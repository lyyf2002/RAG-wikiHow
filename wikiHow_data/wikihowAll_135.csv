Review the course catalog. Familiarize yourself with the institution's academic or professional focus. Take note of classes that appeal to you and areas in which you already have a solid foundation. You might want to refer to some of these aspects in your letter.
Take note of the exact name of the college or program you are applying to. You don’t want to mention “X University Law School” if the name is actually “X University School of Law.”;
, This applies to graduate and professional programs more than it does undergraduate institutions. For example, your program may fall under the umbrella of a larger educational institution. Become familiar with the overall structure to prevent making any errors in your letter when addressing the institution.

, In some cases, colleges and programs will ask for more than one statement. Ensure that you understand all of the instructions and that you know what documents to prepare.


For example, some colleges request both a cover letter and a personal essay. Some graduate and professional programs require multiple, separate written statements, including letters of interest, statements of qualifications, diversity statements, etc.

, Requirements vary depending on the college or university you’re applying to. They may also vary depending on the type of program you are applying to. It’s always a good idea to check directly with the source to establish any requirements for the document.


The terminology used to refer to the interest letter varies widely. However, most colleges and programs will provide specific directions to you about what the document should contain, which you should use as guidelines as you compose your letter.

, You need to have an understanding of why you are applying to this specific college or program and how your interests and skills align with the program’s focus. You may find it helpful to create a list of accomplishments, skills, and achievements.


Reflect on your achievements. Now that you are familiar with your desired program, consider your past achievements that align well with the program. Academic, employment, volunteer and extracurricular activities may all apply. For example, if you are applying for a graduate program in teaching, you might mention your preschool teaching experiences, childhood education courses completed, and any volunteer teaching you did at your local community center.

, You will likely deal with two sets of goals in your letter: your goals while you are in the program and your future career goals. To help you determine your goals, ask yourself some of the following questions:


What contribution or impact will studying at this particular college or program have on my academic development?
What are my career goals?
What steps and training are necessary to attain these goals?
How will I use what I learn in this program to achieve my goals?

, Consider how attending this particular program, and not just any program, will help you achieve your goals.

, Like most other essays, your letter of interest needs to have a central focus. In this case, this focus will be you: your qualifications, your plans for the college or program you’re attending, your future goals, and your fit for the program or school.

, While you shouldn’t give a full career history in your interest letter, having an understanding of what has led you to your choice of field, program, and career will help you explain why you are pursuing admission to the program.Consider what interests you most about your field. Is there a particular problem or challenge you want to tackle?
When did you realize that you wanted to pursue this field?
What challenges have you faced and overcome?

, Your introduction should introduce the program to which you’re applying and your personal goals. It should give your readers some idea of who you are, why you have chosen your field, and why you are applying to this particular program.Draw on the information you gathered in your research. Use the program facts you gathered, as well as your reflections about your accomplishments and goals, to formulate a few clear and concise introductory statements about your interest in the program and its alignment with your goals.
Avoid lengthy discussions of the program’s qualifications, such as “Z Business School is the nation’s top business school and has stellar resources in such-and-such.” The program is aware of their own qualifications; they want to know about yours.
Consider developing a “hook” for your introduction. You could begin with a statement that piques the reader’s interest, such as “I haven’t always known I wanted to do X. In fact, I thought for a long time I wanted to do Y.” Remember: personal anecdotes can be great for introducing who you are and what you value, but don’t let your introduction become your life history.

, In general, plan at least one paragraph each on your personal qualifications and previous experience, your plans for your studies, and your future goals and why the program to which you’re applying will help you achieve them.Describe your qualifications in terms of your academic experiences, your personal traits and skills, and your recent and current activities. Relate any responsibilities or experience to skills that will be useful in your program.
Discuss your area(s) of interest. While you should not be too broad in this discussion -- don’t say you want to study simple “American history,” for example -- they should also not be overly narrow. Instead, they should show that you are familiar with problems and challenges in your field. Elaborate on what you want to do during your program of study.
Describe your future goals in concrete detail where possible. Then, demonstrate how the skills you expect to develop in your program will contribute to your achieving these goals.

, Examples of evidence include experiences, skills, and personal traits. For each claim that you make, you should have at least one piece of evidence that supports it.

, An effective college interest letter leaves the admissions committee with a clear understanding of who you are and what you hope to accomplish. Close your letter by conveying that you are highly motivated, dedicated to excelling in the program, and focused on achieving your academic and/or professional goals.

, It can sometimes be tempting to use overly self-deprecating language, such as “If I have the privilege of admission to this college...”, “I believe I can...”, or “I will try to….”. Such language sounds uncomfortable on paper and may suggest to the admissions committee that you will not be able to handle the rigors of your chosen program.


Writing confidently doesn’t mean you have to be arrogant. Simply using clear, declarative sentences such as “I plan to study such-and-such in order to pursue my career goals of such-and-such” allows you to project confidence without arrogance or condescension.

, This classic advice for writing fiction also holds true for writing letters of interest. Don’t simply write that you’re a hard worker; instead, explain how you balance a part-time job with volunteer activities and your coursework while maintaining a 3.75 GPA.

, The admissions committee will probably read hundreds of applications, and many of them no doubt will offer some variation of phrases like “live life to the fullest.” Avoiding these worn-out expressions and offering your ideas in a genuine, fresh way will help your essay stand out.


This also applies to ideas. You may wish to become an English professor because you love reading, but many other people also love reading. What distinguishes you?

, Move smoothly from paragraph to paragraph by connecting key ideas together and using transitional expressions such as “In addition to” and “Furthermore.”


If you’re having a hard time transitioning between paragraphs, they may not be in a workable order. Figure out the central idea of each paragraph and switch things around as necessary to achieve a logical progression.

, A clearly defined and expressed goal conveys the impression that you are focused and disciplined. Think of this as the “soundbite” introduction to yourself.


For example, a goal statement for a medical school application might read like this: “Attending X Medical School will provide me the training in forensic psychiatry that I need to achieve my career goal of working as a psychological profiler for the FBI.”

, Demonstrate that you’ve done your research and that you are a good fit for the program or school to which you’re applying. Avoid sounding as though you’re sucking up -- don’t, for example, write something like “Professor X’s amazing work in psychopharmacology has changed my life.”


For example, if applying to a graduate degree in history, you could mention a professor whose research interests you and with whom you’d like to work.
For an application to medical school or a graduate program in the sciences, you might mention particular resources or laboratories that will support your research goals.

, Lofty statements such as how a love of reading gives value to human life don’t give the admissions committee anything personal or informative about you, the applicant. In fact, they may weaken your credibility by making your writing seem immature or without sufficient thought.

, Follow the institution's designated format and length, and adhere to the topics they have asked you to address.

, Place the date on the top left. Include the name and address of the program below the date. Find out the exact name of the admissions committee or individual who will receive your letter and start the greeting with ""Dear.""


You may be requested to include a header with your name and email address, along with a page number, on each page of the statement.

, Unless otherwise specified, use 1” margins and a readable 12pt font such as Times New Roman. Single space all text.

, Be sure to sign the letter.

, Your letter is your first chance to make an impression on the admissions committee. Careless proofreading and grammar errors can damage a reader’s opinion of your preparation or seriousness, so read over your letter at least twice.Read your letter aloud. This will help you catch awkward phrases and missing or incorrect words.

, Use good-quality white paper. Resume paper can be a good choice, as it is slightly heavier than printer paper and will help your letter stand out.

, If you are submitting your documents online, save your letter as a PDF. This will ensure that your formatting translates properly across screens and operating systems so that your reader sees the letter exactly as you want them to.

Set your intentions.,
Plan your career goals.,
Connect your life to your academic ambitions.,
Select graduate programs that will meet your academic needs.,
Look through the department course catalogue.",How to Write a Letter of Interest for Grad School1," You should know what you want to achieve by attending graduate school before you start to apply. This statement is part of your application but it is also an opportunity for you to do some serious self-evaluation about your goals and plans.While you may not know your exact dissertation topic at this point, you should have a good idea of where you’d like to go in your studies.Evaluate your goals based on what you would like to study, and think about whether your particular focus will contribute to the field you’re entering.
For example, your intent may be “I want to study early onset Alzheimer’s disease in men.”;
, If you are planning to attend graduate school, you should have some idea of what you want to do after graduate school. Part of your statement should address how you plan to use your graduate degree to further your career aspirations.


It’s okay if your career plans change over the next few years, but it’s useful to have a concrete starting point.
Your career goal may be “I want to obtain a PhD in History in order to become an Assistant Professor of History at a small liberal arts college.”

, This is perhaps the trickiest part of your statement of purpose, but it is important to make your goals personal. Think of this personal connection as why you have chosen graduate school and your chosen career path. This may take some reflection and thought.Too vague: “I want to become a researcher because I love science and working in a lab.”
More specific: “Because I watched my beloved grandfather wither away to a shadow of his former self, I want to devote my life to researching Alzheimer’s disease. No one should have to lose a loved one before he is truly gone.”
Too vague: “I want to be a history professor to inspire students to love history.”
More specific: “Visiting civil war battle fields with my parents helped me realize the importance of understanding and learning from our history. I want to bring that history to life to a generation of students who may not have had the travel opportunities that I had.”

, Though it’s tempting to select schools with the biggest names, the process of selecting a graduate school should be a bit more intensive than that. It’s important to ensure that the graduate institution you choose will fulfill your academic needs and that you and the school are a good fit for each other.Be sure the school offers support for your specific field of specialization. It is helpful to work with someone who is well-respected in your specific area.

For example, if you want to study East Asian history, make sure you apply to departments with several professors in that field. These professors should have publications in East Asian history.


Learn about the graduate school process at each institution. Most programs follow the same general timeline: coursework, comprehensive exams, a formal thesis/dissertation proposal, and finally the thesis/dissertation writing and defense.
Select a school that has a high job placement rate after graduation. The department you’re applying to should keep some data; if their placement rate is high, they will likely advertise it as such.

, If possible, look at the graduate-level course offerings in the university’s course catalogue.This will help you ensure that you will have ample opportunities to take both required and elective courses. You should be able to get a sense of both the scope and depth of available courses and determine whether there are several professors who offer courses in your areas of interest.

Spend some time thinking about the question.,
Don’t reuse essays for other applications.,
Think about what makes you different.,
Don’t just list extracurriculars.,
Tell them something new.,
Tell a story.",How to Write a College Admissions Essay1," Most admissions essays come with a prompt or a question you need to answer. Read the prompt or question carefully and then give yourself some time to think about it. Don’t just go with the first idea that comes to mind when you read it.Consider writing down a list of ideas that come to you after you read the question or prompt. Once you've written your list, look it over and see which topics or ideas jump out at you as something you could write about.;
, If you’re applying to colleges, you’re probably writing a lot of essays. Resist the temptation to just rework an essay from another application to fit the new prompt. It will be obvious to the admissions officer reading your essay if you're answering a different question., When you’re brainstorming ideas for your essay, think about the things that have made you stand out: what are your strengths? Your best personality traits? What types of compliments do you receive the most from your friends and teachers? These are good things to build an essay on.For example, maybe you're a creative thinker, or a great problem-solver. Emphasize this in your essay by writing about a time that those qualities helped you in your day-to-day life.

, When you’re thinking about possible themes for your essay, don’t just list all of the extracurricular activities you took part in during high school. A lot of other applicants will have participated in the same groups and organizations, and it's hard to set yourself apart using the same exact things other people use.It's okay to mention your extracurricular activities occasionally, especially if they help to explain or support some of the main points of your essay. Just don't make them the focus on your essay.

, Your essay also shouldn’t just repeat things that you’ve already listed elsewhere on your application. Tell the admissions officer something they can’t know about you from the other paperwork you’ve filled out.For example, you could tell a story that illustrates how much you enjoy helping take care of others as a way to explain why you want to do a pre-med major.
You could also explain how you overcame a particular fear.

, If you can tell a story in response to the prompt or question, do so. Telling a story will be much more engaging or interesting that just listing a bunch of reasons why you want to go to college. Admissions officers are often looking for students who can engage their audience, and the more interesting your essay is, the more an admissions officer will want to read it.


If you're not sure how to start this type of narrative/personal essay, you can look some examples up online to give you an idea of what you should be shooting for.

Format your statement appropriately.,
Begin with a hook.,
Use all your allotted words.,
Be specific.,
Summarize your academic history.,
Add relevant non-academic information.,
Address any inconsistencies in your academic record.,
Maintain a formal style.,
Edit thoroughly.",How to Write a Letter of Interest for Grad School2," Your statement of purpose is often the first item in your application packet and often serves as a cover letter for the rest of your application materials. Particularly if the school calls the statement of purpose a “letter,” you should format it as such.Formal letter-writing etiquette dictates that you should include the following:

The institution’s mailing address
Greeting addressed to appropriate person (or To Whom it May Concern: if you are not sure)
Today’s date
The body of the letter
A formal closing (such as Sincerely,)
A signature at the bottom of the letter



, As with any essay introduction, you should try to grab the attention of the readers with a hook in the start of your essay.You may offer a vivid personal anecdote that provides the basis of your personal connection to your field of study.


For example, you may say “I stood feeling helpless while my twin brother attempted to begin his presentation to the class. He sputtered a feeble “w- w- w- when…” then fell silent, shame-faced and unable to continue. In the deafening silence that ensued, I vowed that I was going to devote my life to ensuring that other kids would never face similar humiliation. My future career in speech therapy was born in that moment.”

, The length of a personal statement varies, but it is important to use as many words as you are allowed. You should try to fit as much concrete, specific information about yourself into your statement as you can, so use as much space as you are allowed.


If the application instructions do not give a length requirement, limit the statement to 1-2 typed pages.If you may write up to 500 words but only write 200, you risk seeming glib or, worse, lazy.
If you go over the allotted length, it will seem as though you cannot follow directions or that you do not care about specific requirements. Neither is a desirable quality in a graduate student.

, Remember that the committee or individual reading your application is likely reading hundreds of applications. Providing generic material will not make your essay stand out from the others. Making overly general statements may lead the admissions committee to skim or skip over your letter. Instead, aim to make concrete, specific statements about yourself as a person that will motivate the readers to want to meet and work with you.Too vague: “I wish to become a historian.”
More specific: “I want to study the history and culture of indigenous persons of British Columbia to fight against their marginalization in the present day.”

, It is important to communicate your academic achievements. It is not necessary to list every class you have taken or boast about every good grade you made in college. You should communicate that you have been academically successful, particularly in courses related to your field. Also demonstrate that you have the intellect and work ethic required for graduate studies, and that you have experienced academic rigor in the past.Be sure to mention all the degrees you hold, as well as honors such as summa cum laude and any other honors listed on your diploma (e.g. “research honors” or “general honors” if you participated in an undergraduate honor’s program).
Include academic awards such as competitive merit-based academic scholarships and GPA-based awards. Also include special scholarly achievements like undergraduate research awards., Use caution when adding information that is not specifically academic.For example, the admissions committee is unlikely to care if you were president of your sorority. If you must include information that is nonacademic, tie it to your future academic achievement.


In the case of being sorority president, you may want to mention that you maintained a 4.0 GPA while serving as president and overseeing two very large fundraisers. This shows that you can manage both people and time effectively, a necessary skill for a graduate student who must balance research, teaching, and scholarship.

, If there is something in your academic history that may harm your candidacy, you need to address it head-on without sounding like you are making excuses.For example, if you suffer extreme text anxiety and thus have low GRE scores, you should make a statement explaining the scores. Then address how you plan to handle any high-stakes testing (such as comprehensive exams) the program requires.
For example, if you have one undergraduate semester in which you made all Cs, explain why (ie: depression, a death in the family, substance abuse). Then explain how you overcame the adversity and went on to improve from that point forward.

, This is the equivalent of an interview. At an interview, you would want to appear professional, put-together, and polished. Your letter should communicate a professional tone, effective organization, and careful proofreading.Avoid abbreviations, smiley faces, and exuberant punctuation such as explanation points!

, Be completely brutal with yourself while editing. Ask yourself whether each sentence you write is completely necessary and an accurate portrayal of yourself, your history, and your future goals. If it isn’t, delete or edit it.


Do not make any spelling or grammar mistakes. Proofread the letter yourself, have several other people proofread it, and take it to your school’s writing studio. If necessary, hire a professional proofreader.

"
"
Reuse most of your statement.,
Read the instructions for the statement of purpose.,
Read the university’s website.,
Connect your goals to the program.,
Avoid flattery.",How to Write a Letter of Interest for Grad School3," You should be able to leave much of your statement unchanged from application to application. Your history, your goals, and the reason you have chosen your field will not need to change. You should, however, include a short section towards the end explaining how a specific university can help you meet your academic goals. You should customize this statement for each university., It is important to ensure that your statement of purpose follows the guidelines for each application. Tailoring will be worth your time even if you end up rewriting most of your statement. If the admissions committee feels that you haven’t answered the provided questions, they may dismiss your application.


Ensure the length of your statement follows the guidelines (if it doesn’t, add to or reduce appropriately).
Look for any specific requests, such as “describe how your past academic history has prepared you for graduate school.” Then be sure that you have already done that; if you haven’t, go back and add it.
Read and follow any “tips” that the university provides for the statement of purpose. Some may provide a list of “dos” and “don’ts.” If the university provides such a list, ensure that you “do” the things they ask and “don’t” do the things they specify not to do., A university’s website often provides a specific mission statement or strategic plan for the institution. It may be helpful to include these in your section about why you are choosing that university.


Realize that sometimes an individual department may not be wholly engaged with the exact goals of the university administration. Look for evidence in the department’s page or in the work of the professors at the university that implies that they are working towards the same mission as the university.
For example, if the university and department webpages specify a wish to connect learners to the community, specifically address how your research can act as a bridge between the university and the greater community.

, After you have found out about the program, connect your specific academic and career goals to the program.You should be explicit about how the program can help you achieve your goals. You may even mention specific professorsthat you are looking forward to working with because their research interests overlap with your own.


For example, you might say something like “Dr. Smith’s recent work on the influence of early intervention on later speech impediments parallels my own work. My master’s thesis involved studying kindergarten students’ response to early intervention. I would love to become part of her research team to continue exploring this area of study.”

, It is good to sound as though you admire a school and department. However, you should avoid providing empty flattery or telling them information about themselves that they already know.


For example, avoid statements such as: “I want to study at XYZ University because it was recently ranked as the #1 graduate school for my subject area in Newsweek.”

,How to Write a Letter of Interest for Grad School4,
"
Focus on one topic.,
Have a great opener.,
Write in your own voice.,
Write a messy first draft.,
Show, don’t tell.,
Don’t embellish.,
Don’t overdo the humor.,
Use a positive tone.",How to Write a College Admissions Essay2," Once you’ve brainstormed a list of ideas, choose one as the theme of your essay. Focusing on one theme helps keep your essay organized and to the point., The person reading your essay will be reading stacks of them, so getting their attention right away is a great way to get the reader's interest right away. You could start with a quote, or a piece of advice you once received, or even a provocative way of setting up the theme of your essay.


For example, if your essay is on how you’re pursuing biology because you’ve always been interested in how things grow and survive in adverse conditions, you could say something like, “Watching grass grow is the most boring thing most people can think of. I love it.”

, Don’t try to copy someone else’s tone in your writing. You don’t have to sound like anyone else, you just have to sound like you. An easy way to write in your own voice is by avoiding clichés. Don’t use phrases that you’ve heard repeated over and over.For example, avoid saying things like ""dream come true,"" ""long story short,"" or ""outside my comfort zone."" Many, many people will use these phrases over and over and relying on them prevents you from using your own words to describe your experience and feeling., Once you’ve chosen the topic for you essay, write a messy first draft. Don’t worry about making it perfect, just write down everything you can think of that relates to your topic., When you’re writing your essay, provide examples to support the things that you’re saying about yourself. Anyone can say they’re a good leader or they love to learn, but what can set you apart is demonstrating how those things are true in your life.For example, don’t just say “I love being in leadership positions.” Instead, give examples of when you’ve been the leader in groups or taken the lead in situations with other people.

, It’s tempting to embellish or overstate what you’ve done when you’re trying to make yourself stand apart from others. You should not do this in your essay under any circumstances. Don’t say you’ve done something or been somewhere you haven’t., You might be tempted to try to make the admissions officer who is reading your essay laugh. Humor is a great way to make friends or break the ice with someone new, but you should try not to rely on it in your admissions essay. You have no way of knowing what the admissions officer’s sense of humor is like, and you don’t want to run the risk of a joke falling flat or, even worse, offending someone., College can be difficult, and one thing that admissions officers might be looking for is evidence that you've overcome obstacles and been able to work through hard situations. Using a positive tone in your essay helps emphasize that you've been able to get through and learn from difficult situations.


For example, if you're writing about a time when you helped a friend through the loss of a parent, part of your essay will obviously be sad. But you can also strike a positive tone by saying something like ""It was one of the hardest things I've ever done, and it changed my friend in a lot of ways. But I also learned that you can never take a single day for granted and what it means to really be someone's friend.""

"
Give yourself some space.,
Proofread your essay.,
Write succinctly.,
Vary your vocabulary.",How to Write a College Admissions Essay3," After you’ve drafted your essay, walk away from it for a while. This could be for a few hours or a few days. Once you come back to it, it can be easier to see where it needs editing, what you can keep, and what just doesn’t work.For example, write your admissions essay on a Saturday morning and then don't look at it again until Sunday or Monday night. After writing it, you'll have a better idea of what you actually wanted to say. It will be obvious after some time away where you're saying what you mean and what areas need work.

, Once you've drafted your essay, you should reread and edit it more than once. Read your essay first to make sure that it says exactly what you want it to say. Then read it again for spelling and grammar errors.You can also ask someone else to proofread your essay for you. Asking a teacher, parent, or older sibling is probably the best way to go, since they might be more familiar with what's expected from college admissions essays., Make sure that your essay does not exceed the maximum word and page length. This might mean cutting out whole sentences or it might mean using less words to say the same thing. If you have trouble with this, ask a friend to check your writing for unnecessary words.For example, instead of saying ""I want to tell you about the process I went through to decide to become a doctor,"" you could say, ""I want to share how I decided to become a doctor.""

, Don’t use the same words over and over in your essay. Most word processing software has a “thesaurus” function. If you find you’re repeating the same words, use it.Make sure you're replacing your original vocabulary with words that mean the same thing. Different words have different connotations, and not every suggestion from the thesaurus will have the exact meaning you’re looking for.

Whether you made it years ago and are still following through or whether you're only just starting to think about where you want to go in life, dedication is key to science subjects.There are some questions you should consider the answers to before considering a science major:


How long have you wanted to go into this field?
Do you know which field you want to go into?
Why do you want to go into science?
What are your grades in science? (Remember, your grades aren't as important as your dedication, however you may wish to consider vocational courses such as apprenticeships if you're not suited to essays and/or exams);
, This doesn't mean the science your best at in school or which science you think will get you into the profession you want. Chose a science course which excites you and motivates you to learn to your full potential. You can change your specialism after your course, if you decide to go onto further study. If you decide to go straight into a job, it is likely that the company will train you to fulfill your roles and responsibilities and only need your general lab experience or other experiences you've had as a scientist.


Although some sciences may not seem to have applications past furthering human understanding of the universe, almost all sciences have other topics which will start to be mixed in while you complete your course. This could be as close as biology and chemistry mixing (biochemistry is a very important and wide field) or may seem far fetched, such as applied ethics and law being mixed with psychology (something that all psychology research projects keep in mind).

, Look at as many as possible and look at possibilities to study abroad. Consider how you are going to finance your studies, personal life and housing, but also consider which universities/colleges are best for your course. Most universities will have bursary and/or scholarship programs, as well as other financial aid that may be available from the government. Consider every aspect of the university, including societies and social life.

, Most universities will have it clearly available somewhere on their homepage. In some countries, there are application systems, such as UCAS in the UK, which allow you to apply for multiple universities at once, which is helpful for making many applications.

, Getting your application declined due to small mistakes can be extremely disheartening.

, Make sure you have a clear voice, look professional and that you are sure of your answers. There are many sources online for typical questions asked at interviews and researching these and practicing your answers can make you seem calmer and confident, which looks good to the interviewer.

, If you don't know what date you start, try to access your timetable or phone your university and ask.

, Don't take too much but also don't waste your money on new things, such as toothbrushes, when you can take them with you.

, If you're moving from California to New England, it's not a good idea to pack your light clothes and someone from New England would probably not pack a thick coat for California. Research the whether in the area you'll be in, research the fashion if it's important to you. No one really cares what you wear in university but for fashion conscious people, it's worth researching.

, A lot get sold out and you may have to pay more if you leave it too late. The university may help you with this or there are several places online to find out more about finding student accommodation.

, You probably won't know what your lectures are about until you get to university, so just make sure you have the basic knowledge and anything that you think might be important to the course. It's best to start studying as early as possible.

, Depending on your university, there may be several activities going on in the first week of the first term aimed at freshman (or first years). These activities are normally aimed at getting you involved in university life and clubs and societies that the university offer. Try everything that interests you and everything that you might want to be involved in during your university life. Being a science major is stressful and having an outlet can help take away the stress but you also look like an active member of your community if you have lots of experience to put on your CV.

,, It's alright to party sometimes but don't go out every night and party. It's acceptable in the first week of term but will damage your grades to continue.

, Friends are important, even if you only have a few. If you find it hard to make friends with people from you course or in bars, try making friends with people in your clubs or societies. You'll already have common interests, so it may be easier to get along with them.

, Not on campus, not on social media, nowhere. Professors don't appreciate students that are causing drama with the admin or with each other and if there's a fight between students on social media, they are likely to find out about it.

, It will affect your studies just as much as getting drunk every day, as well as affecting your health.

, Use posters and reminders to help you achieve your goals in your hobbies. This will help with stress and with relationships.

, There is nothing better than getting to know a new place and new people.

, To motivate yourself, think about how much one lecture costs and how much money you're wasting by not going. The lectures are important.


If your university allows it, record the lecture. Listen to it again when you're at home and take notes again, you'll remember more information.

, Even if you think that the lecture won't be interesting or won't have important material covered, you may be surprised or you may find something else to link into your studies.

, If you're doodling, they'll call you for a question because they know you're not paying attention. Some lecturers don't care as much or see it as your choice not to listen.

, There is no point going into a lecture that you're not going to listen to. You're wasting time that you could be doing work.

, The lectures are only the backbone of your study. Make sure that you're studying every day, except for relaxation days, and make sure that you have a range of sources that guide your studies.

, There are several different ways to study and finding the one that is right for you in important to being an undergraduate, whether in science or otherwise. Science may be tricky to learn, as many science courses have lab sessions but most of the learning is from textbooks and scholarly articles that you'll read over your course. Transferring this information into an easier-to-manage format makes your study time much more effective

, They'll be important no matter which field of science you're in. There are sites such as Google Scholar which can help find articles but your library should also have a system for searching articles the school owns or have permission to access. Do the library's tutorial for finding articles.

, You'll burn yourself out if you work too many hours at a time, make sure to give yourself sufficient breaks between studying. Make sure you're hydrated and well fed during the break and that you're not too tired to continue.

, That way,you're less likely to be distracted by these sites, just resist turning the application off.

, Don't let it stress you out too much, use it as an opportunity to learn the correct formatting.

, Everything that you cite in papers must be fully referenced at the end of your work. If a reference helped but wasn't cited in the text, reference it under further reading.

, The deadlines will just keep getting closer and you'll realise you have many assignments to do but such short time to do them in. It's better to start and finish them early and make corrections before the deadline.

, Scientific articles don't ramble and neither should you. Remember that you shouldn't be trying to fill the word count with nonsense. Ask the lecturer the terms of the word count (whether it's maximum or if points are deducted for being 10% or more out) and if you need to make it up to the count, then look into relevant articles that may supply more information.

, Get several references from several different places. Some should be books from the library, some should be from online, some should be scholarly. Mix it up but remember that online articles, although important, should be briefly evaluated (less than 100 words) as a source.

, All science undergraduate courses have dissertations or extended research projects at the end of the course. Search for advisors and topics early to avoid being disappointed about the range of subjects that you're allowed to pick from.

, You might not need that long to complete your project but it's better to be happy with the topic and motivated to do your best than it is to dread every second.

, Don't stress too much if it's not perfect on the application form.

, It's likely that you'll get your first choice, so concentrate on that but don't ignore the other topics.

,, Have days to sit down with just your dissertation and work through it

, It's likely that you'll get your first choice, so concentrate on that but don't ignore the other topics.

, They should help you through the stressful situation or give you some allowance to help make your workload lighter.

,, Many science students stay in education. The same steps as are in parts 1, 2 and 3 can be used for the application into further study.

, There are more questions to consider with postgraduate study:


What type of course do you want?
Where do you want to specialise?
Do you want to dedicate your life to this subject?
Do you want to work after your postgraduate study?

, You can study while feeling like you're not. If you find a topic that interests you or you want to support, writing articles can help put you into the mood to write your assignments.

, If you've procrastinated for too long, think about how much better you'll feel if the work is done and you still have time to do other things.

, When you've read the paragraph, eat the bear.

Start with a great opening line.,
Personalize your essay.,
Don't go over the top.,
Choose the right topic.,
Don't repeat yourself.,
Check for grammar and style.,
Go above and beyond.",How to Spice up a College Application1," The first line of your college essay can be the hardest to write, but it's also arguably the most important. Instead of starting with a generic and boring sentence like ""I want to attend this college because..."", write something more imaginative. Use colorful language and leave the reader so intrigued that he will want to keep reading.A great first line might be something like, ""I have always felt that the world was full of questions and riddles, and that it was my job to answer them to the best of my ability."" or, ""I think my parents knew that I was destined to become a scientist when I began experimenting with dangerous chemicals at the age of five."" Whatever you decide on, make sure you are telling your own story.
Make sure your opening line is related to the rest of your essay. You want your reader to remain engaged throughout the essay.
A little bit of humor can go a long way, if that's your personality.
Don't feel like you need to write your first sentence before the rest of the essay. It might be best to save it for last so that you will know how to properly tie it in to your main point.;
, It might be tempting to write one generic essay and then fill in a few blanks so that it works for every college you want to apply to, but this is not the way to write a great essay! Take the time to write a unique response to each individual question.It helps to show that you have thoroughly researched the college and have clear reasons for wanting to attend that specific school. Make a few references to how the school fits your educational needs.Consider discussing the specific courses you hope to take or professors you hope to work with. This will show that you are really invested in the program and have a good understanding of how it will help you reach your personal goals.

, You should always try to make your writing sound intelligent and individual, but don't take it too far by using words you don't know just because they sound fancy. You run the risk using them incorrectly and not making any sense., If you have the opportunity to choose the topic that you are writing about, choose with care. You should write about something personal and something that you care about because this will help you convey your unique voice and skills. If you have an assigned topic, but you aren't inspired by it, come up with an angle that allows you to get more personal. As long as it's clear to the administrators how your essay relates to the original question, you can take in any direction you like. If you need an idea for a personal topic, consider one of the following:Write about a moment that changed your life
Write about a time when you had to overcome a major obstacle
Write about how your passions and interests developed from an early age
Write about a person who had a significant impact on your lifeWrite about why you want to major in a particular field, College essays typically have pretty strict word limits, and you don't want to waste those words stating facts that are already included in your general application. Take the opportunity to highlight your personal attributes that the admissions officer wouldn't otherwise know about., It's crucial that your college essay be well-written, which means you must double and triple check for incomplete sentences, run-on sentences, typos, misused words, and confusing syntax.When in doubt, have someone you trust read your essay over. A second pair of eyes may catch something that you missed.

, If there are optional essay questions, always answer them. It will give you an extra opportunity to show your unique personality.You may also consider including a resume with your application if you feel that your essay and general application do not cover all of your accomplishments.In some instances, you may wish to include copies of your academic work. This is especially helpful if you mention a specific project in your essays and you feel it needs elaboration.On many applications, you may be given a small space to provide additional information. Use this opportunity to explain any negative aspects of your application, like a bad grade or test score. Focus on how you learned from your mistakes and/or overcame a major obstacle in your life. If you don't have anything negative to explain, use the opportunity to provide additional insight into your personal and academic preferences. If, for example, you want to be an English major, you could write a brief paragraph about your favorite author and how he or she has inspired you.
As enthusiastic as you may be, don't forget to follow the rules. If there is a word limit, for example, you need to stick to it. Instead of going over the limit in order to say everything you want to, go back and carefully edit out all of the unimportant words. You will end up with a much more concise and meaningful essay.

Consider your options.,
Choose a school and program.,
If you haven’t settled on a career path, visit a career center or meet with a guidance counselor to learn about jobs that would fit your natural abilities.,
Decide whether you are the technical type.,
Think carefully if you enjoy working with figures, numbers, logistics etc.,
Decide if you are the academic type.,
Determine whether you enjoy working with people or prefer working alone.,
Get to know yourself and your needs.,
Do not be persuaded by others.,
Adapt to the uncertainty of work.",How to Select the Right College Degree Program," Higher education has never been more accessible; students can travel away to attend four-year universities or enroll in online classes without even leaving home. Colleges, universities and vocational schools are amazing places where students hone their skills, meet new people and explore career opportunities.;
, Choosing a school and education program is easier for people who have specific career goals. Some professions require degrees from four-year universities, while other lines of work require two-year degrees or vocational certificates. Also, many colleges and universities are stronger in some educational departments and weaker in others. It’s easier to match a school or educational program to your professional goals if you know what you want to do for a living.

, Do everything you can to narrow your professional goals to a specific line of work. However, don’t panic if you’re still undecided. Students can begin vocational school and certification courses at any time, and the first couple of years at colleges and universities offer plenty of chances for students to shape their long-term goals. Many college students don’t choose their majors until their sophomore years.

, These types enjoy working with their hands or being creative. Fields in this career path includes subjects like technology, engineering, beauty therapy, massage therapy, physiotherapy etc. There is a broad range of careers to choose from in all the Medical, Engineering, Faculty of Arts, School of science etc.

, You may perhaps be happy in choosing a career field involving Economics, finance, Auditing, Computer Technology etc.

, Academic types like working in jobs that are intellectually stimulating as it involves many thought processes and common sense. These include becoming a Scientist, Actuarial Science, Medical Science, Biochemistry,Microbiology etc.

, Sometimes it may not be possible to work entirely on your own. Consider this important factor when choosing a career. Individuals who prefer autonomy and those who dislike having a boss or anyone to account to, should consider job opportunities that makes an allowance for self employment. This simply means you work for yourself.

, If it is money and success you want then consider career choices that pay well, has opportunities for growth as well as giving you personal fulfillment.

, Finding joy and contentment with work is something you will have to choose for yourself. The idea is not to cherish and fulfill someone else's dream or mission. This happens often when parents lacked the opportunity to become something and continue this trend by forcing their children to complete their own unfinished dreams. Example "" I could not afford fees to become a doctor, so my son, you will become one"".

, Many jobs are fast becoming redundant so one has to consider more than one career choice in order to meet the ever changing world of work. Safe jobs are becoming rare, so a second career option would be a good idea. One that pays the bills, and a second backup career, just in case the first does not meet your requirements.

Take the right classes.,
Have experience in your field.,
Show your passion with activities.,
Be a leader.,
Think carefully about who you ask for recommendations.,
Accept an interview.",How to Spice up a College Application2," Depending on your school, you may have a variety of challenging classes available to you, from honors classes to AP and IB classes. Try to take the most challenging classes you can. This will make you look ambitious and studious, and it will also help you develop the skills you will need to succeed in college level classes.Advanced classes are a great way to show your passions. Even if you don't take a ton of AP classes, consider taking one in the subject that is most closely related to your intended major.
Take advantage of elective classes too. These will give you the opportunity to explore your passions, and it will show admissions officers that you are curious and interested in learning new things.

, If you already know what you want to study in college, you should try to demonstrate that you have already begun pursuing your goals, even before college. Even the smallest amount of experience can set you apart from your peers.A part-time job or internship that's related to your field is a great way to show that you're committed to your career goals.
Even if you can't get paid, you can till pursue your passions and explore your interests through volunteer work. This will make you come across as both driven and generous in your college application.
You can also consider participating in a summer program at a local college during summer vacation. This will not only look good on your application, but it will also give you a taste of what college courses will be like.

, It is important to show that you excel both in and out of the classroom, so find a few activities and hobbies that you are passionate about and pursue them to the fullest. Your extracurricular activities will also give the admissions officers a better impression of who you are as a person than your transcript will.


Try to have a good balance of activities. Athletics will show that you are a team player, while artistic pursuits will show that you are inventive. Colleges are looking for well-rounded applicants.It is important to convey that you are intelligent, inquisitive, and inventive in your college application, so think of any unique interests or hobbies you have. Keep in mind that they don't all have to be school clubs or other organized activities. If, for example, you maintain a large aquarium at your home or you have been trying to teach yourself a foreign language, mention how your curiosity led you to pursue these hobbies.Whenever possible, try to present tangible evidence of your accomplishments, whether it is an award, a publication, or a portfolio of your work.Don't forget volunteer work! Colleges love to see that you are spending your free time helping to make your community a better place. Look for opportunities to help out a local soup kitchen, build houses with Habitat for Humanity, or mentor children in need.

, Show strong leadership skills by taking on roles that require a high level of responsibility. You can also try initiating something, whether it's a new club, a volunteer group, or even a blog.While participating in activities is great, taking the initiative to start something new is even better, especially if what you do is helping your local community. If, for example, you are passionate about sports, consider starting a club at your high school to mentor younger athletes. This will look much more impressive on a college application than simply being on a sports team.
Even if you don't start something from the ground up, you can highlight ways in which you contributed significantly to existing organizations. If, for example, you volunteer at an animal shelter, you could mention the initiatives you took to educate other young people about the problem of homeless animals in your community.

, It may be tempting to request recommendations from the teachers who have given you the highest grades, but this may not always be the best choice. Think about how well each teacher knows you and what unique characteristics they would be able to point out. Teachers who know you on a more personal level will be able to write much more sincere recommendation letters, which will really stand out from all of the generic ones colleges receive.


Try to get recommendations from teachers who can speak to who you are as a person and why you will excel in college. The more specific examples they can offer, the better.If you struggled in one particular class, but were able to motivate yourself and pull through with a decent grade despite the difficulties, that teacher might be able to write an excellent letter of recommendation that highlights your resiliency.You may also want to get a recommendation letter from someone who is not your teacher, like a boss, if this person can talk about characteristics that your teachers may not be privy to. This can be especially helpful if your boss can talk about traits you have that would help you excel in your future career, like a talent for working with children if you want to pursue a teaching degree., If a personal interview is an option at one of the schools you are applying to, go for it! Make sure you ask a lot of questions about the school and express enthusiasm for the school and a passion for your studies. The interview is also a great opportunity to tell your unique story.You should approach a college interview the same way you would approach a job interview. Be sure to dress appropriately, be on time, turn off your phone, bring copies of all relevant documents, take notes, and carefully elaborate on all your answers.

Because Yale is an Ivy League school, admissions officers look for students who have proven they can survive a heavy course load. Achieving high grades in easy courses will likely not be enough to get you into Yale, so load up on advanced placement and college prep courses to prove you stand out among your peers.If your high school offers unusual or unique courses not found in most high schools, take them. For example, if your high school offers Cantonese in addition to Spanish, French and German, choose Cantonese. This will help you stand out.
Don’t take “easy” or “blow off” electives. Getting a 4.0 in easy elective classes will not help you gain admission to Yale. So ditch the dodgeball class and take something a little more challenging.;
, The first thing Yale will look at is your academic performance throughout your high school tenure. Maintaining a consistently high grade point average throughout high school is a critical step in applying for Yale.As an elite Ivy League school, Yale will examine your grade history from all four years of high school whereas less exclusive schools tend to weigh your performance in your junior and senior year more heavily.However, you should make sure that your senior course load reflects a rigorous program of study. Do not indulge in ""senioritis."", There are a number of programs and courses designed to help you prepare for the SAT and ACT. These courses can help you devise methods for studying and taking the exams that will help you achieve the highest score you possibly can.These courses or programs generally provide techniques designed to help you maximize your score on the ACT or SAT, like how to increase the speed with which you work through individual questions or how to eliminate clearly wrong choices when you don’t know the answer.
Community centers and public schools sometimes offer these classes for free or at a reduced rate, so check in your area to see what options are available to you.
SAT Subject Tests are recommended but not required for admissions to Yale. However, these tests are a great way to showcase your knowledge in a specific area and can help distinguish you from the rest of the pack., Be sure to pay close attention to the dates when you can take the ACT or SAT in your area and compare those dates to Yale's yearly application deadlines. This will help you plan out a schedule that maximizes your chances of scoring highly on a standardized test before you have to apply to Yale.


The application deadline for Single-Choice Early Action applications -- where you agree to accept an offer of admission if it is made -- is November 1. The regular application deadline is January 1. If you are applying for regular admission, Yale recommends you take the SAT or ACT no later than December., If you are worried about your score, consider taking the SAT or ACT more than once. Your score on these exams is a major component of your application package.However, Yale does suggest that you not retake the test if your score is already in the ballpark, since your time will be better spent strengthening other elements of your application.Yale does not have standardized test score cutoffs. However, the most recently enrolled freshman class had SAT scores ranging between 2130-2400 and ACT scores ranging between 32-36.Yale does not participate in “Score Choice” reporting on the SAT and ACT general exams. This means that you must submit all of your SAT and ACT general exams scores to Yale.On the SAT subject test, Yale does allow “Score Choice” reporting, meaning you can choose which scores you want to submit to the university on the SAT subjects test.While you can take these tests multiple times, there is little evidence to support the idea that your score will rise drastically after the second or third time you take the exams. Save yourself the time, money and headache by focusing on exam preparation in the beginning rather than trying to maximize the number of times you take the test., The Ivy League schools do not give out athletic scholarships to students. Still, engaging in athletics will help you to show Yale that you are more than just a bookworm. Playing high school sports while maintaining high grades demonstrates that you are a well-rounded individual who can balance multiple responsibilities.Also, if you excel in a sport in which Yale participates and your high school grades are above average, it is possible that Yale will “bend” some of the more stringent academic standards for admission to get desirable student-athletes to attend the school.
While Yale is not known for its athletics program, the university has had some success in men's diving and swimming, golf, hockey and women's fencing.

, Getting involved in student government in your high school is a great way to show Yale that you are engaged in your academic environment and are ready to take on leadership roles within that environment. So run for class president, vice-president or treasurer., While joining clubs and group activities in school are great extracurricular activities on a college application, nothing is more impressive than a young student taking the initiative to found a group or spearhead a student project. Identify areas where your school is lacking extracurricular activities and lobby your school’s administration to allow you to begin a new group.When taking this step, be sure you identify other students that will participate and a faculty member who can oversee the group. This will make “pitching” the idea to your school’s administration much easier., Get involved in community service, charity, and public outreach programs. Yale is looking for intelligent individuals who will use their intelligence and ambition to improve their community and those around them. Helping to improve your community during high school will demonstrate that you are exactly the type of outward-thinking person Yale wants at their school., Working a part-time job during your high school tenure will demonstrate your work ethic and personal drive to the admissions board at Yale. Working at a local restaurant, carwash or retail store will prove that you can juggle multiple responsibilities while excelling in many areas.Just make sure your job does not impact your grades and does not cut into much needed study time. Also, don’t get fired, as being terminated from a position of employment will not improve your chances of admission.

, Prior to applying, carefully and closely read over Yale’s admissions guidelines and application requirements. You will want to know what you need before you begin to put the application together., Be sure that you mention anyone in your family who has attended Yale in the past. It is well known that Yale gives preference to “legacy” students; in the past, they have admitted that about 20-25% of legacy applicants are admitted, compared to the around 6-7% of overall applicants.Also, inform the school if you are a racial, ethnic, religious minority or a first generation college student somewhere in your application package. Yale has diversity quotas that they try to achieve and may give preference to those who have broken the mold to become the first person in their family to attend a four year university., Test scores, high school grade point averages and letters of recommendation will reflect what others think of you and your performance to the Yale admissions office. The application essay is your chance to represent yourself to the university. Personal essays are a major component of Yale’s admissions package and are often the element of an individual’s application that will set them apart.A strong application essay should address the following questions:


Who are you?What experiences have shaped your life and your outlook to date?What have you achieved during your time in high school?What do you hope to achieve in the future?How can attending Yale help you achieve future goals?What can you bring to Yale to enhance, improve or benefit the student community?Remember, all strong essays contain a clear and creative introduction that will “hook” the reader, a well-organized body that provides concrete examples as reinforcement for the claims in your introduction, and a poignant and meaningful conclusion that ties the rest of your essay together concisely.Always proofread your essay, looking for grammatical, syntactical, and typographical errors. Also, have someone else, such as a parent or respected teacher, read your essay and provide feedback before submitting. A fresh pair of eyes can do wonders for improving the clarity of your writing.The questions that are to be addressed in Yale’s two application essays change from year to year, so be sure to read and consider the questions they are asking you carefully before attempting to draft your application essays. You can’t fit your life story into brief essays and Yale knows this, so don’t try to squeeze everything into your essays. Stay focused on a particular theme and treat that theme comprehensively., The Common Application Essay must be between 250-650 words, and the Yale Writing Supplement essay must be 500 words or less.You will not be able to submit your application if your essays exceed the word count.

, You can fill out both online by visiting the Common Application website. Pay the current application fee with a credit card or electronic check.


You can also download and mail these forms to Yale, but an overwhelming majority of applicants submit them online. The mailing address for Yale is: Office of Undergraduate Admissions, Yale University, PO Box 208235, New Haven, Connecticut, 06520-8234
Include a check or money order payable to Yale University.

, Ask two of your high school teachers to write a personalized letter of recommendation for you. Teachers can submit the letters online using a link you provide them from the Common Application website.Yale strongly recommends that you ask your 11th and 12th grade teachers for recommendations, since those teachers have taught you most recently and in more rigorous courses.You should have a resume, C.V., or list of accomplishments prepared for your teachers so that they can make specific references to things you've done or accomplished in the letter of recommendation.
Yale is looking for recommendations that highlight your performance in class, as well as your energy, motivation, relationship with your classmates, intellectual curiosity and impact on your classroom environment.These recommendations are confidential and you, as the student, should not have access to them. As such, be sure to select two teachers who know you well, think highly of your performance in the classroom and can outline your particular achievements. If you can, it is a good idea to ask for recommendations from teachers of different subjects.If you have significant accomplishments in another field, such as music or research, you can solicit an additional letter of recommendation from a person who is very familiar with your accomplishments and can speak about them in detail. However, Yale recommends that you only do this if it will substantially add to your application. It should be labeled as a ""Supplementary"" letter of recommendation., Ask your high school guidance counselor to submit a letter of recommendation on your behalf and your official high school transcript. The recommendation should help Yale understand the difficulty of your classes in high school, as well as general information about your background, including any leadership roles you have assumed during your years in high school., Submit these scores through the Common Application website. Visit the Standardized Testing page on the Yale website to determine if the program you are applying for requires any other tests.You can also submit your scores by indicating that you want your scores to be sent to Yale. Do this by entering Yale’s school code in the correct section of the ACT or SAT exam. For the ACT, Yale’s school code is “0618”. For the SAT, Yale’s code is “3987”.Looking at Yale’s standardized testing website can be useful before you take these exams as well. The website outlines how Yale views your performance on these tests and identifies the general criteria for performance on these tests., Ask your high school guidance counselor to submit a mid-year report though the Common Application website as soon as your first semester senior grades are available. Yale wants to ensure that applicants are maintain a high level of academic success throughout their senior year., Wait up to 3 weeks after you submitted your application for an email from Yale. This email will have instructions for setting up your “Eli” account. The email will be sent to the address you included on your application. You can use your Eli account to track which documents Yale has received and will allow you to check on the status of your application.If you applied for Single-Choice Early Action admission, you will receive notification in mid-December. If you have applied for regular admission, you will be notified by April 1.You may be offered an admissions interview. If you are offered one, you should accept. However, not being offered an interview does not mean you will not be admitted."

, They can put in a good word for you.

, They can give you a good feel of their work and department, plus they can also put in a good word.

, It's better to focus on one or two activities you love and give 100% effort to than to make a half-hearted effort on five.

, Get involved in activities and projects because you love them, not because ""everyone else is"". For example, if you're passionate about learning Hindi, go online to learn it, study it! In your application, be sure to highlight these efforts.

, Find a cause that you are passionate about, and commit a significant amount of time to working on it. Colleges want to admit good citizens as well as good students, and showing that you've spent four years tutoring in a low-income neighborhood or organizing donation drives for an environmental group is good proof of this.

, Interesting jobs or internships are definitely a plus, but a summer of hard work for your uncle's construction business is more impressive to admissions than a contrived trip to France for the vague purpose of ""cultural experience"".

, While it may be tempting to dash off an essay about how you learned leadership skills from being the captain of the football team, consider how many other football captains probably wrote a similar essay.


Make sure your essay is in your ""voice"".
Start writing your essay early to allow for revision.

, While you may think you sound smart by pontificating on United States foreign policy in Iran, you'll sound the opposite. However, if you write about how your parents fled Iran because of U.S. policy decisions, and how this effects your choice to go into immigration law, write away!

, Be enthusiastic, make eye contact, and ask lots of questions.


Dress nicely for your interview-- it shows you care.

, A college is more interested in someone who says they want to be an immunologist with a focus on viruses than someone who ""might want to be a doctor"" or ""doesn't know."".


Your plan should make sense with your past experiences and activities. Admissions is more likely to believe someone who says they know they want to be a doctor after volunteering at an urban clinic than someone who randomly thinks they want to be a doctor but has only held banking internships and doesn't like blood.

, Be sure to challenge yourself academically. Take the most challenging classes you can, even if you could get an ""easy A"" in a less difficult class.

Dress Nicely.,
Introduce yourself.,
Get settled.,
Listen carefully.,
Stay on topic.,
Remain calm.,
Speak with confidence.,
Ask questions.,
Thank the staff.",How to Have a Successful Prep School Interview," This will show that you care about getting into the school and are professional. Always dress at least semi-formally. Jeans, no matter what top they are paired with, are always a no. Conservatively and classy is always the best way to go.;
, Adults love polite teenagers. You should greet the staff and your tour guide (most likely a student), with respect. ""Yo! Waddup dawg?"" is probably not the best choice of words. A simple ""Hello!"", followed by a handshake and a smile, should do the trick.

, You will probably be with your Admissions Counselor for anywhere between 20 minutes to an hour, so you want to be comfortable. Your Admissions Counselor may think you are disinterested if you constantly fidget. You should also turn off any electronic devices at this time, if you have not done so already. Can you imagine how embarrassed you would be if your cell phone began to screech the tune ""American Idiot"" as you explained your impressive track record?

, Most of the questions asked during an interview are simple questions about the different aspects of your life, especially your school life and your social life; they are not meant to be tricks. As a result, extensive preparation (and excessive stress) is not necessary. Your Admissions Counselor knows his job well; he knows where he wants to take the interview. As long as you are attentive, you should be fine.

, You want to be as focused as possible during your entire visit, but especially during your interview. Although one-word answers are not appropriate, you should also avoid elaborate speeches. You should get to the point as soon as possible and answer all questions clearly.

, Your Admissions Counselor wants to get to know you, so he can decide whether or not you are a good match for the school. Nervousness is normal, hysteria is not. The last thing a highly competitive prep school needs is an emotionally unstable student who is unable to handle stress. An Admissions Counselor is not a type of psychologist. Your interview should not double as a mental therapy session.

, There are enough mediocre people out there. What you need to do is convince your Admissions Counselor that you are the best, and that you deserve the best. You need to sell yourself make them think that you will be a wonderful addition to their school. Tell them all of your achievements but do not brag be humble you do not want to seem arrogant. You want to appear as a well-rounded individual. A variety of extracurricular activities are a real plus. Since each school has a different focus, however, highlight those attributes which you believe are most valuable. For example, if a particular school has a strong science department, emphasize your interest in environmental studies. Tell them about the things that make you different, you want to be unique.

, Not only is the ability to ask good questions a sign of intelligence, but they also make you seem interested. Schools in general, especially high schools, are full of students who rather be at home in front of the television. Prep schools want motivated students who will do well in a competitive environment. Be interesting, do not be just another applicant that walks through the door. Your interviewer is the only one reviewing your application that has actually met you, you need them to fight for you.

, Once again, adults love polite teenagers. Remember to tell your Admissions Counselor how much you enjoyed your visit. Even if you don't feel as if things went too well, you want to leave on a good note. Write your interviewer a thank you note. They will give you their card, send them a note thanking them for their time. MAIL IT! Even though you have their email it looks like you spend more time if you mail it to them. Send it to the school with their name on it it will go into their mailbox.

Try again the following year.",How to Plan for Graduate School," Graduate school is a major commitment of time, energy, and money. It is good to spend some time thinking about the reasons why you want to attend graduate school to make sure that you are prepared for it. Some questions you might want to ask yourself include:Do I need graduate school to get the job or career that I want?
Is it best to work for a few years in my field before returning to graduate school? Or should I go straight out of undergrad?
How will I pay for graduate school? Am I applying to programs that offer funding and stipends?
Will I go full-time or part-time? Can I balance graduate school with my work and social life?
Do I love what I study?;
, Your undergraduate transcript will be essential when applying for graduate school. If you are still currently enrolled in a baccalaureate program, you should start taking courses that will prepare you for the graduate program that you want to apply to. Graduate Admissions Committees want to see applicants who have strong GPAs and who have taken rigorous courses.


If possible, get involved in research during your undergraduate program. Submit a paper to an undergraduate conference or journal. Ask your professors if you can become a lab or research assistant.Internships, volunteering, and work experience also look good on an application.
You will need to do well throughout your undergraduate program to get into a graduate program. Many graduate programs require at least a 3.0 GPA and strong GRE scores for admission and financial aid. If you have a low GPA, demonstrate your qualifications through work, leadership, or volunteering experience., There are many different graduate programs that offer different specialties and opportunities. You should start researching the best programs in your subject area. Some things you might want to look at:


What types of learning experiences do they offer? Will you get hands-on experience in your field?
What are their facilities (laboratories, libraries, studios, etc.) like? Are they appropriate for your field?
What type of research grants do faculty and graduate students earn? Are there opportunities for graduate students to pursue their own research?
Do they offer research assistantships? Will you be able to work as a teaching assistant?
What are the employment rates of graduates?
Who are the faculty? What are they known for?
How much does it cost per year? Do they offer funding or financial assistance to students?, Your professors are deeply rooted in the field. Identify faculty at your undergraduate university who specialize in the type of work you want to do. Ask them to recommend programs and potential research advisors. They may even be able to introduce you to faculty at that university., Consult the program and department websites. Read about the faculty and the type of research they do. Write to faculty whose research interests are a good match with yours. Write them an email that states who you are, why you’re interested in their program, and why you’re interested in their work. Ask them to send you some information about their program.


Begin the email with Dear Dr. Smith, or Dear Professor Jones. Always start with a formal opening. Do not make the mistake of addressing female professors as Mrs. Smith or Ms. Jones, and never use first names unless and until you are invited to do so.
For example, you can write, “Dear Dr. Taylor, my name is Roberta Smith. I am a current junior at State University majoring in marine biology. I am writing you to inquire about your graduate program in marine biology. I am very interested in your program because it offers students valuable experience both in the lab and at sea. Your work on manatee behavior is also very interesting to me. I was wondering if you could give me any advice about the graduate program and whether or not I would be a good candidate. Thank you. Best regards, Roberta Smith.”

, Some universities hold open house events or other opportunities to meet the faculty and tour the facilities. If you can, visit the campus to get a sense of what life is like there. You might even want to schedule a meeting with a faculty member to introduce yourself and ask questions about the program.To find out about prospective student weekends, you can look on the graduate school’s calendar.
You may also email the graduate school’s admissions department or your specific department’s director of graduate studies.

, It is good to apply to several schools to increase your chances of being accepted. While you may apply to as many schools as you’d like, you should select at least four programs to apply to. Five or six schools is average.You may want to have one aspirational school that you might think is slightly out of reach as well as one safety school that you absolutely qualify for.


Remember that the more schools you apply to, the more statements that you have to write and the more you have to pay in application fees. While it may be tempting to apply to ten or fifteen schools, it may be beneficial to focus on a few schools and write a strong, compelling application for each.

, Once you’ve found a few potential universities to apply to, you will want to organize all of the information you will need to provide in the coming months. Each university may have different application deadlines, exam requirements, and statements that they require so read their individual websites carefully. Create a table that organizes all of the following information for each graduate program:


How much they cost
How much they give in assistance
What exams they require
What GPA or degree class they require
How many references you need
What statements you need (personal statement, statement of interest, research statement, etc.)
What documents they require (transcript, portfolio, CV, etc.)
How long your writing sample should be
When the application is due

, Standardized testing is often required by graduate schools for admissions. While you may encounter a program that does not require such testing, you most likely will have to take a test. Read the university’s graduate admissions page to find out what tests you need to take. You might have to take multiple exams. Some common exams include:


Graduate Record Exam (GRE) GRE Subject TestLaw School Admission Test (LSAT)Medical College Admission Test (MCAT)Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT)If you are a student from a non-English speaking country applying to a university in an English-speaking country, you may have to take an English language exam to prove your proficiency in the language., Some exams, such as the GRE, can be taken at any time. Others have only a handful of dates a year to take the exam. The spring before you have to submit the application, you should find out when the exams are and how long before the exam you need to register for your place.


Many people take their graduate exams at least twice. Take your first exam early in the academic year so that you can try to improve your scores before the application is due.It can take a few weeks for your scores to be reported to universities. Many universities will let you know the latest date you can take exams so that your scores reach the university in time.

, Many companies offer courses to help tutor you in graduate exams. These courses will coach you through the procedure of the exam, the material on the exam, and tips on how to pass. While these courses can be expensive, they are a good way to study for the exam. There are both online and classroom classes offered.Some reputable test course companies include:


Princeton Review
Kaplan
Barron’s
Magoosh

, A cheaper alternative to courses is to self-study with practice questions and exams. You can buy test prep books at the bookstore, or you can use online tools to help you study. Time yourself taking practice exams. Familiarize yourself with the types of questions being asked, and pay attention to what type of material they want you to know. Some things you may have to study include:


Vocabulary
Essay writing
Equations
Information relevant to your field of study

, On the day of the exam, you may be asked to come early. Be sure to bring your photo ID as well as any materials you will need to take the test, such as pencils or an approved calculator. Get plenty of rest the night before, and eat a good breakfast. Some exams are several hours long with breaks so be prepared.


Read up on the exam before you take it. Find out if it is a written exam or if it is taken on a computer. Learn whether you will be doing multiple choice questions, essays, or written equations before you take it.
Each exam will require you to bring different forms of ID and supplies with you. In general, however, you will not be permitted to bring personal items such as phones, wallets, or purses into the testing room with you.

, If you are not currently in a baccalaureate program or if it has been many years since you have been an undergraduate, you may demonstrate that your work experience makes you qualified for the program. While you may still be required to submit transcripts, prepare a thorough CV that demonstrates your experience.


In your personal statement or statement of interest, you can explain how your work experience makes you uniquely qualified for the program.
Many universities will ask for your job history. This is a good place to demonstrate how your experience outside of university has made you a competitive applicant.

, Typically, you will need at least three references, although this number can vary by university. Never list a faculty member as a reference until s/he gives you permission to do so. Always ask first. Give the faculty member at least two months of advance notice. Provide a copy of your CV and statement of research interests to help the writer craft the letter appropriately.


To ask someone to write you a letter of recommendation, you can say, “I am applying to graduate school this fall. I was wondering if you would be willing to write me a letter of recommendation. I really value your good word.” If they agree, don’t forget to thank them.
If it has been a few years since you graduated your baccalaureate program, you may want to ask recent employers or coworkers to write references for you. Choose people who can testify to your hard work and the skills needed for the graduate program., Graduate programs will often require not just a personal statement but also statements about your research interests, interest in the graduate school, and plans for the future. The length and requirements vary from university to university. While it may be tempting to write one statement and send it to all schools, it is best to tailor your personal statement to each school that you are attending. State why you are interested in each university and how it will help you achieve your goals.A personal statement is a short essay about your skills, experience, and unique characteristics that make you a strong applicant.A statement of research interests explores what you want to research and why. You may also state how you are qualified to begin this research.A statement of interest details why you are interested in that particular university. Here you might explain which faculty members you want to work with, classes you want to take, or opportunities that will be available to you.
Many universities have writing centers where you can have a consultant read over your statements. They can not only proofread the statement but also give you suggestions as to things that you should include.

, It can take a few weeks for your current or former university to process requests for transcripts, and it can take a few more weeks after that for the transcript to reach the other school. Make sure that you submit your transcripts as early as possible so that they reach the schools you are applying to.


If you are applying in the fall, you should request your transcripts around October., Graduate school applications will include many pages asking for details. They may ask you for personal information, job history, course history, a CV, writing sample, portfolio, and other personal details. Each application can take several hours, in addition to writing the statements and ordering the transcripts. Do not procrastinate, or leave it until the night before the deadline.


Most applications charge a fee. You may be eligible to waive the fee if you are unable to pay. Contact the graduate school, and ask them about fee waivers.
Read the application policies carefully. If the university wants all of your files in a PDF, make sure that you convert your files to PDF before you submit.
Before you submit your application, double-check it to make sure that you filled everything out correctly and attached the proper documents.

, Universities typically send out acceptances in the spring. Avoid accepting a position until you have heard from all of the schools you applied to. Once you have, compare the offers that you have received. You may consider:


How much funding or financial assistance you have received
What the requirements of each program are
How many years it may take you to complete each program
Which program has higher employment rates after graduation
The cost of each program and the cost of living where the program is located

, It is good to hear a student perspective on the program. They can inform you of the atmosphere of the department, any problems with the program, and how to make the most of your experience. Email the Director of Graduate Studies at the program, and ask them if they will put you in touch with a current graduate student.

, Some universities will automatically consider you for internal funding sources, but others will make you apply separately. In addition to merit scholarships and fellowships, you can apply for external funding through a variety of sources. Some scholarships you might consider applying for include:U.S. Department of Education Jacob K. Javits FellowshipsThe Fulbright Graduate Degree GrantsGoldwater ScholarshipFord Foundation Scholarship, In the months leading up to graduate school, you will have to consider many new changes. Plan ahead of time what you will need to do before you begin your new program. This may include:


Notifying the university that you want to attend
Moving to a new city
Contacting faculty that you want to work with
Submitting paperwork to your university
Becoming up to date on all of your required immunizations
Attending orientation

, If you were not accepted to graduate school or if you did not receive the assistance you need, you may consider waiting a year and trying again. In that year, you can improve your exam scores, gain work experience, and work on your personal statements.


It may be better to reapply the following year rather than accepting a position at a program that will not help you reach your goals.

Reply to Stanford by June 1st.",How to Get Into Stanford," The fact of the matter is that kids are growing up faster and faster nowadays and parents are becoming more and more demanding. Taking an AP class in high school isn't nearly as impressive when your neighbor is taking it as a 12-year-old. The sooner you start being an amazing student, the better! In other words, start in junior high if you can.


You know the phrase ""You can't teach an old dog new tricks?"" Take it to heart. Picking up a sport, a language, a hobby, or a skill is infinitely harder the older you get. Do yourself a favor now and get involved in whatever you can. By the time you need to apply, you'll be the cream of the crop.;
, Meet with your high school counselor regularly from day one to review your academic progress. Inform them you're looking to go to Stanford so they can get you on the right track as soon as possible. They'll be able to suggest classes and tell you what you need to do to get started.


Keep your career goals in mind when it comes to choosing classes. For example, becoming a doctor would require Algebra 1, 2, Geometry, Calculus, Trigonometry, and any other math classes you have offered in your school along with Physics, Chemistry, and any other science classes you have. For art/design careers, physics, geometry, art, and computer design are wonderful.
Be aware that Stanford recommends 4 years of English with an emphasis on writing and literature; 4 years of Mathematics with emphasis on algebra, trigonometry and geometry; 3 years of History/Social Studies, preferably with an essay component; and 3 years of laboratory science, such as biology, chemistry and physics. Three-to-four years of a foreign language is also recommended.

, The better your grades, the better your chances, even though Stanford has no ""minimum GPA"" requirement. And if your grades are in AP and advanced classes, even better. 56% of all applicants have a GPA of 4.0 or better.That being said, you can get into this school on less than perfect GPA. If you have a 3.5 but you invented a school curriculum that 10 states have adopted, you'll still get in. You just may end up going to MIT instead!, You should begin as early as possible taking gifted classes and any honors classes that your school offers. Yes, you will have to take EOC tests for those classes, but the more the merrier! If your school only offers a few, take them.


This is important because Stanford weighs certain classes against others. The more AP classes you have -- and if you get good grades in them -- the more impressive your application will be. Harder classes are given more consideration., The university is looking for enthusiasm and commitment in what you're doing. That might be better shown as in-depth experience in a couple of activities rather than minimal participation in many clubs and sports. Find what you enjoy and do it. Do it throughout your high school career.


No extracurricular activity has more merit than another at this college. As long as you can prove you're sticking with it and advancing, it's impressive.
Participate in clubs that your school has, like Student Council, Spirit, Debate, or NHS. Run for class president and be one of the officers. Participate in a school play. Start an environment group. Be as well-rounded as possible.

, If there's something during your time in high school you should make time for, it's volunteering. Not only do you have to be smart, athletic, and well-spoken, you have to be kind and community-oriented, too. A good GPA isn't that hard to come by -- but a person with good character, solid morals, and a good GPA takes the cake.


Look into volunteering at your local hospital, animal shelter, homeless shelter, nursing home, daycare, or with larger groups like Habitat for Humanity. If you're interested in an organization doesn't have an established volunteer program, ask! Very few people turn down those willing to work for free.

, One of these standardized tests is REQUIRED by Stanford in order to be considered. However, there's no minimal test score needed in order to be admitted. Although, getting a near perfect score will rocket your chances into getting into Stanford. In the last year, 25% of the admitted class received an 800 on their SAT for both math and critical thinking.Two SAT subject tests are recommended, but are not required. You will need to include official results if you choose to submit these tests. Take reading and math, as this is pretty much the bare minimum of the two tests. Take writing if possible. Go on websites like number2.com in middle school so you will get a perfect score in high school!
If your results are less than you were hoping for, don't let it keep you from applying. There are a dozen other things being considered in addition to your test scores.

, If it's not easily explicable, even better. Consider student A: She's captain of the volleyball team, the lead in the school play, has a 4.0 GPA, volunteers at a domestic abuse shelter for women, is a black belt in karate, and speaks fluent Japanese and Tagalog. Impressive stuff. Student B just went on a UN trip to Switzerland and coordinated delegates. Wait, what?


Both students A and B did things that were very impressive and required hard work -- no one's going to argue otherwise. However, student A did things that most people could see themselves or someone they know doing. As for student B -- how they heck did they get involved with the UN at 17?! They must have something special about them. Even though student B got lucky, attended a conference and just schmoozed the right people, no one knows that. They just know that student B did something incredible. Something they can't explain. And that's impressive. Stanford loves impressive., The Restrictive Early Action deadline is November 1st. The regular decision deadline is January 1st. If you are including an arts supplement, the deadlines are October 15th and December 1st, respectively. Most students abide by the regular decision guidelines.


""Restrictive Early Action"" should only be used if you are confident Stanford is your first choice. Conduct a thorough search of other colleges before you assume this is the action you should take.Visit admission.stanford.edu/arts for information on submitting the arts supplement.If you are serious about the arts and intend on pursuing them in some form (no commitment to pursuing them at Stanford is necessary), consider this section of the application and its respective deadlines.

, For the most up-to-date information, that's where you'll want to be. Click on the ""never registered"" link under ""Apply"" in the middle of the screen. And you're off!


You must apply online unless you have special circumstances that prevent you from doing so. Stanford University only accepts online applications unless you are given special permission to send in paper applications.

, The process will be very linear and straightforward online -- you can find them at commonapp.org.Your high school transcripts are also required. Your school has the choice of sending them electronically or by mail. There are three forms that must be completed: the Secondary School Report, the Mid-Year School Report and the Final Report. These forms can be completed or downloaded at the Common Application Web Site.
You must also send in a $90 non-refundable application fee with these forms. If you'd like to have the fee waived, talk to your counselor and fill out the necessary form online or fax it to (650) 723-6050., These evaluations must come from teachers who taught you in grades 11 or 12, unless you took advanced level courses in grade 10. Be sure to ask well in advance -- some teachers will take their sweet, sweet time when it comes to recommendation letters and evaluations. Your teachers should submit them online, as per Stanford's preferences.


These evaluations must come from 2 different core subjects. Examples of accepted subjects include Math, English, Science, Foreign Languages or History/Social Sciences.
You may take the option of including a third letter not from a teacher, if you feel it would round out the impression you give of yourself. However, this is optional and a third letter will neither increase or decrease your chances., Be yourself when writing your essays for Stanford. The college is looking for your ""genuine"" voice and not what you think they want, also known as ""packaging."" The committee has seen it all, can easily call BS, and won't be impressed by anything other than innovation, genuineness, and honesty.


It is possible to write an essay on your love of ice cream and get in.Don't think you have to write your standard ""Look at how awesome I am"" essay -- at least directly. If you show you have drive, commitment, and are willing to step out of the box, you stand a decent chance of getting in.

, Rest assured that the acceptance committee doesn't fall for much. They've seen tie-dyed boxers, dozens and dozens of baked goods, and even planes flying overhead trying to get students in.Know that they don't work. Only ""you"" seals the deal, not the gimmicks you employ.

, Each year, Stanford accepts fewer and fewer students -- well, really, more and more are applying (around 20,000).Last year, they accepted around 7% of all applicants.Even if you're Mr or Ms. Diamond Child Extraordinaire, you may not get in. And that's fine! It's not reflective of worth. Plenty of other schools will get you on the path to success, too.


You should always, always have safety schools up your sleeve. If Stanford doesn't work out, you need a backup plan. If they accept you it doesn't mean you have to go!

, This means that whether you're the son of Bill Gates or the daughter of an unemployed illegal immigrant, you'll be given consideration. What's more, Stanford has great financial aid -- if you don't think you can afford it, apply anyway.


Yep, Stanford is a very, very expensive school to attend. You're looking at over $13,000 a quarter.But again, don't write it off. Stanford knows it's expensive -- it wants to help you out. It doesn't care whether you're the best of the best -- if you need aid, you will receive it.
Apply for the CSS PROFILE (College Scholarship Service) and FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) online. It'll take about 20 minutes and should be done by January., For transfer students, the deadlines are a bit different. The application with the Arts supplement deadline and the standard application is March 15th; however, the SAT must be taken by January and the ACT by February. This goes for transferring students, whether you're international or not.


Traditional students abide by an earlier timeline -- they apply by January. They'll also get notified by April, whereas you'll get notified by May., Consult the Stanford Bulletin and the registrar's web page for the most updated information on what transfer credits are accepted. If you have any questions, your adviser can help you out.


Only classes in which you obtained a C- or higher will be counted toward your degree. What's more, only coursework from accredited universities that is similar to what Stanford offers will be accepted for credit.In order to obtain a degree from Stanford, you need to complete at least two years of coursework at the university. , Both of these must be completed and submitted online at the Common Application Web Site. Also complete the Transfer Application Personal Essay as well as the Stanford Supplement Short Essays. Essay tips can be found in the ""Mastering the Application Process"" of this article.


The process for you is very similar to process traditional students undertake. Instead of just high school transcripts, you'll be offering up your college ones, too. The same fees apply., These evaluations must be from an academic teacher at your college, unless you have only taken large lecture courses. In those cases, a teaching assistant can fill out the form.


Just as with the traditional students, you may submit an optional third letter from someone other than a teacher who knows you well and can round out your character. It will neither increase or decrease your chances.Have your instructors submit them online, if at all possible. Stanford is trying its hardest to go paperless and highly prefers online submission.

, This is an addition to the forms outlined in the traditional student section. Other than that, the process and expectations are no different.


Translation of official transcripts and teacher evaluations into English is required. Original copies of your instructions should also be translated. These translations should be by teachers or school administrators who know English well.
You can also take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) if you are not a native English speaker. The test is not required, but is recommended.

, If you get notified that you were accepted, well, for starters, congratulations! Secondly, let them know by June 1st of your decision. The sooner you do, the sooner you can get started on living arrangements and financial aid.


If you don't get in, don't stress. Getting in as a transfer student is even more difficult statistically than getting in as a traditional student -- in recent years, somewhere between 1 and 4% of transfer applicants get accepted. That's because only 20 to 50 spots are open annually. If you don't get in, you're in good company.

, Financing your education is important and requires advanced planning. UPenn offers generous financial support to all qualified students who are admitted. Financial aid at UPenn utilizes all-grant approach that includes scholarships and work-study programs, without any loans.That way, students can graduate debt-free.


UPenn admissions is need-blind. Decisions are made regardless of an applicant's financial situation.All financial aid at UPenn is need-based rather than merit-based.
UPenn is committed to supplying grants and work-study opportunities that meet the full demonstrated financial need for each accepted student, for up to eight academic semesters.
The average financial aid package for incoming freshman in 2013 was over $44,000.
Loans are available to students that desire them for certain reasons, such as to substitute for work-study programs.Financial need can be reassessed as needed (such as if a student's parent loses a job).

, Like most colleges and universities, UPenn requires the submission of standardized test scores.These include the SAT or ACT (both, if desired), and the TOEFL, for students who are non-native English speakers and who did not attend a school where the language of instruction is English. Studying for these tests beforehand can help you score well. There are self-study guides, private courses, and tutoring options available to help you prepare for any standardized test(s) you need to take.

Make sure that your scores are sent directly to UPenn if you are taking standardized tests at a late date. This ensures that your scores will arrive on time.
UPenn considers only the highest score on any standardized test, if an applicant takes the test multiple times.
If you take a standardized test early, you will have more time to take it again if you want to improve your score.
The middle 50% SAT scores of recent applicants to UPenn are: 690-780 (Reading), 710-800 (Math), 700-790 (Writing).The ACT composite score range of the middle 50% of recent applicants to UPenn is 32-35., When applying to UPenn, you must declare which of its four undergraduate schools you want to enter.There are some dual degree and specialized programs at UPenn, but you still must apply to one school.While students at UPenn can take courses in any of the four schools, it is not always easy to transfer from one to the other. The four schools are:


The College of Arts and SciencesThe School of Engineering and Applied Science.The School of NursingThe Wharton School of Business, There are two types of admission to UPenn.When you submit your application, you will declare which admissions plan you desire. Each entails certain types of commitments and obligations.


The Early Decision Plan is for students who are certain that UPenn is their top choice. If you select this plan, you agree to withdraw all applications to other schools if you are admitted to UPenn.
The Regular Decision Plan allows more flexibility when choosing schools. However, if you have made an early decision agreement with another school and you are accepted there, you must withdraw your Regular Decision Plan application at UPenn.

, All application components (with the exception of any supplementary materials, if applicable) must be submitted by the deadline in order for your application to be considered complete. The exact deadline may vary from year to year, but it is generally the beginning of November (for Early Decision Plan applicants) or early January (for Regular Decision Plan applicants).,, The Common Application includes a general essay (250-650 words) portion, for which you will select a prompt and write a response.You must also write an essay that is specific to UPenn, as well as one for any coordinated degree program you want to enter (if applicable).


Prompts include things like “Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story” and “Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea. What prompted you to act? Would you make the same decision again?”
UPenn requires a supplementary essay (400-650 words) in response to this prompt: “How will you explore your intellectual and academic interests at the University of Pennsylvania? Please answer this question given the specific undergraduate school to which you are applying.”
If you are applying to one of the coordinated degree programs at UPenn, you will have to write an additional essay. Check with the UPenn Admission’s page on essay requirements for the most current details.

, These must be received by UPenn in order for your application to be considered complete.


You are required to submit two letters of recommendation from academic teachers.
Make sure to ask your letter writers before listing them as a recommender on your application.
Allow your letter writers plenty of time to finish and submit their letters ahead of the deadline.
Give your letter writers a copy of your current resume when you make the request. This will help them write the strongest letters possible.
You can request a third letter of recommendation, one from someone who is not a teacher (such as a coach, research supervisor, boss, or clergy member). The author of the third letter, if you choose to have one, must know you personally and be able to speak to your readiness for admission at UPenn.

, Submitted as part of the Common Application, the school report describes your school’s curriculum, academic profile, and other pertinent information.This helps the UPenn admissions committee see how well you performed and how rigorous of a curriculum you took in high school, compared to your peers. Typically, a counselor, headmaster, or similar administrator submits the school report.


Make sure to request a your school report from this person well in advance of the application deadline so that he or she has time to complete it.

, Your Common Application will include transcripts from all high schools you have attended. You must request that your school submits your most current transcript by the application deadline.


If you are deferred, you must submit a Mid-Year Report that may include an updated transcript.
If you admitted, you must submit a Final Report that includes your final high school transcript.

, Most students do not have to submit supplementary materials with their application to UPenn.In fact, submitting excess materials may detract from your application. Occasionally, however, additional materials may support your application, as long as they are submitted in accordance with UPenn’s guidelines. For example:


If you have talent in an area like art or music, you may want to submit a portfolio of sample works/performances.
If you have significant experience in a non-academic area (such as community service, work, research, etc.), you may submit a supplementary third letter of recommendation.

, Once you have completed and submitted the Common Application and any supplementary materials, your application is considered complete.Remember to submit your application by the deadline, at the latest, and to pay the $75 application fee.If you have financial difficulties or special circumstances, you can request a fee waiver through the Common Application., Many applicants to UPenn, but not all of them, are interviewed by alumni volunteers during the admissions decision process.You cannot request an interview, but will be contacted by an alumni volunteer to set one up.

, Colleges, especially elite colleges (Harvard, a Service Academy, Yale) aren't going to just accept you because you only have a 4.0GPA. They want to see your character and your willingness to become involved and help others. Joining clubs that are involved in school( Sports, Debate, Dance, Glee, Honor Society, you name it), or outside of school(Scouts, Church, Community Service, Part-Time Job) shows that you are willing to do other things than academics and you are a well-rounded person.

, Don't just join activities, lead them! Being the leader shows colleges that you can take charge of something and make it do great things. This will also show that you can work with other people to get things done. Running for Club Officer, Class Officer, ASB Officer, Sport Team Captain are all great examples.

, Make sure that you get practice on these test through practice tests or books/programs that help you prepare for them. Also, take these test multiple times to get the best score. When looking at colleges, know what their scores are so you can aim for them.

, When colleges look at applications, they want to see what makes you more special than the other 100 applications they receive.

, Don't drink, do drugs, smoke, or be lazy. Make good life choices everyday, and doing the other steps will be easy. If you do drugs or drinks, you are setting yourself up for eventual academic failure. Colleges want good, solid people.

Talk to your professors.,

Know what you want to do.,
Work as hard as you can.,
Take the right classes.,
Study for the big exam.,
Ask for letters of recommendation.,
Take a lot of appropriate classes.,

Apply early.",How to Prepare for a PhD as an Undergraduate," It’s a good idea to talk to professors about your interests, especially professors in your field of interest. Not only have they been through the process of obtaining a PhD, but they know other professors and institutions in the field. They'll have inside tips to prepare you for the workload, and may even be able to write a letter of recommendation for you.Don't approach any professor at random. Look at the department you’re interested in, review who is teaching what, what their specific area of study is, and then contact them. For example, if you’re interested in linguistics you would go to the linguistics department website and look under the faculty tab. Here you will find a bio for each professor that can help you choose one or two professors to talk to.
If you send an email, start with “Dear Professor Smith,” then ask if you can meet to ask questions about pursuing a PhD in linguistics. Sign the email with a cordial closing like “sincerely"" and your name.
If you go to their office hours, show up when the hours begin, politely knock on the door (even if it’s already open), and introduce yourself. You can say something like, “Hello Professor Smith, I am John Public and I’m interested in getting a PhD in linguistics. I’d like to ask you a few questions about the process. Is this a good time for you?”
Don’t try to talk at length with the professor after class. They likely have another class or something already scheduled. What you can do, however, is inquire about setting a meeting, and then follow up with an email about the details.;
, Grad students can talk about how they prepared and what they actually do in grad school. They’ll also likely have solid tips on how to study and survive the increased amount of work


A good way to meet a current grad student is to contact a professor and ask for a list of people who would be willing to meet up with you. Then you can email the student directly to ask if they would be free to meet up over lunch or a cup of coffee. During the meeting be sure to thank them for taking the time to meet with you. Most importantly, you need to come with a list of questions you have about grad school, and also be open to listen to any advice they have to give that isn’t on your question list.
For example, you might ask “how much does grad school cost, and how do I pay for it?”, or inquire about what is required of them. You might also ask, “what are the best and worst things about grad school?” And also, “how do you handle the workload?”

, You don’t have to know the specific subfield, but you should at least have a decent idea what you want to study. For example, you don’t exactly need to know you want to study sociophonetics, but knowing you’re interested in linguistics is crucial.


Make sure you also think about whether you want to get a PhD to work as an academic (i.e. a professor) or in the private sector.Both paths can be rewarding, but the prep work can be wildly different. For example, an associate professor teaching psychology at a university will require a significant publication record, but going into private practice or working for the government requires much less.

, Professors looking at your undergraduate transcripts will want to see that you’ve worked hard from start to finish.


Do you remember the semester you decided to take the extra class, suffered the loss of your childhood pet, or thought sleeping through geology was a good idea? The group of professors on the selection panel will understand one or two grade discrepancies on your transcript. After all, they were undergrads too. The panel will be less likely to overlook frequent or repeated bad grades and withdraws (classes marked by a W on your transcript), even if they are in non-major courses or general prerequisites.
To work as hard as you can, do homework and study on a daily basis. When you don’t understand the material, go to your professor’s office hours with specific questions and examples of what you don’t get. Also, don’t be afraid to go to the tutoring center or hire a private tutor. This will provide detailed, first-hand help with the course material.

, You will generally need to complete two types of classes to be well prepared. These are general education requirements (or Gen Ed classes) and the classes needed to complete your specific major (major classes).


General education classes are designed to provide a well-rounded, general education that gets you ready for more specific courses. These classes are required at the University level for all students to complete. For example, you’ll likely need to complete freshman level English classes, a few science courses, and perhaps writing classes.
Major classes are more specific courses that the major or department requires. If you’re a language major, you’re likely required to take a general linguistics class, several survey courses in literature and culture, and depending on the state you go to school in, you’ll have to pass a language-specific written and oral test. These requirements are put in place to make sure that you will be ready to take graduate-level courses and perform well.
Many universities also offer cross-listed classes, which are courses open to both graduate and undergraduate students. Take a few of these to get an idea of the work you’ll be doing. This is also a great way to meet grad students and make your introduction.

, Some schools require a GRE or other exam to be considered for acceptance, and usually require a minimum score. If you take the exam and don’t perform well, you can always study and take the exam again.


There are several ways to prepare for the GRE or other important entrance exams. The most obvious but often overlooked is to work hard throughout your undergrad education. This means study early for each class and study often.
Many people find it helpful to buy test preparation materials to study for the exam. For example, you can purchase GRE prep manuals from Kaplan, ETS, or The Princeton Review. You can usually find online or in-print materials available. Often the materials can be used in conjunction with a class that is meant to prepare you for the exam. These same companies also likely have courses available.
If you’re looking to seal the deal, try hiring a tutor who is trained in test preparation. There are several national companies like Wyzant, Varsity Tutors, and Sylvan who have tutors trained in this area. It’s also likely that there are many local companies who offer the same services. Finally, check with your college or university’s student services center, as they may have several on-campus options.

, Every PhD program will require that you submit letters of recommendation with your application, and they usually want three. For this you want to ensure you ask a current or past professor for a letter, but only if you have done well in their class. Don’t ask the teacher whose class you got a C in.


You need to ask the right person. Ask a full-time faculty member who is an assistant, associate, or full professor. Many times the person teaching your introduction course, the principles of economics class, or the first 4 or 5 semesters of most language courses is a graduate teaching assistant, and their letter will not carry as much weight as would that of a faculty member. Ask for letters of recommendation usually toward the end off your junior year, when you’re filling out the applications.
Give the person at least three weeks to write the letter if possible. Professors usually have to teach, perform research, grade, serve on multiple committees, advise students, and go to department meetings, so providing sufficient time is best. However, if an important grant or new opening at a PhD program comes up and you’re in good standing with your psycholinguistics professor, go ahead and ask politely for a letter of recommendation. The worst thing they could say is no.

, The economics graduate program you want to get into will place more emphasis on the economics and finance classes you took, and less emphasis on your courses in Basket Weaving or Yoga for Beginners. The best practice is to satisfy the requirements for your college major and program, and go beyond the minimum to earn a minor. Better yet, try a double major or double minor. Often the prerequisite courses are the same, leaving a smaller amount of classes to take.

, PhD programs sometimes require you to know an additional language other than your native language. For those seeking a PhD in a language, you will need to have some level of proficiency in two languages beyond your native tongue. Besides, being bilingual carries with it a host of positive correlates, one of which is making you look better to your potential program.Several options exist for learning a new language. One of them is to take classes in a language at the university you are already attending. You can also take courses at private language schools in your area, study with language learning software like Rosetta Stone or Fluenz, use a language learning app on your phone like Duolingo or Babbel, or hire a private language coach.
Regardless of which option you choose, be sure to bolster your skills with practice. You can practice your language skills by watching movies, listening to music, joining a local club or society, and hiring a conversation partner.

, Becoming familiar with your future field will carry a lot of weight in your application. What’s more, your supervisor or research advisor will make an excellent person to write letters of recommendation. Note that research differs from field to field. For example, in the natural sciences (biology, physics) you will perform laboratory research, while the humanities (English, Spanish, literature) and social sciences (linguistics, sociology) you will likely never enter a science lab, rather perform individual investigations.


You can get research experience by applying for part-time positions in a laboratory, department, or a related job outside the university. For example, if you want to study cognitive development, you can apply to work in a psychology lab, a medical center that specializes in cognitive disorders, or even volunteer in the psychology department.
Other opportunities include paid or unpaid internships, which can be found in a variety of places. For example, legal offices, court houses, large medical centers, museums, and many more places usually have many openings. Be careful though, these positions may fill fast, so be on the look out.

, For example, if you want to go into oceanography, learn how to handle small boats. If you’re studying to be a teacher, get a job tutoring on the side, or writing activities for a textbook company.

, You’ll need to learn how to better organize your time, be more efficient, and adapt better critical thinking skills. Graduate level work requires an enhanced version of your current brain.Taking classes at the next level is the point at which you switch from a consumer of information to a producer of information.


There are a lot of ways to improve organizational skills. For example, focus on a few skills at a time, like improving time management.You can also work on learning to set priorities, doing what’s more important first and saving less crucial tasks for later., You’ll likely need to apply for a PhD program at the very beginning of your last year of study, and in some cases, the summer before. This means you should start thinking about programs as early as possible, even at the end of your sophomore year or beginning of your junior year, and make sure you have your application completed on time. Schools will not usually extend a deadline without a very good reason.

Most students entering NYU have a GPA of about 3.5. That doesn't mean that they won't accept any lower, and they certainly would like higher. However, it's good to keep the range in mind., NYU accepts either the ACT or the SAT for the entrance exam, though your particular department may prefer one or the other. Once you decide which one to take, you need to spend some time practicing for the exam before you take it.The middle 50 percent of freshman at NYU score between a 29 and 32 on the ACT or between 1910 to 2150 on the composite SAT.You can also submit three ACT, SAT, or Advanced Placement (AP) subject scores. You'll need one literature or humanities subject, one math or science, and one other test of your choice, though check with your particular program to see if they prefer one or the other.
You can buy books that will help you prepare for the exam, but you can also take practice tests online. You should definitely try a practice test before taking the real exam, so you know what the questions and timing will be like.
You'll need to register for a date and pay a fee to take the test at a testing center. Often, you can take it at a local school on a Saturday.You'll need to take the test early in the year. That is, you must take the test before the application deadline, even if you don't get the scores until after the deadline., If you can focus your academics in high school, that tells a college like NYU that you're passionate. Plus, if you can show you can succeed in a field in high school, that shows you can succeed in college. Of course, you don't have to decide what you want to do with the rest of your life, but narrowing down a major can be helpful. You'll be able to gain some experience in that field, which will look good on your application.For example, maybe you decide you have an interest in politics. In that case, you want to take as many history and government classes as you can. You can run for student senate or even volunteer for a local campaign. Having things like that on your application shows you have focus and the drive to pursue your interests, which colleges like.
Deciding what major you want before applying to NYU is also important because it can determine which application you use. However, you can always change your major later.

, If you take all easy classes to prop up your GPA, a school like NYU will notice. The school will want to see that you've challenged yourself before you've come to college because a school like NYU will challenge you. You need to be prepared for it, and taking hard classes, like AP classes is one way to do it., It is important to be involved in more than one extra curricular at your school. However, you shouldn't do so much that you spread yourself thin. The projects and activities you get involved in at school should reflect your passions and what you want to do later on. That shows NYU you have the passion AND follow-through.For example, if you want to write for living, you don't necessarily need to be in band, on a sport's team, in choir, in an art club, in a writing club, and on the yearbook. Instead, focus on the writing club, yearbook, and maybe the newspaper.
An even better approach is to take initiative. If your school doesn't have a writing club, start one. You could also partner with an elementary school to get kids excited about writing.

, You can make mistakes in high school and still get into a college like NYU. However, you do need to offer some explanation because the admission's office will notice where you goofed up.For example, you could note that you struggled early on in pre-calculus, but you decided to push ahead instead of changing to something easier. By the end of the course, you'd worked hard to bring your grade up, and even though you ended up with a B overall, it taught you a good work ethic.

, That is, try to visit, or spend time on the phone with the admission's office asking questions about the school. Applying for early admission can also show you're enthusiastic., High-caliber schools like NYU often have interviews for the students, though it can depend on the on which school you're applying to. Basically, the school wants to get to know who you are before accepting you to the program. An interview also gives you a chance to show enthusiasm for the school by smiling and being energetic.Make sure you've read up on your own materials and the school beforehand.
Try to stay up with current events, as they may want to see how much you know about the world.
Try a practice run with your parents or teachers.

, If you show up on time, always have your homework, and work hard, that shows character. You're teachers will notice, and that's important. You'll need them to write letters of recommendation for you.Most admissions counselors weigh letters of recommendation heavily, as it's a chance for the people who've taught and worked with you to evaluate you as a person. Therefore, try not to burn bridges with your teachers.

, High-caliber schools like NYU want to know that you're going to contribute to your community and the world, and that starts by showing what you can do in high school. That means volunteering in your community and taking initiative when you can.Find a place to volunteer that's relevant to your interests. For example, if you're interested in being a veterinarian, consider volunteering at your local animal shelter.
If you see a need in your community or school, don't wait for someone else to fix it. You can create big changes, too.

, When applying to NYU, it's a good idea to apply to other schools, too, as no one is guaranteed to get into any one school. However, you don't want to apply to so many that you spread yourself thin trying to get all the applications in. Instead, pick ones that are similar in caliber and composition to NYU, plus one or two ""safer"" schools, meaning schools that have a higher acceptance rate., Your essay is an important part of your application. It introduces you to the college you're applying to it. It should be short and sweet, and tell a story about who you are and what you want in life. The Common Application expects you to keep your essay to 250-500 words.The Common Application does provide questions to help you along, though you can write on any topic you choose. For instance, you can write about an obstacle you've overcome, a political or ethical issue that's important to you, or about a person or fictional character that's had an influence on you.Make your essay as personalized as you can. Don't just give a standard answer, as you're trying to distinguish yourself from other candidates. What makes your story unique?
Sell yourself. Part of the job of the essay is to sell yourself to the admission's office. That is, you have to tell the person why you think you should be admitted. Maybe you're great at overcoming obstacles, or you have a truly stellar academic career. Whatever it is, bring it out at the end. Don't over-represent yourself. You need to be honest. However, you do need to convince the admission's office that you should be let in.
Have someone else read it. It has to make sense to a reader, not just to you. Have someone else read it, such as a parent, a teacher, or a guidance counselor. Ask them for feedback, as well as for some proofreading. You don't want typos in your application essay! Also, make sure you don't slip into informal language (like textspeak) or punctuation., The Common Application is a universal application used by many schools across the country, not just NYU. It just makes it easier on you. You complete one application, and you can submit to as many schools as you need to.You can also send it to multiple NYU campuses if you want to apply to more than one.
When applying to NYU, make sure your program is covered under the Common Application. A couple of NYU's programs require a separate application, mainly the dental hygiene program, a second bachelor's in the Tandon School of Engineering, and a second bachelor's degree in nursing.
Find the appropriate application. The main NYU admission's page lists the applications for these programs. Click on the appropriate link to find the one for your program. On the next page, you'll find more information on what you'll need to do to apply., Of course, you can apply to the main campus of NYU. However, you can also apply to a variety of satellite campuses, located in other cities and towns. You may find you have a satellite campus closer to home that you prefer over the main campus.When you work on your application, you'll need to add the schools you want to submit it to, though you can always go back later and submit it to other schools.

, In the Common Application, you'll need to fill in a large amount of biographical information, including information on your history and where you live, as well as your parents' information.You'll also need to fill in information about your educational background, including the high schools and colleges you've attended, as well as the test scores you have already. You'll also need to fill in information about any academic honors you've received.
Another section will cover any work or volunteer experience you have. Almost any experience is good, but you should make sure to put down any experience that's relevant to what you want to study. You'll also need to write about one of them. In that case, definitely pick something relevant to your program if possible.

, When applying to NYU, you'll need to submit a variety of paperwork. They'll want official copies of your transcripts, for instance, both for your high school and any college work you've done. You'll also need letters of recommendation, as well as the scores from your standardized tests.You can ask for transcripts from your high school's guidance counselor's office or from your college's registrar's office. They must come directly from the school, not you, to be considered valid.Have them sent by mail to this address: New York University, Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 383 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10003, USA
Don't forget to check your program's requirements. Certain schools within NYU require additional information, such as a portfolio. For instance, if you're applying for an art program, you'll need to submit examples of your work in a portfolio.

, One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to miss the school's application deadline. NYU's main campus has a final deadline of January 1. However, you can apply for early decision by submitting an early decision application before November 1. These dates apply to your senior year of high school or the year before you go to college.Don't forget to pay the application fee. The application fee as of 2016 for NYU is $70. The application fees can be steep if your family doesn't have a lot of money. If that's the case, apply for a waiver on NYU's website. Often, the school will waive the fee if it's needed.

, No matter where you go in the United States, you need to fill out the FAFSA to receive federal aid, and that holds true for NYU. It's how you get things like student loans and federal grants to help you put yourself through school., When you first arrive on the FAFSA website, you'll need to make an ID. Basically, you're just creating a username and password like you would for any other website. You can create the ID by clicking ""Start a New FAFSA"" on the FAFSA website. On the next page, you should see a place to fill in your ID information, along with an option to create your FSA ID.Enter an email, as well as a username and password of your choosing.
You'll also need to give some biographical information, such as your date of birth, phone number, and address, as well as your Social Security number.
Submit your information to receive an email. When you get the email, you'll need to click on a link in the email to verify your account.

, Log into your account by clicking on ""Start a New FAFSA"" again. Put in your log-in information. Once you do, submit the information, and it should begin a new application for you and take you to the next page., The next step is to pick which schools you're applying to so that the government can send them your financial aid information, confirming you filled out the FAFSA. Of course, you need to add NYU, as you're applying there, but you should also add any other schools you're applying to. Search for the school code for each school, and enter them in.The code for NYU's main campus is 2785.
You may also need your NYU student ID number, which will be given to you after you apply to the school., You don't need to determine your dependency on your own. Rather, you go through the FAFSA's questions to determine your dependency. If you're a typical student, you will usually be considered to be dependent on your parents. However, the FAFSA will have questions about your marriage status, age, and whether or not you have kids to determine your dependency. Answer the questions truthfully., Just liked you filled in biographical information for yourself, you also need to add biographical information for your parents. You'll need things like their Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers., If you're a dependent, you'll need to add financial information about your parents, and you'll need to add your information either way. That includes things like income (from your tax returns), as well as assets your family owns. To make it easier, you can use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to bring in tax return information from the IRS.


To use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, you'll need to have done your taxes already for the year.
You'll also need information about what's in each of your bank accounts.

, Once you've added all the information, submit it. You should wait until you see a conformation page. Print that page out, just in case, even though the information will also be sent to your email. Also, the confirmation page can contain extra information., You must complete this application to receive other types of aid that aren't provided by the federal government. For instance, it helps you apply for scholarships. It's actually a general application for financial aid used by many schools.You'll need to create a log-in with the College Board if you haven't already done so because of tests like the SAT.
You'll need basically the same information for this application that you did for the FAFSA, such as your tax returns, W2s, and bank account information.
You must pay a fee for each school you submit the report to, as well as an initial application fee. However, in some cases, the fees can be waived.

Choose between Cambridge and Oxford.,
Choose your college.,
Write an excellent personal statement and UCAS application.,
Take the test (Oxford only).,
Submit your written work (Oxford only).,
Shine at the interview.,
Secure your place.",How to Get Into Oxbridge," Oxford and Cambridge are great places to study and look very good on a CV. One in five member of the Parliament actually went to Oxbridge!In a few cases, you may wish to consider top universities overseas, or another university for a specialist degree (e.g. Mechanical Engineering). You might also want to study in another European country to enjoy other cultures or learn a language.


Make sure to visit Oxford and Cambridge. You can access the colleges and talk to the students. You can also contact the universities and colleges through their webpages or by phone. Don't send emails to the lecturers and professors. They don't deal with general queries and are already busy enough.
If you haven't studied in the United Kingdom before, look at the criteria online or contact the admission teams. They have very specific criteria for each country on the planet. ;
, Your A-Levels will determine if you are admitted or not. As a teenager, you will be expected to work over 40 hours a week for some subjects, so make sure you are willing to dedicate yourself to the hard work.


Your A-Level results are extremely important. If you feel you will be able to achieve highly when taking more than three A-Level results, then feel free to do so. However, the number of results is far less important than the grades. It is better to do better with three A levels (at least AAA or higher, dependent on course and university), than to do less well with four or more. Most Admissions Tutors will agree with this.
It is not mandatory to disclaim your GCSE grades but they are often used to distinguish between entrants due to the high number of A's achieved at A level. As they are not mandatory, there is officially no level to reach. In practice, the better they are, the more likely you are to be accepted.

, Your choice of A-Levels needs to reflect your desire to study a discipline. You cannot study medicine if you never had an interest in science. It’s always a good idea to check in advance what is needed in your aspiring field.

It's also a great idea to make sure you are passionate about your subject, don't just do it for Oxbridge, for a job or because you are good at it. You will be slogging it out for the next three or more years, make sure It's something you can enjoy. The interviewer will also be looking out for this passion.

Think ahead. Your degree will decide what you do in life. You should realise that you might not work in history, even if you have a degree in the field. Decide what’s right for you and don’t let others choose for you.

, Many applicants will have perfect grades at GCSE and A-Levels. When all else is equal, depending on what program you're in, Oxbridge may look at your life and at who you are to decide who has done the extra mile.


Gain leadership experience. Having responsibilities and the ability to lead a team is always a way to shine. Try to become the captain of your sport team or the president of your debating club.
Volunteer with charitable organizations. Helping others and showing that you care about your surrounding will make you look like a valuable addition to a community.
Engage with cultural activities. Oxbridge is based on traditions and history. Even if you want to study science, show that you care about the past and the culture.
Ultimately though, extra-curricular activities are not the be-all and end-all. The people reviewing your application will be academics, so it is much more important to show a genuine passion for your subject and to back up your claims with evidence. This can include listing relevant books you have read, films or documentaries you have watched, or events you have attended.

, It might be obvious but you need to know where you want to study when you apply. There is a strong rivalry between the two universities and you probably already have a preference. The most rational way to pick the right institution for you is by picking the strongest in your field. Oxford performs far worse in engineering and technology than Cambridge but is better for life sciences, medicine and humanities.It is slightly easier to reach Cambridge from London.
Think about the financial implication. The tuition fees are currently £9,000 per year and you should allow an additional £8,300 per year to live in Cambridge.. Oxford is slightly more expensive in terms of living costs.

, You will need to pick a college when you apply and write the application. Read up about as many colleges as you can. You can view the statistics of each college online to see how many people applied and got in for each course. Study the history of the college and try to remember the name of a few of its prominent members. It’s important to show that you care.


Make sure to choose a college that offers your subject. You can find information on this on the University websites.
Only take an open application if you are unsure what college you want to go to. This will not affect your chances but you will be asked why you didn't apply for a college at the interview. Make sure to underline that it has nothing to do with you not caring or not having read on them.

, Oxbridge will only look at your personal statement for a few minutes. It has to be perfect. Ask several teachers to look over it and even get your friends to double-check. Make sure to take the advice of experienced teachers. There are many ways to approach a personal statement but make sure to mention the following in your letter:


Introduction about the subject, why you want to do it, etc. (show some knowledge of the course)
Academic achievement
Non academic achievement
Extra curricular activities and hobbies
Conclusion (include what you want to do after university).

, There are extra steps between the UCAS and the interview at the University of Oxford. The first one is a test with the Admissions Testing Service.The test is not systematic. It is required when you need specific knowledge, like Latin and Greek for Classic studies. A full list and several examples of tests are available on the webpage of the University of Oxford.Each test is different. Make sure to read what's required and the criteria about your specific discipline.

, You will need to submit written work. The piece needs to be marked and cannot be more than 2,000 words. Make sure to select the best written work you can.The written work should be relevant to your future career path. Don't send a history essay if you want to study biology.

, If you are called for an interview, you will need to prepare. They will ask you difficult questions and try to test you. You must prove your knowledge and your desire to learn in that particular university. They will also ask you about your hobbies. Remember that they are looking for human beings who can contribute to the life of the college.


Know why you want to go to the college, why you want to study your course, and what you love about your course.
Stay confident throughout the interviews.
It is always a bonus to search up your interviewers to see the areas they specialise in. Read up on these areas as it may be likely that they will ask you questions on those topics. It is always better to be clued up, and you will impress them.
There are courses held every year for students to prepare for the interview. These are extremely expensive, sometimes costing hundreds of pounds. They are not necessary if you are supported by your school and trained by your teachers.
It is a good idea to get teachers to give you several different styles of mock interviews. Make sure you study relevant topics and be prepared to answer questions that require independent thought.
Don’t forget to dress properly and behave impeccably. The first impression counts a lot. However make sure that you feel comfortable in your clothes, this may seem minor but it could affect your performance in the interview which is by far the most critical part of this process. Whether to wear a suit or not is an ambiguous subject. Some tutors may dress much more casually than others (this may have a correlation with which subject they teach). The letter or email inviting you to the interview may hold a hint on what kind of clothes are acceptable.

, Oxbridge will typically notify you of their decisions six months before your final A-Levels. If you get accepted, you will still have to perform well at your A-Levels as the offer will be conditional on you receiving certain grades. The typical Oxford offer is AAA at A-level, but Cambridge offers usually asks for the new A* grade.


If you are rejected, you will need to consider your options. If you want to try the year after, make sure to do something constructive, such as volunteering, during your gap year. You can also choose to apply for another university.

Fulfill specific course requirements.,
Make grades your number one concern.,
Identify professors with whom you feel a connection or whose classes you particularly enjoy.,
Have a well-rounded college experience.,
Get clinical experience.,
Show that you are committed.,
Be a leader.,
Get an internship.,
Acknowledge about the future.",How to Get Into Medical School1," As long as you complete the requirements (mostly scientific in nature), you can major in anything you would like. For example, you must take courses in biology, chemistry, and physics to prepare for the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) and fulfill medical school prerequisites. As a result, many pre-med students major in a field of science. As it turns out, medical schools are looking to diversify their programs, so they are starting to accept more students with less conventional backgrounds that include degrees in fields such as humanities. As of 2015, you will need the background of one semester of introductory psychology and one semester of introductory sociology to be prepared for the Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior section of the MCAT., It is important to have a high GPA in order to be a strong medical school candidate. Whatever major you choose, make your performance in the classroom your main focus.


Be an exemplary student. Attend all of your classes each time they meet, schedule lots of time for reading and studying and do not hesitate to get help from another classmate or a tutor the minute you realize you are struggling with any of your subjects.
Focus on BCPM. BCPM stands for ""Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics""; these are the core classes for a pre-med major because these courses are prerequisites for any medical school program.
Your BCPM grades are greatly important that when you apply to medical school, your scores in these classes will be separated out and an additional GPA will be calculated for these classes alone and reviewed along with your cumulative GPA in all of your classes.

, Do your best to get to know them and learn if they are accessible to offer guidance or answer questions. In a couple of years, you will need letters of evaluation from individuals who know you and your work, and one of your professors might agree to write such a letter if he or she feels they've made a connection with you.


Attend department and informal functions where it might be easier to talk casually and openly with instructors.
Look for opportunities to meet alumni who have gone on to medical school or those who are working now as physicians. You can learn a lot about what to expect in medical school by talking to someone who has been there themselves.

, Plan to get involved in activities both related and unrelated to your major and look for opportunities on and off campus to develop personal, leadership, research and clinical skills.


Be sure to join any health-career clubs on your campus and get on the mailing list so that you will receive notices about events and activities. Approach the campus health clinic to look for volunteer positions there, and, if your school has a research facility, check for opportunities to assist in some way.
Go off campus to explore ways to get involved in the local community health center, at health fairs or teaching children about basic health topics. See if a local public school might be looking for candidates to take to kids about health care careers.

, That is a world of difference from learning the fundamentals in a classroom and practicing those skills with actual patients. You must find ways to get hands-on experience in a health care setting. Reach out to your local Planned Parenthood office, HIV clinic or free clinic to volunteer.


The author of an article that appeared in U.S. News and World Report said several admissions committee members he spoke to referred to clinical experience as ""the unspoken requirement.""

, The occasional one-time volunteer job is fine, but you want to choose a couple of organizations or causes about which you are passionate and make a regular (once-a-week or once-every-other-week) commitment over a sustained period of time.


Seek out under-served populations. Medical schools are not only looking for students with great grades, they want people who are caring and want to make a difference. Working to provide health care and health education to under-served or at-risk populations can help communicate your compassion.

, Being a physician means being in charge of a lot--diagnosis, treatment, medications, follow-ups and on and on. Hone your skills as a leader by heading up a group or a committee and be sure to set, achieve and record your goals for your organization.

, Internships for pre med students typically fall into one of two categories: research or clinical. Decide what most interests you and focus your efforts there.


Start with your adviser. Your adviser or health-career services office should have a list of internships available. Many times, schools establish relationships with doctors, hospitals, and health care organizations who, in turn, regularly accept student interns from that school.
Apply early. The time to be thinking about summer internships is in the fall of the preceding year. At minimum, start three to four months out, but do not be surprised if there are fewer opportunities available.
Be proactive. Talk to older students or alumni to find out about internship sites they would recommend or get and review a list of places that offered internships last summer. Contact those organizations on your own before they post or advertise their upcoming internships for the general pre-med population.

, While you're busy working on your grades, extracurricular activities and internships, you also need to keep in mind about upcoming requirements and deadlines that are a part of the med school applications process.


Take the MCAT junior year. There are two factors to consider when deciding on the timing of your Medical College Admission Test (MCAT): whether you plan to take the exam more than once and how prepared you feel.

If you think you might want to take the test more than once, plan to make your first attempt before May 1. This will give you plenty of time to get your scores and make a decision about retesting.

Most people do not plan on taking the exam multiple times, and some argue that it will hurt your chances. Like all things in life: if it's worth doing, it's worth doing right the first time. Schools will see your scores from all your attempts, and a great score the second time around will not mean as much as doing it the first time.


If you don't feel prepared academically or there are elements in your personal life that are making it difficult for you to focus, put your efforts into your coursework and on getting in a good place mentally for the test. It would be perfectly fine if you waited until June or July to take the exam. Even people who take the exam in August can apply that cycle.

Compile a collection of different looks.,
Calculate your budget.,
Assemble staple wardrobe pieces.,
Pick pieces for your body type.",How to Dress Classy for a New College Guy1," The diversity in men’s fashion is always expanding, but you can still dress well by building out a wardrobe of staple pieces. Before you go out and buy some staple pieces do some research to see what kind of styles you like. Cut out pages from magazines you like, or download images you find online into a special ""Fashion"" folder.


Gather inspiration from websites. blogs, and magazines that cover men’s fashion. GQ and Esquire are two larger magazines which are focused on men’s fashion and lifestyle. You will not only find ads that feature looks you may like but also get style tips that you can incorporate.
Websites like fashionbeans.com, askmen.com, and the subreddit /r/malefashionadvice will give you style tips and keep you updated on current trends.
Save some photos of looks that you like to help you get an idea of what kind of basics you want in your wardrobe.
Go to clothing stores and try on some clothes. You don’t have to buy something just because you try it on. But seeing how certain clothes and fits look on you will help you to save money and look your best.;
, Dressing well on a college budget might require you to spend more effort finding the right clothes and building out your wardrobe over time. Knowing how much you can spend will help you to make smart buying decisions. Your clothing budget should come from your extra spending money, not money you need for rent, food, or other bills. If you are committed to dressing well you may have to spend less money eating out and save it for a new shirt.
Remember that you don’t need a brand new wardrobe right away. You may find that you already own some nice pieces that you can wear.
Don’t think that more expensive clothes are better. While GQ will give you style advice, the clothes which are featured are often more expensive. You can still find similar outfits at other stores for much less.

, You don’t need a lot of different clothes to make a variety of looks. You can create plenty of looks that get you from class to the gym to the bar with less than 30 pieces of clothing.


Focus on building a versatile wardrobe with items that are compatible with each other. Solid, staple colors and a few essential pieces can be paired with just about anything. Staple clothes include:
Jeans and chinos.
Collared shirt.
T-shirt.
Sweater and/or cardigan.
Dress shoes and casual shoes.
Jacket or blazer.
A nice coat if you live somewhere where the weather gets cold. Peacoats are a staple and always in fashion. You can explore other coat styles and should find one you like. But a peacoat is always in style.

, You want a look you feel comfortable and confident in. You may be more comfortable in a casual look of a sweater, jeans, and casual shoes. Or, you may like to dress up more and wear button-downs and chinos. Regardless of your preferred look, get clothes that fit your body well.


Everyone’s body is different and certain patterns, cuts, and even certain brands of clothing will work in your favor. Generally, thinner vertical lines will slim you down, while thicker horizontal lines make you look broader. Patterns typically shorten a part of your body. Slimmer cuts in shirts and pants will accentuate the shape of your body.
In addition to getting stylish clothes you need clothes that fit well and make your body look proportional.
Men with broader shoulders and a smaller waist will be able to wear most fits whether you like a slim cut or a looser one.
If you have a bit of a wider midsection, opt for tops that have vertical stripes or are a solid color. Get pants with a slimmer straight leg to make your legs look longer and create an even line from your waist.
Add layers to accentuate certain areas. If you have narrower shoulders you can throw on a jacket or a crew neck sweater to give yourself a broader look and more definition.
Invest in a trusty pair of dark denim jeans. Denim is one of the most versatile pieces of clothing you own.

Have your items ready.,
Ask the RA or a roommate where the laundry room is, how much the laundry costs and how the payments work.,
Pre-treat laundry stains, if needed.,
Empty all of your pockets in your clothes.,
Find an empty washer.,
Remember to check the washer's soap and bleach dispensers.,
Separate your laundry.,
Turn t-shirts and tops inside out if they have any printed designs or text on them.,
Choose your settings on your washer depending on the contents: hot, warm or cold water and the size of load.The permanent press setting (if available on the machine) is a good choice if you are unsure about any garments and they do not have specific care instructions on them.,
Put your laundry in the machine and start as directed (with either coins or a card).,
Wait.,
Find dryers when your clothes are completely done that will fit all of your laundry.,
Check the lint trap if your dryer has one (many commercial ones do not).,
Add a dryer sheet to the dryer before starting (optional).,
Put your laundry in the machine and start as directed (with either coins or a card).,
Wait.,
Deal with wrinkle-prone articles immediately after the dryer is complete so they don't get wrinkled.,
Double-check the dryer.,
Carry your items back up to your dorm.",How to Do Your Laundry in a Dorm," Most dorms have the laundry away from main living quarters, so you need to have everything together. Be sure to check that you've taken all your soiled clothes from your workout or sports bag as well as towels, sheets, pillowcases and duvet covers if necessary. This includes:


Dirty laundry bag or basket
Laundry detergent--do not use other soaps, such as dish soap, hand soap or body wash. These can cause severe over-sudsing, do not work well, and can cause severe skin irritation).
Stain remover (optional) Softener or softening dryer sheets (store-bought or homemade) ).
Cash or swipe card, as appropriate.
Security card or key - even if your roommate says he or she will be around.;
, Have quarters or small bills (if there is a change machine) or a pre-paid student card if needed. It usually costs about $2-$2.50 to wash and dry each load. It will typically take one load per week of dirty clothes but this will vary widely depending on your own needs., If you haven't done so already, do it now. If you don't have a stain remover, use a few drops of laundry soap on the stain and rub it in using the fabric around the stain.Only use a bleach pen on white clothing!

, A pen or lipstick tube can easily ruin all of your clothes. You also don't want your cell phone to go through the wash.

Before leaving for the laundry room do NOT forget your room key.

, These can usually be identified by having the top or lid being raised, showing an empty washer. You can check machines that are not running. Do not remove another person's clothes unless there is really no other machines available. Remember to leave the lid raised for others after you are done.

, If someone else put bleach in the machine and didn't wash anything, your clothes could be ruined. If someone left soap in the dispenser--bonus!--unless you are sensitive to certain detergents. If there is bleach or soap remaining relocate to another washer.

, Sort your laundry into piles:""Lights"" usually refers to white cottons or cotton blends, light colors like yellows and bright greens or anything that can be washed without damage in hot water. This will also include your towels and sheets (unless sheets are dark colored).
""Darks"" usually include dark colors that will fade after repeated washings or fabrics that should not (or do not have to) be washed in hot water. If in doubt, (like a red and white striped shirt) always choose a colder temperature. Blue jeans should be washed with the darks.
Red and purple fabrics in particular have a nasty habit of releasing dye into the wash and turning white items pink. Put the reds, pinks, oranges, etc. in a separate load, or, if you only have reds, wash them in with the dark clothing. Some people report the same issues with lime or yellow-green clothing.
""Delicates"" include things that need special, delicate washing. This includes wool sweaters, bras, tights or nylons, silk shirts, swimsuits, and knits. The care label will usually indicate these items if you are unsure. Sometimes these can be combined with darks in a cool wash if the washer is not too loaded.

, The agitation in the washer will cause them to fade and/or become damaged over time. Also secure the drawstrings on items like hoodies, track pants and gym shorts so that they do not get pulled out during washing and drying.

, It is a warm soak and gentle agitation followed by a cold water rinse.

, Put a capful of detergent in the machine for a large load, or as directed by the detergent instructions and then close the lid to begin washing.


Try to fill the machine about 3/4 of the way to the top. Allow room for clothes to agitate during the wash cycle.
Distribute laundry weight evenly (if a top loading washer). A heavy blanket or coat may unbalance the washing drum. You may have to balance the load by with other items on the other side. Be careful of small, heavy items that may cause this problem.

, You will have between 35-45 minutes to just hang out and make sure no one takes your laundry out of the machine. Don't leave your laundry defenseless--thieves steal from laundry rooms routinely. Do your homework.

, Two laundry loads will usually equal one dryer load. Do not overfill as this will cause the drying to take much longer. It is better to use two dryers for 30-40 minutes than one for 90 minutes.


Whites such as cotton T-shirts, sheets and towels will usually take a normal/high setting,
Darks will usually be on a medium setting. You can use a higher setting if you're washing lots of dark cottons.
Fine washables should be either air-dried, line-dried, or dried on the lowest setting available. If in doubt, dry at a lower setting or air-dry if possible as shrinking of clothes usually happens in the dryer.

, Wipe off any lint present (it should come off easily) and throw it into the recycling bin. Return the lint trap back to its place.

, These give a fresher smell to your clothes and prevent static electricity between garments.

, Choose your settings for the dryer (heavy, normal, light)

, Get comfortable as you may have between 30-60 minutes to chill and wait for your clothes. Do more homework.

, This may mean either putting them on hangers or folding appropriately. Folding pants and shorts right away will reduce the bulk you will have to carry back up. If you fold jeans and slacks the way you would want them pressed (flat front or with a crease down the middle of the front) directly out of the dryer then they will likely not need to be ironed later (depending on the fabric composition).

, Make sure you didn't forget any socks, loose change, or other small items in the machine.

, Put them away and then bask in the glory of fresh clean laundry.

, The American Medical College Application Service and American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service are centralized application processing services available to students applying to their first year of medical school. The good news is, no matter how many medical schools you apply to, you only have to submit one online application. The less good news is that the process can be a bit overwhelming, so it's best to begin by reading the thorough instruction manual (85 pages at last count)so you know what to expect.

, Applying to medical school is a multistage process, so start early so that you can collect and record accurate information and devote time to your admissions essay.

Biographic information. Here is the place where you will record information that includes citizenship status, family make-up and relationships, military service and criminal background.

Course Work. Students have identified this as the most difficult section to complete. The best way to go about it is to request transcripts from every school you attended after high school and use those transcripts to enter detailed information about all the classes you have taken.

Work and Activities. You have the opportunity to enter information about your work experience, extracurricular activities, awards, honors, or publications in this section. You are limited to 15 entries, so choose wisely and know that some of the things you list you will designate as your “most meaningful” experiences.

Register for the MCAT.,
Study for the MCAT.,
Take the exam.",How to Get Into Medical School3," The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is designed to determine how well you have mastered basic concepts in biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, psychology, sociology, and biochemistry along with your ability to solve problems and think critically.


The test is offered multiple times throughout the year from January to September. Registration opens in October for all the winter and spring test sessions, registration for summer and fall opens in February.
The test is broken into four sections: Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems; Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems; Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior; and Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills.Register online using via your AAMC account. The registration fee for the MCAT exam is $305; this covers the cost of the exam and distribution of your scores. Additional fees are may be given for late registration, changes to your registration, and testing at international test sites.View the calendar on the AAMC website for a list of registration, late registration and exam dates.

, The MCAT is a challenging exam with a total content test time of four hours and five minutes. You'll perform better and feel more confident if you start studying early and prepare thoroughly.


Take a class. Choose a professionally designed MCAT course such as Princeton Review or Kaplan to give you an overview of the exam, tools, and practice you will need to earn the best possible score.

Be sure the class is led by a highly qualified instructor and is kept small so you can receive one-on-one help.


Join a class that meets a few months before your exam date. By doing so, you can take what you learned in the class and spend time on your own reviewing and reinforcing the material.
Hire a tutor. Some students who have received high scores themselves on the MCAT exam offer themselves as tutors for those who plan to take the test. They can help assess your abilities and determine and help correct any areas of weakness.
Take practice exams. It is one thing to know the kinds of questions that will be on the test, but it is another to try answering those questions following the real test format and timing guidelines. Working with practice exams is great preparation--both academically and mentally-- for test day. Practice questions and tests are widely held as the most crucial part of exam training. As your test day approaches, shift your efforts to completing more questions.

The AAMC website offers practice exams or you can but test prep books with sample tests or find practice exams online.
Take a proctored exam with other students. This will give you an accurate sense of what the testing environment will be like so you will know how much focus you will need to perform well in a room filled with other students.
Some MCAT classes include practice testing, so if you plan to take a class, look for one that offers that feature.



, Anxiety is common when facing this important exam, but knowing what to expect and being ready will help put some of your fears to rest.


Check in at least 30 minutes prior to your appointment time for the exam admission. Your ID will be verified and you will be given a key and a locker for your personal items, a copy of the admissions procedures and a seat assignment.
Be prepared for security. A digital image of your fingerprint will be taken and you will be scanned with a metal detector wand when you enter (and every time you re-enter) the room. The only things you may bring with you into the room are your ID and a pair of earplugs (sealed and inspected by the test center administrator). You may be asked to turn your pockets inside out to show that they are empty. Your photo ID must be visible on your desk at all times.Dress comfortably. It is difficult to predict how warm or cool a room will be, so it might make sense to dress in layers. However, if you need to remove an article of clothing, you will have to put it in your locker and the clock will not stop for you to do so. Hats and headscarves are not allowed (unless for religious purposes), and if you are wearing a hoodie, the hood must stay down at all times; it cannot be pulled up onto your head.

Complete your application.,
Get your letters of evaluation.,
Mind the timeline.,
Wait for a response.",How to Get Into Medical School4," Medical school is a huge commitment of time, money, and effort. Be sure to pick the one that best suits your career goals.


Consider your chance of acceptance. You can use online tools that allow you to enter your MCAT score and GPA into a database that will then compare your scores with the average from each medical school in the country and give you a sense of how competitive you are. This may be an example of building a list of schools you might want to consider.
Find the balance between being realistic and aiming high. Top 10 medical schools receive thousands of applicants and send out almost as many rejections. Pick a range of schools to apply to--one or two ""reach"" schools (ones you may not get into) as well as schools whose average MCAT scores and GPAs are in line with your own plus a ""safety"" school (one you feel certain you'd be accepted to). Many American students apply to medical schools in Caribbean countries as part of their ""safety"" school strategy.
Talk to alumni. If you really want to know about a school from a student's point of view, talk to a student who has been there. Seek out people who attended the schools you are interested in and ask them about the coursework and faculty as well as about social life.
Consider cost. Medical school is expensive, so you have to look at cost when you are deciding where to apply. If you are interested in a school that you cannot quite afford, find out about scholarship opportunities. If cost is a major consideration, focus your search on state schools, as they are generally less expensive than private schools.
Most students have to take out loans to finance their med school education. It takes a number of years to establish yourself as a physician and to be able to pay back your loans. Try not to overburden yourself financially if possible. You do not want your debt to cause extreme stress or to find that it will later limit your career options.
Think about location. Medical school is grueling and it will not leave you much time for family and friends, but you should still ask yourself how far away you want to be from your support system. Think, too, about what kind of setting you like (small town or big city), whom else you might know at school, and how easy it is for you to make friends.

, Chances are, you will be able to create just one application via AMCAS or AACOMAS that will be accepted by all of the schools you are interested in. Keep in mind that not every school in the United States uses AMCAS, osteopathic medical schools use a similar service known as AACOMAS, so if you're applying to a school with a different application process, find out what's required. Information about all sections of the application mentioned above. In particular, keep these ""must-dos"" in mind:


Make sure there is an MCAT score on your application
Provide complete information about your coursework via transcripts from all post-secondary educational institutions.
Notify AMCAS of all the letters of evaluation you are expecting to have and what schools they should be sent to.

, There are a number of costs associated with getting into medical school. Keep these in mind upfront so that you can set aside the money you'll need to complete this process.


The most significant fees are those related to your medical school application itself. For the 2016 AMCAS application, the processing fee is $160 (includes one school) and $37 for each additional school. Most medical schools require a secondary application, the cost of which usually ranges from $0 to $150, but can be greater. Some schools will waive the secondary application cost if you qualify for the fee assistance program. There may be a small fee from your college registrar for your transcripts and occasionally schools charge a a fee for the transmittal of letters of recommendation.Include travel costs. If you visit different medical schools as part of your decision-making process, you will have to put out money for gas, airfare, lodging, and food.

, It will take several hours to complete your application. You can choose to do it all in one sitting or break it up into small chunks, perhaps completing a couple of sections at a time.


The basic information of the application is straightforward. Have all the information you may need to complete the first three sections that focus on basic, identifying information.
Invest time in your essay. Your essay is essentially your opportunity to speak directly to the admissions officers who will be reviewing your application. What is most important is that you discuss what attracted you to the field of medicine and how you plan to use your degree to help others.

Avoid taking a philosophical or overly creative approach to your essay and avoid talking about information that has already been covered somewhere else in your application or overfill it with details in the hopes of impressing. This is meant to be your personal statement, so focus on the ""personal"" aspect and give readers some insight into who you are and your career goals.



, Ask professors with whom you've developed a relationship or community or group leaders or employers with whom you've worked to write a letter that speaks to how well suited you are for a career in medicine and positively predicts your success as a doctor.

, The deadline for medical school application submissions differs from school to school with some asking for information a year ahead of the expected admissions date. That means you should be working on your application at least 18 months in advance of your desired enrollment date. If you are interested in Early Decision, the dates could be even sooner, so get to work on your application materials junior year.

, Turnaround time for acceptance notification can range from a few days to several weeks. While it's definitely nerve-wracking to be waiting for news, try to stay focus on your studies and avoid making any alternate plans until you've gotten all of your responses.


Do not allow your grades to drop during this time. Medical schools look for upward trends in GPAs so crashing and burning your senior year will only hurt your future chances.
If you don't get accepted to the school you wanted, there are things you can do to make yourself a desirable candidate in the future or other career paths you could follow.

Retake the MCATs. You can take them three times in a calendar year), working for a year or two before reapplying or attending graduate school.
Take time off. The average age a student entering medical school is now 24, with a considerable number of students applying later. Not only do medical schools appreciate mature applicants who learned from their mistakes, but if you take time off you will have more time to prepare a more competitive application.Consider osteopathic schools. Look into pursing a D.O. instead of an M.D. This field is less crowded but still has high standards. According to the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, in 2010 the average entering osteopathic student had a 3.47 GPA."

Wear more shirts with collars.,
Move on from the sweatshirt to the sweater.,
Upgrade your denim.,
Get a pair of nicer pants.,
Take pride in your footwear.",How to Dress Classy for a New College Guy2," You don’t have to ditch all your t-shirts, but consider polos and other collared shirts when trying to look classier.


The polo can be troublesome due to trends of overly bright primary colored polos, popped collars, and shapeless cuts. But a well-fitting polo with a more muted color or sparse pattern can actually feel a lot like your t-shirt.
Cotton, knit, and woven button down shirts are a staple as well. This type of shirt has many uses and pairs well with plenty of clothes. Add a tie if you feel like dressing up or are meeting with someone. Then take the tie off and throw on a sweater before meeting up for a study date.

, Your university sweatshirt is great for showing school spirit at sporting events. But upgrade to the sweater for a classier look. Cardigans are perfect for adding a nice layer to your top. Button it up over your button-down when it’s time to get down to business or wear it open over a t-shirt on the weekend when hanging out with your friends.
Crewneck sweaters are a great alternative if you’re missing your sweatshirts. Not all, but many crewnecks will be thinner and more form fitting.
Shawl collars are a great way to dress up your look without having to wear a collared shirt underneath.
Generally, darker sweaters are considered more formal and lighter colors more casual.

, When it comes to dressing well, your denim shouldn’t be conspicuous. Light colored denim or jeans with holes and rips will quickly draw attention to the wrong areas of your body. A pair of dark denim jeans works just as well with a blazer and dress shoes as with sneakers and a t-shirt.


Dark denim which fits you well and shows off your legs without drawing too much attention can be the most valuable item in your wardrobe.
Many workplaces allow employees to wear clean dark jeans as part of the workday uniform.
Mid-rise jeans will help you to look proportional and give your legs a longer, slimmer look.
Skinny jeans or really baggy jeans can also draw the wrong kind of attention to your legs. A slim straight cut is universal, whether it’s time to be professional, or let loose with your friends on the weekend.
Invest in a pair of jeans that fit you well and don’t lean toward one style trend too much. A slim straight cut will always be in style and give you the most versatility.
A dark pair of jeans is also very versatile as the dark blue will pair with most colors from black to brown.
In addition to dark denim, black or gray jeans are also good colors as these pair with a lot of colors too.

, A reliable pair of jeans is great, but sometimes an occasion calls for something else. Having a variety of options is useful for when you feel like changing your look or you need to dress it up for an occasion.


Chinos, wool pants, and even flannel (not pajama pants) can give you a classy upgrade to your style. These pants also provide you with a whole new combination of looks to build.
Like with jeans, grab a pair that has a high enough rise so the pants sit around your waist. A higher rise will make your legs look longer and give you a well put together appearance.
If you’re on the taller side with long legs, you can get a lower rise to help proportion your body. The overall goal is to have roughly a 1:1 ratio of top and bottom.
When choosing a pair of dressier pants notice if the pants are pleated. Pleats are the folds of fabrics in the front of the pants. Pleated pants can offer more movement than flat front pants, but aren’t always in style. However, a well fitting pair might take you from casual to classy.

, You probably do a fair amount of walking most days going from classes to activities around campus. While canvas sneakers go with most looks, upgrade your footwear to something more supportive and stylish. Casual leather shoes like loafers add class and can be quite comfortable. You don’t have to shell out a lot of money for a pair either. Sites like www.asos.com have a great selection of varying prices. Suede and nubuck loafers are a great staple that pair with anything from a suit to a sweater and shorts.
Oxfords are a classic and perfect for when it’s time to get down to business. Simple black Oxfords can be worn at your internship, a job interview, or on a date.
Brogues are a similar type of shoe to the Oxford but have a punch hole design which adds a smart looking touch. A brown pair of Brogues is a great alternative to black Oxfords. These shoes pair well with any pant from dark denim to tan chinos.
Lace-up boots, Chukkas, Desert Boots, and the like are great when you need something stylish in more severe weather. A good pair of boots is a classic look that adds more class to any outfit. Be careful and get a pair that go well with your pants. If your boots are too high and bulky for your slim pants your feet will look big and clunky.
Sneakers go through a rotation of being in and out of vogue. But solid colored sneakers made of canvas or leather will give you a casual, vintage edge to your look. White sneakers have risen in popularity because you can wear a pair with just about anything. For the most part, you don’t want a pair that’s ripped up or extremely dirty. And your skate shoes from high school aren’t the same as a nice pair of Converse, Nike, New Balance, or Vans if you want to retain some of that old school skate look.

Add more pieces to your wardrobe over time.,
Leave sweats for the gym.,
Dress for the career you want.,
Get two belts.,
Plan your outfits.",How to Dress Classy for a New College Guy3," Build out your options with items that reflect your personal style. After you have some staples you can begin to add with more clothing and accessories that fit your style. Don’t waste money or time on items that you don’t like and donate your old clothes when you get new ones.


If you like a more preppy look, and wear more button-downs, add a tie to your wardrobe.
While a clean pair of sneakers is great for pairing with sweaters, button-downs, and even a blazer, consider ditching your old dirty pair. Or, upgrade your shoes to casual leather loafers or a pair of brown dress shoes.
If you’re always running late to class it might be time to accessorize with a watch. Not only will it keep you punctual, but it adds a bit of class to your look.

, Dressing classy as a college guy means putting in the effort to look put together, even at that 8:00 am class. Sweatpants and a zipped-up hoodie should be worn at home or the gym.


If you love your sweats or the athletic look, you can class it up with little effort. Invest in a pair of joggers or slim structured sweatpants which taper around the ankle. Swap your worn out zip-up hoodie for a solid-colored crew neck sweatshirt or sweater.
You can also play with layers. Wear your sweatshirt over a collared shirt.

, Dressing well will make you feel good, keep your mind sharp, and give you confidence. So dress for the job you want to give you a head start.


If you plan on going into a career that is more traditional you will probably be wearing a suit or an outfit that’s close at the office. Invest in a suit and some dress shirts. Being prepared will not only help you think like a man with the job but could benefit you with potential interviews and even your professors.
Shower before class and think about how your professors see you. When it’s time to start networking and looking for work these are some people who you may need help from. Wearing a polo instead of a t-shirt and nice jeans or chinos instead of sweats shows you’re responsible and respectful.

, You can really class up your style with two leather belts. You don’t need to spend a lot of money either, but one brown and one black leather belt should be all you need. Depending on your personal style, feel free to get more belts that go well with a certain season or occasion. A colored leather belt can be a statement piece when you’re going for a casual look.
Formal belts should be about 2.5 – 3.5cm wide and be understated and match your shoes.

, Planning what you’ll wear the next day will not only help you prepare to look your best, but it will give you a sense of anything missing from your wardrobe.


Before going to bed pick out your outfit for the next day.
Remember to match your belt to your shoes.
Add layers when you can.
Planning out your outfit will help you to look put together. You won’t have to worry about it when you wake up in the morning.

Think of the possible options.,
Set a budget.,
Think about the advantages and disadvantages of each option.,
Consider all the costs.,
Get into details.,
Consider whether you want roommates, and if so, how many.",How to Decide Whether to Live on or Off Campus1," Consider on-campus housing opportunities like dorms, co-ops, fraternity or sorority houses, or university-owned apartments. Know whether you're guaranteed on-campus housing and what kinds of housing are available to you on campus. Then consider off-campus housing like a rented apartment, house, or room. Make a list of these options so that you can consider them further.;
, Know how much money you can afford to spend on housing. When creating a budget, consider the costs of food, laundry, and furniture as well as the cost of the housing itself.

, For example, living with your family at home, if you go to school locally, will allow you to benefit from Mom's cooking, but you'll miss out on some of the campus experience. A dorm will be right on campus so your commute to class will be almost nothing, but you won't have very much space, you'll likely have to share with a roommate, and the atmosphere can feel stifling. Living off campus will allow you much more freedom and independence, but you'll have a much longer commute to class, you'll have to cook for yourself, and you'll be farther away from your friends.


Make a list of the pros and cons of each option, taking into account important factors like cost, commute, meal plans, and proximity to friends.

, Which would cost you less? Driving from home costs gas money. But dorms also usually provide extra services a student needs like Internet, utility costs, and some other things. In an apartment things like this can also be included in the lease, or not. But you might be able to pay for these things in apartment yourself and have it ending up cheaper than the dorm.

, How far is your house from college, and is there a lot of traffic on the way? What does the dorm provide, and is best for your wallet? Look for apartments around the area, and look at what the landlord wants for rent.

, When renting a house or apartment off campus, sharing it with others can drastically reduce the cost. If living on campus, you'll almost definitely have to share a room with at least one other person. If you get along with your roommates, they can make your life much easier and more fun, but living with roommates you don't like can make every day a fight. Talk to friends or meet other people you'd be interested in living with.

Before making a solid decision, inspect your chosen house to make sure everything seems right.,
Listen to warning signs and trust your gut.,
Sign that lease or agreement!",How to Decide Whether to Live on or Off Campus2," Look for signs of damage (flooding, cracks), make sure you understand any renting policies, have the correct lease (everything landlord said is on it), know about traffic and transportation options, and make sure the locks work. Make sure you're on the same page with your roommates about your housing situation, and that you're all looking forward to living together.

, If you're not sure about an apartment or about an individual you might be living with, ask yourself why. This place will be your home, so you want to be comfortable and safe. Make sure you're choosing the right option for that, all constraints considered.

, When you find the option that has what you need, in your budget, that is close to campus as possible, go for it!

Discuss the cleaning schedule.,
Develop a plan to handle visitors.,
Discuss your phone policy.,
Determine a lights out time.,
Sign a roommate agreement.",How to Deal With College Roommate Problems1," You and your roommate probably have different ideas about what is considered clean and neat. This can be a major area of conflict. Make a chore schedule and determine who will do what and how often. For example, you two may designate Sunday afternoons as your cleaning day. Choose a time that works with both of your schedules. Responsibilities you may consider include:Taking out the trash
Sweeping the floor
Cleaning out the mini fridge
Washing the sink
Straightening up the room
Washing dishes;
, Talk about how you will handle friends coming over and intimate visitors. Conflicts are more likely to occur when it involves an intimate partner. Set up a system that both people are comfortable with.What is the time limit for guests?
Can intimate visitors spend the night?
How will you notify the other person that you need privacy (e.g. rubber band on the door knob, a symbol on your name tag, a certain color of paper on the door)?

, You will probably talk on the phone and video chat with your friends and family while you are away at school. Are these conversations private? Should these conversations take place in the room or outside the room?Consider having different rules for daytime talking and nighttime talking.
You may say talking in the room is fine as long as the other person isn’t studying.

, You and your roommate probably do not go to bed at the same time. You may prefer a 9:30 pm bedtime while your roommate doesn’t go to sleep until 2:00 am. To compromise, set up a time when the lights have to be out. During this time, headphones should be used to watch movies and listen to music and a personal light should be used for reading instead of using the overhead lights.For example, a fair compromise between a 9:30 pm bed time and a 2:00 am bed time may be to turn the lights out at 11:00 pm.
You may set a different time for weekdays and weekends.

, Once you have developed ground rules for common situations, write them down and sign them. This will keep both of you accountable. If you someone is not holding up their end of the bargain, you can use the agreement as a starting point for the conversation.


You will have to compromise to come to an agreement. Both of you should get some of the things you want, but things may not be exactly how you want them to be.Be sure that both you and your roommate are comfortable with the terms of the agreement.
You may have to modify and change some of the agreement as the school year goes on.

Choose the right time.,
Talk in person.,
Focus directly on one problem.,
Listen to your roommate.,
Communicate with your roommate.,
Develop a solution together.",How to Deal With College Roommate Problems2," Do not go to your roommate when you are super annoyed and irritated. You may say something that you regret. Also, if your roommate is studying or getting ready to leave the room, wait to have the conversation.The conversation will not go well if your roommate feels like they are being ambushed.
If you are not sure of a good time to speak with your roommate, you may ask or send a text that says, “Hey, when are you going to be around? I wanted to have a chat about something.”

, An in-person conversation is much better than texting or venting on social media. It is easy to misinterpret what someone has said when you are only reading their words. You do not see any of their body language or facial expressions. People also will say things over text that they would not say to your face.Posting how you feel on social media often makes things worse. Imagine how you would feel if your roommate tweeted about how messy you were or that you snore all night long.
Not posting on social media also keeps other people from interfering in your roommate problems as well.

, This could be studying or talking on the phone with all the lights on while you're trying to sleep, using all the hot water in the shower, or not cleaning up. Try to talk to your roommate about this one big issue, and offer a suggestion for how to make it better. Allow your roommate to disagree/agree with your suggestion until you work out a solution.


If you try to discuss too many issues at once, your roommate may feel like you are attacking them.
Talk about the behavior not the person.You may say, “It’s hard for me to sleep when you talk on the phone late at night,” instead of “You’re rude and disrespectful when you talk on the phone at night.”
Focus on the behavior and how it makes you feel. Your roommate may not even realize how their behavior affects you., Once you have told your roommate the problem and how you feel, allow them to speak. Your roommate has a different perspective than you and may say something that you have not even considered. When you listen, ask yourself what you would do if the situation was reversed.After you have spoken, you may say, “What do you think?” or “How do you feel about the situation?”
When your roommate speaks, do not interrupt.

, Spend time getting to know your roommate. Talk to your roommate about their likes and dislikes,what they did in high school, and what they are looking forward to in college.You are going to be living in tight quarters with this person for the whole year. It is worth the effort to get to know them.

#*Are you a morning person or a night person?

How will you handle boyfriends/girlfriends? How long can they stay?
Do you want to share food, clothes, and/or school supplies?
Do you sleep with the TV on or with music?
Do you sleep with the lights on?
Are you super neat or are you messy?

, Once you and your roommate have had a chance to speak, it is time to come up with a solution to the problem. If it something that has already been covered in the roommate agreement, the solution is simple. If it is a different situation, you will have to negotiate something that works for both of you.For example, maybe your roommate has a new partner that spends a lot of time in your room, but you need quiet time to study. The solution may be to have designated days the partner can come over, and you agree to study at the library 2 nights a week so they can have privacy.
Both of you make a compromise to get something that you want. Your roommate gets private time and you have designated days that you can study in your room.
Ask your roommate, “What do you think we should do?” or “How can we fix this together?”

Try to keep an open mind.,
Talk to your Resident Advisor.,
Talk to your friends.,
Spend time elsewhere.,
Request a room change.",How to Deal With College Roommate Problems3," You and your roommate might not have much in common, but that does not mean that you cannot be friends. Work on trying to appreciate your roommate's differences and enjoy the experience of getting to learn some new things while living with him or her.

For example, your roommate might be a fan of a sport you have never taken an interest in, a type of music that you don't enjoy, or a hobby that you have never even heard of. While your roommate's engagement with these interests might get on your nerves from time to time, remind yourself that learning about these new things is something that not everyone gets to do. Try to be grateful for the experience.
It might also be helpful to remind yourself that living with a roommate is a temporary situation, but it can lead to a life-long friendship.

, If talking to your roommate doesn't work, try talking to your Resident Advisor (RA), Resident Assistant, or Resident Director.Your resident advisor can help you deal with the situation or help mediate the situation between you and your roommate.


See your Resident Advisor immediately if your roommate is engaging in unsafe behaviors such as binge drinking, illegal drug use, self-harm, or an eating disorder.If your roommate is breaking the dorm rules by drinking alcohol or doing drugs in your room, you can get in trouble too. It’s best to let your RA know instead of handling this issue on your own.

, It is likely that other people at your school are having problems with roommates too. This can be a great way to bond with friends, and to make more friends. Socializing with people who share similar problems is a great way to learn more about yourself and take advantage of all the benefits of college..


Talk to your roommate about the problem before you tell a friend. Your roommate will be very upset of they find out you were talking about them behind their back.This can actually make your problems worse.
A friend may have a suggestion that you have not thought of.
If you are looking for a new roommate, one of these friends might need a new one too

, You may be stuck with a roommate that you just can’t get along with. Consider spending more time in the library, coffee shop , or with other friends instead of in the room. If you spend less time with your roommate you may gain peace of mind and calm down by removing yourself from the situation.


Your school may not allow you to change rooms. This is not an ideal situation, but sometimes it is the only solution.
Remember that your roommate situation is temporary, and you just have to make it to the end of the school year.

, Some situations cannot be fixed. If you have tried talking to your roommate, compromising, and working with your RA, it may be time to request a room transfer. Room transfers are typically a last resort after all other methods have failed.Each school has a different process and criteria for a room change. Check with your RA or the Office of Residence Life to get the details.

Protect your belongings.",How to Create Privacy in a College Dorm1," If you want privacy in a room that you share with others, you have to establish ground rules so everyone knows what to expect. For example, you might discuss what the policy for having visitors in the room is with your roommates and whether overnight guests are acceptable. It’s also a good idea to discuss whether you can borrow each other things, such as clothing and computers.Be honest with your roommates about the type of privacy that you need to be comfortable, and be sure to listen to the boundaries that your roommates require. Everyone should feel at home in the room.
If you’ve just met your roommates, it may be hard to bring up the topic of privacy and room boundaries with them. You might say, “I’m excited to live with you and get to know you, but my privacy is very important to me. Do you think we could talk about how we’re going to handle that in the room?”
When it comes to having overnight visitors in the room, you and your roommates might agree that they’re allowed as long as you inform each other ahead of time.
If you are willing to allow each other to borrow items from one another, it’s usually best to agree that you must get permission first.;
, If you want to have private time in your dorm room, it helps to discuss each other's schedules with your roommates. You’ll want to know when they’ll be at class or work, and they’ll probably want to known the same about you. That way, if you need some time alone, you’ll know when the room will be free.If you and your roommates are usually out of the room at the same time for classes, work, and other activities, you may want to create a schedule that allows you each to have some alone time in the room each week. For example, you might agree to go to the library for a couple of hours on Monday evenings so your roommate gets the room, while they agree to head to the gym for a workout on Wednesday nights so you can have some alone time.
You may also want to discuss whether you and your roommates tend to stay up late or wake up early so you can be respectful of one another’s schedule.

, Hopefully, you’ll be able to trust your roommates so you don’t have to worry about your things. But if you’ve only just met them, you may not be sure that they’ll respect your privacy. That’s why you should make sure to enable passwords on your phone, computer, tablet, and any other electronic devices that you keep in the room. If you have other items, such as clothing, jewelry, or books, that you don’t want them to have access to either, you may want to invest in a trunk or footlocker that you can lock.Make sure that you don’t share your electronic passwords with anyone. Don’t write them down on papers that you keep in the room either.
If you have a trunk or footlocker with a lock, keep the key in your wallet or book bag so you know it’s always with you.

Stop by your local music store and pick out some CDs that remind you of your ex-roommate.,
Try eating your ex-roommate's favorite foods.,
Wear clothing that reminds you of your ex-roommate.,
Buy the fragrance that your ex-roommate wears.,
Adopt a new mantra.,
Accept that he/she is now your ex-roommate.,
Get in touch!",How to Cope with Missing Your Ex Roommate," You could try paint-by-numbers or maybe learn a foreign language. Do anything to take your mind off the fact that your ex-roommate is no longer your current roommate.;
, It just isn't worth it. If you're sitting on your roommate's Facebook page and hitting refresh over and over then you are not accepting the fact that he is now your ex-roommate, which only exacerbates the pain of missing him.

, This will be something to remember her by, but not something over which you should obsess. Preferably the photo should be black and white because the absence of color will distance you from the memory of your ex-roommate, making it easier to let go.

, If your ex-roommate liked rap music, try a Milli Vanilli album. Maybe he/she liked alternative music: you can't go wrong with an Avril Lavigne CD!

, It might be nice to taste a spicy pad Thai and to know that it is one of your ex-roommate's favorite flavors in the world. It might even be nice to try to imagine what thoughts go through your ex-roommate's head when he/she eats this food.

, Maybe you have a cardigan that your ex-roommate took one time without asking and he/she stained it but you were okay with it. Why not put it on and remember the good old days?

, Smells can bring back so many intense memories, it's truly amazing. Buy your ex-roommate's fragrance and spray it around your room when you miss her. This will make you feel closer to him/her. If you don't know what scent he or she wore, just smell them all at a store that carries a variety of fragrances, such as Sephora.

, Try to repeat to yourself something like, ""is gone now. We had a nice time, but it's over. Shape up."" Tough love is the name of the game, but you don't want to be too hard on yourself. Your mantra can be whatever works best for you, so long as it gets the point across that your roommate is now your ex-roommate!

, Things are probably better this way. Chances are your ex-roommate has moved on, and it is time that you do so too. Living in the past impedes your future happiness.

, Just because they are no longer your roommate doesn't mean you can't hang out any more. Go to that new movie, or bowling, or have him/her come meet your new roommate.

Don't be afraid to rearrange.",How to Decorate a Dorm," Before you start buying or crafting new items for your dorm room, it's a good idea to have a theme in mind. You will be working with a neutral backdrop, so your accessories will bring all of the color into the room. Make sure your color choices represent your personality and the mood you want to create in your room.For a monochromatic but balanced color palette, choose three or four different shades from the same color family.
If you want accent colors, choose one or two colors from a different color family. You can look at a color wheel and choose colors that are across from your primary colors. You can also use the accent colors in your bedding or other fabrics for inspiration.;
, Your bedspread is often the biggest part of your decor you have control over. Find a pattern or color you like and will not grow out of in a few months.Consider a few different layers of bedding to add visual interest and provide optimal comfort in different seasons.
Don't forget fun, coordinating throw pillows for some added comfort and style. You can put matching pillows on your chairs as well.
Be sure to check with your college to find out if the beds are regular length or extra long.

, A throw rug is the perfect way to add some color to your drab dorm room floor, and to add warmth and comfort to your room. Throw rugs are available in a wide variety of sizes, colors, and styles., Curtains are the perfect way to dress up bare windows, and they're yet another way to add some much needed color to your room.To avoid putting holes in the walls, use a tension rod to hang your curtains or get creative by using adhesive hooks to support the curtain rod.If you're on a budget, consider using shower curtains or buying bundles of fabric and sewing them yourself.
You can also buy inexpensive plain white curtains and dress them up yourself by dying them, stenciling them, or decorating them with ribbon.
Consider functionality as well. Blackout curtains will keep your room dark and will help keep the warmth in on cold winter nights. Sheer curtains will provide privacy but still allow light to filter into your room.

, You may not be able to paint or hang traditional wallpaper in your dorm room, but you still have a lot of options for decorating your walls. Stick-on wall decals are available in a huge variety of styles, and they peel right off of your wall in seconds when it's time to move out. Whether you want to cover an entire wall with a geometric pattern or you want to dress up a wall with an image of your favorite animal or sport, you can find a decal or temporary wallpaper that's right for you.A super cheap alternative to buying decals is to make some yourself using construction paper. Consider cutting out lots of colorful circles and sticking them to your walls with double-sided tape for a fun confetti look., If you love colorful geometric patterns and are willing to spend a bit of time on a project, you can create a true masterpiece on your walls with colorful washi tape. Just stick it on in whatever pattern you please and peel it off when the school year is over.You can use washi tape on more than just walls! Consider using it on doors, floors, and furniture as well.

, Nothing personalizes a space more than photos and artwork, and there are so many different ways you can incorporate these items into your room design. Get creative with arranging your pictures in a way that expresses your individual personality.Create a gallery wall by taping a group of pictures to the wall, either in a grid pattern in a more random arrangement. You can also hang rows of string or wire from your walls and attach your picture to them with clips.
If you have one or two photos that you really love, think about having them blown up to poster size.
Display your own artwork by hanging clipboards from the wall. This makes it super easy to switch up the pieces you have on display.
Store-bought artwork is also an option. Visit thrift shops for great deals.

, Plants add so much cheer to a room, so consider incorporating a few into your design. As an added bonus, they also purify the air.You can display them in decorative pots on the floor or on your desk. If there's no space for that, you could consider buying hanging planters.If you feel like doing a DIY project, attach pipe straps to a piece of wood to hang mason jars as planters. You can decorate the wood in any way you like.Make sure you have enough light to keep your plants alive. Putting them near the window is your best bet.
Remember that you will need to water your plants regularly in order to keep them healthy.
If live plants aren't for you, artificial plants can look just as good and are totally maintenance free!

, Versatility is key in a small space, so always look for pieces that serve multiple purposes. For example, cube ottomans can be used for both seating and storage. You may also be able to find a bedside table that has a drawer you can use for clothing., If your dorm room is dark and dreary, it's easy to brighten it up with some additional lighting. Look for desk lamps and floor lamps that go with the theme of your room.Paper lanterns and string lights are also fun ways to add some extra mood lighting.If you have a boring lamp shade, dress it up by stenciling it or gluing some decorative ribbon to it.

, If you have clothing items that you really love, you can use them to decorate your space. Just hang some adhesive hooks on your wall or buy a small display shelf. This will keep you organized and make your room look awesome.This works especially well for things like shoes, scarves, bags, and hats.

, Every dorm room needs a message board of some sort! It will help keep you organized and give your friends a handy spot to leave you notes. Depending on your needs, you may opt for a cork board, a magnet board, a chalk board, a whiteboard, or some combination of these.For a cheap magnet board, hang cookie sheets on your wall with adhesive tape. If you can't find colorful ones, consider spray painting them to match your decor.Chalk paint can turn any surface into a message board, from a table top to a piece of scrap lumber that you can hang on the wall.

, You'll need to cram a lot into a small space, so storage bins and baskets will come in super handy. Choose decorative storage containers that match your decor. There are plenty of designs to choose, from wicker baskets to neon-colored plastic bins and patterned fabric containers., You can store a ton of stuff under your bed, which helps you control your clutter and keep your room looking great. If you don't have enough height, buy some bed risers to lift your bed a little higher.Invest in under-the-bed storage containers to keep your storage area neat and tidy.Get an extra-long bed skirt if you want to keep your storage out of view.

, It may not sound like a lot of fun, but keeping your closet organized will help you keep your room neat and tidy, and it will make it so much easier to find the things you're looking for!


Consider buying hanging closet organizers. The smaller ones are great for storing shoes, while the larger ones give you a place to store folded sweaters and jeans.Slim velvet hangers are great space savers for small closets.
Take advantage of any space you have at the top of your closet too. You may be able to stash storage bins up there for off-season clothing or other items that you don't use every day.

, Most dorms have strict rules about hanging decorations with nails and painting the walls, among other things. Always check the rules and regulations before you do anything that might be a violation.


Adhesive strips and hooks make it possible to hang nearly anything on your walls without leaving a mark, so don't feel that you are limited in your design options!
Some dorms may also prohibit you from hanging anything from the ceiling, even if it doesn't create a hole.
Most dorm rooms do not allow you to burn candles or incense, so look for fire-free ways to add a nice scent to your room, like oil diffusers.
Fire codes may also limit what you are allowed to hang on your door., If you'll be sharing your room with one or more other students, it's a good idea to start talking to them as soon as possible to determine what each of you is bringing. You can coordinate so that each of you brings one or two large items that will be available for everyone to use.


It also helps to talk to your roommates about likes, dislikes, and color preferences. If you come up with a design plan together, your room will look much more cohesive.Be sure to talk about practical things like dorm fridges, microwaves, and televisions, in addition to decor items.
Go shopping for new items with your roommates if possible. This will be a great way to get to know each other while decorating your room.

, It helps a lot to know exactly how much space you will have to deal with before you start buying items to decorate your room with. If possible, visit the dorm rooms yourself and take measurements of everything (Including the existing furniture). If you can't do it yourself, call your college and see if they can provide you with measurements.


Remember that you can't fill every square inch of your floor space with furniture. When deciding how much will really fit, be sure to take walking space into consideration.

, You do have to deal with the furniture that comes with your dorm room, but there's no reason you have to leave it in the same place! Feel free to move things around to create a space that works for you and your roommates.

Check the list of authors and the publication the paper appears in.,
Read the abstract.,
Skim the entire paper.,
Highlight words or phrases you don't understand.,
Read the paper.,
Draw your own conclusions.",How to Read a Scientific Paper," Generally, the publication should be a peer-reviewed journal with a good reputation. Find out who the authors are, where they work, and what other papers they've published. The less reputable the publication and authors, the more skeptically you should view the paper.;
, The abstract sums up the paper in 1 paragraph, explaining the purpose of the research, the results, and the conclusions of the researchers. The abstract allows you to determine whether the scientific paper is relevant to your own work, so you don't waste time on papers that aren't useful to you.

, Look at the major headings and glance at the figures and tables. Get an idea of how long the paper is and how many sections it's broken into.

, Scan the entire paper, line by line, marking words that you need to look up in a scientific or medical dictionary. Also look for phrases you don't understand. For example, you may understand the words ""control"" and ""group,"" but not know what the phrase ""control group"" means.

, Have a notebook handy to jot down questions that come to you as you read. When you're finished reading the paper, you may want to store your notes with it in case you go back to review it again later. Scientific papers generally include:


An introduction that gives the same information that's in the abstract, but in more detail. While the abstract helped you decide whether to read the paper, the introduction will tell you what to look for. It will also summarize previous research so you can see how the research described in the paper contributes to the field of study as a whole.
The methods section describes how the researchers investigated the question posed in the introduction. As you read about the methods, ask yourself if it seems likely that the methods produced useful outcomes and what those outcomes might be.
In the results section, researchers state the outcomes of their methods. Check them against what you guessed the results would be when you read about the methods. Some publications have space limitations that require the researchers to shorten their paper, so the results may be a part of the methods section.
In the discussion section, the researchers talk about what they learned from their research. This is often the most important part of the paper, because the researchers will interpret their results and discuss at length what they think their results mean to their field of study.

, Go back over your notes and see if all of your questions were answered. Ask yourself if you agree with the conclusions reached by the researchers. They may have made incorrect assumptions starting out, or the researchers may have had biases that caused them to use faulty methods in order to get the results they wanted.

Arrange the room for privacy.,
Set up a folding screen.,
Hang curtains.",How to Create Privacy in a College Dorm2," While dorm rooms usually aren’t very large, there are ways to arrange the furniture so you and your roommates each have some privacy. If you’re sharing the room with only one roommate, you can each take a side of the room to set up your space. If you’re sharing the room with three or four roommates, you can each take a corner of the room for your furniture.In a two person dorm room, you might use the room’s furniture to divide the space. Place the dressers, closets, or bookcases side by side in the center of the room, with yours facing your side of the room and your roommate’s facing theirs. That will create a barrier that gives you each a little more privacy.
Check to see if your school will loft your bed for you. By lofting your bed, you can create a space beneath that you can put your desk or create a seating area where you’ll have a little more privacy.
In a two person dorm room, having one person loft their bed and place their desk beneath it, and the other leave their bed on the floor, with their desk overlooking it, allows you to keep different sleeping and studying schedules without disturbing one another.

, When you may want a little more privacy than your dorm room’s layout allows, a folding screen is an ideal solution. You simply place it in front of your side of the room to give yourself some private time. Because it folds up, though, you don’t have to leave it out all the time, so you can still be social with your roommates when you’re in the mood.A folding screen works especially well if you’ve lofted your bed and created a study or sitting area beneath it. Open the screen in front of the area, and it’s almost as if you have your own private room.
You can find folding screens or room dividers at stores such as Target or Walmart. If you’re on a budget, you can even make your own with old shutters and hinges., Fabric can also work well as a room divider when you want privacy from your roommate(s). Most colleges won’t allow you to screw or bolt curtain rods and cables into the ceiling, though, so you should opt for a lightweight material for the curtains, such as cotton voile, organdy, or cotton gauze, that you can attach to the ceiling with easy to remove push pins.You can hang the fabric panels in the center of the room to completely divide the room, or just in certain areas, such as in front of the area under your lofted bed.
If you want to be able to open and close the fabric divider, use curtain tiebacks to gather the panels back when you open up the room.

Open a pop-up tent.,
Use a sleep mask.,
Wear noise-cancelling headphones.",How to Create Privacy in a College Dorm3," If you want privacy from time to time, a pop-up tent is great option for your dorm room. Unlike traditional camping tents that require stakes to assemble, these tents stand on their own so you can put it up anywhere in your room. When you want some private time, you only have to climb inside. The rest of the time, you can choose to leave the tent assembled -- or take it down, fold it up,and stash it under your bed.Some pop-up tents are designed to fit around a bed, so you can privacy when you’re sleeping or just sitting on your bed reading. Other pop-up tents are placed on the floor, so you can have private space anywhere in your dorm room.
The tents usually have zip-out windows that you can open when you feel like being more social or just need some air.

, If you and your roommates aren’t on the same schedule, a sleep mask is a must. These masks block out the light, so if your roommates are staying up to study or write a paper, you won't be disturbed. It’ll also help you sleep during the day if you’ve had to pull an all-nighter. By being able to sleep more flexible hours, you may be able to find a little more private time in the room too.Sleep masks come in a variety of materials, such as cotton and silk. Try some different options to see what’s most comfortable for you.
Some masks are infused with aromatherapy scents that can actually encourage sleep. If you have trouble sleeping while your roommate is working, it may help you fall asleep.
As a friendly gesture, you might want to purchase a sleep mask for your roommate so they can sleep around your schedule too.

, If you don’t want to listen to your roommate’s phone conversation or fights with their significant other, noise-cancelling headphones are the best way to give them so privacy. You can wear these headphones whenever you want to study or do work for class and not have to worry about being distracted by whatever your roommate is doing.Noise-isolating and noise-cancelling headphones are not the same. Noise-isolating headphone physically block out noise by creating a tight seal between your ear and the headphone to minimize the amount of noise that you hear. Noise-cancelling headphones may use a seal to help block noise, but they also electronically cancel out ambient sounds for more effective noise blocking.
It’s a good idea to try on the headphones that you’re considering if possible. You want to make sure that they’ll be comfortable when you wear them.

Read diverse sources.,
Keep track of your sources.,
Listen to similar lectures.,
Consider your purpose.",How to Prepare a Lecture1," Don’t develop your lecture material from a single source. Try to get a diverse perspective from professional texts, academic papers, news sources, and even less formal sources like blog posts. Diverse sourcing will give you a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter and reflect a more authoritative ethos to your audience.It’s good to present scholarly perspectives that conflict with each other. This will demonstrate that you are aware of critical perspectives, present a more comprehensive view of the topic, and give your audience something to think about.;
, Make sure you are properly citing any sources you plan on using in the lecture and know precisely where each piece of information comes from. Keep written bibliography on the side in case someone requests this information.Verbal citations for a lecture don’t have to be as complete as written citations for a paper. You can say some like “According to the U.S. Department of Labor’s 2008 study…” before preventing the relevant information. Still, you should have a complete citation that includes the author, date, author’s qualifications, title, publication, relevant page numbers, and instructions for finding the source on the internet or in print in case someone wants to see your sources firsthand.

, Use your preferred internet search engine to find other lectures on similar subjects. This can help you both in developing information for your content and giving you a template for how the lecture can be organized and delivered.YouTube and onlineuniversities.com are good places to find lecture videos.


As with any other source, make sure you cite the lecture if you are using specific information you gathered from it.

, The general purpose of your lecture is most likely to inform your audience about something they don’t know. However, you can consider this purpose more deeply. Are you trying to prepare them for an exam on the material? Are you leading them toward developing their own unique thoughts on the subject? Throughout the research and development of your lecture content, ask how you’re serving your overall purpose."
"
Start with an outline.,
Include an introduction and conclusion.,
Work in audience participation.,
Anticipate questions and confusion.",How to Prepare a Lecture2," Divide your content into major points and use them to set up an outline and develop subpoints underneath the major points. Starting with an outline will help you organize your thoughts and help you get starting in writing the actual wording of the lecture.Try to organize for consistency and include a relatively equal amount of information, subpoints, reflective questions, and sources for each larger unit of your outline.

, Introductions and conclusions are even more important for verbal lecture than written content because, unlike a written paper, the audience likely won’t be able to go back if they missed something. The introduction should prepare the audience for the most important parts of the lecture and the conclusion should restate those essential parts. The statement of purpose should clearly outline the functional value of the lecture. For example, say “By the end of this lecture, you should be able to apply the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of sides of a triangle.”
Directly state the purpose of the lecture in both the introduction and conclusion.

, Try to work in elements of your speech that are directly engaging the audience. The best way to do this is to include open questions in your lecture and offer an opportunity to for listeners to answer or give their thoughts. Interactive elements will keep your audience involved and give them an opportunity to apply the information or skills they’re learning.You can also organize activities for break out sections. You can break your audience into groups and have them and have them debate a subject against other groups or have them review separate case studies. This works specifically for a classroom lecture.
Ask an open-ended question that requires your audience to reason their answer like “Why do you think that Britain declined to recognize the Confederacy during the American Civil War?”

, Try to anticipate parts of your lecture that might be confusing and specific questions that the audience may ask. Where you do anticipate confusion, do your best to clarify each part of the information and make time to respond to questions or concerns. You should also try to demonstrate the concept in a practical way. For example, if you’re explaining a difficult math formula, do work out several problems while clearly explaining how the formula applies.If you’re having trouble determining this on your own, ask a friend or colleague to review it and determine areas of confusion.

"
"
Provide an outline.,
Practice on your own.,
Maintain eye contact.,
Moderate your tone and pace.",How to Prepare a Lecture3," If you’re concerned about the audience’s ability to follow along with your lecture, print out copies of your outline and hand them out to the audience. If you have a projector available, you could just project a copy of the outline instead. PowerPoint is an excellent tool for presenting an outline along with your spoken lecture.


It isn’t a good idea to read your lecture verbatim from a script so try to limit your outline to the key conceptual aspects of the lecture.
With a PowerPoint or projected outline, don’t over rely on it to keep you on track. Think of it as a note-taking guide for the audience and a way to incorporate visual material like images or video that support your lecture content., Practice will not only improve your technique but lessen any speech anxiety you may be experiencing.Go over your speech as many times as possible to perfect your delivery.


Consider recording yourself delivering the lecture. This will give you direct insight into how your audience will see you.

, Eye contact will demonstrate confidence and help keep your audience engaged. Try to pick out 3 or 4 targets for eye contact amongst the audience ahead of time and rotate between them., Consider how quickly you’re delivering the lecture and variations in your tone. Going too quickly will cause you to lose some members in your audience, as will speaking will a monotone.


Public speaking anxiety can cause you to speed up without noticing it. If you find yourself doing this, break up sentences with some sort of marking reminding you to pause. This make you more conscious of your pace.You can also mark certain words to put emphasis on. This will provide variation in your delivery tone.

, Obtain things like agenda books,dry erase boards or just regular notebooks to write a step by step plan of what you need to do everyday. It helps to also write the little things like talking to a friend or grabbing something before you leave.

, Go on your school or the school of your choice site and go over what specifically your major requires for you to succeed.

, Take time to go to each professor or your advisor asking them (politely of course), what is required to pass and how can you effectively succeed in the class as well. They will gladly appreciate you for this and this puts you ahead of most students who just come in there to learn and leave.

, In college, you're always wanting to have fun and break free since you're away from the ""boring , over baring parent""; but take your time to go through all random friends, things and events you will not need while at college. If you know you have an exam next week on a Monday, it would not be best to go out and party Saturday and Sunday. If you know you have a class at 8, wake up 2 hours early to get yourself together.

Find a place to work.,
Collect your materials together.,
Highlight the most important information.",How to Make Flash Cards1," Have a well lit working area where you are away from distractions and have all equipment ready. You want to devote your entire attention to your flash cards. Some people enjoy having a television on in the background or have music playing. If this is you, feel free to enjoy your preferred auditory stimuli, just make sure that they don’t distract you from your task., This means that you should have your flash cards and textbook ready. Have a good pen, markers, highlighters, and whatever other writing implements you’d like to use.


At this stage, you’ll also need to decide what medium you want to use to make your flash cards. Will you choose paper and pen or will you create digital flash cards? Ultimately, it is a matter of preference. Studies have shown that most students retain information better if they have to write out the materials.Yet, the convenience of having your flash cards on your phone may outweigh other concerns.

, Identify salient information in your notes and text book. Distill them down into their key parts so that you can transfer them to your notecards — in a physical or a digital form. You can do this by highlighting your notes or the textbook. If you cannot write in your textbook, write on a separate sheet of paper or create a separate file in a word processor on your computer.


Eventually, you will develop a system of note-taking that will make flash cards easier to make. Some of the easiest ways of doing this are to highlight or underline key sections your teacher stresses. Some people use asterisks, dashes, or other symbols to set off important text from the rest of their notes.

Keep coursework with you.,
Create a plan for big assignments.,
Avoid perfectionism.,
Reward yourself for a finished job.",How to Keep up to Date With Coursework," Keep your notes and textbooks organized by class, and don't let papers pile up. This will decrease the chances you lose something or forget an assignment that you need to do., Once you get the assignments for all of your classes at the start of the semester, make a calendar listing all of the due dates. This will allow you to see how assignments overlap, and when you should be concerned about work piling up.Your calendar should include tests, due dates for papers and other assignments, and anything else in your classes that will affect your grades.
Make sure to have just one calendar for all of your classes. If you spread things out across different places that will increase the chances that you forget or lose something.
Put your calendar in a visible place. It should be somewhere easy for you to see so you can always be aware of what is coming up.The class syllabus is a good place to see when all the assignments are due and what they are worth. Be aware that those deadlines can change, so listen for any changes from your instructor, and adjust your calendar as soon as you learn about them., Find space in your weekly schedule to do the necessary work for particular classes, and stick to it. This will help create set-aside times for you to do necessary work. Give time to each of your classes, and make sure that that time is only for work from that class. Sticking to these times will keep big assignments from taking over your time, and keep you from falling behind in other classes.


Find the best times for you to work. Some people are ""morning people,"" while others are night owls. You know yourself best, and what times you are most productive. Make sure you devote that key time to doing school work, as that is when you will likely have the most energy., This includes working through problem sets, writing papers, reading, or any other work you are assigned from class. Be honest with yourself. You don't want to run out of time because you consistently underestimate how long it takes to do something., After each class, review your notes, and highlight the important information. This will help reduce the amount of information you will need to review when it comes time to study for exams. By organizing and reviewing as the semester goes along, you'll keep up with and remember more information, and won't need to cram the night before exams.

, You will probably do most of your coursework on a computer in the form of papers and projects. If your files aren't named properly or well-organized, you will waste valuable working time searching for the right files. This is something you should do right away, because if you wait, you will likely lose something.Create folders for each of your classes. Make sure they have clear names. The name of the course (Introduction to Biology), or the course number (Biology 101) are good to use. It might be best to create one larger folder (maybe named ""School Work"" or named after your school) to hold all these folders.
Give your files clear names that make it easy to remember what each is for. Check each course syllabus to see if there is a particular name you should use for assignments. This is important if you turn in papers or assignments online.
Save your work regularly so you don't lose anything, and make sure you keep the files in the right folder.

, Colleges have a number of avenues available for students to help keep track of assignments and do them well. Find out what kind of academic advising, tutoring, and writing centers your college offers. Look for your professors' office hours, and use them to talk to your instructors about the class and the best way to do your assignments.If you start to have concerns about completing your coursework, you should discuss that with your instructors. They probably won't change your deadlines, but they might have some helpful tips for using your time better.

, A good rule of thumb is to get 7-8 hours of sleep every night. While you may feel like you need to stay up later to study or finish assignments, cutting back on sleep only increases the chances you will miss deadlines or do poorly on work., You will need to decide what place is best for you. It could be your dorm room, the library, or anywhere else you can be comfortable and focused. You can choose a single study space, or use multiple places. Just make sure that the area you choose is quiet and well-lit., When you are doing coursework, whether writing papers, reading, or other assignments, make sure you don't use that time for anything else. That means putting away your phone and staying off the computer except for things you need to complete your work., The start of your work time is when you have the most energy. If you have multiple assignments to do, figure out the ones that are the biggest or will take the most work, and do those first.Do not push away assignments that you don't want to do. Those should probably come first, as they will take more effort and require more energy.

, Having small assignments with you in a backpack or bag can help remind you of things to get done. Also, it gives you something to do if you have a little bit of free time, such as on a bus or waiting to meet a friend., Longer assignments, like research papers or projects, can't be done in one or two nights. Instead, you should build a plan to help you do a little bit of work along the way. Most large assignments can't be done in a few hours or a single night, so think about the smaller steps you will need to take in order to finish the assignment properly, and give yourself short term deadlines.In most courses, the assignment schedule is back loaded. This means the largest chunk of your grade will be based on work done at the end of the semester, and this will probably be true for most of your classes. Creating a broad plan as soon as you get assignments, and starting work as soon as you can, will help avoid letting things pile up later.If you are not sure what smaller steps might be, ask the instructor or TA. They know the best practices for the field, and can help you figure out what is important to complete and how long it might take.
Don't ask for extensions. It can be tempting, as work piles up, to request an extension or incomplete from the professor. Without a clear deadline in place, though, it becomes even harder to get work done., Sometimes students get too caught up in doing the best work that they never feel confident in the finished product. Don't let mistakes paralyze you and prevent you from finishing. Think of criticism as part of a process to doing better work, and not a statement on your personal worth. For each assignment, you should create the best work you can at this moment.

, If you've worked hard and finished an assignment, you deserve to celebrate. Having something as a reward at the end of the process can help keep you focused on what you are trying to accomplish. This can also prevent you from doing distracting things instead of working during study times.Just make sure this reward doesn't get in the way of doing other necessary assignments.

Take a book and count words in any page of it.,
Count from 100 to 1.

,
Count from 100 to 1 skipping each 3 numbers like 100, 97, 94, 91 etc.

,
Choose a word or sound and repeat it silently in your mind for 5 minutes.,
Take a fruit, an apple, orange, banana or any other fruit, and hold it in your hands.,
Visualize the fruit.,
Take a small simple object such as a spoon, a fork, or a glass.,
Draw figures.,
Visualize the figure.,
Try for at least five minutes, to stay without thoughts.",How to Increase Concentration Level," You can also count it again after you done it to be sure you counted right.;
,,, If you can do it for 10 minutes you are ready for next exercise.

, Examine the fruit from all its sides, while keeping your whole attention focused on it. Do not let yourself be carried away by irrelevant thoughts or associated thoughts that might arise, such as about the shop were you bought it, about how and where it was grown, its nutritive value, etc. Stay calm, while trying to ignore these thoughts and not be interested in them. Just look at the fruit, focus your attention on it without thinking about anything else, and examine its shape, smell, taste and the sensation it gives when touching and holding it.

, This is the same as exercise number 5, only that this time you visualize the fruit instead of looking at it. Start by looking at the fruit and examining it for about 2 minutes, just as in exercise number 5, and then do this one. Close your eyes, and try to see, smell, taste and touch the fruit in your imagination. Try to see a clear and well defined image. If the image becomes blurred, open your eyes, look at the fruit for a short while, and then close your eyes and continue the exercise. It might help if you imagine the fruit held in your hands, as in the previous exercise, or imagine it standing on a table.

, Concentrate on one of these objects. Watch the object from all sides without any verbalization, that is, with no words in your mind. Just watch the object without thinking with words about it.

, After becoming proficient in the above exercises, you can come to this exercise. Draw a small geometrical figure, about three inches in size, such as a triangle, a rectangular or a circle, paint it with any color you wish, and concentrate on it. You should see only the figure, nothing else. Only the figure exists for you now, with no unrelated thoughts or any distractions. Try not to think with words during the exercise. Watch the figure in front of you and that's it. Try not to strain your eyes.

, The same as number 8, only this time visualize the figure with the eyes closed. As before, if you forget how the figure looks like, open your eyes for a few seconds and watch the figure and then close your eyes and continue with the exercise.

, This exercise is to be attempted only after all the previous ones have been performed successfully. The previous exercises, if practiced correctly, will endow you with the ability to impose silence on your thoughts. In time it will become easier and easier.

Being prepared and having good knowledge about the topic that is to be presented will create interest among the audience and will not let them sleep all throughout your presentation. Capture the attention of your audience. Create soft humor which will add a boost to your interaction with them.;
, Presentations usually involves PowerPoint slides. It is important to select the right font, font size, and theme of the slides. Keep it formal!

, Involve the audience. Ask them few questions related to your topic. Keep it Short though because overdoing it would like Debate rather than Presentation.

, If you are distracted by some one, look at other side of the audience. Don't just read out the key points from the slides because the audience aren't blind.

, The presentation should last for the time given to you. Don't extend the presentation, since there are others waiting for their chance too.

, Helping your friends if they find it hard to give the presentation will boost your skills since you get to know the difference in a good and a bad presentation.

, When you are done with the presentation, it is time for the question round. When questioned, don't give vague answers, make sure your answer is simple and clearing everything which is asked and never question the person who is questioning you.It will be an insult to them.

, This helps you know what went wrong or if you have given a good presentation.

Write the key term or concept on one side of the flash card.,
Write short, concise notes on the other side of the flash card.,
Make sure your writing is large, clear, and well-spaced.,
Write in bright colors.,
Use shorthand to save space.",How to Make Flash Cards2," Write it in large letters so it will be easy for you to read. You don’t want to include any of the key information on this side. The point of flash cards is to see a basic concept and then be able to identify pertinent information about that topic. If your teacher has given you key questions to consider, you might just write out the question on this side. Keep this side of the card as simple as possible.

, Your goal is to distill the key information on this side of the notecard. Don’t rewrite a professor’s entire lecture on Mongolian agrarian reform or bicameralism. Take the most important points your professor emphasizes and bullet point them on the notecard.


Write with pencil or light ink so that this information doesn't bleed to the other side of the card.
Draw diagrams if you need to. Don’t be afraid to include additional information on the back of your notecards, as long it is essential information to the studying process.

, If your writing is small, you will not be able to read it easily and if it's crowded you will have too much to take in at one time. Writing clearly will enable you to read your notes easily.


If you find yourself including too much detail on your notecards, either try to distill it further or break it up into several notecards. In this case, you can place the key word on the first side with some kind of qualifier in parentheses. For example, if you wanted to remember the causes of the French Revolution, but couldn’t condense it onto a single card, you might make several cards. “French Revolution Origins (Political)”, “French Revolution Origins (Social)”, and “French Revolution Origins (Economic)” might be possible cards for this subject.

, Colors are your friend. Feel free to color code particular information. For example, if you are studying for a French verb test, you might write the infinitive verb on one side of the card and then on the other, you could write the definition in black and then the conjugated forms in a different color. Get creative. Color can be used to help further organize the salient information on the flash card. Just make sure that you can still read it. Yellow ink on a yellow flash card won’t work.

, Sometimes, you might have a lot of information on a single flashcard. In this case, you might consider adopting a form of shorthand. Most people develop their own that makes sense to them. In general, people use shorthand to highlight essential information and de-emphasize non-essential words. Turn “and” into “&” and “for example” into “e.g.”."

Open Microsoft Word and start a “New” document.,
Choose a flash cards template.,
Fill them out with the necessary information.,
Print out and cut up the flash cards.",How to Make Flash Cards3," No matter what version of Word you are using, you’ll need to open the program first. Then you’ll want to click on the “New” file button. This is found in the top bar., You can do this in two different ways. There is a search bar. Type “flash card” is that search bar and the template will appear. Or you can go and find the “flash card” template amongst all the other templates provided in MS Word. Typically, there are several different flash cards templates to choose from. Some are more colorful than others. Some are plain white. Some have decorations. Choose the one that is the most appealing to you, but keep in mind that your flash cards should be easy to read. If some sort of decoration or color makes them difficult for you to use, you’ll want to avoid that template., Each template will tell you where the key term, concept or question should go and where you should put the necessary information.Use color to organize your notecards further. Simply highlight the text that you’d like to recolor and then click on the text color tab at the top of your program. Use a color that is still easy to read, but distinguishable from the other color that you’re using. For example, use black for the primary information and green, blue, red, purple, or brown for subsequent particulars on the same card.

, Flash cards won't help you much if they're stuck on your hard drive. Print them out on sturdy cardstock and cut them apart.


You can punch a hole through one corner and string cards on a ring to keep them together. Then you can just flip through them as needed.

Choose an online flash card creator.,
Create an account if prompted.,
Insert all the relevant information.,
Finish your flash cards.,
Choose a mobile app to make flash cards.",How to Make Flash Cards4," There are several to choose from. Some will even let you download their program to use offline.Several sites like cram.com, http://www.flashcardmachine.com, http://www.kitzkikz.com/flashcards/, and https://www.studyblue.com are great free resources., Many online note card creation programs require you to create an account. This is essential so that you don’t lose the information you’ve put in. By creating an account, you’ll be able to access your flash cards from any computer with an internet connection. This means that you’ll be able to look at them on your desktops, laptops, and smartphones.

, Each site has a place for the key term, concept, or question and then another place for the important information. Some websites like cram.com give you the option of personalizing the aesthetic of your flashcards — adding color or designs. Others like http://www.kitzkikz.com/flashcards/ just have spaces for the information.

, Every website then has a button to click that says “create flashcards” or “process flashcards”. Click it and start using them.

, The biggest advantage to a mobile app is that you can take your flash cards with you wherever you go. There are many mobile apps out there that can help you make flash cards. Some are even tailored by subject, such as math and vocabulary.Most apps are free, so try out a couple to see what best suits your needs.

Take your time to make flash cards.,
Test yourself frequently.,
Have someone test you.,
Keep your notecards until you are absolutely sure that you don’t need them.",How to Make Flash Cards5," This may be the biggest “no brainer” step of all, because you need to have good information on the card if it’s going to be helpful. Try to think of making flash cards as part of the study process, not just a step that allows you to study. It is oftentimes the first foray into the study process for you. Pay close attention to the material. Try to add your own insight while you are making them. It will help you remember the information later on.


Some researchers even think that hand-written flash cards work more effectively than those made on MS Word, with other software programs, or online. Princeton and UCLA psychologists found that information retention increases when students are forced to write it out on paper. Your brain is forced to process the new material in a different way than if you simply type it out verbatim., Don’t just make the flash cards and look them over right before a test. Reference them frequently. Set aside a chunk of study time when you won’t be disturbed. Go through the notecards methodically. Keep them at hand throughout the day and reference a couple during television commercials, when you are sitting on the bus, or waiting in line at the grocery store. Your goal is to know the entire stack backwards, forwards, and mixed up. You can only do this if you test yourself frequently., It doesn’t matter if the other person is in your class or not. All they have to do is be able to read to you what you’ve written on the card. Have them show you one side of the card. You then explain the material on the other side, making sure that you use key phrases.


If you are new to the information, you might even have your study helper show you the side with the information and then you say the key word., One of the biggest mistakes that students make is discarding their flash cards after the quiz or exam. Information compounds over the course of the semester and from one class to the next. If you are taking a course that has several parts, consider creating a much larger “bank” of flash cards to reference in the coming months.

College, however, offers tons of ways to connect with others, with many schools offering more than 100 clubs or organizations to join. Go through the list of orgs at their school and encourage the student to pick two or three to find more about.Encourage them to attend a club meeting or two and to try to make friends there.
This is a great way for the student to make friends while fostering their own interests.;
, When a student transitions away from home and to college, everything may seem foreign to them. Most experiences they will have during their first few days will be completely new and unfamiliar. Encourage them to explore this newness whilst simultaneously creating familiarity with the campus.This will help the student begin thinking of the campus as home.
They might also find some cool monument, site, or even study area for them to utilize.

, This student may also want to find some friends outside of the scope of a club or organization. Colleges provide several different avenues to make connections with new people. Suggest that they hang out with their roommate more or participate in events sponsored by their dorm. Encourage them to connect with classmates or with people they are in group assignments with.Finding a campus job can also be a great way to make friends.
If you are a staff person on campus, consider connecting them to other students who you know have similar backgrounds or interests. You can also enroll them in a peer mentoring program if your college has one.

, There are several different departments and offices on campus tasked with helping students make an easier transition into college life. Offices such as Multicultural Affairs, GLBT Centers, Women’s Center, or Student Involvement can provide unique opportunities for students to engage with their peers as well as faculty and staff.


Many of these offices are open for students during the work day and even provide study spaces for them.
Parents can research these different departments on campus and inform their students about them and encourage them to stop by or set up an appointment.

, One of the main causes for homesickness in students is a poor use of free time. When the student was in high school, nearly all of their day was likely mapped out for them, but college is drastically different. Encourage the student to use a planner or Google calendar to have a better understanding of their schedule. Encourage them to fill in any gaps with either homework, studying, or something fun.Tell them to also list their class schedule and to be sure not to miss any of those.

, The RA, or Resident Advisor, is an upperclass student who is tasked with providing activities for the dorm or hall. This person is typically someone who has been successful thus far on campus and can help guide the student towards similar success. Encourage them to reach out to this person when they are feel very homesick or alone.The RA’s often have drop-in or on-call hours throughout the week. Encourage the student to use those when needed.

, Though you do want to encourage the student to make a life while at college, you do not want to teach them that they should disconnect from home. But rather than calling home constantly, encourage the freshman student to plan times to call home and to honor that unless an emergency arises.For instance, maybe they will call every other day at around 7PM. This will give the student and family something to look forward to while not feeding their dependency too much.
If you are the parent, try to abide by this schedule as much as possible.

, Just as students should plan times to call, they should also plan times to visit home, as well. If you are their parent, try not to allow your child to come home every weekend. Sit down and plan these visits weeks ahead and allow them to come perhaps once or twice a month at a maximum., On a similar note, if you are their parent, try not to visit your child too often either, especially during the first year of college. You want the student to begin developing a healthy level of independence and autonomy so that they can step into adulthood. Limit your visits to once or twice a semester., Another way to allow the student to remain connected to home is to have them bring items of sentimental value or importance to them to be kept in their dorm. On their next visit home, encourage them to bring back a blanket, stuffed animal, book or any other item that they connect with home.If you are their parent, consider giving them something of yours to keep with them while at school.
Suggest that they do not bring items of great value to school with them, especially if they have roommates. It could get knocked over or damaged.

, Sometimes, homesickness can be so debilitating that it impairs a person’s ability to function normally. Other times, it is just enough to affect their quality of life in a significant way. In any matter, refer the student to the counseling center so they can talk and work through these issues with a trained counselor.At some universities, staff have a formal reporting mechanism to inform the counseling center about students with difficulties. Utilize this if you feel overly concerned about the student.
Remind them that most students feel homesick and many utilize the counseling center to help cope with it.

, Sometimes, homesickness can be augmented by continuously harping on what was left behind. Tell the student to lay off the social media accounts of family and friends for a while until they start to enjoy college more.Suggest that they even deactivate their accounts for a bit.

, Students are often so caught up in missing home that they are blind to the fun and excitement that surrounds them. Encourage them to think about all of the fun activities and people and classes that they have encountered while being at college. If you are a staff person, inform them of any upcoming fun events.You can even suggest that they make a list.

, During this time of transition, the student might be considering making rash decisions like breaking up a longterm relationship, cutting off their hair, or getting a tattoo. Encourage them to wait to make such decisions until they are in a more positive frame of mind so that they won’t have any regrets.For instance, you might say something like “Mary, I know you said you wanted to get a tattoo covering your back, but it sounds like you haven’t really been thinking about it that long. Why don’t you wait until next semester to decide?”

, Encourage the student to create a space that they can identify with that feels like home to them. Tell them to hang posters, buy books, get a cool tapestry, or make a piece of artwork to make their room aesthetically pleasing.As their parent, you can help brighten up their room with things that they like. Buy them some colorful pillows or a poster of their favorite band.

, Tell them to schedule one thing each day to look forward to. It can be something as small as watching a show or getting some ice cream, but make sure they are creating moments of happiness for themselves daily. Encourage them to also continue self care by taking care of their hygiene., Another way to boost their mood and ensure that they are active and healthy is through exercising. Encourage them to get active by joining their school gym, which is often free of charge, taking some fitness classes, or going for a run. Encourage them to also eat healthy, as well."

Prepare.,
Study ahead of time.,
Take notes on paper.,
Do not procrastinate.,
Study every night.,
Ask questions.,
Stay focused and dedicated.,
Have fun!",How to Get Straight A's in University or College," Make sure you have a lot of notebooks, binders, pencils, pens, erasers, highlighters and so on. You must aim to be organized. Have a pencil case with everything so your pencils don't break in the bottom of your bag, and everything is easy to find. Label your notebooks and try to use the color coding system so you can quickly pull out your green math book if you come in late.;
, Take the time to look at what you will be learning in classes and use your summer time to learn and get ahead. Memorize the definitions for certain words, review your notes from last year, watch videos of history, and practice your language skills. The more you know before the actual class starts, the easier it would be when you are actually in the class. This prevents less stress because everything is not completely new or foreign to you.

, That's ""write""! Even if you type quickly, having a laptop with wifi is not a good mix. Students tend to update their Facebook statuses or check out their twitter during lectures. Take away the tempting distraction and take notes on a piece of paper. Listen well and analyze what the professor is saying, then write down the important or emphasized points. Have a voice recorder to go back to if you miss or couldn't hear a part. After, rewrite the same notes in your notebook. This way, you process what you have learned and your notes are clean and usable.

, In university and college, you will have up to a month to complete a project or essay. Do not let this time go to waste! If you cram, your work will more likely be trash. If you start ahead, you can take your time. You can prepare and plot, and even get professionals to edit and help you with it. Trust me, it is much better knowing you are 98% done a week ahead of time than forgetting about it and realizing you have to do a 8 page essay in two days.

, It is much easier and less stressful if you study and memorize everyday rather than being a passive learner and expecting to remember everything for the exam. If you review every night, and go back every so often, everything is already in your mind, and exams would be a breeze.

, Most classes come with a tutorial or a certain time when you can go to your professor or teacher’s assistant (TA) to ask questions. Use this time wisely. If you are ever confused about something, don't choose to leave it that way! They are there to help you! Some teachers would even over look your essays and work if you show it to them. Ask for explanations and even ask what would be on the exam. There are somethings they won't say in class or during the lecture, but are willing to give out if you ask about it.

, From the start, pick classes you are interested in. Even if there are some mandatory classes, make sure your electives are classes you would enjoy. If you find your class boring, maybe start a study group to keep you going, or search deeper for something you really like. For example, WWII may bore you to death, but you really like Italy or Japan. Use this to your advantage.

, This is your last chance to socialize and have fun before hitting the serious world of debt and careers. Go out with friends once in a while and eat with people. Join a club and do things you really like. Explore campus and eat at different places. Plan a flash mob. Stay focused on your classes, but if you follow the above steps, you will have a lot of free stress-less time, so have some memories, then get back to the boring stuff later.

Write the introduction.,
Explain how you are currently paying for college.,
Justify why you are seeking aid.,
Describe how you would benefit from the financial aid.,
Write a closing statement.",How to Write a Financial Aid Statement1," Present a picture to the financial aid committee of who you are. Describe special family circumstances, such as whether you are the first in your family to attend college. State whether you come from a disadvantaged family. Mention if you are from an ethnic group that is under-represented at the school.For example, you could write the following: “My parents moved to the United States from Albania in order to give us better opportunities. As their oldest child, I will be the first in our family to attend college.”;
, Describe your financial situation. Tell if you are currently working to support yourself. Describe other sources of support you are currently receiving, such as from your family. Provide details about any college savings that you have, such as a 529 College Savings Plan.For example, write something like this: “I have worked to help support my family since I was 16 years old. Currently, I work on the weekends as a waitress to support myself. My parents also give me what they can each month. Since my parents didn’t speak English when we moved here, it was very difficult for them to support our family. My mother worked many hours as a housekeeper in a hotel. They saved what they could, but we do not have enough savings to pay for my college education.""

, Explain difficulties you are having meeting your needs. Describe changes in your life that have affected your ability to pay for college. For example, changes in your family’s income or unexpected expenses may have caused a financial deficit. Provide evidence that you can handle your finances responsibly. Tell how you have paid some of your tuition yourself through your own efforts. Avoid details about paying for expenses other than education, such as car loans, as this is irrelevant.For example: “My earnings from my weekend job cover my living expenses. I worked extra shifts over the summer and saved enough to pay for a portion of this year’s tuition. However, I am seeking aid for the portion of the tuition I cannot cover on my own.”

, Explain how you will make good use of the financial aid you receive. Benefits might include being able to concentrate more on studying instead of working. The financial aid may allow you to take advantage of an unpaid internship. It may even make the difference between graduating or having to drop out.For example: “Receiving financial aid will allow me to focus on my studies during the week without having to worry about earning extra money. I would continue to work on the weekends to cover my living expenses, but I would be able to keep the weekdays free to focus solely on my school work.”

, Use a professional and polite tone. Avoid begging or being highly emotional. Awarding financial aid is a responsibility that schools take very seriously. Recognize this with a concise conclusion that thanks the committee for their time.For example: “Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my opportunities with you.”

Write an introduction.,
Describe your academic record.,
Communicate your leadership skills.,
Explain your community service history.,
Illustrate how your past experience has imparted qualities that the scholarship committee will value.,
Choose your words carefully.",How to Write a Financial Aid Statement2," Develop a thesis statement. Outline your academic and career goals. Indicate the main categories you will address in your statement. Describe how your academic record, work experience and community service have lead you towards your goals.For example: “I am applying for this scholarship in order to further my studies in education. My long-term goal is to work as an ESL teacher in an inner city environment. My academic, work and personal experiences have lead me to this career goal.”

, State that you have taken challenging courses. Mention that you have an excellent academic record. Note any skills or special knowledge you have acquired. Describe any special projects or research in which you have participated. Include information about tutoring or teaching.For example: “I graduated from my undergraduate institution with a 4.0 GPA. I had a double major of Elementary Education and Spanish, with a minor in Sociology. I applied for and received a prestigious internship working with the state government on developing educational policies.”

, Describe how your work experience has taught you how to interact with a variety of different people. Affirm your understanding of your strengths. State how your educational experiences have taught you to overcome obstacles and face challenges. Describe how life experiences have motivated you to continue your education and given you a clear vision of your future.For example: “My parents moved our family to this country from Albania when I was 12 years old. I did not speak any English when we arrived. The ESL teachers in my school helped me to be successful in school, and I want to do the same for other students in my circumstances.”

, Emphasize active participation in clubs, organizations, or civic associations. Describe volunteer work you have done. Explain how you chose your community service projects. State how long your involvement was. Tell about your travels and how they have impacted you. Express how your interactions with others have engendered a passion for what you do.For example: “Each summer, I volunteer for the Migrant Workers Education Association in Chester County, Pennsylvania. They service migrant workers who come here from Mexico to work on mushroom farms. We not only link families with community services, but we also tutor children in English and help them learn important school skills that will allow them to be successful in school.”

, Describe the qualities you have developed as a result of your academic, work and community service experience. For example, your academic experience may have given you motivation, knowledge of your current field and an attention to detail. Your work experience may have given you originality, creativity and an ability to solve problems. Your community service experience may have given you maturity, emotional stability and the ability to face challenges.For example: “My experiences as an ESL student and an English tutor have taught me the value of helping children to feel successful and empowered. I know the meaning of hard work, and I have learned how to overcome challenges in my own personal and academic life.”

, Strike the right balance between being modest and bragging. Demonstrate your abilities in an unpresumptuous way with phrases like “good candidate,” “well-prepared,” and “good leadership skills.” Avoid overstated statements like “my fantastic background,” or “my eternal passion for learning.” Present clear evidence of your skills and accomplishments. The evidence will speak for itself."

Use specific examples.,
Give yourself time for revisions.",How to Write a Financial Aid Statement3," Don’t wait until the last minute to write your personal statement. It may be your best chance for making the case of why you should qualify for aid or a scholarship. It is an important document that sets you apart from other applicants. Devote enough time to making it accurately reflect who you are, demonstrate your writing ability and provide evidence of your achievements., Develop a logical structure for your statement. Write an outline that organizes your ideas and categories. Get input from others about what to include. Ask teachers, parents and others whom you trust for feedback. Include enough details to be thoughtful and complete, but avoid being long-winded., Share information about who you are. Tell the readers what you want them to understand about you. Give them information about your family and past experiences and how they have motivated you to pursue your studies. Explain how your work and academic experiences have given you knowledge about your field. Describe personal experiences that have helped you hone in on your goals., Write about who you really are and what you really care about. Do not try to write what you think the readers want to hear. The application committee will know right away if you are not being honest. They read so many essays that they can distinguish the difference between genuineness and insincerity. Showcase your true desires, accomplishments and strengths., Remember that those reading the essay do not know you. They may not understand your sense of humor, so it’s best not to use it in this essay. Avoid using clichés in order to make your application essay more specific and persuasive. Instead of saying that you’re a “people person” or a “Jack of all trades,” provide specific details about yourself and your experience., Reinforce general claims about yourself with specific details. For example, if you state that you feel comfortable with people of different backgrounds, give details that explain why. Perhaps you have been an ESL tutor, or you grew up in a military family and traveled around quite a bit. Provide concrete examples of your motivation and leadership. Explain how you are going to use your education to accomplish your goals., Prepare to write several drafts of your personal statement. Get feedback from others. For example, show it to people on campus such as professors, advisors, classmates and teaching assistants. Revise it for clarity and content. Check your spelling, grammar and punctuation."

Create a support network.",How to Get Rid of Study Backlogs," Panicking or beating yourself up over your current situation will accomplish little. Instead, focus on staying in control of your actions and mind. Repeat to yourself, “I can do this,” while taking a few deep breaths. Think about another time that you faced a difficult situation and beat it.If you find yourself dwelling on the negative possibilities, say aloud, “Focus on the present and future.”;
, Gather all of your syllabi and assignment sheets. Then, get a piece of paper (or more, if needed) and draw a line down the middle. On the left side, place the dates of any exams and the due dates for all assignments. Try to merge all of this information into one list that goes chronologically from the near due dates to those further out.Post this list somewhere visible so that you can keep track of due dates and also mark off assignments as they are completed.
If you are under a lot of stress, it may be helpful to create a general “to-do” list at the same time. Write down items such as doing the laundry or washing your car. This list will not take priority, but it can ease your mind to write down everything at once.

, Now that you’ve made an initial list, you’ll need to decide how to tackle your workload in an organized way. Mark down the first item on your agenda as “1” and continue onward. You will want to take into account the due date, the difficulty level of the task, the grade’s weight in your final average, and your individual confidence level in each area.To assess difficulty, you may want to look at your other scores for similar material. For example, if you received a 65 on the last quiz, you may need to spend some more time in that area. This may take priority over studying for a class where you are holding a consistent “A” average.
Also, if you know that your notes are weaker in a certain class, you may want to move it up on your list as it may take more time to catch-up and make any note fixes.
Be careful of listing all of one course’s assignments together in the priority order as you may get burnt out just working on one subject over and over again. Instead, look for opportunities to integrate different projects into your list while still making progress.

, Move through your list in priority order and assess how long each task will take. For example, “I expect to spend three hours writing that paper.” Then, look at your calendar for each week and match up your free time with your list of items. Each free slot should have a corresponding item assigned to it.


Try not to overschedule yourself. Make sure to keep your study sessions between 30 minutes to two hours long. Add in short breaks in between sessions. Keep the sessions shorter for more difficult material.Think about what you do during the day and look for ways to free up additional time. For example, if you normally go home in between classes, try staying on campus and going to the library instead.Realize that with your schedule in place you may have to say “no” to taking on additional responsibilities. Put your study needs first whenever possible., Store your class materials in separate binders or folders. Some people prefer to use different colors for each class. Within the binders, place all of your materials in order by date and type. This will save you time when you need to find a guide sheet or study guide.It is also a good idea to keep all of your study materials in one place at your home. You don’t want to waste time looking for a piece of paper when you could be working.

, If you are still feeling overwhelmed, there is nothing wrong with reaching out to your teacher. Stay after class or go to their office hours and tell them about your situation and what you are doing to fix it. Ask for their advice, but avoid requesting hand-outs, such as extensions, unless you absolutely have to.You might say, “To be honest, I was unprepared for the amount of work this class would require. But, I am willing to put the effort in to turn things around for me. I plan to work on these assignments first, what do you think?”

, If you’ve got a research project coming up, go ahead and hit the library to grab some initial books and articles. Or, you can always search via online databases. If a friend of yours has a set of class notes, ask them to make a copy for you and do the same for them. Be as prepared as you can for each study period.


If possible, and if it is allowed, see if you can get a copy of the previous year’s exams or maybe even a sample of a graded assignment from that particular professor. The more information that you have about the grading expectations, the better.

, For each bit of free time, come up with a study spot in advance. You may head to a particular table in the library or perhaps a quiet coffee house nearby. Try to rotate your spots every few times or so, otherwise you may fall into a bored routine and slow down.Make sure that these are areas where you can study without encountering too many distractions. For example, if your friends hang out in the student center, it may be cozy, but not the best place to study.

, When you sit down to study, turn off your phone and put it away. Resist the urge to browse the internet or hit any social media sites on your computer. Put your other “to-do” list out of your mind and concentrate on finishing up as much work as you can.

, Give some thought as to your study practices and learning style. Are you a visual learner who needs notecards or diagrams? Do you take your best notes direct from the book? Or, do you do better after listening to your notes via an audio file?, Don’t get caught up in too many details. If you are under a time crunch, read the first and last sentences of every paragraph. Pay particular attention to the introductory and concluding sections of each chapter. Try not to re-read and instead focus on getting the larger topic and thesis in hand.

, It is very easy to let one difficult project or exam take over your entire study schedule. Assess your progress every few days and watch to see that you are crossing off items on your assignment list on a regular basis. If you get stuck, give yourself a final deadline to finish and stick to it.It is also important to recognize that you will never be perfectly prepared. Don’t strive for perfection. Instead, just try to do the very best that you can at the moment.

, Talk to your fellow classmates and try to arrange group study sessions. This will help to keep you accountable while also increasing the knowledge that you can draw upon. However, make sure to stay on-task during these sessions.Experiment with different study strategies as a group. For example, take turns teaching a subject to one another.

, Talk to an academic counselor at your school or your teacher to get a recommendation for a tutor in your particular subject. Start meeting with your tutor on a regular basis. During the first meeting, tell them that you are a bit behind and ask for their assistance in crafting a plan to catch up and do well.

, No one can work all the time, at least not effectively. Make sure to give yourself adequate breaks in between study sessions. Try not to work more than 2 hours at a time. You might also choose at least one evening a week to take off and do something not school related.


Aside from breaks, offer yourself some sort of reward for each study task that you complete. For example, if you finish a paper assignment, then enjoy a piece of chocolate or a brief shopping trip out.

, Even if you are an “A” student, if you fall behind you may need to lower your expectations and aim for a passing grade. Do the best you can, but realize that you are facing significant time constraints.

, Try to avoid finding yourself in a similar situation in the future by maintaining your study calendar even after you’ve eliminated your backlog. Every week write down your new assignments and update your schedule as needed.

, If you’ve started to slow down while studying a certain area, or if you’ve sped up in another, make sure that your daily schedule reflects these alterations. Make sure to still give yourself plenty of time for breaks in between study sessions., If there was a particular reason for your falling behind, such as a series of absences, recognize this and do everything you can to avoid ending up in a similar situation.

, Tell your close friends and family that you are trying to improve your study accountability by keeping a calendar and schedule. Ask for them to regularly check-in with you regarding your progress. This will help keep you accountable too. And, it will give you a reason to brag if you are doing well.

MFin programs are usually about eleven months long. MBA programs take 18-36 months, depending on whether you attend full or part time.
MFin degree holders will almost always earn less than their MBA counterparts.
MFin degrees prepare graduates to work in finance fields. MBA degrees are broader, and put graduates on a leadership track.;
, While an MFin focuses on the finance aspect of the business world, there are a variety of potential careers available to MFin-degree holders. Each MFin program has different strengths and opportunities, and having an idea of what you would like to do with your degree will help you select programs to which you’ll apply. Career options examples are:Investment banking
Real estate
Financial planning
Corporate finance
Insurance

, You need to research your program options before you do anything else. There’s no need in wasting the time, effort, or application fees applying to programs that don’t ultimately meet your needs or help you obtain your long-term goals. You might make a spreadsheet with specific criteria that you need a program to meet and schools and how they meet those criteria, which will help you easily see what programs are best for you.Criteria might include:


Program ranking – where you get your MFin may determine your chances of securing the career you want.
Financial assistance – if you require financial assistance, it’s good to know up front what sort of packages programs typically offer.
Class times – are the classes held during the day or at night? Will this be doable for you?
Job placement – programs should be able to provide you data on how many of their graduates place in jobs, how long after graduating they secure those jobs, and what positions they’ve secured.
Program emphasis – every program has its strengths. What strengths do the programs you’re looking at have? Will they help you achieve your career goals?
Length of program – some programs have an accelerated pace while others are part-time and taking much longer.

, Master in Finance programs typically don’t require work experience, unlike their MBA counterparts, but they do usually want to see that applicants have successfully completed one or more internships in the field before applying.Internships give you hands-on experience and show the admissions committee that you’re committed to working in the field.

, Before you apply to MFin programs, you should already have a good idea of general prerequisites you’ll need to be a successful candidate. It’s best to start working on these before you graduate with your bachelor’s degree so that you’ll have an advantage over other applicants. You can typically find prerequisites on individual program pages.Some examples of prerequisites include:


Good grades. Many programs will say that they require a “B” or 3.0 grade point average. More realistically, you’ll want at least a 3.5.
Work experience. To supplement your grades, some programs ask for internships or work experience. They may simply say that either are encouraged.
Extracurricular activities. Demonstrating to admissions committees that you can earn great grades while actively engaging in your academic and geographic communities reflects favorably on your application.
The correct bachelor’s degree. Many programs do not require that you hold a business-related undergraduate degree for acceptance to an MFin program, although some do., Every program will require test scores as part of your application for admission. Pay particular attention to which tests they call for and their deadlines. Also, test scores must almost always be taken before your application will be considered complete.


International students will likely be required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) examTypically MFin programs will require that you take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) before you apply. Most programs will require a minimum score of 650.Some programs require the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) instead, and some programs even accept either test., Every program has their own application deadlines, and you’ll need to be mindful of the deadlines for every program to which you’re applying. As a general rule of thumb, most MFin programs have a deadline of December 1.


The deadline is for your application and all supporting materials. Make sure that you allow plenty of time for documents that you’re not providing, such as your official transcripts and letters of recommendation.
Incomplete applications will be automatically rejected.

, Your resume provides the application committee an overview of your work experiences and skills. The resume also allows you to highlight particular skills that you believe the application committee will value and this document needs to be clean, informative and concise. Some skills that you’ll want to highlight are:


Computer skills
Programming experience
Statistics competencies
Language fluency
Any finance or math-related experiences

, This essay is your opportunity to speak to the admissions committee, and paint a picture of why you’re an ideal candidate for their program. In the statement of purpose, you’ll talk about what led you to choose this career path, or where you see yourself going with your degree in hand, for example.Avoid clichés in your writing
Don’t be melodramatic or over-the-top
Let them know why this program is right for you and why you’re right for the program.
You’ll be giving them transcripts and a resume, so don’t waste this valuable essay going over that information again.

, Every program will ask you for letters of recommendation in which people are more or less speaking on your behalf or vouching for you. Who you ask and how you ask them is important, and these letters can play a role in your getting into an MFin program.Ask former professors or other relevant people that know you well, but not family members or friends.


Don’t wait until the last minute to ask so that you give them ample time to write the letter.
Make your letter request in person, rather than in email, and don’t assume they’ll say yes.
It helps any letter writer if you can share copies of your statement of purpose and resume so that they may refer to them when writing your letter.
Thank them after they have submitted the letter.

, Every program to which you apply will require several materials from you, such as your application, your resume or CV, your transcripts, your test scores, letters of recommendation.Almost all programs also have everything online now so that you can view your application’s progress and verify that all supporting materials have been received.


Verify that everything is received by the school.
Verify that you’ve submitted all documents correctly, such as the right file formats, or official vs. unofficial transcripts.

, You will hear differing advice on whether or not you should follow up with professors or the admissions committee after submitting your application. Some experts say that this follow up shows interest and effort and is well worth it. Others say that the committees are busy and that you should not contact them or faculty unless they reach out to you first. If you’re unsure which option you’d like to choose, don’t be afraid to ask someone in the admissions office what their preference is.If you are asked to interview, always send a hand-written thank you note to the committee or faculty that interviews you.

, Become a member in professional organizations that relate to your field. This shows that you’ve taken time and initiative to learn about the professional aspects of the field and are thinking longterm., Failing to research the school and program is a common pitfall. You should be able to provide, at any point in the application process, information about the program and school that you find appealing, as well as faculty that are doing work that you’re interested in. Being able to provide this sort of information shows that you have a strong interest in their MFin program and did not simply apply to the program as a last resort., Essay requirements vary by program, but you can expect that you’ll be asked to write at least one (some ask for two or four, even). Because this is your chance to sell yourself as a great candidate, you need to make sure that your essay is essentially perfect. Plan to revise your MFin essay several times, ask others to look over it for you. A poorly-written essay will have:Typos or other egregious errors.
Restatement of what is already included in the supporting materials.
A lack of elevated vocabulary and field-specific jargon.
An overall lack of organization and conciseness.
A lack of stated goals.

, There is a difference between a letter writer that writes bad things about you and a letter writer who writes an ineffective letter. Unfortunately, both of these types of letter writers exist and they are both damaging to your application. If you have a tenuous relationship with a professor or received a mediocre grade in their class, consider asking someone else.You may wonder why a professor would agree to write a letter if they have nothing nice to say about you. It’s possibly because they felt uncomfortable saying no. Always give them a non-confrontational opportunity to say no.
If you simply ask for a letter and leave it at that, you will receive a generic letter, which will do you no good. Instead, let your professor know why this field appeals to you, what you plan to do, why it is that you think they’re the best person to recommend you, and some of your strengths.

, Simply put, if your application or supporting materials have typos or poor grammar, diction, syntax, organization, or formatting, you will give the impression that you’re underqualified for the program. Remember, unless you’re called for an interview, your committee only knows you through text. Another writing pitfall is overly-detailed, tedious writing, which may bore your committee.

, Be weary of name dropping to the admissions committee, and don’t speak poorly of your undergraduate institution. Committees won’t be impressed by either, and may see you as someone who is unable to succeed without riding the coattails of others, or as someone who is overly critical of given opportunities, rather than a team player looking to find opportunities even in adverse conditions."

Place your focus where you need to improve.,
Request model papers and tests.,
Look into supplemental reading and course material.,
Study a little each day.,
Seek outside help.",How to Get Good Grades at University1," Learning how to best direct your studies can help you improve your understanding of course material. If there's something you do not understand, focus on improving in that area. Identify where you need to improve in each class and direct your focus accordingly.It may be one particular subject that's giving you trouble. You may find history and English courses easy to understand, but falter slightly in your math class. In the coming weeks, make math your priority. Strive to raise your grades in this area.
It may also be one part of a particular course that stumps you. You may be doing great in genetics overall, but don't understand chapter 12 of your textbook. When studying for your upcoming exam, place a lot of energy mastering chapter 12.;
, Most professors will be happy to give you examples of past work. If there's a test or paper coming up, request a sample paper or sample test. Some classes actually provide information like this on a course website. These can be great resources to help you succeed academically.Many teachers keep old papers on hand to give students a writing model. If you can get some old papers, read them carefully and try to emulate their writing style. If your teacher does not have model papers, try asking someone else who previously took the class and earned a high mark if they still have their old papers.
A lot of teachers will be happy to present you with old tests as a study guide. However, do not simply memorize the questions and answers on old test, as a teacher is unlikely to simply repeat old material. Use them as more of a guide, giving you a sense of the type of questions that may be asked. Make a point of reviewing all course material before a test.

, If you're not understanding something, it may be a matter of how it's being explained. Everyone is different, and has a different learning language that works for them. If your professor or your textbook are leaving you baffled, look into outside course material. Maybe lecture notes from another professor, or an alternative textbook, can help you better grasp a particular subject.Textbooks are often chosen because the professors knows their writer. They are not always necessarily the best works. You can find supplemental reading online or at your library if you're not understanding something. An alternative text on the work may help you better grasp the material.
You can find a lot of course material for free online. Many professors will freely post things like PowerPoint presentations online, and you may even find recorded lectures on sites like YouTube. If you're not understanding the way your teacher explains something, see if another teacher can explain it better.

, If you want to understand something, cramming at the last minute will not help. Every day after your classes, review your notes and study a little. If you work on studying a small amount every day, this will help you retain the information longterm.Find a time when you can most easily study. Look for gaps in your schedule. Maybe you could study a bit in the morning on days you have a late class. Maybe you could study after lunch and before a class around 5 at night.
Stick to your routine as much as possible. There may be days where you have errands to run or a social engagement. Slipping from your routine won't be as big of a deal if you're usually stringent with it.

, There's nothing wrong with asking for help if you need it. You may find a certain subject is just not clicking with you, despite your efforts. You can ask your professor for help after class, hire a private tutor, or go to any resource centers available at your college."

Estimate your need and set a savings target.,
Start saving as early as possible.,
Start working early to earn your own college money.,
Get help from family members.",How to Save For College1," It is never too early to begin thinking about saving for college. Although you do not need to decide exactly what school you (or your child) will attend, you should begin to consider some general possibilities. Understand that private universities generally will cost more than public universities. Public schools also grant tuition reductions for in-state residents. As your child grows and begins to develop interests, you can certainly redirect your focus, but it will help to set some targets for saving as early as possible.According to U.S. News and World Report, the average tuition and fees at a private university for the 2016-17 school year are $33,635. The most expensive school in the study is Columbia University, with a one-year cost of $55,056.The average in-state resident cost at a public university, reported by College Board, is $9,410 for a single year.
These figures tend to increase by about 3% to 5% each year.;
, Even without any specialized investments or major savings plan, you can get a very big start on college saving by beginning early. Small amounts of money that you begin to set aside early can grow into substantial savings, even at modest return rates. The sooner you begin saving, and the more you save, the wider your range of options will be when the time comes to attend college., As a student, there are many opportunities to begin earning money that can be set aside for college. Some common jobs that are available even to relatively young students are babysitting, yard work, dog walking, house sitting or washing cars. If you are energetic, and with your parents’ permission, you can visit neighbors to ask if they have any jobs you could do to earn some money. As you earn, begin setting some money aside for college., Relatives, even extended family members, may be willing to help with college saving. If you speak with them early in the child’s life, you could design a saving plan that would not be too intrusive or expensive, but can have very positive results. Instead of, or perhaps in addition to, birthday or holiday gifts, you could ask relatives to contribute to a savings account for college. They will probably feel very good about being able to help in this way.


The IRS allows individuals to make gifts to family members without paying a gift tax on the transferred money. This allowance is as high as $14,000 for gifts made during 2016. (Note that this is not tax deductible for the giver, but the amount of the gift is excluded from taxable income for the recipient.)"

Keeping everything separate will make the process infinitely faster.


Most forms, if not all, will be downloadable via the Internet.
Make sure when you download them that you paperclip them with the correct scholarship and gathered supporting information.;
, Make sure you are providing an answer to every question. Leaving something blank is pretty much a guarantee for disqualification. This goes for honesty as well. Fudging answers can lead to immediate and automatic denial.

, As the saying goes, haste makes waste. There’s no faster or easier way to do this. Take your time and do it right. It will pay off in the end.


Keep in mind that any question requiring a lengthy or well thought-out response should be flagged and held for later. Always take the proper time to think about the best possible answer.
Once you’ve thought about it, write out a practice version first, then go and fill your final answer in.

, You will need the same basic information for every single letter you write, regardless of the recipient. That means a job well done now creates a faster and less intensive process later on. When you write your second letter, third letter, and so on, you will use the 5 paragraph essay structure for each and simply highlight different information to more accurately fit each recipient.

, Rewrite them until you can state them in one sentence. Now you have a clear, concise plan for your future as well as an important reason for applying for your scholarships.

Include academic achievements you may have earned such as being valedictorian, school club president, or graduating with honors as well as non-academic activities such as work history, volunteer/community work, awards, sports honors/awards, and internships. Include anything that shows your strength and potential as a leader.

, Scholarship committees don’t want to hear about how much you need the money. They want to know that you know how to use it. So make a list that shows them you do. For instance:


Tuition
Books
Housing
Supplies
Fees

, Use the standard five paragraph essay format. This format will structure your letter in a clear, concise, and compelling manner. It consists of an introductory paragraph, three main body paragraphs, and a conclusion. , Your introduction should focus on your immediate educational and career goals. This sentence is already written in your preparation stage so you should be able to place it right into this part of your outline. You will briefly discuss how your particular interests within your chosen field of study developed and state why you want to continue your education.Remember that these bullet points are for your reference so you can see just how much you’ve accomplished thus far. When you write, it’ll be up to you to turn this list into a compelling ""story""., In this paragraph you will focus on your strengths and leadership skills including academic achievements, extracurricular activities, community and/or volunteer, and awards. Again, you have these listed. Now put them in a bulleted list here.


Were you class president? Did you write a story that won a competition? Did you write for the school newspaper? Were you captain of the Lacrosse team? Did you volunteer in a political campaign or at the food bank? Do you hold down a job with management responsibilities? Do you work with kids? Have you been nominated for academic awards?

, This paragraph will develop your reason for applying for this particular scholarship and why you should be considered. Be professional and direct and do not say that you need the scholarship money but rather mention what you will be using it for. Examples would be to help pay for tuition, housing, books and supplies.


This is the part of the story about the future. How do your goals and vision match up with theirs? And what would you pay for if you had that opportunity?

, Now that you’ve told them about yourself, show them that you are deserving of their scholarship and how you will wisely use their funds. Highlight your ability to successfully complete the college program for which you are requesting a scholarship as well as a clear intention on what you plan to do with your course of study. Remember: you are investment. They want to know you'll pay off.


This an expansion of your introductory paragraph regarding your academic and career goals. Now you provide greater detail that illuminates just how strong your knowledge and passion are and how you could you change your life and the lives of others with this scholarship.
You’ve already shown them who you are, ""now show them who you will become and how that will benefit them"".

, Reiterate within this closing paragraph your interests in applying for the scholarship. Then explain what you – and by extension they – will gain from you having received this particular award. Remember, they want to award successful candidates. Their success going forward is contingent on choosing candidates who successfully complete their education and move on to productive careers. Be sure you let them know this is exactly your plan.Be careful not to use redundant words or phrases from earlier paragraphs.
Think of this paragraph as one in which you are paraphrasing an article, paragraph, or even a book: summarize but do it in a different way. Make it new, unique, and fresh. As they say, “Take it to the next level.”

, Do a little research on the organization's website before you write your individualized letter. See if you can find their goals or mission statement. Often, these will influence their decisions when awarding scholarship money. Keep your audience in mind as you develop the letter. If you are creating a letter to the National Engineer’s Association, for example, what you highlight will be different than your letter to the NAACP. , You have all the information you need already organized and ready to go. Create strong, dynamic and clear sentences that capture the essence of each paragraph concisely.


Use active voice. Passive voice puts you, the ""do""er, last: ""Being elected as class president was a highlight of my high school career."" Instead, phrase this actively, focusing on what you accomplished: ""As class president, I focused on developing a peer anti-bullying group.""Use expressive action verbs. Instead of saying ""I volunteered at Habitat for Humanity,"" use action verbs that say exactly what you did: ""I coordinated volunteers from my high school and helped construct houses for Habitat for Humanity."", Your first paragraph is not a summary. You want to grab their attention from the get-go with your introduction and a summary won’t get the job done. Approach it like you’re telling the beginning of a story to your friends so they'll ""need"" to know what happens next.


Remember the art of the Hollywood thriller: what comes next? If you telegraph where your introduction is going (e.g., by summarizing what follows) you will capture their interest and make them want to read to find out “what happens next.”A descriptive short anecdote is often very effective. For example, you could start off telling about the time you held your mom's hand as she screamed in the hospital room. You could describe how you felt as your baby sibling came into the world. Then follow it up with your goal statement: ""This experience made me realize that I am called to serve rural communities as an OB/GYN.""

, Make sure your second paragraph keeps the mystery and suspense going. Who are you? Where have you been? What have you done? What sets you apart? What is so unique about your story? At the risk of answering a rhetorical question, ""you"" are what makes your story unique.


Remember, you intrigued them with the introduction so don’t fall into the “summarize my strengths and leadership skills” trap in paragraph 2. You may choose one, two, or at most three to highlight, ""'choosing those that directly reflect the scholarship’s purpose""'.
Think of your overall strengths/leadership skills as a theme that infuses your second paragraph. It’s not about making a list, it’s about painting a picture. Show them ""who you are"" (create a narrative paragraph), don’t ""tell them"" who you are (make a list).
Be specific! Don't say ""I'm a people person."" Say ""In my job at the grocery store, I have never met a stranger. I strike up chats with each customer and have often been commended for my friendliness.""

, First show them what you would do with their scholarship now (degree, course load, tuition, room & board, etc.) and then show them how it would benefit everyone in the future.


Imagine you’re the underdog in a sports movie. You’re Rocky Balboa. You’re Daniel ""Rudy"" Ruettiger. You have it all – everything except that one big break. You’re ready to grab that break and become a champion. Are they ready to give it to you? If so, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS!

, Avoid dry, momentum-killing transitions like, “First,” “Second,” “In addition,” “In conclusion,” etc. Make each paragraph flow naturally into the next like it would in a conversation. The most compelling writing is the writing that makes the reader want to read the next line rather than reading a by-wrote list of why they should be reading.


A natural flow in a story never uses these types of clunky transitions and your letter is a story. Look at it that way and transitions become much easier.

, Remember, you only have two pages maximum. That means each paragraph can’t be much more than one-third of a page. Be pointed, be brief, and be strong., Use a 12-point font type, double-spaced so that it is easy to read. Use professional quality stationery paper if you plan on mailing the letter using the postal service.


If the organization has given you specific requirements for the letter. follow them precisely. It would be a shame if your essay is DQ'ed straight out of the gate for being too long or in the wrong font.

, This should be done numerous times to check for grammar, typos, layout, organization, and clarity. If you can say something in 12 words instead of 20 then do so. Add or delete content and check for proper punctuation each and every time you read it. Make any needed corrections and edit where necessary.

Mind your dishes.",How to Shop for College," Federal law requires the college to provide you with a list of required textbooks once you register for classes, so you should be able to find out which books you need well in advance from either the registrar or your professors. You should not need to rely on the campus bookstore to tell you.;
, You might be able to find the occasional good deal at your campus bookstore, but in the vast majority of cases, you can find the books you need for a much lower cost somewhere online.Check out websites like BIG WORDS.com and Campus books.com, both of which direct you toward textbook sellers offering the lowest prices.
Also check out websites that allow users to sell their own used and new copies of a book, like Amazon or Half.com.

, For many textbooks, you can buy an old edition at a lower price without facing too much difficulty.


You might want to check with your professors before doing this, however, in the rare instance that there is a significant change in the new edition that you will need access to in order to survive the class.

, Renting your textbooks will not guarantee a lower price tag, but oftentimes, the price to rent a book will be cheaper than the price to buy. Look into both options and determine which will work best for any particular book.


You can check your campus bookstore for renting opportunities, but there are also online sources, including Chegg, BookRenter.com, CampusBookRental.com, and ValoreBooks.

, If you really want to pinch pennies, you can check for coupons that allow you to save money on textbooks bought online. These coupons will rarely be specific to the publisher, but you might be able to find coupons for various online stores.

, If you know a friend who needs to buy some of the same textbooks, consider splitting the cost in half with that friend and sharing the book.

, Upperclassmen who are done with a textbook for good will occasionally sell it, and the cost is usually pretty cheap since they tend to be more interested in making whatever they can on the book.

, As long as the international edition is printed in the same language, this can be a viable option. Research carefully, however, since international editions can go either way in terms of cost.


Check the cost of shipping, as well, since shipping costs on international editions can sometimes cause the overall price of the book to shoot up.

, Even if you plan to do most of your work on your computer, you still need a range of basic writing utensils for class time and study time.


Buy blue or black ball-point pens and pencils for taking notes and filling in exam papers.
Get highlighters to help you study.
Invest in a couple of permanent markers and a bottle of white-out., Folders and notebooks are essentials, but there are a few other supplies that could come in handy that may not be quite as obvious.


Consider buying a three-ring binder and a hole punch to help you stay organized, as well as subject dividers and loose-leaf paper.
Buy a book bag or messenger bag that you can carry from class to class.

, The desk in your dorm room will need to hold a large number of supplies and papers, so buy tools and supplies that can help you keep everything in order—including your sanity.


Consider buying:
Sticky notes
Personal organizer or calender
Dictionary and thesaurus
Calculator
Rubber bands, a ruler, scissors, a stapler and staples, thumbtacks, and tape

, If you do not have one already, you should really consider buying a computer. Most of your classes will require you to type and print papers, and a computer can also help you with research and entertainment.


Aside from a computer, check into buying:

Printer
Printer paper
Ink cartridges
Flash drive


Find out if your campus has computer labs equipped with printers. If so, you might be able to skip the printer and save yourself the cost.
Protect your tech. Buy surge protectors to protect your computer from any unexpected electrical surges. You can also consider buying an external hard drive so you can periodically back up the contents of your hard drive.

, Most dorm rooms are equipped with extra-long twin beds, so when you buy comforters and sheets, you should make sure that the size of the bedding you buy will match the size of the bed you will have.


You will need pillows and pillowcases, bed sheets, a blanket, and a quilt or comforter.
Also consider buying a mattress pad to make your bed more comfortable.

, Many dorm rooms are equipped with some form of lighting and mirrors, but it usually will not hurt to buy a few of these yourself.


If your dorm does not come with one, buy a full-length mirror.
Consider buying a desk lamp and floor lamp to supplement the overhead lighting installed in the room.

, An alarm clock is an absolute must, unless you have an alarm on your cell phone that you rely on. Even if you do use your cell phone alarm, having a backup alarm clock can still be a good idea.


You should also buy supplies that can help you fall asleep faster so that you can wake up well-rested. These may include earplugs and an eye mask.

, Odds are, you can just bring the same clothes you wore throughout your high school years. There might be a few instances in which you will want or need to buy new clothes.


Prepare for bad weather. Have a raincoat, rain boots, umbrella, and snow boots, as needed.
If the climate you are moving to differs from the climate back home, buy clothes that are more suited toward the climate you'll be heading to.

, Some items you need to bring with you will not stay out once you get to campus, so you should buy a few storage bins to help you store any excess materials until you need them.


Also consider buying temporary racks and shelving to store shoes, books, and other belongings that you need to access easily.

, While this is not a necessity, you should consider buying things to decorate your walls and door. This is the room you will be living in for the majority of the year, after all, so you'll want it to be comfortable for you.


Options worth considering include:

Bulletin board
Posters
Dry-erase message board and pens for your door



, If you have never owned your own suitcases, now is the time to buy a set. Purchasing your luggage in sets is recommended over purchasing it piece by piece, since a set will usually provide you with the best deal for your money.

, You will need a large bath towel and small washcloth, at minimum, but there are also a few other shower-related items you should look into buying.Purchase sandals or shower shoes to protect your feet from the bacteria left behind in communal showers.
Buy shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.
If your room has its own bathroom, buy hand towels, a bath mat, and toilet paper.
Bring a shower caddy to store your soaps and other supplies.

, As a general guideline, any product or tool you use at home should be brought with you to college. If you were using your parents' supplies at home, you need to buy your own, now.


Buy a hair dryer, flat iron, brush, comb, and curling iron, as needed.
Also consider buying a razor and shaving cream to take care of facial and/or body hair.

, As with hair care products, any skin care product you use at home will also need to be purchased for college.


Protect your skin with moisturizing lotion and sunscreen.
Keep your teeth clean with your own toothbrush and toothpaste.
Buy a new tube of lip balm.
Keep body odor in check with deodorant.

, A first aid kit is a good idea for any college kid. You can buy a commercially-prepared first aid kit or buy the supplies separately.


Supplies worth including are:

Rubbing alcohol
Antibacterial ointment
Adhesive bandages
Hydrogen peroxide
Thermometer



, Aside from a first aid kit, there are a few other items you should consider having in case you get sick or otherwise feel less than your best.


A few items worth buying include:

Over-the-counter headache medicine, cold medicine, and allergy medicine
Prescription medications
Cough drops
Eye drops



, In many cases, you will only need to worry about cleaning your bedroom or dorm room. In some cases, however, you might also be responsible for the dorm hallways, bathroom, or kitchen area, in which instance, you will need to buy cleaning supplies for these areas, as well.

, A vacuum cleaner, broom, and mop should all be on your college shopping list.


Invest in a mini-vacuum cleaner, especially if you are only in charge of a small space like your dorm room.

, You will almost always need to wash your own clothes. Stock up on laundry detergent and invest in a hamper.


Buy a collapsible hamper to save room.
Purchase fabric softener in either liquid or dry sheet form.

, Disinfectant wipes are advisable, regardless of how much you will be expected to clean. Having disinfectant wipes and sprays can help reduce the spread of germs, which is very important in a compact space like a dorm room.


Also bring along dish soap and glass cleaner, as well as clean rags that can be used for scrubbing.

, Even the most studious college student will need to unwind every now and then. Now is as good an excuse as any to stock up on any CDs, DVDs, or Blu-rays you've had your eye on.


Skip the fancy sound systems, though, since you can get in trouble if you make too much noise and your neighbors file a complaint.
Also buy a small TV to watch your movies on.

, You might love your music, but that does not mean your roommate or your neighbors will love it as much as you do. Headphones are important, so if you do not own any, buy them now.


If you invest in noise-canceling headphones, you can also shield your ears from the music and sounds made by other people.

, If you enjoy reading, purchase a few books you can look forward to reading. Doing so can restore some of the joy of reading that might otherwise get lost amidst all the textbook work.

, Indoor and outdoor games can help you relieve stress and make friends, so if you do not have any games you can bring along with you to college, buy one or two now.


Board games and card games are a great, inexpensive option. You can also bring a video game console, but do so at your own risk, since this could be stolen if you leave your room unlocked and unattended.
Buy supplies for outdoor fun, too, like rollerblades, a frisbee, or a basketball.

, Many colleges have restrictions regarding the types of cooking instruments you are allowed to keep in your dorm room. Review these restrictions before making any big purchases.


Items you should check on before buying include:

Coffee maker
Blender
Microwave
Small refrigerator



, Resealable plastic bins and plastic bags are important since they allow you to store leftovers and make your food supply last longer.


Make sure that your plastic bins are microwave-safe.

, Forks, knives, and spoons are the absolute essentials you need to stock up on, so buy these supplies before you head off to college.


You should also consider buying a can opener, funnel, and any cooking utensils (like whisks and mixing spoons) you might need if you plan to prepare your own food.
Cooking supplies also include baking pans, saucepans, and frying pans.

, You will also need plates, bowls, cups, and mugs when you head off to college.


Make sure that your dishes are microwave-safe.

Research scholarship and grant opportunities.,
Apply for nursing scholarships.,
Apply for nursing school grants.,
Stay organized and keep application responses handy.",How to Pay for Nursing School1," Search the internet for reputable scholarship and grant opportunities. If you’ve already applied and been accepted to a nursing program, start with its website. Your college program’s site will likely offer helpful links that compile opportunities and offer helpful information about applying.


Check the financial aid resources listed on the website of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN): http://www.aacn.nche.edu/students/financial-aid

Remember, the more scholarship and grant money you can accumulate, the less you have to pay out of pocket and the less debt you have to pay back in the future.;
, With a shortage of nurses in certain sectors of the medical field, there are a number of public and private organizations that provide scholarships for nursing students. Some scholarships are designated for students looking to earn a bachelor's or master's degree in nursing, so read descriptions carefully and only save links to relevant opportunities.Keep in mind that hundreds or thousands of students apply for major national scholarships.
Try applying for local scholarships as well, as they will have smaller applicant pools. Individually, they might be smaller, but you can build a considerable sum of money by winning several of them., Look into state government-funded grants for nursing students. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sponsors a number of grants to help in-need students pay for nursing school. Other, private grants may require you to have reached a certain level in your education (such as completing one semester of your program),or may require that you agree to work for a specified time in a particular area of nursing. However, you don’t have to repay any of the money you’re awarded out of pocket. That’ll help you graduate from a nursing program as debt-free as possible.Professional nursing organizations may also offer grants.

, Once you’ve researched scholarship and grant opportunities, make a calendar or use a calendar app that specifically lists application deadlines and other important related dates. Once you’ve applied to a few, keep any digital files saved on your computer, or make copies of applications that had to be submitted in writing.


List dates in your calendar in advance of application deadlines, or set reminders to work on an application. Give yourself reminders to begin and complete applications several days before they’re due.
Keeping application info, from basic info to essay responses, will help streamline the process so you can maximize the number of applications you send. "

Come to class prepared.,
Review your notes before class.,
Take excellent notes.,
Reach out to a teaching assistant.,
Listen during class.,
Refer to your syllabus throughout the semester.",How to Get Good Grades at University2," If you're not prepared for class, a lot of what's discussed will be lost on you. Do all the required reading before entering your classroom. You should also complete any homework assignments that are due, or do any activities your professor requested. You're unlikely to get a lot out of a class if you can't follow lectures or participate in discussions., Do this around 10 to 15 minutes before class. A quick review will allow you to see how material in your class goes together. This will help you follow the lecture or discussion and also give you a more significant understanding of the subject material.As you review your notes, pay attention to major topics. What are the main points that were covered in the last class? How do they relate to any reading and homework that was due?
Think about any overarching themes or ideas you see emerging. Try to consider what your professor may discuss today.

, Always come to class with a notebook, pen, or pencil. Some teachers may allow you to take notes using your laptop, but be very careful to avoid getting distracted by things like the internet. Good notes are vital for studying for tests and writing papers.Make sure your notes are organized. Use headings explaining each major topic. Group related materials together and avoid writing all over the page or clogging the margins. Write neatly, so you can easily read your notes at the end of class.
It can be easy to misunderstand your own notes, especially if you were writing them fast. Your handwriting may be somewhat illegible, and you may not remember what a given note meant in a month or so when studying for exams. Therefore, try typing up your notes at the end of each class period when they're fresh in your mind. They'll be more legible and organized when you refer back to them later.

, If your class has a teaching assistant, he or she can be a valuable resource for you. This can be particularly helpful in a large lecture class where it's difficult to get your professor's attention. Work on fostering a good relationship with your TA, as this can help you better understand your course material.Your TA may have taken very similar classes to you as an undergraduate. Therefore, he or she can probably easily answer a lot of your questions. Teaching assistants are also generally younger than professors. Your TA may better remember what it's like to be a student, and be able to offer you tips on how to balance school, social life, and extracurriculars.
If you're confused about an assignment or a lecture, see if you can stop your TA after class. This may be more helpful than going to your professor in some cases.

, There is no point in attending class if you're not going to pay attention. Turn your cellphone off before entering the classroom. Pay attention through the duration of the class.As you listen, pay attention the main ideas presented in this lecture. This will give you an idea of which areas to focus in on when studying later on.
Identify supporting material. What texts, or portions of your textbook, does your teacher most often bring up in discussion?
Remember to take notes as your teacher lectures.

, Do not just review your syllabus at the beginning of the year. Keep it on hand throughout the semester for review. Your syllabus is a valuable tool that can help you figure out how to best approach the course material.Your syllabus generally gives you a breakdown of how much assignments, in-class activities, tests, papers, and so on count towards your grade. Keep this in mind as you try to best direct your energies.
The syllabus will also remind you of appropriate classroom conduct, which is important to keep in mind as you navigate your classroom.

Maintain a regular schedule.,
Take advantage of office hours.,
Reach out to successful students.,
Attend all your classes.,
Improve your test taking skills.",How to Get Good Grades at University3," A major part of good grades is the ability to manage your time wisely. Work on maintaining a regular schedule and sticking to it throughout the semester. You should also plan ahead and stay aware of when big papers and tests are coming up. Write down important dates in your calendar and keep a daily planner.Decide when to study, do homework, socialize, and so on. Have a daily routine you follow that works with your class schedule.
Stick to general rules that work for you. For example, maybe you need a couple of weeks to write a solid paper. Make sure to always start papers a week before they're due.

, Professors have office hours in which you can come in and ask questions. Always take advantage of the time your professors are offering. Office hours are an invaluable way to gain a higher understanding of course material, and build solid rapport with your professors.Do not just come into office hours when you're struggling. Stop in just for a refresher when necessary. You can also have a professor look over a draft of your paper or go over the reading with you.
Your reputation can help sway your grades. If your professor is, say, deciding between a B+ and an A, they're more likely to grant an A to a student who seemed like they were consistently trying.

, You want to surround yourself with inspiring people. In class, try to identify the most successful students. Try to plan study parties and review sessions with these students. Your grades will improve as good habits rub off on you.Try to form a regular study session. Meet once a week with the top students in your class.
Make sure to keep study sessions directed, however. Study sessions can sometimes dissolve into socializing, which will not help you bring up your grades.

, Everyone misses class once in awhile. An illness or emergency can occasionally prevent you from making it to a lecture. However, never allow missing class to become a regular thing. Unless it's absolutely impossible, attend all your classes all the time. In college, classes may only meet once or twice a week. Missing a single class can really diminish your understanding of a course.Avoid being late. In many classes, too many tardies will count as an absence, which can bring down your grade.

, Even if you know the material, you may do poorly without basic test taking skills. Improving your test taking skills can really bring up your grades in university.Know what you should expect on exams. This will help with your nerves. Try to go into an exam knowing the test format ahead of time.
At the beginning of the test, stay calm and read through instructions before you begin writing.
Pace yourself. Be aware of time and make sure you do not spend too long on a single questions.
If you're confused by a question, ask your professor. It's better to stop and ask during the exam than to realize you misread instructions after getting the exam back.

Have a positive attitude.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Get organized.,
Eat well.",How to Get Good Grades at University4," Your attitude can actually make a big difference when it comes to academic success. Try to feel positive about school and learning. You should also feel confident that you're able to succeed. This can help you have the energy necessary to get good grades.If you have a setback, see it as an opportunity to learn and bounce back rather than a defeat. Remind yourself that it's normal to get one bad grade or struggle with one subject. This is how you'll learn to be strong.
Remind yourself of the benefits of an education. You're learning to have a more nuanced understanding of the world while assuring yourself future success.

, Many people neglect sleep in college, but you're unlikely to be an academic success if you're tired all the time. Consistently running on less than 4 hours of sleep will inhibit your ability to concentrate.Stick to a sleep schedule. Try to go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time each day.
Avoid electronic screens before bed, as these can stimulate brain activity and make sleep difficult.

, If you're unorganized, this will make everything about school more difficult. Try to keep all your course materials well organized. This will make studying and doing homework easier.Invest in a large planner. Store material from different courses in different folders in your planner.
Never throw anything out until the end of the semester. You never know when you may need something. Have a folder or section of your desk for old papers, notes, and other class materials.

, A healthy diet can help give you the energy you need to earn high marks. Avoid processed foods and sugary foods. Have a salad for lunch instead of a slice of pizza. Snack on things like fruit, vegetables, and nuts over chips and other junk foods. You will be surprised by how much more energetic and confident you feel when eating a diet of healthy foods."

Open a 529 savings plan.,
Invest in a 529 prepaid tuition plan.,
Buy savings bonds for college.,
Invest in Coverdell ESAs and custodial accounts.",How to Save For College2," A “529 Plan” gets its name from section 529 of the U.S. Tax Code, which establishes such plans and the tax benefits connected to them. A 529 Plan allows you to invest money, and the income from the investments will grow tax-free. In addition to saving on federal taxes, there may be benefits on state taxes as well, depending on the state where you live.For more detailed information on establishing a 529 account, check out Choose a 529 Account.
529 Plans exist as either “Direct Sold” savings programs, which you buy directly from a plan manager, or as “Broker Sold” plans, which you arrange through a financial adviser. You may need to pay professional fees for a broker sold plan, but you get the benefit of the financial adviser’s experience.
To review the plans that are available, you can visit www.SavingforCollege.gov, which provides a list of all the plans available, state by state. You can review the plans, get details on the investment possibilities, and even enroll right there online., Prepaid tuition plans are sponsored by the government of individual states. To set up a prepaid tuition plan, you will contact your state’s prepaid tuition program and select a contract. A contract allows you to make periodic payments toward the future estimated tuition costs. The contract sets tuition at today’s current rates, for future attendance. As you make periodic contractual payments, the money is set aside in the form of credits, which you will then use when you attend college.To find the prepaid tuition plans available in your state, just search online for “prepaid tuition plan” and the name of your state. You will find the state office that manages the plans, along with information about how to enroll and begin investing.
The money that you invest in a prepaid tuition plan is generally fully refundable if it is not ultimately used to attend college. However, you should check with the plan manager for specific details and possible fees., Buying federal savings bonds from the U.S. Treasury allows you to make an investment in college that will enjoy some tax benefits, while encouraging you to save money. You can purchase education savings bonds online at www.treasurydirect.gov, in amounts ranging from $25 to $10,000. The maximum purchase is $10,000 per year. The interest that you earn on federal savings bonds can then be excluded from your taxable income when you cash in the bonds to attend college.To purchase bonds, visit www.treasurydirect.gov and open a personal account by using the link “Open an Account” in the top right. You will need to provide some confidential identifying information. From there, you will be able to make investments, purchase bonds, and manage your account.
For more information on the tax benefits of savings bonds, see the IRS Publication 970, “Tax Benefits for Education,” available at www.irs.gov.
For specific help regarding the tax benefits of savings bonds, you should speak with an accountant, tax lawyer or other tax professional.

, A Coverdell Educational Savings Account (ESA) is a way to invest money, through a broker or financial adviser, that provides great flexibility and tax advantages. Contributions are not tax-deductible, but the investment earnings are tax-deferred, and withdrawals that are used for education costs are tax-free. To establish a Coverdell ESA, contact a brokerage firm, mutual fund company, or other financial investment institution."

Earn credits through Advanced Placement classes.",How to Save For College3," Although not technically a method of “saving” money for college, you can reduce your college tuition costs by taking classes earlier. You can attend your local community college and take some introductory courses while you are still in high school. The tuition for these credits will likely be much cheaper than credits at the college that you eventually choose to attend. As a result, you can, in many cases, reduce the overall cost of attending college.You may choose to take some community college classes while in high school, or enroll directly into community college after high school graduation. Many people will spend one or two years at community college, and then transfer their earned credits to another public or private institution. In the end, you will graduate with that other school’s degree, at greatly reduced cost.
Research ahead. If you have one or more schools in mind where you ultimately would like to attend, make sure that the credits from the community college will be transferable to the program that you want.

, Many high schools participate in dual enrollment programs. These are programs that allow high school students to attend classes at a nearby college. The credits earned count both toward high school graduation and as college credit that will be transferable after graduation. If your school offers such a program, and depending on how many classes you take, you may be able to save as much as a full semester or more of college tuition costs.


If you search for the term “high school dual enrollment” and the name of your state, you are likely to find information about programs that are available.
One particular example is Liberty Online Academy, which has a dual enrollment program for online students to earn both high school and college credits at the same time., Advanced Placement (AP) is a wide-spread program at most public and private high schools that gives students an opportunity to enroll in advanced level classes. Students who perform well in AP classes and earn high enough scores on the AP test at the end of the year can earn college tuition at participating colleges and universities. Each college or university sets its own policies about accepting AP test scores for credit. If you have a particular school that you plan to attend, you should contact its admissions office for more detail.Much more information about the AP program, tests and college credits is available at https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/creditandplacement.

Meet with high school counselors.,
Consult with lending officers at your local bank.,
Work with a stock broker or other financial adviser.",How to Save For College4," You high school counselor is a general resource, who can help not only with selecting classes and getting into college, but also with saving for college. Speak to the counselor at your school for information about savings plans that may be available and about scholarships for which you or your child may qualify. Guidance offices often sponsor workshops and lectures about college savings., Banks are not only in the business of earning money but also helping you save money. To get some help saving for college, visit an adviser at your local bank. You will be able to get information about investment programs that the bank offers for its customers, as well as information about federal and state-sponsored programs. As a local resource, the bank is also likely to be more familiar with scholarship programs in your area or contacts with local colleges and universities., Many investment programs for college savings will require the assistance of a professional financial adviser or stock broker. Many people think that financial advisers are only for wealthy investors, but that is not true. Even people with modest incomes who wish to make the most of their savings should be consulting with a professional adviser. Here are some suggestions for finding a reliable and helpful financial adviser:Ask friends, relatives or colleagues for recommendations. If people you know have used a particular individual or company, and have been satisfied, then you may as well. This is a good way to get started.
Consider whether you want to hire someone who is fee-based or commission-based. A fee-based adviser will collect a retainer or hourly fee, but then may be more likely to work with a wider range of products. A commission-based adviser does not collect a fee from you but earns a commission on the investments that you make.
Visit reliable websites. The Garrett Planning Network offers a nationwide search tool that helps you locate financial advisers across the U.S., particularly who service middle class customers. MyFinancialAdvice.com is another tool that offers financial advice for modest investors.

Discuss financial aid options with your nursing program.,
Inquire with the college financial aid office.,
Join your local National Student Nurses’ Association (NSNA).,
Join Sigma Theta Tau or your school’s nursing honor society.",How to Pay for Nursing School2," As you apply to and are accepted into a nursing program, talk to anyone you come into contact with about financial aid. Look at your program’s website for financial aid info that’s specific to the program. Look for the contact info of relevant people, such as the program director or the department’s student advisors.Ask them about local scholarship opportunities, work-study programs, and how other students commonly pay for that particular program.

, Talk to your college’s financial aid counselors about securing aid and about the process of paying for nursing school. If there is federal financing available, the office will instruct you on how to apply. Federal aid is usually a loan, so you will need to repay the borrowed amount.


If you’re applying for a program in the United States, fill out a FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Your school will provide you with information about deadlines. https://fafsa.ed.gov/


, Once you’re enrolled in a nursing program, don’t stop looking for scholarship and grant opportunities. Continue to make yourself a winning applicant by joining your local NSNA chapter. You’ll have access to great networking opportunities, it’ll look good on your resumé or to any opportunities you apply for, and you’ll be informed about grants and scholarships available for enrolled student nurses.Take a leadership position in your local chapter for even more networking opportunities, to learn more, and for a resumé booster.
Your nursing professors will provide you with information about how your program participates in the NSNA and other relevant organizations.

, In addition to joining your school’s NSNA, find out if your school has a local chapter of Sigma Theta Tau, which is the international honor society for student nurses. If not, find out if your college participates in another nursing student honor society, and how to get accepted into it. Keep your GPA up, and once again, take a leadership position if any are available to make yourself a more appealing enrolled applicant for scholarships and grants."

Ask a family member to borrow money.,
Seek part-time work that can help you pay for some of the costs.,
Use an interest-free or low-interest credit card.,
Find out about work repayment and student loan forgiveness options.,
Join the military.",How to Pay for Nursing School3," Being indebted to a family member at a very low or zero rate of interest is definitely preferable to being indebted to a federal loan servicer. You can avoid a lengthy application process and years of outside debt if you have a family member who’s in a position to loan or give you the money needed for school.


Any loan agreement, even those between family members, should be put into writing.

, Most nursing programs are very demanding, and you’ll need to devote your focus to completing your coursework, externships, and clinical rotations. If you can manage it, consider obtaining a part-time job to cover part of your tuition, living costs, or other expenses, especially one that’s relevant to your studies. Various private and public hospitals offer jobs for student nurses as Undergraduate A.I.N. (Assistant in Nursing), which is also helpful for the course itself.


Speak with your program’s advisors or look for on-campus part-time work.
Look for doctors in need office help. Check listing online, in classified ads, or visit offices in person.

, If you can access a credit card with a minimal interest rate, use it to pay for tuition, books and other expenses. Use a rewards or cash back card to earn rewards off the amount you charge to the card. If a grant and scholarship awards are only paying partial tuition, and if you have good enough credit, you can potentially access an interest rate lower than what you’d pay for federal student loans.


If you’ve been awarded a total financial aid package that only covers part of your tuition, consider using a card to pay off the rest.
Be careful of high interest rates when using a credit card. Don’t end up paying more money than necessary in the long run due to high interest.
Be aware that after graduation you will need to pass the licensing test and gain employment. There could very well be a few months between graduation and your first nursing job, so be aware of when you'd be responsible for any loan or credit card repayments.

, When you’re applying for nursing jobs, consider getting a job that offers loan repayment or forgiveness options. This type of financial aid requires that you work for a particular agency or within a particular field of nursing, such as end of life care, for a certain number of years. In return, your employer offers a repayment option once you begin employment.Look for federally funded programs, such as the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program.Look for local programs that also offer work repayment and loan forgiveness, such as state health departments.

, In addition to public health service, military service can also offer full forgiveness of federal student loan debt. Debt forgiveness programs for public and military service often include consolidating loans to renegotiate a smaller monthly payment. After 120 on-time monthly payments, the remaining balance is forgiven."

Get a job.,
Look into tuition reimbursement.",How to Pay for College With No Financial Aid," There are many types of scholarships to help you pay for college, and not all are based on academics. For example, you may qualify for a scholarship based on your ethnicity, your gender, or your parents' military background.Other scholarships relate to your hobbies and interests, or your area of study.
There is no limit to the number of scholarships you can use toward paying for college.
Many scholarships renew each year that you are in school. If your funding renews each year, you don’t have to search for other funding sources to replace a scholarship that has ended.;
, Both your high school and all universities have staff that can direct you toward scholarships. Applying for scholarships can be time-consuming, but it’s worth making the effort.If you are in high school, sit down with a guidance counselor to discuss your scholarship options. Many organizations that offer scholarships will reach out to contacts at high schools. These organizations want qualified candidates to apply.
Ask an administrator at your college of choice about the scholarships the college offers, as well as qualification and submission requirements. If the college administrator helps you find scholarships, there is a higher chance that you will attend their school.
Many scholarships are given by organizations to advance a particular mission. You may be required to write an essay, or demonstrate service to the community as part of your application. If you apply for a scholarship from a non-profit, for example, you may have to document how you’ve volunteered in your community.

, Keep in mind that some scholarships are not publicized by the organization that provides them. If you perform a search on the web, you may find opportunities that other students miss.Search scholarship websites like FastWeb and Sallie Mae's Scholarship Search for programs where you can apply. Through these sites, you can get the information required to apply for the scholarships, as well as what it takes to be approved.
Check your locate community newspaper. Many local charitable organizations grant scholarships to students in the community. You may find information about these opportunities in your local paper.
Review your local library’s website. Library bulletin boards often have postings of local scholarship funds operated by private parties and area businesses. The library may also post that information on their website.

, Your high school counselor can also help you find courses that allow you to earn college credit. Those credits will reduce the amount of course work you need to take in college.In addition to your high school, you may be able to take courses at your community college while you are in high school. Those credits can also transfer to a 4-year university.
When considering a university, make sure that they accept the transferred college credits from your high school or community college. If they don’t, consider a different university that does accept the credits.
Some four year colleges will accept the credit hours, but not the grade you earned. This can still help you, since the credit transfer will reduce the hours required to graduate.

, Both of these programs are offered through the College Board. If your high school does not offer certain AP courses, you can take them online.You can take AP (or Advanced Placement) courses in a variety of subjects, including math, science, history and social studies.
After taking an AP course, students sit for an exam. If you score well enough on the exam, you can earn college credit.
CLEP offers 33 exams in 5 subject areas. If you pass a particular CLEP exam, you can earn 3 or more college credits., The tuition between colleges can vary greatly, based on the type of school you choose. You can select a public or private university. Your school may be near your home or out of town.A private university can be twice as expensive as attending a public (or state) university. To keep your costs down, narrow your choices to public colleges.
If you decide to attend school near your home, you can live at home and commute to school. This eliminates the need to pay for room and board.
You can attend a community college for two years then transfer to a university. The credit hours you pay for at a community college will be cheaper than the rates at a university. You may earn up to half of your university credits at a cheaper community college.

, Many colleges meet the financial needs of students by offering work-study programs. You may also consider a Reserve Officer’s Training Corps (ROTC) program to pay for college.A work-study program normally involves working a certain number of hours on your college campus. In exchange for your work hours, your tuition costs are reduced.
The Reserve Officer’s Training Corps (ROTC) program trains college students for future careers in the military.
The ROTC offers scholarships that cover the cost of your college education. In exchange, the student commits to active duty service in their chosen branch of the military.

, Parents can plan for college expenses when a child is very young. The savings they accumulate can be used for college expenses.Consider a 529 Plan for your college savings. These plans may allow the investor to invest pre-tax dollars into an investment, like a mutual fund.
Because the dollars have not been taxed, more money goes into the investment. Say, for example, that you want to invest $100 a month on a pre-tax basis. The entire $100 gets invested. If you had to pay taxes on the $100 first, you may only invest $80.
Set up a family budget. Include an amount of college savings in that budget. When you’re paid each month, move funds into the college savings plan immediately. That self-discipline will help you keep your investing plan on track.

, Even students who do get college financial aid often have to find employment to make ends meet while they go through school. You may need to work full time and attend school part time.Alternatively, you may be able to work part time and go to school full time.
Look into alternatives to traditional shift-work, like multiple part-time jobs. Part-time jobs give you more flexibility to fit in your courses at school.
Check your school's website for alternative sources of income. You may find small tasks that pay you something and don't take much time. For example, nearly all colleges need people to take research studies.
Consider taking more classes online, if they are available. Some colleges offer degrees completely online. An online program can provide the flexibility that can allow you to work while you’re in school.

, Some employers offer to reimburse their full-time workers for the cost of tuition. These costs are covered when an employee attends college while they work at the firm.Employers want their workers to increase their skills. A business may offer to pay for college degrees that increase your value to the firm.
If you pursue tuition reimbursement, the company may require you to stay with the firm for a period of time after your courses are completed.
If you leave before the time required, you may have to repay the tuition costs to your former employer.

Perform research in your area of study as an undergraduate.,
Reach out to possible advisors.,
Compare tuition prices at several graduate schools.,
File a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).",How to Pay for Graduate School1," If you plan to pursue a Ph.D. in the United States (or PsyD or equivalent degree) upon graduation from college, the single best use of your time as an undergraduate is to be working on research in your area of interest. Try to present research at several conferences and publish research in one or more professional journals before graduation.


With a publication/presentation record and the outstanding recommendations that will go with your research involvement, you have a good chance to be awarded funding through a university fellowship, a graduate teaching assistant position, or graduate research associate position from your graduate school. This funding will most likely pay for your university tuition plus a small stipend to live on.;
, For graduate school, your advisor is your most important point of contact and the person who will direct and help you in your research and writing. Email each person, explain who you are and that you are planning to apply to their program. Ask if they are accepting new advisees and what kind of information they might want from you. It’s important to cultivate a relationship with a few possible people with whom you could work, and then they can work to help you be accepted to their program. The graduate program you choose should be because of the adviser and because of the financial package you receive to attend that university.

, Keep in mind that the price on their materials will probably not be indicative of the price you would pay. Based on the possible assistantships and stipends, many graduate students, particularly for Ph.D.s, often do not end up paying any tuition at all. For other degrees, it is less likely that you will be fully supported, so the price matters. Prices vary widely so comparing costs will keep the expense of graduate school down. Many well-known public universities have tuition similar to that of private universities. However, there are still some very good public universities that offer less expensive graduate degrees.


Pay close attention to whether or not the public university to which you apply charges out-of-state students more in tuition than in-state students -- it depends on the university and the program., Everyone considering graduate school should fill out the FAFSA application to see if you qualify for federal aid. You could receive either a grant or federally subsidized loan based on income. You will need your Social Security number, along with identifying information for your parents if they still declare you as a dependent on their taxes. You should also have copies of your income taxes for the last three years, and if necessary, that of your parents.You can be considered a dependent on your parents' taxes if you are under 19 years old or are a student younger than 24 years old as of the end of the calendar year. It would be to your advantage to NOT be listed as a dependent on your parents' taxes, assuming you make a lot less money than they do.
Fill out the application online at the federal student aid website and submit it electronically for processing. Monitor the status of your application and view your eligibility once the results come in.

Make contact with the department administrators.,
Pursue all funding opportunities that are available to you.,
Do an online search for graduate school scholarships.,
Research professional associations that offer scholarships.,
Apply to fraternal associations.",How to Pay for Graduate School2," The department administrators as the university that you plan to attend will be able to talk to you about typical funding packages for graduate students. If you have further questions or want to explore the possibility of more funding, talk to a financial aid officer.. There may be many additional funding sources available from the college for tuition assistance, Funding opportunities for graduate school include fellowships, assistantships, and grants. Every university has a different set of funding opportunities available to graduate students. Fellowships, assistantships and grants are awarded by college programs, departments, academic offices, and outside institutions. These programs provide money to help pay for graduate school and they are also impressive additions to your academic resume.


Check with each school you're interested in to see what funding opportunities are available and apply for as many as you can.
Teaching or research assistantships are sometimes awarded to graduate students who assist professors teaching undergraduate classes or helping with their research. Duties vary and may include grading papers, holding study sessions, and cataloging research. Compensation also varies, but usually includes some combination of tuition remission, health insurance, and a stipend.
Administrative assistantships offer office work positions to students in various departments on campus. Again, compensation varies based on the institution and the duties involved with the position.
You may only need to check a box on your application indicating your interest in fellowships or you may need to submit a separate application and, in some cases, complete an interview. Check each school's requirements for funding applications before you apply.

, There are many nationally based scholarships available for all fields. Sites such as Peterson's and Scholarships.com have extensive lists categorized by your area of interest. Do the research on these scholarships well in advance. Make sure you fulfill all of the criteria and have the proper documentation -- these will be very competitive scholarships., Many professional associations ranging from the National Shoe Retailers Association to the Garden Club of America to the American Marketing Association offer scholarships for graduate study. Most offer student memberships so joining may increase your chances.If you’re unsure whether a professional association in your field provides scholarships, email the administration. If they don’t have scholarships, they may have other suggestions of places to try.

, If you were a member of a fraternity or sorority as an undergrad, contact the national headquarters to find out about graduate scholarship opportunities. Or contact the North American Interfraternal Foundation for information on scholarships they offer."

Consider the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC).,
Use GI Bill benefits if you are a veteran.,
Consider working full time for the college or university.,
Approach your current employer.",How to Pay for Graduate School3," If you contract with the Army at the beginning of your first year of graduate school you will receive 100 percent of your tuition, in addition to book allowances and stipends. After graduating, you must serve in the Army for three years of active duty or in the National Guard for six years, as payment for the free tuition.If you enlist in the Army ROTC, the summer before graduate school begins you need to attend its Leadership Training Course (LTC). This is a paid, month-long course that teaches you the basics of becoming an Army officer.
Be sure to speak with active duty veterans who have taken advantage of these opportunities before you sign up.

, This applies to active service for any branch of the military. There are also many scholarship opportunities if you are disabled as a result of your military service. You can qualify for the GI Bill if you meet the following requirements:You entered active duty on or after July 1, 1985.
If your obligated period of service is less than 3 years, then you must have served 24 continuous months. If enlisted for 3 years or more, then you must have served for at least 36 months.
You must not have declined the GI Bill in writing when you signed up.
You had your military pay reduced by $100 per month for 12 months ($1,200).
You have an honorable discharge.

, Many schools offer free tuition to full-time employees. If so, take a full time job at the college doing something related to your field if possible, or an office or service position if not. You can attend graduate classes part-time on evenings and weekends.

, Whether or not you already work in your field, find out if the company funds graduate degrees for existing employees to encourage their advancement. This type of employee incentive is most commonly offered in the business and technology fields. (Tuition assistance would be a good question to ask before you take a job.)


If the boss is paying for your graduate degree, he will expect you to perform well in both your classes and at work. If either slack, chances are good the company will no longer foot the bill.
When employers pay for graduate school they usually expect that you will remain with them, so they reap the rewards of your advanced degree. This agreement could be stated, written and signed, or implied.
If your degree is not related to your current job and you are in the United States you may need to pay income tax on part of the tuition which your employer pays.

Take out a federal loan to pay for graduate school.,
Borrow only what you need.,
Make sure you understand the loan terms.,
Ask a family member for help.",How to Pay for Graduate School4," Graduate students are eligible for an unsecured Stafford Loan that is not based on financial need. Assuming your advanced degree will increase your income, you will be better able to pay back the money after graduation. Pursuing a graduate degree is an investment in yourself, your future, and your earning potential. Like all investments, it sometimes comes with debt and risks.


Carefully consider how much you think you’ll be able to pay back after you graduate. If your job prospects are going to be challenging, taking out a loan might be a bad idea. You might want to think about working throughout graduate school and paying as much as possible at that time rather than relying on future earnings.

, If you get a fellowship of some kind of assistantship, you might not need to take out a loan. And based on what you do get, it’s likely you won’t need to take out the full amount you are eligible to take. There are times, however, when you need to avail yourself of the full amount of the Stafford Loan. If you attend graduate school full time, you automatically qualify for up to $20,500 each year for a total of up to $138,500, through the Stafford Loan program., The interest on graduate Stafford loans is 5.84% for the 2015-2016 academic year. Because it’s unsubsidized, the interest starts accruing immediately on the loan. You will not be required to pay back the loan until you have completed your graduate studies, plus a grace period of six months. Keep in mind that Stafford Loans also have a loan fee of 1.068%. This is figured as a percentage of the total loan amount. You will end up getting less money than you are actually borrowing because of the loan fee. You will need to pay it all back, including the loan fee, even though you never see that money.10 years is the typical period over which to repay the loan.
If your first job out of graduate school has very low pay, you may qualify to pay based on a percentage of your income, rather than the normal monthly payments., If you have a family member who is able to pay your tuition, then consider asking that person (or persons) for a loan. The average grad school loan carries an interest rate of 6.8%.If your family member is willing to charge you a lower interest rate for the loan, then you can save thousands of dollars on the cost of attending grad school.


Try saying something like, “I am worried about the high interest rates on loans for graduate school and I was wondering if you might be willing to offer me a lower interest loan for part or all of my tuition.”

If you focus on living frugally and saving a large portion of your income, you can have several thousand dollars saved to apply towards college expenses. While this may not sound significant, you can cover a portion of your first year costs, which means less work will be required during the school year to cover the remainder of your expenses (you may even be able to get ahead and start saving towards the next year)


This can also be a valuable opportunity to gain full-time work experience and boost your resume.
If possible, consider living with parents or roommates during this year to offset your living expenses. Assuming you are working at a full-time minimum wage job, you can expect an annual salary of around $15,000 – $16,000 per year.;
, This is an essential part of any plan to pay for college debt free. Working part-time during the school year and full-time during the summers can be an excellent way to offset expenses, and unless you are able to secure a full-scholarship, this will be a key component of your plan to pay for college debt free.


If you budget wisely, you can apply the money saved during the summer to the following years tuition. You can then use the money earned during the school year, in conjunction with some of the other options presented, to offset the remainder.

, Colleges and universities often offer their employees tuition discounts. If you can secure employment at a school that offers this arrangement, you will not only be offsetting your expenses via work, but you will also be reducing your total expenses through tuition reduction..


A recent survey found that 98% of colleges and universities offer tuition breaks for employees. This is why it is very important to either contact your school, or check their online job board to explore what opportunities are available. Make sure to apply for every opportunity you are qualified for.

, Joining the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, or Coast Guard may qualify you for education benefits available while you are on active duty or after you leave the service. Each service has its own program, so you will need to speak with a recruiter or counselor to find out what benefits are available and whether or not you qualify. The military offers up to $4,500 in tuition assistance for active members., This can help you get some college credits under your belt before you begin. Dual credit students pay a fraction of what regular college students pay for the exact same course, and AP exams are only $93 each!Dual Credit: Taking a class dual credit means that you are a high school student enrolled in a college class. You will get credit for high school completing the class, and start earning college credit before you even graduate!
Advance Placement (AP): This is an advanced high school class, at the end of which you will take a test to see if you learned enough to qualify for college. This is another way to start earning college credit in high school.
If you take a lot of college classes in high school, you may be able to graduate college early!

, Generally speaking, you can choose to attend a community, public, or private college. Each type of college has different costs, with private colleges being the most expensive, followed by public colleges, and community college being the most affordable.Private colleges are typically only a good option financially if you are a very strong candidate and are able to qualify for a financial aid package which includes scholarships and grants as opposed to loans. The application process can be long, and if you do not qualify for aid your education can easily cost over six figures. Consider this option if you have very strong academic and extracurricular credentials.
Public colleges are typically affordable, with the average year costing about $19,000 including living expenses. This is a good option to consider if you feel your application is not strong enough to get aid for a private college, and if you are planning on staying in-state.
Community college is by far the most affordable option, typically costing about $11,000 for a year including living expenses. If you are intent on saving money, consider doing a two-year program at a community college (at a lower cost), and then transferring to a public college for the final two years (assuming you are interested in a 4 year program). This can save money.
Look into tuition-free or loan-free schools and programs. Many other universities are tuition-free for all accepted students whose families make below a certain amount (pay special attention if your household income is $20,000-$60,000/year).A loan-free guarantee means that the school will cover the cost of tuition + room + board to make sure you do not end up with any debt at all. However, the school may require you to pay the ""estimated family contribution"" determined by your family's income. If you are in the $20,000-$60,000/year range, this EFC will be little or nothing.

, College programs are generally either two year or four year. Two-year programs are not only more affordable per year, but they are shorter so your overall tuition is much less. Which type you choose depends on what your interests are.


The main benefit to two year programs is that not only are they affordable, but they are often highly skills based. This means that you will likely learn a marketable trade or skill that you can immediately take out into the job market upon graduation. They also include the option to upgrade into a four year program.
Four year schools are typically about three times as expensive as two year schools per year, and are useful if you want a degree is a specific field like biology, chemistry, math, or many others. Often, four year programs are important requirements to pursue many professions, and in today's competitive job market a four year program is necessary to compete in certain fields.
Start by understanding what your interests are and what career you would like to pursue, and then see if it is better served by a two or four year program.

, You can choose to attend school full-time, part-time, or even online. If you are looking to get through post-secondary debt free, it is important to consider options other than full time study.


Part-time study can be useful because each year will cost less (due to less credits being taken). In addition, the rest of your time can be spent working, which can make the year very affordable. The major downfall is that your education can take double the time (assuming your doing 50% of a full-time course load.
You can also consider taking slightly reduced course loads every semester, which may just extend your overall education time by a year or two. This can make a big positive difference in your ability to fund your education.

, A public two-year college program costs about $11,000 per year (including living expenses) on average, whereas a public four-year university program costs about $19,000 per year on average. If you can live at home with your parents, you could eliminate a large portion of your first year costs.Even if you live off campus, you will be able to join any school organizations, and attend any school events you choose! Not living in a dorm does not have to prevent you from feeling like a part of the student body.

, Most colleges and universities now offer some, or possibly all of their course material online. Adding online courses to your course-load can allow you to work more hours while in school. Many students with families or higher expenses opt for online courses so they can continue to work full-time.


Even adding one or two online courses to your semester can provide you with the flexibility you need to potentially get a few more hours at work in.

, There are numerous sources that provide information on available scholarships. One excellent place to begin is with the U.S. Department of Labour's Scholarship search. This resource allows you to search over 7,000 scholarships, fellowships, and other financial aid opportunities. You can locate that resource here.


There are also other excellent resources like fastweb.com and collegenet.com. These types of websites allow you to search billions of dollars of potential scholarships, and even match the scholarship to your personal profile.

, If you are still in high school, your high school guidance counselor can be an important resource with regards to directing you to scholarships. Guidance counselors often know about local scholarships, and they are often familiar with the types of courses you are taking as well as your academic performance, and they can direct you to various scholarships that match your profile.

, If you are interested in a particular school, call and make a phone or in-person appointment with the financial aid officer. These individuals can direct you to potential scholarships available at your school of choice that apply to your situation.Make sure to be open with them regarding your personal and financial situation, as many types of scholarships are directed towards individuals with specific sets of personal or financial qualities.
Make sure to inquire about scholarships outside of the school that may apply to you.
Your financial aid officer can also assist you through the application process.

, Often times professional associations have specific scholarships available for students pursuing that career path (like nursing, for example). If not, they can often direct you to scholarships and financial aid that may be specific to your career.

, There are numerous books available that publish extensive lists of scholarships available for students. Some common and popular titles include the Ultimate Scholarship Book,The College Board's Scholarship Handbook, and Peterson's Scholarships, Grants and Prizes.


It is always wise to look through one of these resources to see if there are any important scholarships you missed.

, Some employers offer subsidies or even pay the full tuition cost for their employees. This is especially true for large corporations or even some public institutions. Contact the Human Resources office at your workplace and ask about what options, if any, are available for employees.

, Students often incorrectly think that there are thousands applying to each scholarship, whereas in reality the numbers can often be very low due to the huge volume of scholarships that are currently available. It is for this reason that you should apply to every scholarship you are eligible for.


Applying for scholarships may be time consuming, but it is a worthwhile investment. Take a full day (or even two) off to spend just filling out the paperwork or online forms for your scholarship if necessary. Even winning one scholarship can save you hundreds, or even thousands of dollars.

, The ability to budget and manage your money is the most important part of getting through college debt free. You will need to carefully control your expenses, and make sure you are religiously saving the difference between your income and your expenses to cover your tuition.

, Your main goal will be to get your expenses as low as possible. To do this, you must understand the two types of expenses, and how to reduce them. Fixed expenses refer to expenses that do not change month-to-month (like rent), and variable expenses refer to expenses that do change (like food, for example).


Your largest fixed expense will likely be your rent. Focus on trying to live with many roommates, as this can reduce your rent expenses. Living on your own or in a dorm can be costly, and by checking sources like Kijiji you can often find roommates with whom you can share costs. You can also split other fixed expenses with roommates, such as internet and utilities costs.
Monthly transportation, food, and entertainment costs are all variable expenses. With regards to transportation, try to find living arrangements close to your place of education. This will allow you to walk, and use public transit when necessary, which can reduce your transportation costs significantly.
Entertainment spending can often be tempting when in college, and can also be an important part of maintaining good social relations. It is important, however, that you pick a small amount for education spending that you stick to and never exceed.
Explore options that your college has in terms of meal plans. These may offer a discount to buying groceries, but be careful to compare the plan with the amount you would spend on groceries to ensure you are choosing the affordable option. Look into the possibility of working in the kitchen or as a server, as you are sometimes allowed a ""shift meal"" when you work.
Consider buying textbooks used online, or from other students. Textbooks at college or university bookstores are often much more expensive than buying used. Amazon offers a wide selection of used textbooks, and many colleges and universities have Facebook groups that act as a marketplace for students who need to books to get in touch with students who are selling.

, If a job in education, public service, a volunteer organization, for a federal agency, or as a doctor, nurse, or lawyer appeals to you, these are all fields in which, under certain circumstances, some or all of your debt can be forgiven.Talk to your advisor at school about these programs, which can vary from state to state.

, Once you have taken steps to reduce your expenses, it is time to create a budget that will indicate precisely how much you make, and precisely how much you can spend. The difference between the two is the amount that will go towards paying for tuition and other costs.


The first step is to add together all sources of monthly income. If you received a lump sum scholarship payment (that is not automatically deducted from tuition) divide the lump sum amount by the number of months in the school year. This is the portion you have available to use each month.
Next, tally up all your expenses. Keep in mind cost-cutting measures that were discussed to make sure your expenses are no larger than they need to be.
Subtract the difference. This is how much you have available to save each month. If you add together your monthly savings amount for the amount of months you are in school, this is the amount you will have to apply towards tuition and other expenses. If the amount is too small, consider reducing expenses more. If there is an area you are having trouble reducing expenses in, look online. There are plenty of resources devoted to helping people reduce expenses.

, Sticking to your budget over time can be challenging, but there are a few tips and resources that can help you stay on track.


Keep your savings in a separate account away from the money you use for day-to-day spending. This helps you prevent spending it. Considering opening a high interest savings account with your bank or financial institution as well, these accounts can allow you to earn a slightly higher return than your regular checking account, and this can help your savings grow.
If you have difficulty budgeting, consider using software like Mint. Mint allows you to sync your bank accounts with the software, and automatically tracks your spending, while organizing it by category. You can easily tell if you are exceeding your allowed amount of spending this way. If you are exceeding, Mint can tell you exactly where to help you reduce those expenses for next time.

Do your homework first.,
Choose your battles.,
Buy smart, buy quality, buy early.,
Take care of your books.,
Sell to a student, when they need it.,
Learn and improve your process.",How to Make Money Buying and Selling Textbooks," You need to know the ISBN, title, author, and edition number for each book you need for classes. You can get this from your syllabus, or from your campus bookstore. Some bookstores have tried to disallow taking notes in the store (!) so be discreet or just be bold. Better information will yield better results. For the majority of expensive textbooks, you want to compare prices, buy the official edition, and buy it as early as possible. You can compare prices on textbooks in a number of places. The specific place is not that important, as the final buying decisions will come from you.;
, Sometimes you just aren't going to be buying a book that is a good candidate to make money on, so just get it cheap, cheap, cheap. An example would be something like Moby Dick-- there are a million editions, and chances are you'll be better off getting a $1 copy than trying to make money.

, This is 90% of the battle. For each book, the lowest price will normally be in the marketplace areas of Abebooks, Amazon, or Half, but it's smart to check first. Once you have a couple of places to check, look at the individual book listings. You are looking for words like 'economy', 'softcover', 'international', etc. You do not want these books. You want the actual ISBN you are looking for, and you should accept nothing less. Read the descriptions carefully, and follow up any purchase with an email to the seller making your expectation of the authentic book clear. 'Fake' listings for less valuable paper editions are annoying, but they are also what allow you to make a few bucks buying and selling books. They depress the listing prices for student sellers that don't have the time to research the issue in depth. So there will normally be multiple copies of the real book, but with prices more in line with softcover editions. This all makes buying early even more important. Not only are prices better if you buy long before the term starts, but you may have to return a book if the seller is less scrupulous. So look for your actual ISBN, in the best condition (very good or better) that is significantly discounted off of the new price. You're looking for books in the 35% of new price range. They are out there. Get it ordered, send out a confirmation to avoid getting softcover editions, and get on to your next book.

, You want to be able to sell your book in very good or better condition. Avoid dropping, writing in, highlighting, or otherwise damaging your books. Keep the notes separate, since you won't be keeping the book anyway. If you can keep the covers somewhat glossy you're doing a good job. Often times you can sell books you purchased as 'very good' as 'like new'.

, Don't expect to sell your book a week into a new term. Many times you will need to leave your book listed through the next term so it will be in place before a new term starts. So just plan for that. You should list your book for sale on Amazon and Half, they are both free and pay pretty quickly. You might also try Craigslist as well, although you'll have to deal with accepting a payment yourself. When you list your book, make it very clear you are selling the original, hardcover, US edition textbook with the ISBN as displayed. Price it at a premium, but try to be cheap enough so that your book appears on the main display page (usually 5 books at each condition). As a quick check, run a buyback price comparison to make sure you aren't wasting your time selling yourself. Some books you may be able to sell immediately for more than you bought it for. You can check multiple buyback vendors, but chances are, a marketplace is the best bet.

, If you're just starting school, you've got 15-20 terms to do this. There are a number of things that will get easier as you get familiar with the process and the language of book listings. So if you're patient, if you're early, and if you're careful, I do believe you can finish school making money on your books instead of spending it.

Use your summer legal job to defray costs.",How to Pay for Law School," When calculating the potential costs for law school. You must consider the cost of tuition and fees, room and board, student health insurance and books and supplies.


In 2012, the average cost of tuition and fees for a public law school as an in-state resident was $23,214 and for an out-of-state resident it was $36,202. The average cost of tuition and fees for a private law school was $40,634.Room and board costs will vary depending on the location of the law school. Law schools provide this information on their websites. For example, Harvard Law School stated that for a moderate standard of living, students should budget for $21,373 over the course of nine months.UNC School of Law tells students to budget $17,008.The costs of books and supplies for an academic year can run between $1,000 and $2,000. In addition, you may need to purchase a computer which could cost on average between $700 and $1,500.If you already have health insurance through a parent or a spouse, you may be able to avoid this cost. However, law schools often require students to demonstrate that they have health insurance and if not, require them to purchase a student health plan. Student health plans can cost between $1,800 per year to over $3,000.;
, Before applying for law school, it is important to consider how much you can afford to pay, strategize on how to save money, and plan how to reduce the cost of law school while continuing to meet your financial obligations.Your law school budget will be similar to a regular budget with the addition of law school related expenses. Your budget should include expenses for three years of law school and the summer after you graduate.

, Your budget must include all of the costs associated with law school. If you know where you want to attend, you can search the school’s website for the schedule of costs and fees or you can use estimated costs based on the amounts set forth above.


Calculate the costs for travel and transportation. The cost of travel and transportation will be dramatically impacted by whether you can take public transportation, walk, drive or bike to school. As a guide, Harvard Law School recommends budgeting $1,500 a year for travel costs and UNC Law School recommends $1,442 a year.Calculate the cost of all other financial obligations. When considering this budget item, calculate the cost of cell phone bills, credit card payments, clothing allowances, food allowances and any other costs that you are responsible to pay.

, In creating your budget you must also include any sources of income that you may have while a law student including, money from family members, savings, income from a part-time and/or summer job, and student loans

, Once you have calculated your financial obligations and subtracted that from your sources of income, you will have a good idea of how much additional resources you will need in order to pay for law school, if any.

, By planning for law school as soon as possible, you give yourself the largest period of time to save money for law school. In order to save money for law school consider the following:


Get a part-time job. If you are a college student who plans to attend law school right after graduation, you should consider getting a part-time job just to save for law school. This may not be feasible for all students, especially for those already working, but if you can work, you should work to offset your law school costs. If you are already employed full-time, determine whether your schedule permits an additional weekend job.
Lower your living costs. Once you have made the decision to apply to law school, you should consider tightening your budget and reducing your overall expenditures. Place any money that you save in a separate account specifically for law school.

, If you know that you are interested in working in the public interest sector (i.e. government or not-for-profit organizations), you should consider law schools that offer loan forgiveness programs. Over 100 law schools over loan repayment assistance programs (LRAPs) that provide repayment assistance or full repayment of law school debt for public interest law attorneys. While you would have to take student loans out to pay for school, once you secured a public interest position, your school would make your loan repayments for you.Here is a list of schools that offer LRAP: http://www.equaljusticeworks.org/resources/student-debt-relief/law-school-lraps/list-law-school-lraps.

, Merit-based financial aid awards are usually awarded based on the strength of the applicant’s profile including grades, law school essays and other application questions. These financial awards can be used to reduce the overall cost of your tuition.


You should apply to schools that are known to give a significant amount of scholarships to law students.
Once you are awarded a merit-based scholarship, you can negotiate with the school to secure an even higher award.For a list of the public law schools that provide the greatest amount of financial aid go to: http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/finaid-public-rankings.

, In addition to any financial aid package offered by a law school, you should also consider applying to outside scholarships. First, you should conduct an internet search for “law school scholarships,” and review any relevant scholarships. You should also explore the following scholarship opportunities:


There are a number of scholarships that support underrepresented minority groups including women. You can find some diversity scholarships listed here: http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/the-scholarship-coach/2014/03/13/make-your-case-for-these-law-school-scholarships. However, you should also conduct an internet search for “diversity scholarships for law school” in order to locate as many scholarships as possible.
The Federal Circuit Bar Association offers a number of scholarships for law students. To see the scholarship rules visit: http://www.fedcirbar.org/Pro-Bono-Scholarships/Scholarships/Rules-Applications.
The Goodman Acker Scholarship Program provides law school scholarships to undergraduate students who have been accepted to law school. Information on these scholarships can be found at: https://www.goodmanacker.com/our-firm/community-involvement/scholarship-2015/.

, Another way to make law school more affordable is to choose a law school near a family member’s home. By staying “rent free” at a family member’s home, you can significantly reduce the overall cost of law school.

, If you need to take out loans to pay for law school, you should take federal loans first. A law student can borrow up to $20,500 per academic year in Federal Stafford Loans. These loans offer students in-school deferment and forbearance options.


With subsidized student loans, the federal government pays the interest while you're in school so long as you are registered at least half-time. These loans are not based on financial need and a law school determines the total amount of loans required to pay for its tuition and costs.
With unsubsidized federal student loans, the borrower is responsible for paying the interest while in school. If you choose not to pay your interest while in school, the interest will continue to accrue and then “capitalize.” Capitalization means that accrued interest will be added to the principal/amount that you originally borrowed. If possible, you want to pay the interest before it capitalizes., There are a number of private companies that also lend money to law students. Often, these companies do not offer the same protections offered by federal student loans and may not allow you to “lock in” a low interest rate. If you need to borrow private law school loans, it is recommended that you take out the least amount possible., If you're trying to avoid paying interest, you may be able to work out a personal loan with a family member who has the money to finance your education. Over the course of the loan, this may save you a significant amount of money.

, A part-time job won't cover all of the costs associated with law school, but it can help you pay for the amount not covered by financial aid or reduce the amount of money you take in loans. You should be cautious about how much time you work during law school. Having a job while in school may negatively impact your academic performance and ultimately affect your ability to secure a good job., If you are interested in working for a large law firm and you have very good grades, you may be able to secure a summer associate position during the summer after your second year of law school. In 2013, summer associates at top-paying law firms earned $3,156.39 in take-home pay a week. This money could nearly pay for an entire year of tuition."

Look around to see which schools in your area offer the best programs to meet your interests, and shop around to compare the cost of similar programs nearby.Consider public schools rather than private schools as private schools generally cost considerably more than public schools.
Consider going to community college for the first two years of an undergraduate degree for general requirements and then transferring to save on degree costs.
If cost is a factor, you may want to avoid ivy league schools specifically. Unless you are able to secure a substantial scholarship, ivy league schools are some of the most expensive (though prestigious) colleges in the world.;
, On average, only 41% of undergraduate college students graduate with a bachelor's degree in four years. Every additional year you're in college means an extra year of tuition, books, housing, and other expenses, and it also means an extra year lost that you could have spent in the work force. When applying to colleges, look at each school's graduation rates, and make sure you don't overexert yourself if you're working while in school so that you can graduate on time., You'll most likely apply to a number of different schools, but you should look at what kind of scholarships and financial aid each school offers. A college that is willing to give you a full or partial scholarship could save you a lot of money, compared to a school that does not offer any merit-based or need-based financial aid.To find out what scholarships are available at a school you're interested in attending:


contact the school's financial aid office and speak to a representativetalk to a guidance counselor at your current high school (if you're still enrolled in school)check the U.S. Department of Labor's free scholarship search engine at http://careerinfonet.org/scholarshipsearch/ScholarshipCategory.asp?searchtype=category&nodeid=22, for students in the United Statestalk to a representative from your state's grant agency to find out about grant options that might be available in your state (for US students). Find information at http://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/state/index.htmllook into outside scholarships available in your community through local organizations, religious institutions, and businesses near you, Dorm life can be a fun way to socialize and meet new people, but it's also expensive. If you can live at your parents' home for free while attending school, do so. You'll save thousands of dollars each semester, and that money can be spent on books, gas, and tuition.If you're going to school too far from home to commute, look for roommates to share the cost of housing. Look for off-campus apartments, as on-campus housing tends to cost substantially more money.Compare the cost of living in different neighborhoods near your college by searching for apartment listings online at websites like Craigslist or Trulia. If you shop around, you might find that some neighborhoods are a little bit cheaper than others because of factors like lack of access to public transportation, longer commute times, and so on.

, Biking is a free means of transportation (other than occasional tune-ups) and a great way to work out. Or take public transportation, if it's available in your area. There are a number of websites, including The Denver Post's news site, that feature a calculator to determine how much you could save by taking public transportation instead of driving every month. , The cost of textbooks can put a significant financial burden on most students, but it doesn't have to. Most students will not re-read textbooks after a given class ends, so why pay extra for a brand new book that you'll only use for a few months?


Buy used. Many textbooks are available used, either in your school's bookstore or online at websites like Amazon.Share a textbook with friends or roommates who are also taking that class. You can chip in on a used textbook and save even more money.Rent textbooks, either from your school's bookstore, or from online booksellers like Amazon. You can also rent e-books, if they are available for the classes you're taking, and save even more money.
Check your school's library for textbooks you need. Many colleges have a section for textbooks, and once you have your class syllabus, you can borrow the book you'll need from the library for free. Make photocopies of chapters if you need to highlight or underline passages to help you learn the material. Return the book when you're finished, and you will have saved a substantial amount of money.

, Credit cards may seem tempting to students struggling to make ends meet, but credit cards do not give you free money. However, owning a credit card and paying off your bills on time is a great way to establish and improve your credit score rating. Just be careful so you don't end up in even deeper debt down the line.Start with a low credit limit. You may even want to opt for a secured credit card, which requires you to deposit a predetermined amount of cash to back your spending limit.Pay your bills on time, every month. This is the best way to responsibly use a credit card in order to improve your credit score rating., Use a notebook or a spreadsheet to keep track of how much you spend every month on expenses like groceries, bills, clothing, gas/transportation costs, eating out, and rent. Then find ways to cut back on your expenses.Avoid eating out whenever possible. This is an easy way to cut back on expenses, and eat healthier at the same time.Keep new clothing purchases to a minimum. Opt for thrift stores, or look for special sales at department stores.

, College cafeterias are convenient for on-campus meals, but they can also be quite costly. Instead of dropping money every day at the cafeteria, save money by buying bulk groceries and storing them in the refrigerator at your dorm or apartment.If you do purchase an on-campus meal option, be sure to choose the option that's right for you. Most colleges offer bundles, depending on how often you anticipate you'll eat at the on-campus cafeteria. If you don't think you'll eat at the cafeteria three meals a day, seven days a week, then opt for a cheaper option that fits with your needs.Find out if your college offers a student food pantry. A growing number of colleges and universities now offer food pantries where low-income students can acquire free canned goods and packaged food., Serving your country in exchange for tuition assistance is a good way to go to college for less --- or even for free --- while getting experience. Here are some options:


The Armed Forces tuition assistance gives enlisted and officer military members up to $4,500 annually for tuition and fees.
The Post 9/11 GI Bill will pay 40% to 100% of tuition and fees at an in-state public college or university or up to $17,500 at a private or foreign school for members who have served at least 90 days on active duty since September 11, 2001.
The Reserve Officers' Training Corps will pay for most and often all of your college tuition and fees. In exchange, you are obligated to join the military after graduation.
Each service arm of the military also offers their own tuition assistance benefits for active duty and reserves. Click here for a chart.

, If you can delay going to school for one year, you can use that time to work full time and save up money for school. You may even be able to take online courses during that time. Aim to work 40 hours per week, but if you can manage working 60 hours per week, even better. Set up a savings account at your bank or credit union so that you will not be tempted to use that money as disposable income., Even if you cannot or do not want to take a year off to work and save up money, you can still work while you're in school. Campus jobs may be ideal for a working student, since they are likely to be more understanding about working around your class schedule.

, If you qualify for the Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program, you can earn minimum wage or higher, often while working in a field relevant to your studies. Many FWS part-time jobs are on campus, though some are located in the community nearby your school. The best part is that most work-study jobs are flexible in determining what hours you are available to work, so you can build your work schedule around your class schedule every semester., Internships are an excellent way to gain valuable experience in your field and earn a strong recommendation that could help you land a lucrative job after college. Some internships are unpaid, but many offer a competitive salary, and you may be able to get college credit for your internship as well., Students in the United States who enter the workforce employed full time by a government agency (local, state, or federal) or by a non-profit organization with tax-exempt status are eligible for Public Student Loan Forgiveness. Under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, post-collegiate workers who took out Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans, Direct Consolidated Loans, Direct PLUS, and Direct Stafford Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans make 120 income based repayments, income contingent repayments, or pay as you earn repayments, after which point the remainder of that worker's student loans are forgiven."

Stay clear of low-yield state prepaid plans and other government backed accounts.


It's probably a little late for that, huh? See if your parents will match whatever you save in your college fund. Come up with some sort of compromise -- in today's day and age, college cannot be paid for without some help.;
, The government knows that tuition prices are getting absolutely ridiculous. As a result, they're budging...a little. There's now such a thing as a 529 plan account that parents can open up that allows money to accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free, as long as it's used for educational purposes. It can even be started years and years in advance and doesn't necessarily have to be done by a parent.


It can even be kicked to another kid. There's tons of flexibility. And students can contribute too! It's all about thinking about the long-term.

, The quicker you can get out of college, the better. Mapping out your course-path is one way, but getting classes out of the way even sooner is a great idea, too. Your high school probably offers AP classes or has joined up with a local community college to give their students credit. Take advantage of it! It's so much cheaper!


If your high school doesn't have an established program, ask about doing it anyway. You can spend the last period of your day at your local community college or university taking a legitimate college course that can start off your college transcripts. The only person you really have to get past is your guidance counselor!

, Straight up, learning to play the bagpipes isn't the most lucrative hobby. If you enjoy something that you can make money at, do it. You won't have a ton of time to work as a student, but what free time you do have should be spent doing what you love. What's more, it could result in scholarships!


Make music. Playing a musical instrument in a band or orchestra can earn someone many scholarships regardless of major. You might also get paying gigs at birthday parties and such.
Play football. In a scene where athletic scholarships in other sports are a mere pittance or nonexistent, football has tons of athletic scholarships and can help lower-achieving students attend colleges they would have otherwise been unable to attend.

, Just because you're in high school doesn't mean you can't squeeze in a few hours of work here and there. And as for summer? Full time, baby. Banking a few thousand dollars for a couple summers while you still live at home will seriously dent the damage done to your wallet that first year of college. Whether it's detassling corn, working the orchard, or bussing tables, it'll be worth it.


Being young has its definite advantages. If you don't have employment, you can proclaim you're working on your ""college fund"" and relatives and neighbors may find work for you to do. If you're car-less or otherwise unable to work for a legit company, don't be above asking for odd jobs around the neighborhood. Shoveling snow may be the best paying job you ever have!

, In general, in-state tuition is much cheaper than out-of-state tuition and public schools are much less expensive than private schools. However, know that some colleges claim to meet full financial needand others may seem expensive but have great financial aid plans. Do your research before you write anything off.


75% of the colleges on the meet-full-financial-need list rank in the top 25 in their rankings categories.These are very, very good schools that want to help you out! When it comes to aid, often where there's a will, there's a way.
The cheapest option is to start at a community college and transfer later. Sometimes the credit doesn't always transfer, so be sure to do your research before you plan on this option. If it works, it can save you tens of thousands of dollars.

, You may think those private schools are out of your budget range, but often private schools compete with their public counterparts by offering more grants and aid.Just because it has a loftier price tag doesn't mean you should avoid it. If they have a good program, apply.


In general, in-state colleges are cheaper. But again, it all depends on the amount of aid you receive from each institution.
Apply to several so you can leverage them against each other. If you have two (or more) colleges that are interested in you, they may up their offers!

, Stanford University, for example, will pay the tuition of students with family income under $100,000 per year; and students whose families earn under $60,000 get free tuition, room and board paid by the university.Set your sights high. If you get accepted to a great university, tuition may not be a problem.

, That's the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and it can be filled out as early as January 1st. The deadline is around June 1st, depending on your state and school, but it is widely suggested you fill it out as soon as possible to get all your financial ducks in a row.If you're unfamiliar with the FAFSA (for starters, where have you been?), it's a form you need to fill out to receive any federal aid to go to college in the US. Without it, you won't receive any grants or loans from the government! Travesty.

, Whether you've applied to just one school and have been accepted or have been accepted to a few, you have the power to negotiate. Often schools say aid is ""non-negotiable""; however, that's just another way to say ""they'll adjust it instead.""Use your power!


If you're set on one school but your financial aid is a little lacking, go in to the financial aid office and make an appointment to discuss the terms. Instead of going in and demanding more money, ask why you were awarded what you were awarded and how you could qualify for more. In addition, relay specific terms that could not be addressed in the FAFSA. Is your family taking care of an aging relative? Do you have a move coming up? Did a parent lose their job? Sometimes these things can be taken into account and applied to your aid.
If you've been accepted to several schools, inform them that you're weighing your financial aid options and will make your decision in the coming weeks. Some schools may up the ante to get you to attend their institution.

, Scholarship programs in your state can greatly reduce tuition costs for simply maintaining a high GPA and or doing volunteer work. There are numerous private scholarships that can be stacked, allowing you to piecemeal a financial aid package for yourself.


Dunno where to find scholarships? Well for starters, the Internet.In addition to the larger scholarships, your school should be able to provide you with a list you can apply for. The financial aid office should be able to pinpoint you in the right direction -- just make sure you're on top of things! Some deadlines come quite early.

, If you maxed out your federal aid and are iffy on the private student loan situation, there is an option for parents to take out loans. So long as you haven't had a credit mishap in just the past 60 days, you should qualify.Private parent loans are a bit harder to come by and the process is a bit more stringent. However, you have dozens and dozens of options when it comes to this realm.

, An academic financial aid agent will help you find the best scholarships, and they truly know the financial aid landscape and can find tax deductions which can help you get maximum benefit from need-based grants that may be available to you, even if you are a billionaire.


53% of federal financial aid in the US is actually given to those in the upper quintile ($60,000 gross income and above) because they are more financially literate and can find deductions where others might not.

, ROTC cadets are eligible for scholarships covering tuition, fees, and textbooks for 4 years, plus a monthly stipend. In return, students take ROTC courses along with their regular classes, promise to serve after graduation (time varies). Over 1,200 schools offer ROTC programs in US.

The Army requires 4 years active duty and 4 years in reserves.
The Navy requires 4-5 years of active duty.
The Air Force requires 4-6 years of active duty and 10 years for cadets trained as pilots.

, That number each school spits out each year that sums up the estimated cost of tuition and fees is just that -- estimated. You don't have to spend every penny of that number if you choose not to. Know where you can fudge a little.


This number usually includes a fairly extensive meal plan. You can have the meal plan for a month or two to see if you need it, but odds are you may not. Many students are happy with just one meal at the dining halls a day.
One word: textbooks. Not only are they sometimes not even necessary for certain classes, but sometimes they can be found online at places like Project Gutenbergor Freeload Press.If not, some campus have book swaps (very literal) or have books available at the library. That's a hefty chunk of change saved!""Board"" is a malleable term. A single room with a bathroom is going to cost a lot more than some co-op housing where you get a reduced rate for cleaning the kitchen periodically. If you don't want to pay for it in the first place, consider more meager living conditions.

, Yeah, yeah, yeah, most students at some point hit a crap-I-hate-this-and-I-want-to-do-something-else stage, but if you can avoid it...do. Planning out your major -- and the classes you'll take -- guarantees you graduate in 4 years. Fact of the matter is that nowadays, most students don't. And spending 5 years in college is an 125% of the 4-year cost! No thank you.


If you do it really, really well, you can graduate in 3 or 3 1/2. You don't have to abide by the 4-year rule, you know! Map it out and see where you have some wiggle room. (There's always a summer class to make it fit!)

, Many schools have jobs specifically for students that need the extra cushion in their budgets. And you can gain valuable work experience, too! Indicate that you're interested in work study on your application form and you may be privy to a list of jobs not open to the public.


Many work study jobs can lead to better, bigger opportunities. A work study job at the front desk of a dorm can lead to becoming an RA -- and that could mean free room and board.

, If you can get around the ""you have to live on campus"" option, it'll save you thousands and thousands of dollars right outta the gate. Can you live at home with your parents or with a nearby relative? Schools will waive the requirement if you have an understandable commute.


If that's not an option, research the dorm options. Some schools have co-ops that are cheaper or less-equipped rooms offered at a more affordable rate. If you're dubious, it's only for 9 months!

, Though it may seem like it's super expensive on paper, it may actually result in saving money, depending on what the alternative is. Think about it: you get your meals cooked for you and don't have to spend money on the small things, like toilet paper. Now that's a win.


Going Greek isn't for everyone and it does involve a sum of money up front and a very specific lifestyle. If it's not for you, it's not for you. Don't force it.
For some campuses, going Greek may be more expensive. If you're spending thousands on new dresses and social events, it's not the way to go about saving money.

, Just because you're studying doesn't mean you can't get off your butt and work. Even the odd babysitting job can help pad your wallet. In addition to work study and hitting up your local Chili's for a waiting gig, look into freelance work. Consider it your beer money:



Tutoring. If you've got good grades, this one is a no-brainer. You'll make a pretty decent wage just for teaching someone else stuff you already know. Your university should have a tutoring center you can apply to.

Modeling. In addition to university ads, local businesses may hand out hefty sums to college students for simply appearing in their ads. Teen model photo contests will sometimes offer large cash prizes which can hugely dent that dreaded bill without costing too much time. Over spring break and summer you can find local gigs without cutting into your study time.

Photography. You can bag some serious cash behind the lens, too. Photograph weird weather, fires, traffic accidents and such. Your town newspaper may buy these images from you for up to $100.00 per image.

Financial need is a calculation from information included on your FAFSA, or federal financial aid application. It takes into account your family's income (usually but not always your parents, with modifications for single-parent families), the number of children in your family, particularly college-aged children, and investments or other assets your family might have. These factors are used to determine how much your family can afford to pay for your college education -- your Expected Family Contribution.Use a calculator like the FAFSA4caster, found on the FAFSA website, to estimate your family's financial need.;
, This stands for Free Application for Federal Student Aid and is the standard financial aid form for colleges and universities in the United States. Fill out this form and submit it to each school you're applying to by their stated deadlines. Make sure all information is correct to the best of your knowledge, and supply any documents or other proof if necessary.


This does not mean you're attending and does mean you have to accept anything – you're simply showing interest and getting a quote. It is completely standard procedure.

, Each school has its own application process, so check with each school you're applying to to figure out exactly what needs to be submitted and when.


Most schools will require a copy of your recent tax documents, and other documents or forms may be requested as well. Double check each school's requirements, and contact their financial aid officers if you have questions about applying for need-based financial aid.
The financial aid application process may be different for transfer or international students. Make sure you follow the right process for your background and education.

, If you've gotten into several different schools, you've likely received several different financial aid offers. Don't just pick the biggest one. Instead, consider the cost of attending each school as compared to their offer. Many schools promise to match other offers you get, so negotiate with a school's financial aid office to try to get a better deal.


Think about the types of aid you're getting. Loans may be helpful now, but you could end up graduating deeply in debt. Work study programs will help you pay for your education, but could end up distracting you from your studies. Decide what type of aid you like best, or pick a mix to minimize your risks.

, Submit an updated FAFSA and tax forms annually. Make sure you keep your school's financial aid office informed about any changes in your financial situation, and pay close attention to deadlines.


Your school may even offer you more money later if you get good grades and show your potential. Once in a while there is scholarship money ""left over"" that you could be eligible for if you stay on top of your game.

, Most people think of college as going to a public or private university. In reality, there are plenty more options, like community colleges – and they're much, much cheaper. You can find a local one to avoid the costs of moving, too.


What's more, most, if not all, of your credits will transfer. You can go to a community college for one or two years on the cheap and then move over the a state or public university. If your grades are really good, you could even be up for more scholarships.

, Nowadays, having a bachelor's in something doesn't mean much. Plenty of people graduate from college and go back to food service. You don't have to go to a legitimate university to get an education and to get a good paycheck – vocational schools can make that happen, too.


Check this out: 50% of college grads are unemployed or underemployed. Meanwhile, trade workers with skills are in huge demand. 40% of surveyed employers in a recent survey complained that they couldn't find enough.Going to a trade or vocational school may be a much, much better move.

, There's no reason you should have to devote all your time and money to a full-time education. Take a few classes at a time if that's all you can afford – and that way you can keep working, too. Every school offers different levels of involvement. You could go part-time or you could just take one class. It's up to you.


Look into taking classes taught by part-time teachers. Part-time teachers are paid less and therefore taking their classes usually costs less, too., While many online schools are a joke, there are a growing number that are not. They're cheaper and save you the cost of transport. What's more, you can do them on your own time, so you can still work if need be. They're also a good transition into a full-time college career down the line as many credits will transfer.


If you are looking to transfer later, look into the policy. Be sure you're attending an accredited, respected online institution before assuming. Take a look at the colleges you want to attend, too, and check if your credits would transfer.

, A growing trend in the realm of technology and education is the MOOC -- a massive open online course. Some are available for credit or certificate and some aren't, but they're springing up all over the place. It's a course that's videotaped or recorded at a university and 100% of it is put up online. It's essentially attending a whole bunch of different online universities.


Look at Harvard and MIT's websites, for example. You can peruse their courses and launch into whatever interests you.
There are also websites like Coursera that coordinate with dozens of schools to provide varied, coordinated curricula. You can take their classes for free with or without a certificate at the end.

, This type of program is where you spend one semester studying full-time and the next working full-time. It's not based on financial aid and only offered at certain institutions; if it's offered at one you're looking at, it's worth a shot. On average, students going this route earn as much as $7,000 per school year.This also gets you work experience in your field from the get go. You're making money and building your resume at the same time. In addition to these perks, many colleges take the work experience as school credit. It may not take you that much longer to graduate if your job is in line with your studies.

, Find a local university or community college and look up their auditing policies. Some schools will let anyone interested audit large classes, while other schools allow only full-time students to audit. Find a school that will let you audit, consulting the registrar or other officials where necessary.


Ask the professor for permission to audit the class. Email the professor well before the first class meeting and explain your interest, background, and educational status. Tell the professor why you want to audit the class, and politely ask permission. If they say no, respect their wishes and don't take it personally -- some professors are concerned about the level of involvement of all of their students, and having people audit the class can interrupt that.
Be engaged in the class in order to get as much as possible out of it. Treat it as you would if you took it for credit. Attend every class session and complete all homework assignments, even if you don't turn them in. Engage with the material, and discuss it with the professor outside of class if possible. This will help you learn the material and get the most out of your college experience.

, Point blank, living at home can easily save you more than $10,000 in your college career.And don't forget the money you'll save on food, too. Living in the dorms is expensive, it can lead to worse grades, and it throws you into a new environment that sometimes leads to quitting. If you stay at home, the transition will be easier and easier on the stretch of your pocketbook.


Let's not forget that this prolongs how long you can depend on your family for. Home-cooked meals, family outings, and a nice house to live in for free? Yes, please.

, Textbooks are getting ridiculous. $400 for a wad of paper and ink? No thanks. Don't bother getting new ones at the bookstore – buy used textbooks online. They're infinitely cheaper and can get you through the class just as well.


You can even rent textbooks now, too. A quick online search will result in plenty of websites that can hook you up with exactly what you need for a fraction of the price. It's not like you need to keep the book anyway.

, Apart from scholarships and need-based financial aid, there are grants and loans. Here's the details:


You don't have to pay the money back for grants. They are academic, talent, and need-based. The Pell Grant may be one you're familiar with, and that's a federal program. It likely will be indicated on your FAFSA. But you can apply for other specific, private grants, too.
Loans do need to be paid back. Your school will include this recommendation on the FAFSA if you qualify. You can also take out private loans if need be, and your parents could take out a Parent Plus Loan, too, if desired.

, Look at your school's policy when it comes to Advanced Placement Program (APP), the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP), and the Provenience Examination Program (PEP). With these programs, you take an exam in a subject (or two or three or four) and if your score is high enough, you can get college credit. Almost sounds too easy, doesn't it?


Every school has a different policy. Talk to your academic adviser about your prospects. Why is this helpful? It could mean graduating at least a semester early, which could save you thousands of dollars.

, Once you're a student, you may be eligible for work-study, a program where only certain students are up for certain campus jobs. If you do qualify, you'll be notified. You'll then be sent a URL where you can check out all the available jobs and apply. Often the competition is less competitive than for an off-campus job.


These are often part-time gigs that understand you're a student first. They'll gladly work around your class schedule and accommodate you as much as possible. If you're lucky, you'll land one where you can study on the job.

, You'll need to take the ASVAB test, which stands for Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, and it's a test taken to qualify for enlistment. It's generally offered to high school students, but anyone interested in enlisting can take it. Different branches of the Armed Forces require different scores for enlistment GED holders will generally need to score higher than high school diploma holders. From there you can talk to a recruiter and enlist.


Why is this pertinent? Soldiers are eligible for up to $4,500 per year in tuition assistance while they serve and the military and numerous online universities offer programs intended to work with your schedule while you serve. What's more, after you leave the military, go to college for free. Under the current GI Bill, 100% of your tuition and fees for a public college and up to $19,198 for private schools will be covered. The bill also gives you an allowance for books and, in some cases, a one-time payment to help you move., Colleges usually offer grants or partial scholarships. Look for programs or scholarships from outside sources that can help with the remaining cost. Apply for as many of these scholarships as you can to reduce the cost of your education as much as possible.


Once you are in college, maintain the academic standing required of your scholarship. Most grants or scholarships require that you maintain a certain GPA or otherwise remain in good academic standing. Continue to work hard and get grades high enough to keep your scholarship for as long as you need it.

, Athletic scholarships are highly competitive, and they only go to the best players in a region or state. If you're not the best player on your team and in your region, getting an athletic scholarship will be difficult. Practice and work hard to improve in your sport. Contact coaches at colleges you're interested in.


The best athletic schools might overlook mediocre academics, but if a scholarship comes down to you and a similar player with better grades, chances are it'll go to the other person. Because of this, keep your grades up, too. Being proactive about getting recruited will put you on the coach's radar as an athlete. Since you came to them, they'll know you're interested in their school and will be more likely to consider you.
While this scholarship can help you get a top-tier education for free, it comes with a cost. You'll have to spend upwards of 20 hours a week practicing your sport, which can keep you from investing in the academics of college. These scholarships are also re-awarded each year, so they can be taken away if your coach doesn't feel you need or deserve it each year.Consider lower-division schools, too. While you may dream of playing for your favorite Division I school, these scholarships are much more difficult to get.

, The ROTC also offers scholarships if you're looking into joining the military. For most ROTC programs, you will serve four years of active service and four years with the Individual Ready Reserve, during which you can be called back to active duty. For certain positions, this commitment may be longer or shorter. For instance, pilots usually commit to 10 years of service. ROTC programs operate in over 1000 colleges and universities in the country. Decide on, apply to, and gain acceptance to one of these schools. If necessary, specify that you're applying as an ROTC student. You can then apply for the scholarships from there.


Make sure you fulfill the basic requirements for an ROTC scholarship. For high school students, you must be a US citizen between 17 and 26 years old, have a GPA of at least 2.50, have a high school diploma or GED, score a minimum of 920 on the combined math and verbal SAT or 19 on the ACT (excluding the writing portion), and meet certain physical requirements.In order to keep your scholarship, you must maintain certain physical and academic standards throughout your college career. Make sure you stay physically fit, and keep your GPA above the required minimum (2.50 or 3, depending on your branch of ROTC). Scholarships can be taken away if you fail to meet the necessary requirements, so be aware of your standing within your program.
After college, fulfill your service commitment. ROTC gives you a free college education, so be sure to honor your commitment to service in the armed forces.

, Do you have an unusual hobby? Are you from a minority or military background? Are you a first-generation college student? What are your talents and interests? Write down everything you can think of, and make a note of anything that might help you land a scholarship. There are tons out there that you may qualify for.


Use reputable websites like CollegeScholarships.org, FastWeb, or Scholarships.com to search through many available scholarships. Research everything you can think of to find scholarships that you might qualify for, or look through a list of scholarships for those that fit your background and interests.
If applicable, put together a portfolio, promotion video, or other material to display your skills. Scholarships in the arts generally require proof of the quality of your work. For writing, photography, or art, put together a portfolio to display the quality and diversity of your work. For dance, music, or other talents, make audio or video recordings of your best performances. These don't need to be fancy, but they should show off your talent as well as possible.

Find or take a photograph of the face you wish to make a portrait of.,
Trace the image on grease proof paper (such as wax paper), outlining each of the three colours.,
Melt the white chocolate.,
Pour the melted chocolate in a piping bag and start working on the lightest colour of the portrait, using the outlines you drew as a guide.,
Repeat the previous two steps with the milk and dark chocolate until you have filled in all of the page.

,
Turn the picture upside down.",How to Make a Chocolate Portrait," Upload or scan it into a computer and use imaging software to change it from colour to black and white. (If you have Photoshop, convert to black and white then save as a 4 color gif, which will provide a ""posterized"" effect.) Adjust the brightness and contrast until you have three distinct tones. If the picture turns out too complex at this point, find or take a simpler one for your personal skill level.;
, After doing this, put a piece of strong cardboard of the same size behind the paper and tape the image onto it, so that the chocolate doesn't flop and slide everywhere later.

, The best way to do this is by using a double boiler. A small pan containing the chocolate is placed in a larger pan with boiling water, and the chocolate is stirred constantly until it melts. Putting it in the microwave doesn't give the chocolate the nice smooth texture that you'll need to make the portrait.
A double boiler with dark chocolate is shown for demonstration purposes.

, Once the white chocolate has been painted, place the portrait in the fridge to cool and harden.

,, To avoid touching, melting or breaking the chocolate, place a piece of cardboard on top of the portrait. (You should now have the portrait sandwiched between two pieces of cardboard.) Hold the cardboard together firmly at the edges and flip the portrait. Detach the cardboard from behind the portrait and peel off the greaseproof paper. Place the piece of cardboard back on, flip the whole thing right side up again, and there you have it, a custom chocolate portrait!

Apply for new scholarships and grants.,
Offer your services as a tutor.,
Get paid to take notes.,
Watch for emails asking for note-takers.,
Advertise your services yourself.,
Proofread your classmates' essays.,
Study the honor code carefully.,
Take advantage of your strong typing and computer skills.,
Visit Career Services.,
Enter academic competitions.",How to Make Money as a College Student1," A lot of students think that they are only eligible for funding when they initially apply for admission. This is a mistake! There are often new scholarship opportunities for upperclassmen, though they aren't always widely advertised. You may also be able to apply for external scholarships or grants, which are offered from groups outside of your school.


Begin by scoping out bulletin boards on campus and paying careful attention to email announcements.
You can also search online for new funding opportunities, and there are apps that you can download for free (or for very little, such as the app Scholly, available for just $.99) that can help you tailor your search.;
, One of the best ways to learn a subject is to teach it. By becoming a tutor, you can hone your own knowledge of your field of study, perform a valuable service to others, and earn some needed cash—it's a win-win scenario for everyone involved!


You can often get paid through your school to tutor other students in classes you have completed and done well in, or you can advertise your own services to your fellow classmates.
To find tutoring opportunities, meet with your advisor or your professors, or go to the campus tutoring center.

, You are hopefully already taking careful, thorough notes in your classes for your own benefit. Why not make your efforts pay out double?


It's fairly common for students who need special arrangements because of learning disabilities to be assigned a (usually anonymous) note-taker for their classes.
These positions are usually compensated—you can often make up to $10 an hour for every hour of class.You'll take careful notes, type them up, and email or drop them off at disability services, where they will be passed on to the students who need them.

, Once a fellow students' needs are documented, disability services will contact the professors and ask for volunteers in the class to take notes, and your professor will in turn email the class.


Respond quickly before your fellow cash-strapped students snag the job away from you!

, You can also contact disability services directly to see if they have a need for note-takers in the courses you are taking, or you can advertise your services yourself to your fellow classmates.


If you advertise yourself, make sure that you aren't violating class or university policy.

, If you excel at writing and editing, you can hone your skills and get paid for it at the same time by offering to proofread your classmates' papers for a reasonable fee.


Spread the word among your friends and roommates, and consider posting fliers which advertise your services.

, If you do get work proofreading, be careful about how you offer feedback and make suggestions for revision. You should be very familiar with your school's honor code and rules regarding plagiarism.


Double-check the particular professor's policy about sharing written work with others, too. Some professors assign take-home essays that are more like exams, and they forbid students from talking to one another during the writing process.
If you rewrite, instead of proofread, someone else's paper, you both could be brought up on academic fraud charges, and you could face serious consequences, to include being expelled.

, If you are a fast and accurate typist, if you are great at creating interesting presentations with sophisticated graphics, or if you excel at creating tables and graphs to represent data, you may be able to get paid to teach and help other students with their assignments and hone your own skills at the same time.

, Most campuses have a Career Services office which counsels students on job market possibilities, and which helps prepare them for applying and interviewing as they near graduation. Don't think, however, that you should only use this resource as a senior.


You can often find advertisements for paid internships and part-time work in your field of study at the Career Services office.
Finding these opportunities early in your studies will not only help you excel in your field and build up your resume, but can add some much needed cash to your wallet while you learn.

, You can pretty regularly find advertisements for essay contests and scholarly competitions (such as science or engineering competitions) which offer cash prizes for the top performers.


Be on the lookout for these opportunities by regularly checking the bulletin boards around campus (begin by looking in academic departments and the library), going through your email carefully, and by going directly to your advisor and/or professors to see if they know of any such competitions for which you may be a good fit.
Even if you don't win, you'll get experience in your field, make connections, and build up your portfolio or work.

Make an appointment at the financial aid office to see if you can still apply (or reapply, if your financial situation has recently changed).


There are all sorts of jobs available on campus, from working in the dining halls, to performing administrative work in academic departments, and even working at campus theaters, where you'll have access to free performances or movies!

, This program provides part-time work opportunities for students with financial aid, and guarantees that you'll be paid at least the federal minimum wage.Whenever possible, the positions available are relevant to your area of study and are civic-minded, aimed to serve the public interest., If you live in the dorms, are an active participant in dorm and campus activities, have a good grade point average, and enjoy working with and counseling others, then becoming an RA (resident assistant) could be a great opportunity for you.


While you may not bring home an additional pay-check for being an RA, you'll usually get either free or greatly reduced room and board, which will then free up money for your other expenses. At some schools, though, you may receive a stipend as an RA., Scope out bulletin boards on campus for advertisements looking for volunteers for psychology studies or medical experiments.These usually pay a flat rate, though at some schools, you could make up to $20 an hour doing something as simple (and possibly as interesting!) as filling out questionnaires., Before you agree to participate, make sure that the experiment was approved by an Institutional Review Board or a Human Subjects Participant Program. This will help ensure that your rights and physical and mental well-being are protected., If you can't find opportunities to participate in research on campus, go to the US Government's official clinical trial website to find legit trials in your area. You can also visit the webpages of local hospitals to see if they are looking for participants., One of your biggest expenses may be the cash you have to set aside for textbooks. You can usually get a good chunk of your money back at the end of the term by selling back your books.


Campus bookstores will sometimes buy back books, but many campuses also allow independent companies to set up shop at the end of the term. You can also scope out used bookstores in the area to see if they buy used books.
To improve your odds of being able to sell a book (or fetch a good price for it), take care of your books throughout the semester, and avoid marking up the pages with notes and highlighters.

, It's hard to succeed in school (or at at any job!) if your work materials are a messy nightmare. Spend some time developing your organizational skills, and then advertise your services to your fellow classmates, and possibly even your professors.


Offer to help your clients go through their files (either paper or electronic), and help them come up with a method for sorting and arranging their work that they can manage on their own.

, College student usually aren't known for keeping spotless rooms or staying on top of their laundry. If you don't mind doing either of these tasks, and if you can stand the mess and stink, consider getting paid to clean dorm rooms or do laundry for your lazier classmates.

, If you are talented at doing nails, hair, or make-up, consider advertising your services to your classmates, especially before big events like sorority formals or Valentine's Day.


Research what local salons charge for services, and then undercut their prices to the point where you'll still be making a profit, but will be an affordable option for your fellow classmates.

, It's not a secret that college students get the munchies! If you're good at baking (or even just scoping out good deals on prepackaged snack items), take advantage of your classmates' perpetual hunger.


Post fliers with tantalizing pictures of your baked goods, or visit the library and other hot study spots at key points in the term, such as midterm and finals week.
If you're a night owl, then you're sure to find students on the prowl for a good snack in the wee hours of Friday and Saturday (or even Thursday, at some party schools!). If you decide to sell to the night crowd, though, it's a smart, safe move to work with a partner.

, If you live in a state which accepts bottle redemptions, you can make easy money by collecting and returning soda cans.Consider making a small investment in a large plastic garbage bin, line it with a sturdy plastic bag, and decorate it with signs: “Place your used soda cans here!”. Place the bin outside your dorm, and then all you'll have to do is sort through it before bringing it to the redemption center.
Make sure that you aren't violating dorm policy by doing this. So long as it's allowed, you may also be able to go through any other recycling bins that are set up on campus.

Serving or tending bar in restaurants, working as a hotel or restaurant valet, delivering food (which usually requires you to have your own car and insurance), or doing street performance are good options., Hit the pavement and check out the local businesses around your area. You may be able to find part-time work that fits around your school schedule.


While you should check the classifieds regularly for posted job ads, understand that not all businesses use these, and you may have better luck if you inquire in person about possible job openings.
Be prepared with a copy of your resume and look presentable when you first go to the shop. Don't pop in on your way home from the gym! That won't leave a good impression!

, The process of finding an available job can be simplified by enlisting the help of a temp agency. They can sort through all the ads for you, and already have established relationships with local businesses.While the agency will take a portion of your wages, temp jobs tend to pay fairly well, and you can be clear about what your availability is around your class schedule.
Another advantage of working through an agency is that you can turn down work if you are having a particularly busy week or month at school.

, If you are responsible and good with children, you can often find steady work as a baby-sitter or nanny.


Research the going rates in your area; as a college student, you may be able to demand a higher rate, particularly if you are an education major (or psychology, pre-med or nursing student, have certification in CPR and/or first-aid, etc.). In some cities, you may be able to make up to $15 an hour., These businesses screen and run back-ground checks on their sitters. Many parents are more comfortable placing their children in the care of sitters who have been vetted through this process.

, You may also consider offering your services to your professors. If you are their current student, they may not feel comfortable (or be allowed to) hire you, but they may be able to recommend you to other of their friends and colleagues.

, If you are already spending time in a home taking care of children, you may be able to make some extra cash by going above and beyond.


For example, you can offer to do laundry and wash dishes for an extra fee (perhaps $10 more) on top of your regular baby-sitting rate., If baby-sitting isn't your thing, you may find fulfilling and lucrative work by tutoring or coaching elementary or high school students.


Contact the local schools to see if they have children who might benefit from your services or to see if they have part-time coaching positions available.
You may also be able to find these sorts of jobs by going to local organizations like the YMCA or YWCA.

, If you connect better with animals than people, then you may be able to find work that puts you in contact with our non-human friends, which will be good for both your mental and your financial health.


Advertise your services as a dog walker or pet sitter. You can place fliers (dog-parks and local veterinarians are great places to start) or advertise on-line, but don't overlook the importance of networking with people you know.
You may even want to think about opening a pooper-scooper business. Cleaning up Fido's business is no one's favorite chore, but armed with gloves and the proper tools, it's an easy enough job. You'll also be provided with steady work!, If you're young and strong and like to be outside, then starting a business in which you do yard work or landscaping could be right up your alley.


Be able to switch up your services as the seasons change: have access to a lawn-mower and weed-whacker in the warmer months, and switch out to warm clothes and a shovel once the cold hits.
If it snows a lot where you live, buying a snow-blower could be a solid investment. If you're an early bird, you may be able to make money by offering to scrape the ice off cars in the early hours before people have to go to work. You may be able to find several clients in your own neighborhood or at a single apartment complex.

, If you own your own car, are insured, and have a good driving record, then there are various ways you can put your car to work for you.


You may be able to find work delivering papers, driving fellow students (to the airport, to run errands or go to appointments off-campus), or you can even open up your own delivery service. For example, you can get paid to grocery shopping for those who are home-bound while you stock up for your own pantry.
If you have a truck, you probably already know that you (or rather, it) is in high demand, especially come moving in/out day on campus: offer your services as a mover—for a fee, of course!

, Do you know anyone who is planning to take a long vacation, or has your professor mentioned their plans to travel overseas on their sabbatical? If so, you may be the perfect candidate to house-sit.


This is a particularly great gig: you usually won't be asked to do much more than watch over the home, collect mail, water the plants, perform yard work as necessary, and perhaps care for pets. Beyond that, though, you'll get to live in a home that's probably far nicer than yours for a few days or even weeks.

, Let your family, friends, and professors know about your availability to house-sit. It's usually best to try to find a friend-of-a-friend (or a coworker or boss of a friend or parent, etc.)


Your immediate friends and family members may expect you to help out for free and be insulted at your request for payment., Why not perform a valuable service for others while getting paid at the same time? Depending upon whether you are giving blood or plasma, you can usually make in the range of $20-45 per “donation”.


You will need to meet certain eligibility requirements before you'll be allowed to donate, though, and there are limits to how often you can donate.
Read up on the American Red Cross's donation guidelines before you commit, or check in with the hospital or clinic where you'll be donating."

Make more Hershey's Kiss roses, then arrange your bouquet.",How to Make a Chocolate Bouquet1," You will need two Hershey's Kisses for each rose. Your bouquet can have as many ""roses"" in it as you want. If you want a more traditional looking rose bouquet, get 24 Hershey's Kisses; this will make a dozen roses.

For an even more rose-like bouquet, use red or pink Hershey's Kisses.;
, Carefully pull out the little paper tab from each Hershey's Kiss. Do not unwrap the candy, however; if the foil comes undone, twist it back together. It's okay if the paper rips--just make sure that it's not visible on the actual Kiss., Place a glue dot or a piece of double-sided tape on the bottom of a Hershey's kiss. Place another Hershey's Kiss on top to make a diamond or rosebud shape. Repeat this step for the rest of the Kisses.Use the same color of Hershey's kisses for each rosebud.
Glue dots are an item used in scrapbooking; they come on a strip, like tape.
Do not use actual glue for this.

, Clear cellophane will work the best, but you can use iridescent cellophane as well. If your Hershey's Kisses were silver, consider using translucent red cellophane instead., Pick up a Hershey's Kiss rosebud and choose an end to be the top. Place a cellophane square over it. Make sure that it's centered, then pull the ends together at the opposite end, like a lollipop.Do just one rosebud for now.

, Hold the rosebud by the bottom with one hand, keeping the wrapped cellophane together. Use your other hand to slide the tip of the skewer or lollipop stick into the cellophane. Twist the cellophane around the stick.Do not press the stick into the chocolate.
If you are using lollipop sticks, make sure that you use the longest kind you can find, otherwise they will be too short.
You can also use florist sticks or short, thin dowels.

, Begin wrapping the tape around the cellophane at the base of the rosebud. Gently tug down on the cellophane until the rosebud stands up on the tip of the stick. Continue wrapping it past the twisted cellophane., Continue winding the tape down the length of the stick. Overlap each row slightly so that no gaps show. When you reach the bottom of the stick, tear the tape off, and press it tightly against the stick.

Consider adding silk 1 to 2 rose leaves; tuck them against the stick while wrapping it.You can buy packs of fake rose leaves from the bridal section at an arts and crafts store.

, Finish all of the roses first. Fill a vase with some vase filler, then stick the roses inside. You can include some real or fake roses as well. Finish the look off by wrapping a ribbon around the vase.

If you add real roses, tuck a matching Hershey's Kiss inside it.
For a fancier rose, wrap some ribbon around the stem, like a candy cane.

Schedule the tasting for mid-afternoon or mid-evening.,
Choose your guests.,
Choose your menu.,
Purchase enough chocolate for everyone to taste.,
Create a sheet for notes.,
Set up a table with each chocolate on its own plate.,
Provide a palate cleanser, such as plain bread or crackers.,
Give everyone a brief talk about chocolate tasting.,
Compare notes.",How to Have a Chocolate Tasting Party," You want it to be after people have eaten and feel satisfied, but before they actually feel hungry for the next meal., A small group of 6-8 is best for interactionand for costs. Invite people who are interested in savoring food, rather than just gobbling it up. People who like wine are more likely to enjoy a chocolate party.

, There are many different kinds of chocolate to choose from. Select a few different kinds of chocolate you have never had.


You can select organic and fair trade chocolates, and talk to your guests about how chocolate is made and how the cacao industry works.
For a fun twist, throw in some chocolates that are made with sheep's milk or goat's milk. There are also chocolates made with chilies, figs, bread, and curry (although not all in one bar!).
You can also expose your guests to chocolates with a much lower sugar content than they're used to. At first, it'll seem bitter, but challenge them to notice flavors that would otherwise be overshadowed by sweetness.
Another potential theme is choosing chocolates that are made in your region, if there are enough. Look in the closest city with a chocolate shop or chocolatier.

, There should be enough for each of your guests to have two squares of every bar. Remember that this is a chocolate tasting party, not a chocolate eating party.

, It should look like a spreadsheet, with columns for aroma, flavor, texture, finish, and the chocolates you've chosen listed on the left. Make copies and have them ready for your guests, along with pens or pencils.


If you want to encourage people to mingle, put the chocolates in a different numeric order for each sheet, so you have, say, two random people at one chocolate at any given time.
If some chocolates are sweeter than others, be sure to have your guests taste the sweetest ones last.

, Break up the chocolate into pieces along the lines etched into the bar.


If you want to be extra fancy, stack them up like a little pyramid.
Be sure people have a way to know which chocolate they're tasting, such as by having an unopened bar next to the plate. If, however, you don't want your guests to know which chocolate they're tasting - like if you don't want their perceptions of a certain brand to taint their opinion, or you want to see if people taste the difference in organic or sheep's milk chocolate, use generic labels like ""Chocolate 1"" and reveal what they are later.

, Also provide water and napkins.

, You might find the article How to Taste Chocolate useful. The important thing is to impress upon everyone attending that they're there to taste the chocolate consciously and deliberately, rather than wolfing it down.

, At the end of the party, ask everyone what their favorite chocolates were and why. If you're feeling generous, perhaps offer a bar of each guest's favorite chocolate for them to take home with them.

Choose a white chocolate.,
Pick your food coloring.,
Warm oil-based coloring in advance.,
Bring a double boiler to a simmer.,
Decide when to add the food coloring.,
Place the chocolate in the smaller container.,
Stir until melted.,
Add the dye slowly.,
Temper the chocolate (optional).,
Let the chocolate set.",How to Color White Chocolate," The ingredient list should tell you whether a white chocolate is made with real cocoa butter, or with a cheaper vegetable oil substitute. Imitation products are less likely to seize (turn gritty) than real chocolate. Experts tend to back real chocolate in terms of taste, but some brands of imitation chocolate compete well in blind taste tests.Use freshly purchased chocolate. Chocolate suffers in flavor and texture when stored too long, especially if it's the real deal.
For detailed chocolate artwork, use a thin dipping or coating chocolate.;
, Even a drop of water can turn your melted chocolate into a gritty mess. For best results, buy powder or oil-based food coloring from a specialty baking store or online.You can use the instructions below with regular liquid food coloring, but the process is much more difficult.


Oil-based food coloring is best used for light colors, since too much of the coloring can add a bitter taste and stain mouths.These food dyes are more concentrated than liquid dyes. They will stain clothing, skin, and countertops.

, As though keeping the chocolate dry weren't difficult enough, chocolate can also seize if the food coloring is a different temperature than the chocolate. If you are using oil-based food coloring, raise it above room temperature first.(Keep other types at room temperature.)


Place the closed bottle in a zip-locked bag. Remove as much air from the bag as you can, then seal tightly.
Submerge the bag in a bowl of warm water for 10–15 minutes. The water should feel comfortably warm to the touch, not scalding.
Shake the bottle once or twice during the process to distribute heat evenly. Replace water if it has cooled to room temperature.
Remove the bottle from the bag and dry it thoroughly.

, If you do not have a double boiler make one from a large pan, plus a heatproof mixing bowl or small pan that can sit atop the larger one. Start with just the large pan, uncovered. Heat 1–3 inches (2.5–7.5 cm) of water until it reaches a low simmer.


Dry the top container and a stirring utensil thoroughly while you wait, even if they don't look wet. A rubber or silicone stirrer is ideal, since wooden spoons may contain absorbed moisture., The timing depends on which type of food coloring you are using. Read the full instructions below before you start, since you may need to change the order of the steps:


Add powdered dye as soon as the chocolate starts to melt.You can add oil-based dye after the chocolate melts, as long as you warmed the dye as described above.
Liquid dye is less likely to cause seizing if added right away, before the chocolate melts.(This is why there is no need to warm the dye in advance.)

, Put the chocolate into the top portion of the double boiler, which should still be at room temperature. Place this container on top of the simmering pan. The indirect heat from the steam will warm the chocolate slowly, keeping it below seizing temperature.


If using a chocolate bar, break it into small pieces of roughly equal size.
Make sure your hands are completely dry. Any moisture could ruin your chocolate.
If using chocolate with real cocoa butter, you may set aside 1/3 of the chocolate for later use. This is only necessary if you want your chocolates to look glossy.

, White chocolate burns very easily, and should never get above 115ºF (46ºC).Keep the heat on the lowest setting, or turn it off completely if melting a small batch of chocolate. Stir slowly and constantly until smooth, then remove from heat.


If the instructions above call for adding the dye before the chocolate is melted, see below for more information.
If melting a large batch of chocolate (several pounds or kilos), a chocolate thermometer or an instant-read thermometer with 1 degree increments is highly recommended.Keep the chocolate between 100 and 110ºF (37–43ºC)., Most powdered and oil-based food dyes are more concentrated than the common liquid type. Add in small increments and stir in thoroughly before deciding whether to add more.


Shake bottled food coloring well before adding.
If the chocolate seizes (turns gritty), remove it from heat and stir in a neutral-flavored vegetable oil a spoonful at a time. The chocolate will usually smooth out again, but this can affect the flavor., If your white chocolate contains real cocoa butter, it may end up dull and slightly soft after melting and setting. This doesn't affect the taste, but you can restore the gloss if you like by ""tempering"" the chocolate. There are many ways to do this. Here's a common approach that doesn't require any extra equipment except an accurate thermometer:Remove the chocolate from heat and wrap a towel around the base to keep it warm.
Add chopped, unmelted chocolate until you have a ratio of 1 part unmelted chocolate to 2 parts melted.
Stir constantly until the chocolate reaches 80–82ºF (27–28ºC), and all the chocolate has melted.

, Many chocolatiers cool their chocolate slowly at room temperature, so it is less likely to crack or sweat. Others prefer to let it set in the refrigerator for 10–20 minutes, which may work better if your kitchen is warm or humid.Store your finished chocolate in a cool, dry room away from light.


For best results, place paper towels in your refrigerator to absorb moisture.
If you are pouring chocolate into molds or using it as a dip, keep it warm until you've finished working with it.

Meet for an interview if you are selected to do so.,
Wait for a decision.",How to Get Into Harvard University," Though admissions officers won't be breaking down your door just because you have a near-perfect GPA, having excellent grades will keep you in the running for admissions to the college. Most Harvard applicants fall within the top 10-15% of their class, so you should aim to be within this range to be seriously considered. If your GPA is well below this range, the other parts of your application will have to be incredibly impressive to make up for it.


Maintaining excellent grades in high school tells admissions officers that you are a hard worker and that you will be able to keep up with the rigor of the courses at Harvard. You can show that you can stand out in other parts of the application.
You should demonstrate excellence in all of your academic subjects. Though you can be stronger in some subjects and weaker than others, you should be an exceptional student in almost every class.
Don't be discouraged if your GPA isn't quite as high as you wanted it to be. If your grades have improved from your freshman year until the time you apply, officers will be impressed, and if there was a dip in your grades because of a personal situation, you can explain it in your essay.;
, Doing extremely well on your SAT or ACT and AP tests will show admissions officers that you are a hard worker with stellar academic achievements. Just like having a perfect GPA won't make you a shoo-in, a high SAT score and strong AP test results won't guarantee you a spot in Harvard, but it will keep admissions officers interested in your application.


Don't be worried if your school doesn't offer a ton of AP tests. Not every school offers 20 different AP tests, and the admissions officers will know if your high school does not. Just try to do well on the tests that your school does offer.
Make sure to take your tests at the right time. If you want to impress Harvard with your SAT score, you'll have to take it well before the application is due. Take the test during your junior year to give yourself enough time to retake it if it's necessary.
Check Harvard's requirements for the last possible test date for the ACT or SAT. It's always just a week or a few weeks after the application due date, but you should already have an excellent score when you apply.
Harvard also requires you to take two SAT II tests.
Don't forget to have your score reports sent directly to the Harvard admissions office.

, Though your grades and scores will prove that you are capable of academic excellence, your extra curricular activities will make you stand out as a unique individual who is invested in pursuing his interests. Finding two or three clubs you're interested in and making an effort to excel in those areas and even reaching a leadership role will show that you are a dedicated, well-rounded individual.


Remember to have quality over quantity. Really standing out in just one or two clubs is much more impressive than joining five or six clubs just so you could mention them on your college application.
Become a leader. Don't just join a club, but run for secretary, or even president. In most clubs, you'll have to work your way up from a smaller leadership role to the head role.
Start your commitment during your freshman year. You should join clubs and other activities early on so you can show a record of dedication and commitment.
Show your leadership skills by joining the Student Council and working your way up to be the president of your class.
If you like writing or using technology, join the school paper or yearbook.
If you like politics or debating, join the Model United Nations team or debate team.
If you love languages, join the French or Spanish club.
If you love to act, be a part of the school's theatre troupe (theater).
You can also join a club or organization outside of your school that has to do with a religious institution or your local community.
Don't be discouraged if you don't have a lot of time to pursue interests outside of school because you have to work after school. Though you should still do the best you can, you will be able to put your work experience on your application as well.

, Though you don't have to be an Olympic athlete or a world-class musician to get into Harvard, participating in a sport or joining the school band will make you stand out. Though clubs can be time consuming, taking a sport or playing an instrument requires for you to practice or compete almost every day after school so it shows a deep level of dedication.


If you join a sport, try to work up to a leadership position. Remember that you don't often have to be the best athlete to be the team captain. You have to be the most dedicated or most well-liked.
Remember that while many sports require ten or more hours of commitment a week, you can also do a sport for just one or two of the three sports seasons. For example, you can run cross country in the fall, but take the winter off to focus on your studies and clubs, and then run spring track the next season.
If you play an instrument, you should also strive to gain a leadership position in your team's band. Quite a few colleges look at musical excellence.

, Volunteering in your community is a great way to show your generosity and your big heart. It is also a great way to impress admissions officers. There are countless ways to volunteer in your community, whether you're doing it through your school's Key Club, or finding opportunities through your local youth center or nearby charities. Here are some great things to do:


Volunteer to help children learn to read in your local library.
Volunteer in an old age or veteran's home in your area.
Volunteer in a local homeless shelter or soup kitchen.
Volunteer to clean up your community at a local park clean-up event.
Help build homes for Habitat for Humanity.
Spend your summer volunteering or building homes in a foreign country.

, Though your summer is supposed to be a vacation, if you really want to impress Harvard, you can't just spend the summer lounging around in your bathing suit and watching reality TV. Though you should take some time to decompress from all the hard work you've done, you should also find a way to continue following your dreams and pursuing your interests. If you do nothing over the summer, admissions officers may think that you don't take initiative unless you're actually in school. Here are some things that you can do:


Travel to a foreign country or a language camp to pursue your interest in a foreign language.
Take a summer class in something you like at a local college.
Spend more time developing your talents. Go to band camp or boot camp for soccer players.
Get an internship at a place that relates to your interests. If you like science, try to get work in a lab.
Get a job and work hard. Admissions are often impressed at students who take the initiative to pay their own way into college rather than relying on their parents to cover the exorbitant costs.

, Your essay should do two main things: it should show the admissions officers what an original, interesting, and driven person you are, and that you have top-notch writing skills. You should take the time to write an essay that is meaningful to you and leave enough time for yourself to proofread it when you're finished. You can find the guidelines for the essay on the last page of the application. It should be 250-500 words long. Here are some tips. Be original. Write something that only you could write. Show what makes you special.
Show your strong character. Tell a story that demonstrates your persistence, work ethic, creativity, or even your ability to learn from your mistakes.
Be compelling. Hook the admissions officers from your opening line, and keep their interests with your lively language, varied sentences, and engaging topic.
Be concise. Don't go over the word limit. Admissions officers will be reading thousands of essays, and they won't appreciate it if you can't follow directions.
Some popular admissions essay topics include writing about your achievements in a club or a sport, describing your family and background, or writing about a life-changing experience.
Get feedback. Run your essay by a trusted friend or family member and your English teacher, if you can. They can help you catch grammar mistakes, and they can also tell whether your essay had its intended effect.
Always proofread your work. When you're done, check your essay for grammar and punctuation mistakes. Remember that admissions officers aren't just interested in the content of your essay, but also by how well you can write.

, Harvard requires you to submit two teacher evaluations to give more insight into your performance in the classroom. Pick two teachers who know you well and have a unique perspective on your strengths in your classroom and your character.


A teacher can describe your excellence in his or her classroom, as well as your contributions to the class discussion. Pick a teacher who has really seen you at your academic best. If your teacher is also your athletic coach or club leader, he can add even more dimension to the recommendation.
Pick two teachers from two different subjects. Don't ask your sophomore and junior year English teachers to write recommendations, or it may look like you only excel in one subject.
Pick someone who you know will write a knockout recommendation. Ask older students if they recommend a certain teacher, or if there's a teacher who has a reputation of being late with the recommendations or not writing anything too specific. You should not only pick a teacher or person who has a close connection to you, but someone who you know will write something detailed and positive.

, Though you should generally avoid making your application bulkier than it needs to be, if you really feel that you have an exceptional talent to show Harvard that does not fall into the traditional application, send it along. Remember to show discretion. Only share these materials if you feel that you are truly exceptional in some way.


Add in why you are a good candidate for the school. Explain how you want to help improve the world and how going to Harvard would help you achieve it. But try to keep the explanation brief.
If you are an exceptional musician, you can send a tape of yourself playing music.
If you're an amazing actress, send along a tape of yourself in your latest school play.
If you're an award-winning creative writer, send along a short story.

, You will have to fill out either the Common Application or the Universal College Application for Harvard. This is the place where you will provide information about your biography, your family, your extra-curricular activities and work experience, and your honors, activities, and work experience. Do this thoughtfully and in a way that shows you know how to follow directions.


Be thorough. Fill out all of the space you are given without going over the limit.
Write neatly. If you're filling out your application by hand, demonstrate your diligence through good handwriting.
Be impressive. Describe your activities and honors in the most impressive way possible. You don't have to lie to make the most of your accomplishments.

, If you forget at item of the application, you will not be considered for candidacy. Keep a checklist of all the items you need before you mail your application in or submit it online. Here's what you need:The application.Your essay.
Your SAT or ACT score report. You should arrange to have the testing company send the scores directly to Harvard's admissions office.
Your two SAT II score reports. Again, these should be sent to the admissions office by the testing company.
Two teacher reports (recommendations).
The Harvard supplement. This is a short application that will provide more information about your academic and extra-curricular interests.
Your financial aid application (if you qualify).
The school report and mid-year school report. Fill out the information on the top of these and hand them to your school guidance counselor. The school report should be turned in by your counselor before your application is due, and your mid-year report should be turned in in early February.

Remember that if you are accepted to Harvard, your final school report will also be turned in, so you should maintain a record of excellence.


Your application fee or application fee waver. The application fee is $75.

, The Harvard application process involves a series of steps accomplished over a period of several months. If you're applying for admission for a fall term early or for the regular admissions deadline, you need to turn in your application on time. The application will be available by mid-August, and you should get a head start on it. Here are some important dates to remember:Early Action candidates should apply by November 1 and will receive notice by December 13th. Harvard recommends that these candidates turn in their application by October 15th.
Regular Decision candidates should apply by January 1st and will receive notice by March 28th. Harvard recommends that these candidates turn in their application by December 15th.
If you really want to go to Harvard, apply early. The decision is non-binding, so you'll have until May 1st to make your decision and to compare financial aid packages from colleges if they are necessary. Though Harvard states that you will not get an advantage for applying early, you should do so to show your commitment to Harvard. You'll also feel more at ease if you know you've been accepted to Harvard early!
If you apply Early Action, you won't be able to apply to any other colleges early. The only exception is if you also apply to your local public institution.

, Once you apply to Harvard, you may be asked to meet an alum for an interview in your local area. You should go to this meeting to show that you are truly interested. It won't make or break your chances of getting in, but if you really want to go to Harvard, then you should do everything you possibly can to make your Harvard dream a reality.


Be prompt, polite, courteous, and engaging if you do meet.
Prepare a few questions to ask about the Harvard experience.
Don't worry if you're not asked to have an interview. This could just be because it was difficult to arrange a meeting between you and someone in your area.

, Once you've turned in your application, there's not much that you can do but wait for the decision. You can state whether you'd like your decision via email or an official letter on your application. In the meantime, here's what you can do:


Maintain a record of excellence. Though you can relax a little bit, this is not the time to slack off, cut class, or stop being a stellar student. Harvard will take your mid-year and (if you're accepted) final reports seriously.
Plan a campus visit. If you haven't already visited the campus, check it out to see if it feels like a good fit for you.
Apply to other colleges. Harvard is a dream school for even the most amazing student, so make sure you're applying to some safety schools as well as other ivy league and prestigious colleges.
Don't obsess. There's nothing you can do to change the decision once your application is in the mail, so enjoy your senior year and do what you normally do.
React appropriately. If you get in, throw yourself a big party! And if not, don't sweat it. It may feel like your dream school, but you'll be having the time of your life at another amazing institution before you know it. Of the 34,303 students who applied for Harvard's class of 2016, just 2,706 were admitted. Don't be discouraged if you feel like you've met every requirement and still didn't make the cut.

Pull out any items that are still in good condition, make sure they are clean and wrinkle-free, and then take them to a local consignment shop.You should be able to walk away with cash in hand. Just try not to spend it all on new clothes while you're there—unless, of course, that's why you wanted the extra money in the first place!

, If there isn't a good consignment shop nearby (or if you think you may be able to make more by selling your items yourself), you may want to consider selling your no-longer-wanted-or-needed possessions online. Craigslist and eBay are two popular sites to try.Think about offering up your clothes, shoes, bags, accessories, exercise equipment, and/or electronic equipment. So long as it's in decent condition, you can usually find a buyer for nearly any item.
You'll want to take high resolution pictures of your items, and be sure to offer a clear, complete description of the item. If you have warranty information, manuals, or brochures that accompany the items, you may have better luck making a sell.

, You can also set up shop in your own yard (or drive-way, or garage). Many areas have active yard sale scenes, and it takes minimal work for you to be able to meet up with those who are looking for great deals.


Post fliers around your neighborhood, and remember to place an ad in your local paper if they advertise garage/yard sales.
Be willing to negotiate with buyers, and don't set your expectations too high when you set your prices. At best, you may only be able to fetch 25% of the original price you paid for an item. , If you are good with the written word, you should be able to find plenty of opportunities to write (or edit others' work) online.


Search for freelance writing and editing gigs. The rates for these jobs vary: you may be paid by the word, be offered a flat rate for a project, or in some cases can be paid an hourly rate. You typically won't be able to retain copyright over your work or collect royalties, however. Even so, by doing freelance work you can build a portfolio and make valuable connections which may later pay off with more stable job opportunities.

, If you want your work to remain your own, and if you want the freedom to write about whatever topics interest you, you can think about creating your own website or blog. If you get enough followers, you can start to bring in revenue through advertising.


You'll only make a few cents per click on the ads on your page, but with enough followers, this can add up for you over time.

, If you prefer visual media and are great at creating videos which are funny or informative, you may also be able to make money by creating a YouTube channel with advertising.


See our related wikiHow on how to earn money on YouTube.

, Do you love do-it-yourself projects? Are you able to knit, crochet, work with wood, or craft hand-made jewelry? If so, you may find a good client base by setting up shop on sites like eBay or Etsy.


You'll need a PayPal account, a good camera to take quality pictures of your crafts, and a way to organize your orders.

, If you have basic computer skills and don't mind doing repetitive work, you may be able to find work stuffing envelopes, doing data entry, or working as a telemarketer from your home.


These jobs typically can be done in your spare time and require minimal training from the employing company.

, If you already spend too much time surfing or shopping online, you may be able to find a way to turn your time-wasting past time into a profitable venture. There are various business which offer you small amounts of money to take surveys (such as iPoll.com), download apps or listen to music.


The money you'll be able to make will probably only amount to pocket change—you'll be offered a few cents to a few dollars per task—but it can add up over the course of time, and will certainly help you feel less guilty about the occasional latte splurge.

, There's a lot of potential money to be made in the mobile app business. If you've got an idea for a great new app that can either provide people with a fun diversion or help them organize their life or learn in creative new ways, you may be sitting on potentially lucrative idea.


There are many tutorials available which offer helpful advice, and you can even create an app if you lack coding experience. See our related wikiHow on how to create an app.

Carefully screen applicants—it may be a good idea to begin searching for a roommate among your friends and classmates. Be sure to draw up an agreement between the two of you outlining how bills will be handled, and make sure you aren't violating your current lease if you bring in an additional person to your home.

, Books are a large expense for any college student, but it's not a good idea to forego purchasing them at all. There are, however, various ways to potentially save hundreds on your book costs over the course of the school year.Once your reading list is available, begin by checking the prices in the campus bookstore, but them look elsewhere for better deals.

, You can usually find cheaper options (both new and used) online or by going to local used bookstores, who often buy books from students at the end of the term.


Given that professors often use the same texts from term to term, you may be able to score much cheaper versions of the book. You may even be able to check the text out for free from the campus or local library.

, If your professor has assigned a newer edition of a text, you may be able to get buy with an older (cheaper) edition of the text. Publishers often make very few changes from edition to edition, and the only thing that may vary is the page numbers or the occasional addition of a new reading.


Double-check with your professor to see if an older edition will work for you before you commit to buying.

, You may also be able to rent your textbooks for a much reduced cost, or you can split the cost of a pricey book with a classmate or roommate who is enrolled in the same course.


If you do this, make sure that you have a clear schedule for when each of you will access to the book.

, You may be able to spend less by limiting yourself to only paying for items with cash. Put your debit and credit cards away, or tuck them in corner of your wallet to only be brought out for emergencies.


When you cash your check or make a withdrawal, take out enough to last you for the month, if possible. This way, you can avoid having to make repeat trips to the ATM. At an average fee of $3 per withdrawal, the fees can really add up.Avoid carrying all of your cash when you go out, though. Take just what you think you'll need.

, If you live on campus, you may be required to purchase a dining plan. If so, select the most economical plan (be honest about how often you'll be willing or able to go to the cafeteria).


Then, whatever plan you have, take full advantage of it: avoid skipping meals so that you won't need to purchase food later; and if you're allowed, take fruit or leftovers so that you'll have snacks available throughout the day.
Also, scope out events on campus which offer free food.
If you have a work study with the dining hall or catering services, you may be able to take home free food., If you are able to, you may be able to save more money by opting out of a dining plan and buying your groceries yourself.


Shop at discount grocery stores or buy in bulk from stores like Costco. While you get more bang for your buck when you buy in bulk, your tab can be pretty high. You can work around this problem by having a friend or roommate go in with you on purchases.

, Sure you want to look good, but you don't have to spend a lot to stay on trend. Consider simplifying your wardrobe: build a solid base of classics that you can easily mix and match.


Buy all of your clothes second-hand or commit to only buying items on sale. You can also swap clothes with your friends to keep things fresh.

, Do you spend more than you'd like getting your hair and nails done each month? Do you have a friend who can't resist the pastries at the coffee shop or who pays for a personal trainer? Think about what both you and your friends spend money on, and then see if there's a way for you to barter and trade services with each other in order to save money.


For example, in exchange for doing your hair before a big date, you can offer to supply your friend with some fresh-baked goodies.

, The costs associated with commuting to and from school (or across town as you run errands) can be quite high. In an effort to save money on gas, insurance, and parking, try to take public transportation as much as possible.


Your school may have discounted bus passes available for students, or you may be able to arrange to carpool with your fellow students to classes or for supply runs.

, You may think that you can't live without your cable or Starbucks, but be honest with yourself. It's probably just the caffeine you need, and not the $4 latte.


Make your coffee at home, consider cutting out the cable and switching to free or cheaper tv options (such as NetFlix or Hulu), and hold off on upgrading to the newest, shiniest electronic gadgets.By going without luxuries, you'll of course free up money, but you'll also come to enjoy and appreciate them more once you can truly be able to afford them again.

, Before you head out to a local restaurant or museum, do some quick research to see if they offer discounts for students. As a student, you can often get free admission or great deals with your student identification.

, How much money do you currently spend going out to movies, bars, or clubs? While it's important that you have a social life and find ways to relax when you aren't hitting the books, you don't have to spend a lot of cash (or any!) to have a good time in your free time.


Actually read the fliers and posters around campus, which advertise free, fun, and/or interesting activities and lectures. You may be able to see plays and concerts on campus, attend lectures from important thinkers, or go to university-sponsored parties all for free with your student ID.

, Besides being able to meet new and interesting people, some of them have regular activities (like movie nights) or even take service trips over school breaks.


These are usually funded in part or sometimes completely through donations or through fund-raising efforts."

Turn off the heat.,
Enjoy.",How to Cook Barley1," Combine both ingredients in a large saucepan, making sure the water covers the barley completely.


You can also substitute broth for water and add salt (to taste) for enhanced flavor, but neither option is necessary.;
, Place the saucepan on the stove and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, cover the saucepan with a lid.


Note that the barley may produce a lot of foam and threaten to boil over the saucepan. Stirring the barley and watching it closely should help minimize the risk of accidental spills.

, Pearl barley may finish within 25 minutes, while hulled barley will usually require up to 45 minutes.If the water boils away prematurely, add more about 1/2 cup (125 ml) at a time.

, The barley should triple in volume and be soft, yet chewy.


You may need to test the barley every 5 minutes or so near the end of the cooking process until it reaches your desired consistency.

, Allow the barley to sit for 15 minutes without stirring, so that it can continue absorbing any excess water.


If there's still excess after letting the barley sit, you may need to drain the water away.

, Add the cooked barley to salad or soup, or toss with spices and oil for a delicious side dish.

If you can't find cardstock, use poster paper instead.
You can draw simple flower shapes instead. You will need 5 to 6 petals for each flower. Make sure that they are big enough to hold your chocolates.

, Draw a line of hot glue down the center of the flower, from top to bottom. Press the stick into the glue, so that it sticks out of the bottom of the flower. You want the stick supporting the entire back of the flower, otherwise it will flop over.If you don't have hot glue, you can use tape instead.
If you can't find green florist sticks, get some short, thin dowels or wooden skewers, and paint them green instead.

, You can also use a glue dot instead. You can find rolls of glue dots in an arts and crafts store. Do not use actual glue for this., Use a small chocolate that is no larger than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) Small, chocolate squares work the best for this.Use the same color for each petal, and a different color for the center.

You can match the color of the chocolates to the paper, or you can use a different color.

Cut a 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) square out of colored tissue paper.,
Fold the square in half, then turn down the corners.,
Wrap the tissue paper around the chocolate stack.,
Twist the bottom of the tissue paper.,
Consider cutting and folding leaf shapes out of green tissue paper.,
Add the leaf shapes to the bottom of the bud, if you made them.,
Wrap green florist's around the stem.,
Make more flowers, then arrange them as you like.",How to Make a Chocolate Bouquet3," Use small, foil-wrapped chocolates, such as Dove, that are no bigger than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). They can be different colors/flavors, but they need to be the same shape and size.You can use Hershey's Kisses for this method. Simply stack two Kisses together with the bottom ends together.
You can use two round chocolates, such as Ferrero Rocher or Lindor, instead.

, Clear cellophane will work the best, but you can use a colored one if your chocolates are wrapped in silver foil. The squares need to be big enough to wrap around your chocolate stack like a lollipop.Something between 3 and 4 inches (7.62 and 10.16 centimeters) should be enough., Place the cellophane on top of the chocolate stack. Wrap the ends around the sides of the chocolate stack, towards the bottom., Slide the blunt end of a skewer between the cellophane and one side of the chocolate stack. Twist the cellophane around the wooden skewer to hold it in place.If you can't find a wooden skewer, you can use a florist stick, a long lollipop stick, or a short, thin dowel.
Don't pierce the chocolates with the skewer.

, Begin wrapping the florist's tape around the base of the chocolate stack. Continue wrapping it around and past the twisted cellophane, onto the wooden skewer itself. Tear off the excess florist's tape.Don't wrap the entire skewer just yet.

, The tissue paper can be the same color as your chocolate, or it can be a different color. It should be solid-colored, however. Cut a square that measures 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) wide and 12 (30.48 centimeters) long.You can also use thin crepe paper instead.

, Fold the square in half first. Next, turn it so that the folded edge is facing away from you. Fold the top corners down to meet the bottom edge., Place the chocolate stack on top of the tissue paper, right next to one of the narrow edges. Make sure that the top of the chocolate stack is just below the top edge of the folded tissue paper. Wrap and roll the chocolate stack towards the other narrow end.You can have the top of the chocolate aligned with the top of the tissue paper instead.

, Once you are done rolling the flower, twist the excess tissue paper along the bottom edge around the stem, just like wrapping a lollipop. Secure the twisted tissue paper with a strip of green florist's tape, just like you did with the cellophane.

Gently pull the top corner away from the bud for a more realistic touch.

, You don't have to do this, but it will give your flowers a nice touch. Cut the leaves out first, then fold them in half lengthwise to make a crease. Unfold the leaves when you are done., Place the leaves against the stem, just below the flower bud. Wrap a piece of green florist's tape around the bottom points of the leaves to secure them to the stem. Do not tear off the tape.

Gently pull down on the leaves to reveal the flower bud.

, Begin wrapping at the top of the stem, just below the bud, and finish wrapping at the bottom. Overlap each row slightly so that no gaps are showing.

If you added the leaves, continue wrapping where you left off.

, Experiment with using different types of chocolates and colors of tissue paper. If you want to, you can even make some skewers with just leaves on them to use as filler.When you are done, you can wrap the bouquet in colorful tissue paper, or place it into a pretty vase."

Take surveys for money.,
Use your photography skills for money.,
Tutor other students.,
Offer a laundry service.,
Edit essays for money.",How to Make Extra Money During College2," If you have free time between classes or after classes, many websites will pay you to take surveys. While the pay is not always high, if you're taking a few surveys during your downtime each day, it adds up.You also may be able to find companies that pay you to test websites. You will have to spend a few hours browsing the site, and then take a survey reviewing your experience on it.

, If you're skilled at taking pictures, you may be able to make some money doing so. If you have a small portfolio of quality of photos, assemble it on a website or blog. Then, advertise your services as a photographer. Offer to photograph events on campus for a reasonable fee.You can also make money via photography online. Websites like Dreamstime allow you to upload your best photos. Each time someone downloads one of your images, you receive payment., If you're talented in a particular subject area, offer your skills as a tutor. Put up flyers around campus offering to tutor students in a particular subject. You can place these photos in relevant locations. For example, if math classes tend to be taught in Wells Hall, put up flyers advertising your services as a personal math tutor there.Most tutors charge somewhere between $20 and $40 an hour. However, if you're targeting other students, you may set yourself apart from the competition by charging slightly less. You may get more clients this way, increasing your income even when charging less for hourly services.

, Many college students dislike doing laundry. If you don't mind the task, offer a laundry service in your dorm. You can charge, say, $10 per load of laundry, as well as the cost of operating the laundry machines. If you can offer students clean, folded laundry, they may feel freeing up some time in their own schedule is worth a small fee., If you're an English or writing major, editing skills are often in high demand. Students without an English background may need to write papers for certain courses. They may be in need of editing services.You can advertise your services around campus or online. You can charge an hourly rate or charge a fixed amount of money per paper edited.
If you're offering freelance editing services, you can set your own schedule. This can help you fit earning extra money into a busy college routine.

You can also try buying a few extra tickets to an event at student prices. Then, sell them to friends and relatives who do not go to your college for an extra cost.If you go to a school with a big sports culture, tickets to things like football and basketball games are in particularly high demand.

, Many students resell old textbooks at the campus bookstore at the end of the year. However, resale prices there tend to be low. You can try reselling your books on your own. You may get more money going this route.The website BookScouter will give you an idea of how much a specific used book tends to sell for. You can then try to sell the book online for that price, or try to resell it to another student for a similar price.
You can also go to local used bookstores. If you have a book that's in quality condition, you may be able to resell it there.

, If you just got a new phone or laptop, do not throw out the old one. You can resell old electronics online or through a used electronics store. People may need the parts, or be okay using a used laptop that's less pricey than a new one., You can auction off old clothes on websites like eBay. You can also stop by a local thrift store or secondhand shop and see if you can get any money for old items of clothing. You can also look for online consignment shops, like ThredUp."

If you are unsure about your area of interest, or know that it will not involve engineering or computer science, you will want to apply to Columbia College.;
, Contact the school or program of your choice at Columbia to ask if they have a list of alumni you can speak to about the nature of their academic experience and how they prepared for the program.

, Columbia offers information sessions and campus tours for prospective students. You should sign up in advance to make sure you get a time that coincides with your ability to be on campus.While on campus, take the opportunity to speak to current students about their experiences and what they did to prepare for Columbia.


If you cannot get to New York City, the school offers off-campus information sessions. See if one is close to you., Take the most advanced or accelerated academic courses available to you in your high school, and do well in them. Columbia's admissions office looks for students who challenge themselves academically whenever possible. Over 90% of the class of 2018 graduated in the top 10 percent of their high school class., Columbia's admissions committee uses a ""holistic"" review process, meaning they take into account not only a person's academic marks, but also extracurricular activities. Columbia wants undergraduate students who can make an impact outside the classroom, and contribute to social and cultural life at the school.The Columbia Writing Supplement asks about books, newspapers, and magazines you have read, or films, concerts, exhibitions, and other performances you have seen over the prior year. Use this as an opportunity to expand your own horizons, and take in as many of these extracurricular opportunities as possible.

, You can apply to Columbia by taking the SAT and two SAT subject tests, or the ACT. If you are applying Early Decision, you can take the tests as late as November, and as late as January for Regular Decision. You may take the tests multiple times, as Columbia will only review the highest score. Be advised, Columbia will only look a scores from a single sitting of the test, so you can't mix and match.For the SAT, Columbia does not require the Writing Section, only Math and Critical Reading. The middle 50% of admitted students in the class of 2018 scored between 2160 and 2330 on all three sections.
For the SAT subject tests, Columbia recommends choosing subjects in your strengths. If you are applying to the School of Engineering, you should take Math and one of Biology, Chemistry, or Physics. Columbia advises that you should not take Foreign Language subject test if you are a native speaker.
For the ACT, the writing component will no longer be required for Fall 2017 admissions. If you are applying for Fall 2016, you will still need to take it. If you have a particular subject of interest, you can also take the SAT subject test in that area and submit with the ACT. 79% of the admitted class of 2018 who took the ACT scored between 32 and 36.

, Make sure to follow the instructions carefully, and pay close attention to the length, topic matter, and format required. Ask others, such as trusted teachers, friends, and relatives, to review your essay before submission to comment on its clarity and effectiveness.

, Columbia requires letters from your high school guidance counselor and two teachers from academic disciplines. If you are applying to the engineering school, one must be a math or science teacher. These letters should come from teachers who are closely familiar with your work ethic, communication skills, character, and capabilities. If they are willing, take the opportunity to talk with your letter writers about why you wish to attend Columbia, which can help provide a more personalized letter that really emphasizes your strengths as an applicant.

, Make sure you have all of your materials ready when you submit the Common Application. Review the Columbia-specific questions for the Writing Supplement, and prepare your answers within the guidelines provided., There is space on the Common Application to provide supplementary materials for work in science or the arts. If you have experience in these fields, include materials to help give depth to your application. Make sure to carefully review the correct types of materials, including formatting and file type."

Finished.",How to Get into College," Most colleges use a ""holistic"" admissions process, meaning that the school will consider your achievement in many areas-- both objective and subjective. A weakness in one area can be outweighed by a strength in another, and vice versa.



Your academic record. Colleges will see this quantitatively in the form of your four-year transcript and GPA, as well as qualitatively in your teachers' and counselor's recommendation comments. Admissions officers want to see that you can succeed in an academically challenging environment.

Your standardized test scores. Most colleges, particularly the more selective ones, require the ACT or SAT.

Your extracurriculars. Colleges seek students who are engaged outside of the classroom. Participating in a breadth of activities can indicate that you are a well-rounded person, but colleges also seek depth of engagement, which you can indicate through pursuing leadership positions or independent projects.

Your character. Essays, letters of recommendation, and interviews all combine to convey your personality.

Your background. Colleges evaluate your achievements in the context of your circumstances-- for example, admissions officers will not expect you to have taken eight AP courses if your school offers none. Similarly, background can illuminate character, and colleges will be impressed by an applicant who excels despite personal hardship.

Your ""fit"" with a particular college. The word ""fit"" can seem maddeningly nebulous: what exactly does it mean to be a good match for a certain school? But admissions officers want students who understand and appreciate the culture and unique offerings of the colleges to which they apply.;
, Take classes that will challenge you, but don't overload yourself; remember that you don't want to get an ulcer while you are still a teenager!


Take AP courses. AP exams not only demonstrate a willingness to challenge yourself, but also can give you college credits that may save you time and tuition later.
Fulfill the coursework recommendations of colleges you are interested in. Most four-year colleges want applicants to have taken four years of each main academic subject, including foreign language. Treat suggestions as requirements: for example, if one of your prospective colleges requires three years of high school science but suggests four, you should take four years of science to remain competitive.
Only take less than four years of a subject in order to take more advanced courses in an area you are especially interested in.

, You don't need a 4.0 to get into a great school, but remember that your cumulative GPA for all four years of high school is sometimes used as an initial screen for colleges that receive a plethora of applications. Higher grades will expand your colleges choices.

, As a freshman, you may want to try out many different activities. But as you get older, it is best to focus your time on a few activities that you find most rewarding and pursue leadership positions in them. Colleges will note your commitment.


Use your summers productively. Find an internship; volunteer; get a job; attend a summer program or take courses at a community college; work on a personal project; reach out to a professor at your local college whose research interests you and ask if you can get involved.
Enter contests. Awards will help your application stand out, and even if you don't win, the experience can't hurt.

, Keep track of your activities and the dates you participated in them so you don't forget anything when filling out your applications.

, Reach out to them after class to ask questions or discuss topics of interest. You'll thank yourself later when it's time to ask them for a recommendation!

, Sign up for a test in winter or spring of your junior year, and that way, if you are unhappy with your scores, you'll have plenty of time to study and take the test again.


Take the PSAT in October of your junior year if your high school offers it. This will help you learn what to expect on the actual exam, and if you do well enough, you may receive a financial award from the National Merit scholarship competition (free money!).
Get a test prep book at least a month before your test and work through it. Focus on areas of difficulty, and take multiple full practice tests.
Use the practice questions posted on the SAT and ACT websites. The SAT, for example, provides a regular Question of the Day.
Consider enrolling in a test prep class. But if test prep is too costly, remember that that it is completely possible improve your scores through independent studying.

, Unlike the SAT and ACT, these exams test knowledge of a specific topic such as Biology or U.S. History. Most selective colleges require you to submit scores for two different Subject Tests.


Take tests in areas you have excelled in.
Take the a Subject Test immediately after finishing the relevant coursework at your school. For example, if you take Biology your freshman year and do well in it, you should take the Biology Subject Test that spring while the concepts remain fresh in your mind.
If you are considering a career in a STEM field and have taken some trigonometry and precalculus, you should strongly consider taking the Math 2 Subject Test. Many colleges will prefer math proficiency beyond the scope of the general SAT.

, Get a college guide book from the bookstore or library; subscribe to college mailing lists by filling our their Information Request forms online; dig around college websites, paying particular attention to the programs and majors that you are interested in; attend information sessions in your hometown.

, Even with extensive research, it can be difficult to get a true ""feel"" for a college without spending time on campus. When you visit, sign up to attend a campus tour or information session-- or both. Campus tours are often student-led, while information sessions are typically led by admissions officers. Both will give you valuable knowledge.


Take notes during or right after your visits. Without anything to refer back to, schools may begin to blend together in your head!
Pay attention to campus atmosphere. What are the students like? What are they doing as you walk around campus? Can you imagine yourself among them?
Set aside time to explore the area surrounding campus. Find out what sort of activities, entertainment, and resources you could take advantage of as a student there.

, The admissions game is wildly unpredictable, and you will need to apply to schools that range widely in selectivity to ensure that, come spring, you have been accepted to at least one program. Your list should include schools from each of the following three categories:



Reach schools. These are colleges that you have only a small chance at being accepted to. Many college counselors will say that a college that accepts less than 15 percent of its applicants should always be considered a reach school, no matter how accomplished the student.

Target schools.These are colleges that you have a good shot at being accepted at. You fit the profile of their accepted students: for example, you fall within their average range of test scores and GPA.

Likely or ""Safety"" schools.These are colleges you are very confident you will be accepted at.

, Talk with your family about how much you can afford to pay for college. But when creating your list, remember that most colleges are ""need-blind"" and will give you financial aid if you are accepted.


Seek out the ""Price Calculator"" on college websites, and enter your family's financial information to find out how much aid you can expect to receive.

, Some of the colleges on your list may offer an ""Early Action"" or an ""Early Decision"" option, which allows students to submit their applications earlier in the fall and receive their admissions decision sooner, in December. Early Action is non-binding: you are not obligated to attend the college if accepted. In contrast, students accepted to a college through Early Decision must enroll there.



If you have a clear first choice college, apply Early Decision if possible. Early Decision increases your chances of getting in by demonstrating to a college that they are your first choice.

If you are unsure where you want to go, apply Early Action. Colleges generally have higher admissions rates for early applicants. Plus, hearing back earlier on will save you suspense-- and a favorable decision will put your mind at ease!

, Personally check the website of each college on your list and note the most up-to-date admissions deadlines. If you are prone to procrastination, create mini-deadlines to encourage steady work: for example, you might plan to finish one new application each week.

, More than 500 colleges currently accept this standardized application form. You only need to fill it out once, and once finished, you simply forward it to all participating schools you are applying to.


The app opens each year online on August 1st, so you can begin filling out your application over the summer (lucky you!).
The Common App requires a ""personal statement,"" a prompt-based essay of no more than 650 words. The prompts generally stay the same from year to year, so it's possible--and wise-- to start drafting your response even before August 1st arrives.
A personal statement will help admissions officers get to know you through some important aspects, or aspects, of your identity. Although there is no one correct format, compelling essays often recount and reflect on a story.

, The vast majority of colleges require two teachers, both from core academic subjects: English, math, science, history, or foreign language. Ask early on in your senior year. Otherwise, your teacher of choice may be swamped with other requests by the time you reach them!


Choose teachers who have a high opinion of you. Ideally, your recommender has seen you excel or work to overcome challenges. Did you enjoy their class? Did you put effort into it?
Choose recommenders who have taught you in the past two years and for at least a semester: not your math teacher from all the way back in freshman year, and not the senior year math teacher you've only known for two weeks.
If you believe another adult-- an art teacher, a coach, a supervisor, and so on-- would write persuasively on your behalf, by all means ask them. But their letter should supplement your two academic letters rather than replace them.
Ask for your letters in person. You may feel awkward, but your request will have a more personal touch.
Offer to send your recommender your resume, to help them write knowledgeably about you.

, Many colleges require essays specific to their school in addition to your personal statement. Like the personal statement, this is an opportunity to convey important parts of your identity in a compelling, readable way.

, If you have devoted significant time to or demonstrated unusual achievement in visual art, music, dance, or writing, a portfolio can enhance your application. But beware!-- if you submit a portfolio, some colleges will require you to submit your entire application up to a month earlier.

, Ask parents, friends, or trusted teachers to read it over, but make sure the words and ideas in your application remain your own.

, Not all schools require or even offer interviews; generally, schools will contact you after you submit your application with interview instructions. An off-campus alumni interview is a good and convenient option, but if possible, arrange an on-campus interview with an admissions officer, as this will hold more weight in the admissions process.



Relax. Your interview will probably not make or break you, unless you show up in torn jeans and a sweaty T-shirt and start swearing.
Research a college before going to its interview. Think about why you are applying to this specific school and what strengths you would contribute to it.
Have questions ready for your interviewer. This is a fantastic opportunity to learn more about the school, as well as to convey your genuine interest in a school.
Look on the internet for some common college interview questions, and practice your answers beforehand-- but avoid memorizing responses in a way that will sound mechanical.
Brush up on some current events. You don't need to know everything that's going on in the world, but it's not a bad idea to read the newspaper daily for a few days before the interview.

, Smile because you've done what you can; now sit back, and wait.

The application typically goes live in late September. For the best chance of getting in, you should be ready to submit your application then or shortly thereafter., You will apply at LSAC website. You’ll want to start early in order to acquire recommendations, complete the LSAT on time, and make sure your personal statement and resume are as good as you can make them. The application consists of 7 mandatory parts:A fee of $85

An interview (granted to approximately 1,200 applicants)

, Harvard Law strives to admit a diverse mix of students. A diversity statement gives you a chance to place your achievements in the context of your background and to make a case for how you would increase diversity on campus., Particularly if there are discrepancies in your application, such as a low GPA and high LSAT, consider including an addendum to explain them, preferably in a way that turns a weakness into a strength. For example, if you had low undergrad GPA, you might address it up front, and explain that between working your way through school and your commitment to an extracurricular (sports, student government, debate, etc.), it was difficult to maintain your grades, but you learned valuable things from these other experiences., You can major in anything and get into Harvard law, though you’d do best to avoid criminal justice, which is not considered an academically rigorous major.The key is to pick a subject that is rigorous, that you enjoy, and in which you can make good grades. If you want to study chemistry, go for it, but know that you will need to supplement your major with electives that demonstrate your reading, research, and writing skills. Here are some common “pre-law” majors.History – Teaches strong reading, research, and writing skills, as well as a basic knowledge of U.S. laws and politics.Philosophy – Teaches logic, critical analysis, close reading, and writing, and is considered a very rigorous major.Economics – Teaches analysis and logical thinking. A senior thesis that displays research and writing skills will boost your application. Economics is considered preferable to business.Political Science – Teaches strong reading and presentation skills, as well as a basic knowledge of the U.S. legal system. However, political science is considered a less rigorous major, so you will need a very good GPA. If possible, do a senior thesis to supplement your courses and show strong research and writing skills.English – Shows strong reading and writing skills, but you will need to supplement your course work with research heavy courses.

Science majors – The difficulty of these majors makes a high GPA even more impressive. That said, you will need to take electives to show you are strong in reading, writing, and research. Also, your application will be stronger if you say you are planning on being a patent or intellectual property lawyer.Art/Music/Film – Harvard law actually likes students with less traditional backgrounds, though to get in with a major in the arts you will need a great GPA, supplemental course work in fields like history, economics, or philosophy, and preferable a senior thesis., Harvard law accepts students from a wide variety of majors, but to maximize your chances of getting in and succeeding in law school, you’ll want to be sure to take courses that develop your reading, research, and writing skills. For example, if you’re an economics major with practice researching and analyzing data, you might want to take some history or literature electives to show that you also have developed reading and writing skills.Consider taking:Courses with term papers – Term papers might not be fun, but they require reading, research, and writing, making these classes the ideal preparation for law school.

Courses that emphasize reading – Literature, philosophy, history, and political science.

Courses that emphasize textual research – Economics, psychology, sociology, history, or any course with a term paper. (The key here is textual research, so lab work will not be as useful.)

Courses that emphasize writing – Literature, history, philosophy, or any course with a term paper.

, Harvard has high standards. For instance, a 3.75 GPA would only land you in the 25th percentile (meaning you did better than 25% of applicants) for the class of 2017. A 3.87 would get you to the 50th percentile, and a 3.95 would be needed to reach the 75th percentile., If your GPA is not where it needs to be, consider taking summer courses to boost it before your senior year. Increasing it by even .1 or .2 points can mean the difference between acceptance and rejection from Harvard., Lots of people who apply to Harvard Law have high GPAs and great LSAT scores. The right extracurricular can help set you apart. And if your GPA and LSAT aren’t as good as you'd like, they can make all the difference. The key is to start early – schools like Harvard are less impressed if you only participate your senior year – and to focus on quality over quantity. Pick 1 to 3 activities and really commit to them.Non-profit work – The larger and more prestigious the organization, the better. Think Habitat for Humanity or a Community Law Project or Clinic in your area.Legal internship – Most legal internships are for non-profits, government, or the American Bar Association. They are good summer experiences, but not necessarily better than any other extracurricular activity. See here for a sample of possible internships.

Debate – Debate teaches you a number of skills useful in law: memorization, crafting arguments, speaking extemporaneously, and analyzing texts, amongst them.Pre-law – Pre-law societies run activities like mock trials and cross-examination exercises, and often have journals that you can contribute to. Participation builds valuable skills and shows a passion for law.Model United Nations – Allows you to practice diplomacy and mediation. And since most law cases are settled before trial in mediation or arbitration, this is a vital skill.Student government – Just serving is not enough. Focus on what you have done for your school and the specific changes you have implemented.Other campus organizations - Any campus organization can be a bright spot on your resume, so long as you hold a leadership position in the organization and can show you made an impact., There are prelaw study abroad programs, but any abroad experience is valuable. Harvard Law appreciates the cultural experience and language proficiency that come from a semester abroad., You don’t have to apply to law school in college. In fact, taking a few years off to work will actually make you a more attractive candidate to Harvard Law.Having work experience makes you more employable, as well as teaching you responsibility and valuable time management skills that make you a better student. And if you take the right job, it can also give you exposure to the field of law. Any job in an intellectual field – teaching, working in government, clerking – will boost your resume, but here are some of the best jobs to consider:


Paralegal or legal assistant – These jobs will not necessarily give you an advantage over other jobs – indeed, Harvard Law likes people with eclectic backgrounds – but they certainly won’t hurt you, and more importantly, they can help you to decide if law is right for you.A non-law job related to the law field you are interested in. If you are interested in corporate law, you might work in business. If you are interested in patent or intellectual property law, you might work in tech. In general, you will get the most out of your non-law job if it relates to the field you want to practice in., Particularly if you didn't participate in a lot of extracurriculars in college, your post-graduate life can be a great time to improve this portion of your resume. Prestigious national organizations will carry the most weight, but anything that shows commitment, leadership, and tangible results will help. You should even consider signing up for full-time service opportunities like Teach for America, the Peace Corps, or Americorps., Especially if you have been out of school for a while, acing courses at a local college can show that you have matured as a student. The better the college you take the classes at, the more weight these results will carry.These courses can be particularly useful for people who have been out of school for 3+ years, as they can yield academic recommendations.

, A graduate degree costs money (unless you get a scholarship), but if it can get you into Harvard Law, then it will probably be worth it in the long run. Especially if you attend a top school, there are several benefits:


A graduate degree gives you a chance to soften the blow of a bad undergrad GPA. Grad GPAs are not factored into LSAC’s GPA calculations, but they are reported and can shows that you have matured as a student.Graduate degrees can yield fresh recommendations from professors.
Your degree can make you a more viable candidate for certain fields of law. For instance, if you are going into corporate or tax law, a MBA or accountant’s degree can help. If you are entering patent or intellectual property law, a graduate degree in a scientific field can help tremendously., The LSAT is offered only on a few dates each year, usually once each in June, October, November, December, and February. It is best to take the February test the year before you apply or the June test the year you apply, so you can get your application in early. The December test is the last one you can take and still apply that same year. Registration is typically due over a month before the test date, so plan ahead. You can find more information on specific dates and register for the test on the LSAC website.


You must have taken the test within the last 5 years before applying to Harvard law.

, The LSAT is scored on a scale of 120-180. To get into Harvard, you’ll likely need to score in at least the 170s. For the class of 2017, scores of 170, 173, and 175 would put you in the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, respectively., For the most part, the LSAT does not test skills that you learn in class. Instead, it focuses on logic, language ability, and reading comprehension. It consists of five 35 minutes sections of multiple choice questions, only four of which are scored (the fifth is to try out questions for future tests), and one unscored 35 minute writing sample. The question types are:Reading Comprehension (one 35 minute section) – You will be asked to read a text and then answer questions about its content and structure. This question format will be familiar if you have taken the SAT, only the texts you must read will be more difficult.

Analytical Reasoning (one 35 minute section) – Also known as Logic Games, these problems test your deductive reasoning and ability to structure data, and are of the type: “Jill, Bob, Susan, Erik, and Stan must be seated at the same table. Jill can’t sit next to Susan or Erik. Bob must be beside Stan…” Most test takers find them the most challenging part of the test.

Logical Reasoning (two 35 minutes sections) – These questions “evaluate the ability to analyze, critically evaluate, and complete arguments as they occur in ordinary language.”

, A week or two is not enough to prepare for the LSAT. For most people, it takes months of intense practice (15-20 hours a week) to reach the score they desire.At the very least, you will want to purchase previously administered LSAT's on the LSAC website to practice on and purchase a study guide. If you are still not happy with your scores, consider enrolling in an LSAT course or hiring a private tutor., If you do decide to enroll in a class, you’ll want to make sure it’s a good one. Be sure that your class is being taught by someone who scored at least a 170 on the test and that the course uses actual questions from the LSAT.And be sure to sign up well in advance of the test. Give yourself at least two months to prepare. Some highly ranked LSAT prep courses include:Power-Score Live LSAT Preparation
Blueprint LSAT Preparation
Manhattan LSAT
Kaplan Test Prep
The Princeton Review LSAT
TestMasters

, You can take the LSAT up to 3 times in any 2 year period. Harvard Law – like most law schools – only uses your highest score in evaluating your candidacy, so there is no reason not to retake the test. If you score higher, they will use that score. If your score lower, they will use your previous score., If you’re in college, your career counseling office should be able to provide you with sample essays that worked. If not, you can buy books that contain personal statements that helped get the writer into Harvard Law, or you can find personal statements online here. The best way to know what works is to read what worked in the past.

, Don’t try to encapsulate your life in a short essay. Instead, you’ll have better luck picking one powerful experience and explaining its impact on you in a way that highlights some of your strengths as a candidate.Write about something you care about, even if it has nothing to do with why you are going to law school. The goal is to let your personality, strengths, and way of thinking shine through. They already know you want to go to Harvard Law. You applied.
Don’t write about how your study abroad experience transformed you. It’s been done way, way too many times.
If you are going to write about why you want to be a lawyer, know that this is probably the most common type of essay. That doesn’t make it a bad topic, but you’ll need to tell a particularly engaging story to avoid boring your reader., Your first paragraph should be engaging, or it might be all that an admissions officer reads. Consider opening with an honest statement about your values or something important to you, such as “I believe in freedom of expression,” and then going on to tell a story that develops why, and how that relates to your application. Or start with a sentence that leads into and explains the story you are about to tell, such as “I never thought much about what it meant to be blind until I met my best friend, Jim.”


Do not start with an overly dramatic story. This is a clichéd technique that has been used far too many times.If you are going to tell a story, make sure you first frame why it matters.
Definitely don’t lead with something like “I’ve always dreamed of attending Harvard Law” or “I have a passion for the law.” (Unless you follow that statement with a twist like, “But then a professor told me what a terrible idea that was.”)

, It’s true in all writing: showing a vivid scene that illustrates your point is more effective than simply telling someone your point. So if you want to convey to Harvard Law that you have a passion for immigration law, for example, a story about your experience with an immigrant will leave a much more powerful impression than a simple statement about an internship., Unless you just got your PhD in medical research and are certain you will be entering patent law, you should steer clear of being too specific. Law school offers the opportunity to explore multiple fields of law and choose one that appeals to you., If you mention why you want to go to Harvard in particular, be sure you can back up your statement with accurate facts. If there is a particular professor you want to work with, make sure he or she is tenured and teaching regularly before you mention him or her in your essay., Re-read your essay multiple times to remove all errors, then have several people you trust closely read it as well. A simple spelling or grammar error will have a negative impact on the reader’s impression of you., If you are asked to interview via Skype, it means that the admissions committee finds your application promising. If you treat the interview as a sign that you’re doing well, it will be less stressful., Most candidates where a shirt and tie or a simple blouse, but if you feel more comfortable in a full suit or business casual, that is fine, too. The most important thing is that you are comfortable, which will help you to relax and give a good interview., Make sure the background behind you is neat and orderly. If the room you are in is a mess, it will leave a bad impression with the interviewer.A few well-chosen books on the shelf behind you, on the other hand, can reinforce your image as a serious student.

, The interview is meant to be conversational, so scripted answers will not help you. Please, don’t memorize anything, but it is a good idea to have a basic idea about how you will answer some typical questions:Why do you want to go to law school?
What attracts you to Harvard Law, in particular?
When did you decide to go to law school?What do you see yourself doing when you graduate?, The point of the interview is to learn about you as a person, not about your accomplishments. Avoid talking about your resume or listing examples found in your personal statement.You will score the most points with your interviewer if you come across as intelligent, curious, and fun to talk to.

, At some point, your interviewer will probably ask if you have any questions. You’ll need to have some ready, and because it’s important to have researched Harvard Law in advance, they shouldn’t be things that can be easily answered simply by browsing the University’s website. So instead of asking “what opportunities are there for gaining practical experience,” you might ask “I’m really interested in the Transactional Law Clinics; can you tell me more about how they work and build on classroom instruction?” The point of the question is not only to gather information, but also to show that you are intelligent and inquisitive.

If you are unsure about your area of interest, or know that it will not involve engineering or computer science, you will want to apply to Columbia College.

, Columbia's admissions office will generally be unable to look at grades from the second semester, so grades from the first will weigh heavily on your application. You will need a minimum GPA of 3.5 to be considered, and the school strongly encourages a minimum of 3.5 in science and engineering courses for the School of Engineering., To transfer to Columbia, you must have completed, or be scheduled for, 24 credit points. Make sure you are taking, and have taken, transferrable credits. Columbia does not accept transfer credits from departments such as business, communications, and education, as the school does not have those departments.


Colleges may count class credits differently. Review Columbia's requirements to make sure you are on the right track, Columbia's admissions committee uses a ""holistic"" review process, meaning they take into account not only a person's academic marks, but also extracurricular activities. Columbia wants undergraduate students who can make an impact outside the classroom, and contribute to social and cultural life at the school.The Columbia Writing Supplement asks about books, newspapers, and magazines you have read, or films, concerts, exhibitions, and other performances you have seen over the prior year. If you are already attending a college, there will undoubtedly be a variety of opportunities to attend interesting and worthwhile events.

, If you have previously applied to Columbia, past materials such as test scores and essays will not roll over. Before resubmitting materials, such as your personal essay, try to review review and improve upon them, using on your own personal growth and input from others at your current institution.

, Columbia requires letters from college instructors. Letters should come from professors who are closely familiar with your work ethic, communication skills, character, and capabilities. If they are willing, take the opportunity to talk with your letter writers about why you wish to attend Columbia, which can help provide a more personalized letter that more strongly emphasizes your strengths as an applicant.

, Make sure you have all of your materials ready when you submit the Common Application. Review the Columbia-specific questions for the Writing Supplement, and prepare your answers within the guidelines provided., There is space on the Common Application to provide supplementary materials for work in science or the arts. If you have experience in these fields, include materials to help give depth to your application. Make sure to carefully review the correct types of materials, including formatting and file type."

Each school has different processes and requirements for application, so you will need to review them carefully.

, You will want to work with faculty who are accomplished in your chosen field, and will likely stay on for the duration of your time in the program. If possible, visit the campus and schedule an in-person meeting with your potential instructors. Some schools will provide information sessions, or help arrange these meetings.

, Columbia's graduate programs are some of the best in the country, and will need to see strong collegiate performance for admittance.

This means choosing classes that challenge you, instead of ones that are simply easy to pass.Take courses that are difficult, but manageable for you. It’s important to maintain a healthy balance of academics, extra-curricular activities, and your social life.
Take college prep or AP courses when you can, as these reflect well on your transcripts.;
, Colleges often place a large emphasis on the quality of your grades when making their determination about whether or not you would be a good fit for their institution. While it is important that you choose courses that challenge you, it’s just as important that you demonstrate your ability to maintain good grades during that challenging coursework.Strive to maintain the highest Grade Point Average (GPA) that you can in order to maximize your chances at getting into college.
Remember that you can recover from a few less than stellar grades through extra-curricular activities and submitting an exceptional application and essay, but getting good grades is still in your best interest.

, Even if your grades aren’t great, a good recommendation letter from one of your teachers can go a long way in convincing an admissions counselor that you should be accepted into their college or university. Recommendation letters can explain things about you that are hard to quantify with grades.Ask teachers you get along with to provide you with a recommendation letter you can include when applying to college.
If you participate in school sanctioned extra-curricular activities, you may want to ask your coach or club advisor to write you a recommendation letter.

, While many colleges accept test scores from either the SAT or ACT tests, you should check with any schools you might already have in mind before choosing to take one or the other. You may want to take practice tests from each, and choose the one that you perform better on.You can register to take the SATs here: https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register

You can register to take the ACT here: https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/registration-information.html

You may want to take the test more than once to ensure you get the best grade you can.

, Many colleges place a lot of emphasis on extra-curricular activities. What you choose to do with your free time can tell admissions counselors a lot about you and let them know what kind of a culture fit you would be at their college or university.Joining a sports team can show admissions counselors that you work well on a team and are both dedicated and committed to working outside of school.
Being a part of a club can show counselors that you collaborate well and have strong social skills.

, In recent years, college admissions officials have begun placing an increased emphasis on volunteer work and community service when considering applications to their institutions. Colleges and universities see volunteer work in a similar light to extra-curricular activities, but some also feel as though being involved with a cause the student is passionate about can demonstrate their awareness and empathy for the world around them, which reflects well on your application.Look on websites like DoSomething.org to find volunteer causes in your area that are tailored for teens and students.
You can also look in local newspapers or contact non-profit organizations you care about in order to find volunteer opportunities.

, Much like extra-curricular activities, holding a part time job during the school year or summer months can demonstrate some of your great personal qualities to college admissions officials. Holding a part time job demonstrates your willingness to work and learn in a professional environment as well as your level of maturity and responsibility. You may have extenuating financial circumstances that require you to work on top of your academic curriculum. This may limit your ability to participate in extra-curricular activities, but a job can be just as beneficial to your application.Include part time jobs on your college application just as you would other extra-curricular activities.
You may want to pull from your work experience in your application essay. This can explain a lack of formal extra-curricular activities and highlight the beneficial experience you gained.

, Some of the most important elements of letting the admissions officials get to know you in an application is to demonstrate the levels of leadership you are capable of exercising and how creative you can be. These elements are extremely important to being successful in college, and as such, many college admissions officials look for elements indicating each in your application. Colleges are not just looking for new students; they’re looking quality individuals to represent the institution after they graduate. Leadership and creativity can demonstrate that you’re just such a person.Holding leadership positions in your club, team, volunteer organization or part time job are great ways to demonstrate your ability to lead.Demonstrate your creativity by highlighting your passions in your college application essay. Your creative endeavors don’t have to be artistic; it could even be the creative solutions you have found for problems you have faced., If you are going to apply for financial aid or student loans when you go to college, you will need to complete the FAFSA application. The FAFSA is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. It can qualify you for Federal student aid, and is often a requirement to receive student aid from colleges and universities as well.You will need to provide your parents’ tax information when completing your FAFSA application so you may want to ask them for help.
You can complete the FAFSA online here: https://fafsa.ed.gov


, Begin thinking about what colleges you may want to apply to in your sophomore year of high school. By your junior year, you should start seriously considering which schools you may want to apply to. By thinking about your prospects early, you can help to ensure you are meeting the criteria required by the schools you have in mind.Check to see if the schools you are considering require you to take the SAT or ACT exams, then take the one you need for the schools you like.
You don’t need to make any solid decisions early, but you should actively consider different college options.
Make a list of schools you’d like to apply to so you can keep track of which ones you liked and which you didn’t.

, Schools have varying academic requirements, and you may not fit the bill for every college or university out there. There is nothing wrong with applying to schools with high academic requirements, even if you don’t quite meet them, but you should also look for schools that are a good fit for you based on your previous school experiences.Create a list of schools, some that are a bit of a reach academically and some that you meet or exceed the requirements for.
Evaluate the schools on that list compared to other criteria as you search to determine which ones are best for you.

, There are lots of colleges and universities to choose from, so one way you can use to narrow your search is to take where you want to live into account. You may want to stick close to home so you can commute and live with your parents, or you may want to experience a different climate than the one you’ve gotten accustomed to. These preferences can help determine which schools to apply to.Ask yourself where you’d like to live during the school year. Is it close to home? Is it near the beach or the city?
Take your preferences and use them to narrow the region you search for schools in.

, Many people have different preferences about the size and environment of a school they would like to attend. Think about what type of environment you would prefer: larger campuses with more people, or smaller schools with more personal experiences. The environment is also important, as some schools are located in more populated urban areas and others can be found in more rural settings.Smaller schools often have fewer students per professor, so you may receive more individualized attention.
Larger schools offer more people to interact with and a large student community to participate in.
You may want to choose an environment that is similar to one you are familiar with, or you may choose to pursue new experiences in a place with more or fewer people than you’re used to.

, There are a number of different options available to you when choosing a type of school. You should consider your ultimate goals when determining which type of schools to investigate.Community colleges are a great place to begin your college journey. They offer lower costs and their credits often transfer to larger, state schools.
You may want to consider schools with two-year technical programs depending on what your career goals are.
Private colleges and universities may cost more than public ones.

, If you have an idea of what you want to major in, you should take that into account when researching colleges. You don’t have to make a decision about your major before you start attending college, but if you have one in mind you should make sure the schools you apply to offer it.If you aren’t sure what you may want to choose for a major, you may want to consider which subjects in school you enjoy. That may inform your decision.
You will have plenty of time to choose a major once you begin college if you don’t have one in mind already.

, If you are able to visit the campus of schools you may want to apply to, it can help you determine if you think you would be a good fit for the atmosphere of the school. Contact the school ahead of time to schedule a tour of the campus to get a feel for the environment.Ask if you can sit in on a class to get a feel for what the classroom environment might be like.
Speak to some students on campus to ask their opinion of the school and what it’s like to go there.

, Most colleges and universities allow you to complete their admissions application online. Make sure to fill out the application completely and look it over a few times before submitting it. Each college will have different application requirements, so it may take some time to complete it all.Make sure to complete each section carefully. Your admissions application is how the admissions officials will determine if you are a good fit for their school.
You will likely need to complete an essay as a part of your application.

, Your college application essay gives you an opportunity to highlight your written communications ability and can also help you address any issues with your application. If your grades are not as high as you would have hoped, for instance, you can address that issue with your essay in a way that justifies your grades. Write about something that highlights you and makes you seem like a good pick for any school.Create an outline of what you want to include in your essay before you begin to ensure you are well organized.
Ask a teacher or parent to proofread your essay and then make revisions as necessary.

, Every college has application deadlines that you’ll need to be aware of when completing their application. Make sure you give yourself ample time to complete the application and essay, and to provide necessary documents like letters of recommendation so you can be sure to have everything in prior to the deadline.Try establishing your own deadlines one week before the actual deadlines provided by the schools you want to apply to, that way you can be sure there’s time for them to receive it.
Waiting until the last minute can limit your ability to put your best foot forward. Give yourself an opportunity to take your time on the application and essay.

, Some schools may require that you attend an admissions interview. These interviews serve as a supplement to your college application and can help admissions officials determine how good a fit you may be for their school. It can be difficult to discern an applicant’s personality through an application and essay, so an interview can shed some light on who you are as a person and as a student.Do some research about the school before your interview. You should know things like if it’s a public or private school and if it offers a major you are interested in before you attend the interview.
Be prepared to answer questions about your high school academics and extracurricular activities, as well as what you hope to attain from your college experience.

, After submitting your applications, wait to receive acceptance letters back from each of the schools you applied to. Once you receive a few, you can decide which school is the best decision for you to attend. If you were not accepted to any of the schools you applied to, you may want to apply to other schools or attend community college while you bring your grades up.If you applied for financial aid through the schools, compare aid award letters to determine which school is most financially viable.
If you have not visited the campus yet, try to visit each campus you are trying to choose between before making your decision.

Take the ACT instead.,
Attend community college.,
Consider distance learning.,
Study in another country.",How to Get Into College Without Taking the SAT1," If you're not completely opposed to taking a standardized test, you can choose to take the ACT instead of the SAT. Most colleges will accept either, but there are many differences between the two.The SAT places more of an emphasis on vocabulary, while the ACT places more of an emphasis on science and advanced math.
The questions on the ACT are generally more straightforward than the questions on the SAT.
Your scores for the three sections of the SAT are looked at individually, while your score on the ACT is cumulative. This means if you are weak in one area, but strong in another, you may still be able to do well on the ACT.
The writing portion of the ACT is optional, although many schools require it. The writing portion of the SAT is not optional.;
, Many programs at community colleges do not require standardized test scores for admission. You can choose from a wide range of associate's degree programs.If you choose to transfer to a four-year college after attending community college, you may or may not be required to take the SATs. Some schools will waive the requirement if you can show that you did well in community college.

, There are a wide variety of academic programs, from certificate programs to masters degree programs, available online. Many online colleges and universities do not require standardized test scores, although the policies are different at each institution., All countries have different requirements for college admissions, and some do not require any standardized tests. If you are interested in attending college in another country, make sure to do thorough research on the school's reputation, the cost, the programs offered, and the language of instruction.In Austria, for example, the only requirement to enroll in many bachelor's degree programs is a high school diploma, although you may have to take classes in the German language.Some universities in Belgium will waive the requirement for SAT scores if you have an IB diploma."

Local art centers offer a variety of inexpensive workshops where you can test your creativity. However if you want to make a living with your skills you may want to enroll in a degree program. They allow you to develop your technical and critical skills, as well as provide professional connections in your chosen field.;
, You will need to research schools to find out what majors they offer. The internet is one of the first places turn for information. It may be hard to sort through all the information available. However events like the National Performing and Visual Arts College Fairs and National Portfolio Days are great places to meet representatives and gain more in depth knowledge about a variety of institutions. You may also want to start by asking your art teachers for suggestions.

, Reputable art schools will require one. The purpose of the portfolio is to help each school understand an applicant’s artistic potential. Therefore, portfolios are not always evaluated merely on the basis of demonstrated skill. Students who have had significant access to studio art instruction are expected to show greater skill than those whose exposure to art training has been relatively modest. Some schools require students to submit work in specific mediums or draw specific items (Like the famous RISD bicycle requirement). Other schools only require that students submit 20 pieces and leave the rest to them. Be sure you are aware of the requirements for each school you apply to. Do not submit reproductions of work by or based on work by other artists, nor drawings that you made from photographs or illustrations, they want to see your original ideas and execution that is not based upon other works.

, High School Seniors typically do this between October and January. Plan on what you are going to tell and show them. Familiarize yourself with each school and prepare to ask informed questions.

, You may also want to bring a sketchbook with you. You don't need to purchase an expensive portfolio to display your work. Just make sure your work is organized and presentable. Avoid showing work that more than three years old. Art Schools are not interested in work you did when you were in Middle School.

, Be thoughtful and polite when touring the school. Art Schools provide an environment where students are free to explore self-expression to it's limit. Be prepared to encounter art in the hallways or studios that challenges conventional values.

, Show them your portfolio, and explain the details to them. Talk about your process, ideas, and things that inspire you. You may want to bring a pen and paper to write down suggestions or artists the reviewer thinks you should research. Thank them for the interview, ask the reviewer for their contact information.

,, In that case you will need to submit 35mm slides, digital images, or prints of your work.

Do the right things in high school.,
Choose your preferred branch, and get acquainted with a recruiter.,
Don't tread new ground.,
Do as well as possible on your college entrance exams.,
If your high school has a Junior ROTC unit, join it.,
Keep up the physical fitness training!,
Sign the acceptance letter when an ROTC unit chooses you, or pick which one you want if you get several offers.,
Don't let it get you down if you don't get a scholarship offer.,
Understand that these organizations are absolutely no joke.",How to Get an ROTC Scholarship," Do not do drugs or alcohol. Study hard, stay away from distractions and substances, get into sports. Good grades are important, but good study habits are critical. also, you should stay healthy, stay fit, and train hard. Stay in good physical shape, do community service projects, develop excellent study skills, and maintain hobbies. Even though military service is about teamwork, your goal from day one is to differentiate yourself above your peers.;
, If your guidance counselor's office doesn't have contact information, check your white pages under US Government, Department of Defense. Any recruiter will be thrilled to make sure you have all the forms, materials, and support you need to apply for an ROTC scholarship. They ask you to take a couple of tests. The better you do, the more they will want you.

, Talk to Military Officers who may be friends of the family for advice; students who are currently in ROTC; college councilors of schools who offer ROTC programs; or Regional Directors of ROTC programs for your target branch. Contact information for these people can be found on the internet. Organize your thoughts, pick up the phone and talk to them.

, This is the single most important criteria used to select high school candidates. Get a good night's sleep before the test, and have breakfast, no matter how nervous you may be. If your blood sugar gets too low, your brain will run on empty. Eat a sugary snack right before the SAT or ACT exam.

, This will give you a little advantage in college, although many many people have never worn a military uniform or walked together in a synchronized manner (they call it ""marching"") before entering a college ROTC program.

, A physical fitness exam is not something you can cram for at the last minute! You should be able to run a good mile and a half in less than 15 minutes, do a dozen pull ups, and crank out 50 sit ups at least, or you will be doing a lot of remedial physical training.

, You pick two or three at the time of the college entrance exams, as well as the ROTC program you prefer. Your military branch makes your scores available to all university ROTC programs for that branch. So, even if your first choices pass on you, another university ROTC may step up to offer you a scholarship. Or...

, Go to a good university with an ROTC program, and enter as a no-contract candidate. It's HARD going to college AND meeting obligations as an ROTC member. MANY students end up giving up their scholarships during the first year. ROTC units look at no-contract ROTC students first. Get good grades in college, stay in shape, stay out of trouble (don't even speed!) and you have a great shot at getting that scholarship.

, If you don't have the stuff, admit it and go home. Serving your country and the good people in the military services will be one of the greatest privileges of your life.

Get a good teacher who knows your strengths and weaknesses.,
Practice daily to improve your talent and skill.,
Expand your knowledge of your skill-set.,
Push yourself to go up against the best.",How to Get Into Juilliard1," Be willing to listen to and learn from this teacher's assessment of both your strengths and weaknesses, so that you can enhance the strengths and improve the weaknesses without fear or favor.;
, Devote at least one hour daily if you're a musician and three hours daily if you're a dancer.

, If you're a musician, vary your repertoire as broadly as possible. If you're a dancer, try different styles of dancing, even if they are not ones you intend to specialize in. If you're looking towards drama, act in different roles. This way, you'll learn to appreciate your skill as a whole and become better at what you already love doing. Moreover, the wider your abilities and the more comfortable you are with different approaches, the more versatile and suitable a performer you're making yourself into.

, Attend competitions, master classes, and/or lectures if possible. Most of all, perform as often as possible! Performing in public is a key part of being fully engaged in the Arts. Furthermore, the more you perform the easier you'll overcome stage fright, and the easier your Juilliard audition will be. (However, realize that you may always have nerves, some of the greatest performers always do, and learn to channel this into performing even better.)

"
Firstly, you need to select the universities you would like to apply to and decide what it is that you want from your university.,
Once you have decided what qualities of a university would suit you best, you need to research the different universities.,
Once you have a list of several universities that appeal to you, arrange to attend an open day.",How to Get Into a Nursing Degree at a UK University1," You need to consider:


The location of the university. Is it easy for you to travel home should you feel homesick? Do you want to be in a city or in the country (the nursing experiences you have will be affected by this)? How are the public transport links to the nearest hospitals and health clinics?
The size of the university.
Accommodation available. Do you want to live with just nursing students? Will you rent privately after the first year? Do you want to live in flats or halls of residence? How many people would you be willing to share a bathroom/kitchen with? Is the accommodation in a safe location?
Structure of the course. Whilst all nursing courses are required to have a 50/50 split between placement and theory, some universities have fewer, longer placement blocks, and others have more short placements.
Assignments. How often will you be assessed by the university? How many essays and exams should you expect? Will you have to revise or complete assignments while on placements?;
, One way of doing this is by attending a UCAS Convention. These are held annually across the UK. Most universities will have prospectuses and a representative there, so you can ask any questions you have about the course. There are also seminars held during these events which give advice about completing your UCAS application. Another useful resource is the use of a HEAP guide. Most school and college libraries will contain one of these as they are very expensive to buy. These list all of the universities which run nursing courses in the order of grade requirements. This will aid you in looking at realistic options considering your predicted grades. Don't be afraid to apply to universities somewhat above or below your predictions - it's good to push yourself and also to have a safety net.

, Many universities require booking in advance. This is particularly useful as it allows you to ask specific questions to the lecturers and tutors. You can also assess the learning environments - be sure to see the clinical skills areas and lecture theatres. You should also be sure to spend some time looking at the accommodation on offer, and also have a wander around the town or city. Remember that you will have to live there for most of the year, and you need to be happy with the location and quality of the shops, nightclubs, culture etc.

Determine if you qualify for automatic admission.,
Find a test flexible school.,
Find a test optional school.,
Choose a school that doesn't accept SAT scores at all.",How to Get Into College Without Taking the SAT2," In some states, students who graduate in the top of their class are automatically accepted into public universities in that state. In Texas, for example, all students who graduate in the top 10% of their class are automatically accepted to public schools.You may still have to take the SAT to be admitted to a public university in Texas, depending on the school you choose, but your scores will not factor into the admissions decision, so it doesn't matter if you did poorly.

, Some universities offer a wide variety of options for submitting standardized test scores, which could be very beneficial to students who perform very strongly in certain academic areas.


New York University, for example, will accept the scores from three SAT subject tests, AP tests, or IB higher-level tests in lieu of traditional SAT or ACT scores. This allows students to submit scores that are reflective of their high achievements in specific subjects., A growing number of US universities are now ""test optional,"" which means that students can decide whether or not to submit standardized test scores as a part of their application. In fact, more than 800 universities now admit at least some students without SAT or ACT scores.If you choose not to submit SAT or other standardized test scores with your application, you should make sure that the rest of your application is very strong. You should spend extra time on your personal essay, making sure that it tells your unique story of personal achievement.You might be required to submit samples of academic work that you did for your high school classes in lieu of test scores. The requirements are different for each school, so read the application instructions carefully., Hampshire College has a ""test blind"" policy, in which it states that it will not consider SAT or ACT scores for admissions at all, whether the scores are good or bad. Instead, admissions are based on transcripts, personal essays, interviews, and extracurricular involvement.Hampshire College's policy is very unique, but it is possible that other colleges will adopt similar policies in the years to come.

Once your skills have developed enough, it's time to get ready for your audition.,
Make sure to allot yourself at least a couple months to prepare for the audition.,
Do the basic logistics once you're ready to audition.,
Start preparing with your full attention to this goal.,
Do mock auditions.",How to Get Into Juilliard2," Most people auditioning for Juilliard have had many years of training, honing their talent and skills and constantly relearning and reinventing their abilities. The level of Juilliard might not be for you if you've been studying merely for one or two years. Ask your teacher if Juilliard is right for you and be humble about the answer; if you need more time, take that as a constructive comment, not a criticism and get stuck into more practice and perfecting of your skills. Be strong and sensible in your goals and you'll get there someday!

, You want to feel secure in your performance abilities and know deep within that you're actually ready.

, First, go on the Juilliard website: Juilliard.edu to find your audition requirements. Sometimes, especially if you're auditioning for the Pre-College music division, the repertoire guidelines vary by age. Read the rules and guidance very carefully, to make sure that you fully understand what is expected. If you don't, contact the college to find out what is needed.

, First, work with your teacher to select what you want to do, making sure that it is something that will completely highlight your talent at its absolute best. If necessary, ask your teacher for additional advisers to come on board and help you make the best choice from a variety of opinions. Once you've chosen the audition piece or repertoire, learn it thoroughly. Practice daily, think about it when you're not practicing it, and take on board all constructive feedback so that you continue to improve. The better you learn what you'll perform in the first few weeks, the more secure you'll feel in the last few weeks.

, A common (and very helpful) thing to do is to attend a competition and compete with your audition selection. If you win, well, all the better for practice! You can also gather family members and/or teacher into a mock 'jury': it will give you a feel for what the audition will be like. If you don't succeed or feel that you didn't do very well, use this as an opportunity to reflect on what needs the most concentration for improvement––failure is not to be viewed as a bad thing, it's simply a nudge in the right direction and it's important to take hold of the lesson and make the most of it.

"
"
Be well rested.,
Try to eat a substantial breakfast.,
Wear something nice.,
Use your nerves to help you stay focused.,
Run over your audition in your head.,
Ask a family member to sit with you outside the audition room.,
Go and do your best.",How to Get Into Juilliard3," The night before, get a good rest. This is said so many times that it becomes a cliché, but it really works. Take a sleeping pill if you're nervous. You should be able to wake up relatively late because Juilliard auditions are not scheduled too early in the morning.

, You don't have to have a three-course meal, but try to stomach some toast and fruit. If you honestly can't eat anything––and that's perfectly natural––then sip something nutritious, like a smoothie.

, If you're a dancer, then you'll obviously be wearing a leotard. If you're a musician, then try to pick out a nice dress if you're a girl. If you're a boy, then wear a shirt and tie. Some people like to wear a suit (you don't have to wear a tux), but if you do then be sure to unbutton it before you start playing, because you don't want your suit to restrict your movement for playing.


Ask your teacher for advice about your selected outfit. He or she may suggest changes to ensure it is going to work well for you.

, It's normal to be nervous! The last minutes before you go into the audition are usually the worst. If you feel like puking, then go to the bathroom and take deep breaths. Tell yourself that you're fine, it'll be all over soon, and the audition honestly doesn't matter.


You might like to eat plenty of peppermints: the mints release an anti-anxiety hormone., It will help you feel secure.

, They'll most likely give you a hug and make you feel better.

, You have worked hard to reach this point, you know you're ready, and all you can do now is the best you can, knowing that you've got the talent and skills well honed. If you succeed, that's great; if not, take it as an experience that will inform future tries.

"
"
In order to present yourself as a well-rounded applicant, you may wish to consider the following:


Volunteering.,
Your next step is to create your UCAS personal statement.,
Get your personal statement reviewed.,
Hopefully you will receive an invitation to attend an interview.",How to Get Into a Nursing Degree at a UK University2," This does not have to be within a hospital or care setting (although this is useful). Any volunteering which shows that you are a compassionate and caring individual will impress admissions tutors. Examples could include working at RSPCA shelters, with disabled adults or children, at homeless shelters, food banks, with the girl guides. Try to get as many different experiences as possible.
Work experience. Try contacting local hospitals, health clinics, care homes etc to ask if you could attend for a week or even a couple of days of work experience. Even if this is sitting in an office doing admin work, it will still give you an insight into the workings of the organisation.
Taking extra short courses. Sites such as Coursera have free online healthcare courses delivered in a university-style format and run by universities worldwide.
Reading nursing books and journals. Finding something through a course or volunteering that particularly interested you and researching it is an important skill to have. Choose a particular topic and read about it. Look in publications such as the Nursing Standard to get inspiration from current events in nursing.

, Avoid listing your characteristics. This is a good example of how you can expand your points: 'Volunteering in my local homeless shelter this summer has increased my awareness of the different factors which can result in a person living in poverty and having a poor quality of life. Research published in X, by Y, concluded that prejudice towards patients is still apparent in hospitals in the UK. It is, therefore, vital for nurses to be non-judgemental when delivering care, which I hope my time at the shelter will help me to demonstrate.' Always make sure to link your experiences to the qualities you have developed in that situation, and then remember to explicitly show that you are aware why this is an important skill for a nurse to possess. Another example would be: 'After reading the July 26th edition of the Nursing Standard, I was particularly interested in an article which-which scrutinised the Liverpool Care Pathway. Research at my college library showed that the Liverpool Care Pathway had been the subject of 12 complaints of abuse and negligence. It is important that nurses are vigilant in reporting cases of negligence and that these are investigated fully, and also that nurses assess the most recent evidence to ensure that they are aware of the best practice to use'. This example clearly demonstrates that the applicant is keen to learn more about current issues and will take initiative and can complete basic research, but shows this in a way that is much more professional and interesting.

, Ask your parents and teachers to look at your personal statement and suggest improvements. Most colleges have a system in place to ensure that your personal statement is reviewed by a relevant staff member. You can also go to The Student Room which has a team of Personal Statement Helpers - people who are already on a nursing degree and who will suggest changes in grammar, structure and content for free. This is particularly useful because these people have been trained and approved, and have undergone the UCAS application recently.

, Tips for interviews:


Be aware of a handful of current issues. Read the Nursing Standard for ideas.
Dress smartly and professionally. It is better to be overdressed than looking scruffy (avoid jeans, trainers etc). It doesn't matter what the other applicants dress like or what they think of you - you only need to impress the admissions tutors by being professional in your appearance.
Don't be afraid to speak up in group interviews. You need to stand out, but remember to let others speak. It's also important to show that you are a good listener.
Don't be afraid to (respectfully) disagree with another applicant in group interviews, as long as you can back up your point with solid reasoning.
Remember to consider all sides of the story when completing a situation task. Consider how a condition would affect a patient's social and family life, work and money as well as direct symptoms such as pain.
If you have a maths test, ensure that you can do basic multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction with and without a calculator. Practice unit conversions and also working with fractions.
If you have a one on one interview and suffer from nerves, consider questions you may be asked and mentally prepare answers. Popular questions include: Why do you want to be a nurse? Why do you want to study at this university? What is the most important quality for a nurse to have?
Be sure to be confident and smile! Body language is very important.

While it can get expensive to apply to dozens of colleges, you should look at the average cost to submit an application and apply to as many places as you can afford.Studies have shown that if you have a lot of colleges to choose from, you're more likely to receive more financial aid. If you're a good student, colleges will want to draw you to them.
Apply to a variety of different school types. Try public universities as well as private colleges that are known to offer decent financial aid (which you can usually find information about online).;
, Many students begin their collegiate studies at a two-year community college. After two years you can earn an associate's degree, then decide whether to transfer to a four-year college. You'll be able to earn a bachelor's degree in less time since you're coming in with a two-year degree and all the course credit that you took.Community college tuition is typically much cheaper than the tuition at a four-year college or university.
Most colleges will let you transfer in some outside credit, but there are often restrictions. For example, you may have to have above a minimum grade in each course, and there may be a cap on how many credits you can transfer.
Find out whether four-year colleges and universities in your area accept transfer credit and how much they're willing to let you transfer.

, While you may prefer to move away from home, staying within your state can save you a lot of cash. Consider applying to state universities to take advantage of your in-state residency, or establish residency somewhere else before applying to schools in that state.Residents of a state can get tuition rates significantly cheaper than out-of-state students would get. At the University of Texas at Austin, for example, in-state tuition is almost $24,000 cheaper than out-of-state tuition.
Public state universities are the most likely schools to offer deep discounts for in-state residents.
If you're planning on moving out of state, either for a better school or for unrelated reasons, establish your residency at least 12 months before classes would start. Some states and schools require even longer to establish residency, so check online well in advance.

, Some colleges and universities will help you earn your degree as quickly as possible. There are a number of ways to do this, though it will typically require more vigorous work on your part to make it happen.Some colleges will accept advanced placement credits from high school.
Most schools let you opt to take summer classes, which can help shave off a semester or two from your estimated completion time.
If you take heavy course loads during the regular school year, you can also trim off some of the time it would typically take to complete your studies.

, When you've settled on a school, you should apply for any and all scholarships and grants that you're eligible for. These can help significantly defray the cost of tuition, and may even be applicable to other expenses like books or room and board.Apply to any and all scholarships offered by the school you choose.
You may also be eligible for outside scholarships from various foundations and organizations., You may find yourself disappointed with the amount of funding being offered after getting some financial aid offers from a couple of schools. If this happens, try reaching out to the financial aid offices at those schools to see if they can offer you anything better. It may not always work, but it never hurts to try petitioning for more financial aid.Write a letter to the financial aid office at any school(s) you're considering and describe your finances, family situation, and any other important factors affecting your ability to pay for college.
Let the financial aid office know about any other offers you've received from other schools, and stress that you'd really prefer to attend their institution if they can offer you better funding.
Don't be rude or demanding, but offer a genuine request with courtesy and sincerity.

, Whether you get a scholarship or not, you should still apply for federal student aid. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is available online and will help determine your eligibility for additional sources of funding, such as work-study programs and student loans.Make sure you complete your FAFSA application before your chosen school's priority deadline to ensure you get the most financial aid possible.In addition to your school's deadline, you'll need to make sure you meet both state and federal deadlines for completing and submitting your FAFSA materials., Depending on your chosen career path, you may be able to knock out some or all of your student debt through public service programs. The amount of time you'll have to spend in public service may vary, depending on the program you enroll in and the type of work you'll be doing.Many teachers are able to pay off their student debt by working post-graduate teaching assignments with in-need school districts.
Some law school graduates may be able to join a public service program where student debt is paid off by working as a staffer for a member of Congress.
Find out more about these and other federal programs by searching online or contacting a representative of the program.

, Military service has been a long-standing means of getting an affordable college education for many individuals. You can get a tuition-free college education and living stipend in exchange for a commitment to military service, and you may be able to customize your military career to meet your professional goals.The terms and length of your service will vary, depending on the branch you enlist in and the program of study you choose.

, Depending on your ability to multitask, you may be able to work while you attend school full-time. However, this can easily get in the way of your studies and make it difficult to balance your time. If that's the case, you can still work during summer and winter break to make a little extra cash between semesters.


Find work nearby so that you don't have to worry about commuting from school to work or vice versa.
Look for jobs with flexible hours. Let your employer know up front that you're a student and that your education comes first.

, If you're really in need of money for college you can always ask other family members for assistance. Some people may be reluctant to ask for help. However, if your family is well-off it can reduce the amount of aid you're eligible for, so it may not hurt to ask your parents or grandparents about the possibility of getting some assistance.Ask tactfully and politely. Never demand money or assistance from anyone.
Say something like, ""You know I hate to have to ask for help, but it would really mean a lot to me if I could attend _____ to study _____ and become a _____. Is there any way you might be able to help me go to college?""

, Living away from campus is usually cheaper than living in a dorm or on-campus apartment, but not always. In some high-rent cities, the on-campus options may be more affordable. The tradeoff is that you're not on campus for all the convenience and socialization that comes with living in the dorms, but you can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars by renting your own place.Assess your living options, both on-campus and off-campus, by comparing dorm costs to the average advertised rent price off-campus. Then choose the less-expensive option.
You can find apartment listings online or in your local newspaper.
Look around at different neighborhoods and different types of housing to get a feel for what's available in your price range.

, One easy way to make living off-campus a little cheaper is to find alternate ways of commuting. The biggest downside to living off-campus is the commute, so by making it cheaper (or free) to get to and from class, you can pocket that extra cash and put it towards your rent, tuition, or book expenses.Walk, bike, or take public transportation whenever possible.
If you live with or near other students, ask them about carpooling together. You can take turns driving or chip in gas money to a designated carpool driver so that everyone shares transportation costs.

, Having roommates can help defray the cost of renting an apartment or home. However, living with other people also has its disadvantages, including a loss of privacy and a potentially noisy living situation. If you need a cheap place to live, though, splitting the cost with one or more other people may help you save.Find roommates you can trust. You'll want to know that your roommates won't throw wild parties during finals week or invite untrustworthy people into your home.
If you have people you're already friends with, ask them about living together. If not, make sure you meet your potential roommates in advance and try to get to know them a little before moving in together.

, Even if your tuition is paid for, you'll still have to worry about the cost of textbooks. Some books cost over $100 each and will only be used for one semester. Instead of paying out hundreds of dollars for your course texts, find ways of getting your books cheaper or even for free.


Buying used textbooks is a great way to cut down on costs. You can get the same textbook for significantly less than a new book would cost - just make sure it's the most up-to-date edition that you need for class.
Consider renting books instead of buying them. Some bookstores and online retailers allow you to borrow textbooks for a semester and then return them, and you can also find textbooks for rent at the school library.

, It may sound obvious, but the most expensive way to get an education is to leave college without a degree.If you're going to be saddled with any kind of debt, you might as well get your money's worth by earning a degree. That degree can unlock many career opportunities for you in the future, and you'll be more likely to escape debt by landing a higher-paying job than if you don't get a degree.


Talk to career counselors and other specialists on campus if you're having trouble keeping your grades up or staying in school. These professionals can help you develop and stick to a plan that leads to graduation.

If you are having a hard time keeping your GPA up, think about tutoring, taking summer classes to devote more time to one class, or studying more. Since the programs are so competitive, your GPA needs to be as high as possible.Most PT programs have minimum GPA requirements, so check the program you are interested in to know what GPA to aspire to.

, There is no specific major that PT schools look for when accepting a student. However, since you are taking so many classes in the sciences, it is likely that a major that relates to science would make your degree easier on you. This way, you won't have to take too many classes outside the sciences to complete your major.


There are some common majors, which include biology, psychology, exercise science, and kinesiology., PT school is not easy. You should also be prepared to work hard in mentally and physically demanding classes. They are also highly competitive. Many schools choose only 30 students from over 200 to 600 applicants. You need to find ways to gain experience and work hard in order to be accepted into a physical therapy graduate program. Programs are typically looking for around 100 observational hours in a variety of settings.Find ways to get either volunteer or paid experience with a licensed physical therapist. Look into surrounding hospitals, physical therapy clinics, nursing homes, or other healthcare establishments to find somewhere to get observational experience.
These experiences are often required for program. Make sure your hours are verified by the licensed therapist you observe., As you work toward applying for PT school, you need to keep up to date in what is going on in the profession. Read current journals about the new practices that are happening in the field. Learn about the specialties that the field offers so you know the options for your future and what you might want to specialize in.


Figure out what about the field makes you want to pursue it. This will help you later when you are asked that kind of question in an admissions interview., When you are getting ready for applications, which is typically during your last year of your undergraduate degree, you need to take the GRE. The necessary score needed for your program will vary depending on the school that you apply to, but the scores range from 130-170 for Verbal and Quantitative Reasoning and 0 to 6 for Analytical Writing. You can arrange to take the GRE through your school or go to the Education Testing Service's website to find local testing centers.If you don't make the score that you need the first time around, there are preparatory classes you can take or books that you can get to help you increase your scores. There are also free test prep questions on the Educational Testing Service's website.Even if you haven't picked a school yet, you need to go ahead and take the GRE as soon as possible. The earlier you take it, the more time you have to retake it if you need higher scores.

, Before you apply, you need to make sure you have the right program. When looking for the right school for you, look at the location of the school, the requirements for their PT program, the cost of the program, and any funding available. You also need to make sure that the program you are looking at is accredited in whatever country the school is in.


Being accredited means that the country where the school is located recognizes it as a legitimate school that had the qualifications to provide you with the skills and coursework necessary for your degree.
If you end up getting a degree at a school with no accreditation, your degree may be worthless.Each physical therapy school is slightly different. All schools will list their application requirements online or in their brochures. You may want to choose a school that aligns with your experience and qualifications.

, Almost all graduate programs require letters of recommendation from professors and professionals who can attest to your skills and merits as an individual, a student, and a future physical therapist. Try to make a great impression on the therapists you work with and the professors that you study under. Then, you can ask them for letters of recommendation that will be filled with praise for you.


Typically, you will need at least three references when you apply to a physical therapy school. One of your references should be a physical therapist. You may be able to use the same references for all of the schools to which you choose to apply.
Make sure whomever you ask knows you well enough to write you a great letter. You don't want to have mediocre letters of recommendation. You want to stand out against the rest of the thousands of students who apply to PT school each year.

, Most applications will ask for an admissions essay. In your essay, you want to convince the admission board what makes you the best candidate for their school. Talk about your experiences in the field, the coursework that you completed to prepare you for an advanced degree, and how hard you will work in the program. Also express why you want to be a physical therapist, what the profession means to you, and what your future goals are.


Essays can set you apart from other applicants who may have taken similar courses, have similar GPAs, and similar experience to you. The essay can make you more approachable and attractive to the admissions board., Although each school most likely requires an application fee, you will increase your chances of getting into a school if you apply to three to five schools. If you get into more than one, you can choose which school you like best.


Be meticulous in the application process. Avoid typos and ask your friends to proof your work. You may also ask for pointers from any physical therapists that you have worked for. Provide all the paperwork needed as requested, or your application may be overlooked.

, If you don't get in on your first try, don't give up. It is a really competitive field, and most programs turn away hundreds of students every year. You may want to broaden your base of schools that you apply to each year, in order to help your chances of being admitted.


It may take a few tries to get in to the program you want, but don't lose hope.

, While you wait for the next round of applications to come around, get more experience with licensed physical therapists to ensure that you have more experience and can add more to your application the next time around. Make sure you have varied settings such as rehab, outpatient, hospital and home health.

, Even if you do not get invited to interview for the school(s) you applied to, it is a good idea to practice mock interviews with seasoned interviewers. Preferably do this with a practicing P.T. that helps with the interviews, or the faculty that performs interviews. Their feedback will be invaluable. There are books on Amazon and Nook that delve further into the intricacies needed to make you a successful applicant.

Generally, doctoral programs in this field look for completed coursework in nutrition or dietetics, so consider these as potential majors for your bachelor’s degree.
Some programs will consider people with a wide variety of educational backgrounds. Consult the academic advisor for the programs in which you are interested in enrolling.
A bachelor’s degree is normally the minimum educational requirement for doctoral programs. You will not be admitted unless you have one.
Your graduate program will often require you to have at least a 3.00 GPA for admission.
Focus on programs known for their strength in nutrition. Top programs include Boston University, Drexel University, and Hunter College at the City University of New York.;
, In addition to a bachelor’s degree, you might also need a master’s degree as a prerequisite for a doctoral degree in nutrition. Refer to the admissions requirements of your selected doctoral program to ensure that you are meeting all coursework prerequisites.


Like with your bachelor’s degree, a masters in nutrition or dietetics is a good choice.
Some programs will offer you the ability to enroll in a master’s/PhD program. This means that you can enroll as a master’s student and then move right into the PhD program. These programs are contingent on your academic success and the recommendation of your advisors.
When enrolling in a master’s program, consider the quality of the program. If you want to enroll in a top program for your PhD, you should make sure that your master’s degree is competitive for placement into top programs.
A master’s usually takes 2 to 3 years to complete., The final prerequisite you’ll need to complete is the GRE. The GRE is an exam that tests your verbal and math skills in order to determine your level of proficiency. Graduate programs, especially those in nutrition, use your scores to help them determine if you are qualified and suited for their programs.


Highly competitive nutrition programs typically require strong GRE scores on both the verbal and quantitative sections of the GRE.
Very good programs in nutrition and health sciences require scores higher than 1200 (in total). However, there are a number of programs that will take lower scores.
Enroll in a GRE prep course, if necessary, to strengthen your ability to answer timed test questions.
Schedule your test for as early in the year as you can. Testing slots book up very early, especially as spring university graduation approaches., Once you’ve decided that you want a PhD in nutrition, you need to start searching for and researching programs that grant PhDs in this field of study. Making an exhaustive and complete search is important, as you’ll want to know all of your options before you pick one.


An Internet search using ""PhD in nutrition"" or ""doctorate in nutrition"" will lead you to a long list of universities.
Consult popular magazines that list the top programs at different universities around the country.
If you prefer to stay in a specific geographic area, make a list of the universities in your region and visit their websites to find out if they offer a program that fits your needs.
Read the program descriptions. Some programs are focused strictly on nutrition, whereas others offer specializations or combine the topic with other areas like exercise physiology or public health., After you’ve researched a wide variety of programs, you should begin the process of narrowing down your list and selecting a few different ones. You should narrow down your list to programs that best suit your needs and desires. Make sure to:


Consider the cost of enrollment as well as any potential monetary assistance from the university. The average cost of tuition per year is between $20,000 and $25,000.
Consider the physical location and the region of the program.
Consider job placement rates from graduates of the program. Job placement often corresponds with a given program's ranking. Top ranking programs that offer a PhD in nutrition include the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Tufts University, and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Consider the faculty and the advisor you may be working with when narrowing down programs.
Focus on at least 3 to 5 programs., Now that you’ve selected a few potential programs to focus on, you need to review the application requirements of each program. This is important, as you’ll need to figure out all of the documents you’ll need to submit in with each application. Requirements typically include:


A bachelor's or master's degree.
High scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE).
A resume.
A personal statement.
Letters of recommendation.
Note the the application deadline due date for enrolling in the next school year or semester., When applying to the programs you’ve selected, make sure to fill out the complete application. Filling out the application on time in full will make sure your application process goes smoothly and that you are considered by the program’s admissions board.


You will have to provide specific personal information such as your social security number, date of birth, and other identifying information.
You will have to provide all relevant academic information such as dates of graduation, grade point averages, and more.
You will probably have to write in your GRE and/or SAT scores, so have those handy.
Write legibly, in black ink.
If you can, fill out the application on your computer. This will make sure that academic advisor assessing your application will be able to read your application., Universities generally request a resume along with the application to examine your prior academic training and work experience in the field of nutrition. Based on your background, conclusions are made about your ability to make a positive contribution to the nutrition field.


Include a professional summary at the top of your C.V. Your professional summary should give an idea of your focus in the field of nutrition as well as your experience.
Outline your professional experience in the field of nutrition. This can range from internships to full-time jobs.
List your educational background. This should include all degrees awarded and should show relevant coursework in the field of nutrition.
Show any publications you might have. Publications in journals like Current Developments in Nutrition or The Journal of Nutrition will demonstrate your commitment and leadership in the field., The purpose of this statement is to understand and state your professional goals, academic and professional background, your reason for choosing the specific program, and how you see yourself contributing to the nutrition field. Read the application instructions carefully as each program specifies a different content and length requirement.


Address your interest and dedication to the field of nutrition.
If you have an interest in a certain aspect of the field, like nutrition in developing countries, state it.
If you already know what your research and dissertation work will focus on, explain it. In addition, if you know your research question, pose it. For instance, ""What are the long-term health implications of vitamin C deficiency in East Africa?""

, There is a very good chance that the program will require you to provide several letters of recommendation. These letters are intended to provide the program admissions panel with more information about your character and work ethic.


Be prepared to provide at least three letters of recommendation from academics or professionals familiar with your work or merit.
Request such letters from employers, professors and colleagues who are closely familiar with your capabilities, performance and significant accomplishments.
Personal references from family members or friends are sometimes permitted, depending on the program., After you’ve gathered all of the application materials, make sure to submit it. Submitting it on time and to the appropriate program representative is extremely important in making sure you will be considered for the program.

, A PhD in nutrition requires you to complete a certain number of graduate courses on related subjects. Nutrition coursework is intended to provide you with all of the basics of nutrition and to give you the tools required to help you become an expert in your subfield.


A PhD program in nutrition usually requires completion of courses in vitamins and minerals, fats, proteins and carbohydrates.
Other courses focus on research methods, nutritional epidemiology and nutritional assessments.
Consult the program guide for specifics concerning required and elective courses.
Graduate coursework for your Ph.D. will take between 2 and 4 years to complete. , After you’ve completed graduate course work, you’ll need to take your doctoral qualifying exams. These exams will test you on all of the information you’ve learned in your course work. They are the final step before you begin work on your dissertation.


Qualifying exams vary from program to program. Talk to the program advisor before enrolling.
Your qualifying exams will most likely be scored on a pass or fail basis.
Qualifying exams are extremely involved and usually take place over a week or longer. Depending on the program, you might test for 6 or 8 hours a day for 6 to 8 days., Deciding on your research top is perhaps one of the most important decisions you'll make in graduate school. This decision will not only dictate the focus of your research and your academic life for the next year or two, but it will help establish you in a subfield within the broader field.


Your topic and/or research question should be original and should make a new addition to the profession.
Your research topic should also be feasible given your time and financial capabilities.
Your research problem can be on a wide variety of topics, including human health and nutrition, animal nutrition, and even the economics and politics of food consumption.
Very often, you'll narrow down research questions and specific topics with the help of your academic advisor -- a faculty member who serves as a mentor., Conducting your research is often one of the most exciting and interesting parts of your doctoral studies. During this phase of your PhD studies, you'll conduct studies and/or gather evidence to support the thesis of your dissertation.


Depending on your focus, subfield, and research question, you may be required to conduct a study and work with people on a nutrition-related problem that you have picked. Potential studies could include looking at what people from different socio-economic or regional groups consume, the impact of popular foods on human health, or more.
Depending on your focus, you may compile statistics and work with previously-existing studies.
The research phase of your program may take up to two years., The culmination of your coursework, work with an academic advisor, and your research will be your dissertation. Writing your dissertation is a prolonged process and will serve as the final achievement of your graduate studies.


The length of dissertations vary, depending on program. Most often, though, dissertations will be from 150 pages to 250 pages.
Typically, you will be required to defend your dissertation before a panel of faculty.
The amount of time needed to write your dissertation will vary. It could take between 1 and 3 years, depending on your research."

Find out about cooking facilities in your dorm.,
Find out about the fire codes.,
Taking steps 1 and 2 into account, make sure you have what you need, but stay simple; space is often limited.,
Learn to cook with a microwave.",How to Cook in a College Dorm," If there's a stove, it's most likely to be electric. There usually are also microwaves for public use. Also find out if either of these even work. You may have to cook on an other floor or in a different dorm (provided you have someone with you who lives there).;
, Stuff like hot pots, coffee pots, candles (useful if you're addicted to roasted marshmallows), and hot plates may not be allowed. But, although this isn't recommended, it may help to be familiar with how strictly enforced those rules are. They may be rules whereas long as nothing is out during inspections, your RA won't even care if you're walking down the hall with a hot pot.

,


If they're allowed, hot pots are great to have. Also, microwave safe plates, bowls, and coffee cups.
You need basic utensils, forks and spoons, a sharp knife for cooking, and chop sticks if you're a lover of Asian food. Also, a spatula, spaghetti spoon, and one of those over-sized spoons for mixing. Consider what you actually use.
For pots and pans, just cover the basics, and be as simple as you can be. A frying pan, saucepan, and spaghetti pot (plus colander). A steamer or double boiler if you cook with them a lot and know you will use them. If you bake, a mixing bowl, cookie sheet, brownie/cake/bread/muffin tin (again, think of what you'll actually use).
Aluminum foil, paper towels, plastic wrap, and dish soap are also necessary. You may also want plastic bags and/or Tupperware for leftovers.
Don't go Costco on ingredients. You will be able to find smaller amounts at a regular grocery store (but if your parents shop there, you can reuse small bottles and stock up at home). Make sure to have nonperishable basics: oil, sugar, flour, baking soda (you can also sprinkle this in the trash so it doesn't smell as bad), rice, pasta, and vinegar. Buy perishables such as produce, milk, eggs as you need them (if you don't have a fridge, you should find a friend who will let you store these things. But a fridge is also highly advised).
Keep microwave and instant food too. Ramen, easy mac, instant coffee (unless you have a coffee maker you can fit in your room), tea, powdered drink mix. Even with these, you can get creative, especially with Ramen. While they're not necessarily healthy, they can be the difference between spending $5 on a meal, and you can control the amount.

, Especially if you don't have a stove in your dorm. And this can also be a lot less time consuming than cooking conventionally and cleaning pots and dishes. Here are several WikiHow articles, with basics and fancier stuff:

Start by comparing the cost of rent.,
Factor in utility payments.,
Look into the cost of food.,
Think about free amenities.,
Compare the final costs.",How to Choose Between a College Dorm or Apartment1," When you begin to consider your finances, see if there's a major difference in rent costs between an apartment and the dorm. Oftentimes, the cost of rent alone is cheaper off campus. The monthly rent for a dorm may be quite high. If you do not currently have an apartment lined up, you can browse listings online to try and get a general sense of what the price range tends to be in the area.
You should be able to find out how much a dorm costs on your university's website.
Write down a rough range of costs of apartments versus campus housing. For example, monthly dorm rent is $900 per month, while the average rent in an apartment is $550.
Remember, you do not have to pay rent alone. Usually, you will end up having roommates. When figuring out your rent responsibilities, consider if you'll be splitting the rent with a roommate.;
, Rent is only one of many expenses to consider. While rent may be cheaper, you want to make sure you look at all your options. One advantage of dorm life is that many expenses are taken care of. Things like internet, heat, water, and other utilities may be covered in the dorms but not off campus.Do any apartment pay utilities? If not, you will end up having to pay things like a water bill, a heating bill, and an electricity bill. If you know anyone living off campus, ask them about how much they pay for utilities.
You will also have to contact an internet or cable company to set up your internet. See how much internet and cable cost per month through local providers.
Add how much you'll be paying for utilities to your monthly rent. For example, say you'll pay about $80 a month in things like water and gas and $40 a month for internet. Remember, the hypothetical average rent is $550. Now, the cost of living per month is $670 off campus versus $900 on campus.

, Groceries are probably the biggest extra expense when it comes to living off campus. You will no longer have a meal plan provided by your college, so you'll have to prepare your own food.Think about how much you will reasonably spend on groceries. Will you spend about $60 a week? Add this to your running total for off campus expenses. Now, you're looking at around $910 a month.
Keep in mind, you may be able to stay on your campus's meal plan for a fee. If you don't like cooking for yourself, see how much a meal plan costs per month.

, In addition the perk of utilities being covered, does your dorm offer free amenities? For example, maybe your dorm has a gym in the building. Are there any on campus amenities only open to students who live in the dorm?If you don't use a lot of your dorm or university's amenities, this may not be a big deal for you. However, say you go to the gym every day. Losing your gym pass could cause problems.
Check to see how you would go about replacing any amenities you lose. For example, look into gym memberships. Is there anything in your price range? Maybe you find something for $40 a month. Add that to the $910 total of rent and utilities. The cost off campus is now roughly $950.

, If your dorm is hypothetically $900 a month, it's slightly cheaper to live in the dorm in this scenario. However, this may not necessarily be the case given the factors in your area. Remember, cost is only one factor to consider. The impact on your social life and academic responsibility should also be taken into account.

"
"
Think about meeting new people.,
Consider how often you entertain.,
Look at your current social circle.",How to Choose Between a College Dorm or Apartment2," Are you a freshmen or a sophomore? If so, now may not be the best time to move off campus. The dorms provide you with a lot of opportunities for socialization, especially early on in college.


In the dorms, you're living with many different students your age. People may be eager to make new friends. There may be get togethers hosted by your dorm, where you'll have an opportunity to meet fellow students. You will also eat in the cafeteria with other students, allowing you to bond over food.
If you're an older student, however, you may already have an established friends group. If you feel confident you will still see your friends off campus, you probably won't miss out on much by leaving the dorms. If anything, you'll get the chance to experience something new.
Off campus apartments are open to the general public, so you are going to be living with people of all ages. There will be families with children, elderly, people working overnight jobs so you might want to think twice before you have guests over, partying, etc.

, Do you like having get togethers? If you're the type to host things like game nights, movie nights, and other festivities, you may want to consider an off-campus move. Dorm rooms are generally small, and may not leave you enough room to have guests.There are also frequently more restrictions in dorms than apartments. Entertaining may be more relaxing if you're living off campus.

, Older students may already have a large social circle. If you're a junior or a senior, now may be a good time to try off campus living. You have likely met people through the dorms, which has led to other friendship.Many people enjoy living off campus once they feel socially secure. If you feel like you have a solid social circle, off campus life may work for you.
If you're a freshman, you may feel you have a solid social circle. Maybe you have a lot of high school friends attending your school. However, keep in mind college is traditionally seen as a chance to branch out and make new friends. Living off campus may limit your opportunity to meet new people.

Weigh your need for privacy.,
Factor in the freedom of apartment life.,
Consider whether you need a resident adviser.",How to Choose Between a College Dorm or Apartment3," The dorm can be great for making friends and socializing, but there is a real lack of privacy. Sharing small living quarters with a roommate can cause stress. If you're someone who values your alone time, an apartment may be a better option. You may be able to get your own room at an apartment, or at least get more living space.If you have a mental health issue like social anxiety disorder, living in a dorm can be particularly stressful. It may be best to seek out a quiet apartment.
You can also look into a single room in a dorm. While these may be more expensive, it's a good in-between. You are able to get the social experience of living in the dorm while still having your own space.

, If you value personal freedom, an apartment may be better for you. There's a lot more freedom in apartment life.As there are less rooms and people, noise may not carry as easily in an apartment. You will be able to play music and video games, and watch television, without as much fear of disturbing someone. But be careful with even off campus apartments, especially with apartments with young child and/or elderly. Many apartments have ""quiet hours"" to let the residents sleep and there are children/elderly that like to go to bed early, take naps, or simply have peace and quiet.
Dorms often have strict rules. You may, for example, have to sign in overnight visitors You may also have to sign in when coming back to the dorm late. In an apartment, you will not have these restrictions.

, A resident adviser, called resident mentor at some schools, provides support and guidance to students. If you're struggling with something personal or academic, you can always ask your resident mentor for help.If you're prone to stress, you may have a greater need for a resident mentor. You may feel better living somewhere where you have someone to rely on for support.
However, not everyone feels they need a resident mentor. If you prefer managing stress on your own, or seeking support from friends or family members, a resident mentor may not be necessary.
Most dorms do not allow pets but many apartments do allow having pets. If you miss having your pet while in college, you can consider living off campus. Having a pet will be especially helpful if you are living alone off campus when there are not as many peers.

"
"
Be honest about your personal responsibility.,
Think about your access to campus amenities.,
Think about distractions.",How to Choose Between a College Dorm or Apartment4," Students who live in dorms often do better academically. It's easier to stay on task with less distractions. If you're on campus, you may also have easier access to places like the library.Be honest with yourself. Are you a responsible person? Will you be able to get to classes on time if you live off campus? Will you be able to stay on track with your homework with the freedom of off-campus life.
If you're generally the responsible type, living off campus will still be an adjustment. However, if you tend to finish assignments on time and have a solid work ethic, you have a good chance of staying on track off campus.

, If you move off campus, you may be farther away from things like libraries, resource centers, and similar buildings. If it is more difficult to run to the library, for example, you may find you're doing it less often.

. But if you are living off campus, you might have more entertainment and socialization options out in the community that would be harder to access while on campus such as movie theaters, restaurants, shopping, etc. These options may be more expensive but you can sometimes get community discounts if you have a campus ID.

A lot of this will depend on where apartments tend to be located in your area. If you're attending school in a college town, apartments may tend to be close to campus. This would make this less of an issue.
You should also factor in the cost of parking and gas. If you end up needing to drive to certain locations, the costs can add up each month.

, The freedom of an apartment can be great. You can have guests over whenever you want, and are generally able to make more noise. However, this can prove to be a distraction. In the dorm, there may be things like quiet hours. You also will not be able to have a lot of people over at once.If you're the responsible type, you may be able to better cope with distractions. However, it will always be an adjustment. If you decide to live off campus, be prepared to work extra hard to stay on track.
It's okay if you think you cannot handle the responsibility. Many students live on campus for all four years. Remember, the most important thing about college is learning.

Though there are a few that hold open spots for high school students whose academic records improve over time, most will be taking your entire high school career into account. It’s nearly impossible to get into a top college if you tank your GPA in the beginning.Don’t completely write off your chances if you struggled during the first few years of high school. Try to make up the ground in summer school or by taking more core classes (like 2 foreign languages or 2 sciences) during your last few years of high school instead of taking electives.;
, If you’re planning to take calculus as a senior, but you don’t have all of the prerequisites by that time, you won’t be able to take it. Let them know that your goal is to get into a top college so that they can help you figure out which classes to take from the very beginning of your high school career., It’s usually not enough to get straight As in standard classes. If your school offers honors, AP, IB, or dual-enrollment classes, you should take as many as you can reasonably handle.Talk to your parents, teachers, and guidance counselor about how many advanced classes is reasonable for you. You obviously don’t want to take so many that you overwhelm yourself and do poorly in your classes.
The number of advanced classes you take will probably also be related to the number of extracurricular activities you take part in. Remember that colleges are usually interested in well-rounded students who can demonstrate proficiency in a variety of activities. Make time in your schedule for more than school.

, Though the classes themselves look good on your transcript, they key is scoring well on the tests. Start saving early if your parents aren’t going to be able to cover the cost of your exams. Each on costs $92.Though $92 seems pricey, remember that most top colleges offer college credit for high scores on the AP test. Check out the AP Test Credit Policy search website to find out if the schools you’re considering accept AP credit.There’s a chance you can get a fee reduction if you have significant financial need. Talk to the AP Coordinator at your school. (This is probably your guidance counselor, but if it isn’t, they’ll know who you should talk to.)

, Most top colleges want as close to a 4.0 as possible (on an unweighted scale). Get in the habit of studying from the very beginning of high school. Stay after school whenever possible to talk to your teachers if you’re struggling - even if it’s only a little bit. Be proactive about getting As., “Coasting” through your last two years looks terrible on your transcript. Just like you need to start getting good grades in hard classes your freshman year, you also need show that you haven’t slacked off by the end of high school., Though most people submit SATs to top colleges instead of ACTs, admissions experts say that there is no compelling evidence that schools favor one test over the other.Most top colleges have a minimum test score that they deem acceptable for admittees (plural form of admittee), so check out what that score is. This information will be on the website of the school you’re interested in.

, Get an SAT or ACT prep book. There are probably lots available at your local or high school library, but you can also check used book stores. (These big books are pricey if you buy them new!) You can also find digital versions of some. Again, talk to your guidance counselor, because they may have some on hand.Be sure that the books were published within the last couple of years. The SAT and ACT undergo changes pretty regularly.

, Start saving your pocket money! It costs $52.50 to take the SAT and $29 (plus $14 for an optional writing test) to take the ACT. Students almost always improve when they retake these standardized tests.You can take the ACT up to 12 times and the SAT as many times as you want. (But remember that it’s only offered 7 times a year, and you can start taking the SAT during the fall of your junior year.)Take the tests as soon as they are offered so that you will know whether you need to take them again or not.
Most schools allow you to send in your best scores, but a few require that you send them all.
Experts recommend that you not take the SAT more than 6 times if you’re submitting your scores to a school that requires that you send in the results of every test., If you’re not scoring as high as you need to to get into the top college of your choice, see if your school offers a test prep class, and if they don’t, ask your guidance counselor about where to find an SAT or ACT class. There are dozens of online classes, and you can hire local college students to help you, but your guidance counselor will be most equipped to tell you which are the best value., Schools want to admit students who will first contribute a lot to their college community and then go on to achieve big things in the wider world. It’s hard to tell which teenage applicant will go on to win a Nobel Prize, so colleges use the application process to try to predict who has the most potential. One way that they do so is by looking at what you contributed to activities beyond academics., A well-rounded student gets good grades but also joins a few extracurricular activities. That doesn’t mean you should join every single club or activity your school offers, because you will never have enough time to commit to every single one. Instead, pick a few that you really enjoy and work hard in those few.


Winning awards and earning leadership positions is another great way to round out your application, and you won’t have time to put effort into that if you overcommit.

, In order to demonstrate that you are dedicated, try to stick with the sport of your choice for a few years at least. Even if you’re not the star athlete, playing on the tennis team or the basketball team still shows that you’re a team player. Don’t overlook dance or cheerleading teams if throwing a ball around isn’t your thing. , Work at a homeless shelter, go on a mission trip with your church, spend a few Saturdays with Habitat for humanities, sort clothes at a donation center, join the Scouts, coach a youth sports team, walk dogs at your local shelter, collect cans for a food drive, participate in a bake sale, or read to kids at your local library. Top colleges want students who will foster change in their schools and communities.Try to the initiative to raise money or collect donations for a cause. Being able to say, “I organized a book drive and collected over 2000 books for under-resourced schools” or “I started a walk-a-thon and raised over $5000 for cancer research” is a very tangible, concrete piece of data to put on an application. It shows initiative and demonstrates that you care about your community.

, Look beyond athletics. Join the drama club, the choir, or the debate team. Pick your favorite subject and join a club devoted to pursuing that subject further. Find a chess club, a gay-straight alliance, or a Future Farmers of America group. Enter academic competitions or join academic teams like Mathletes or Odyssey of the Mind.Better yet, start a club of your own. This shows a great deal of leadership potential and the ability to organize others. It also shows that you can work well with adults, because you will probably have to coordinate with a faculty sponsor and the principal., Studies have shown that students with part-time jobs have higher GPAs on average because they are forced to manage their time more carefully. Plus, real-world experiences look great on your application. Holding down a part-time job while still getting good grades is evidence that you know how to balance your time., Run for student council or just take on leadership positions in the organizations you’re already part of. Top colleges are interested in shaping future leaders, and they care about your interest and ability to organize others., Though even a stellar essay won’t get you into a top college if you’re not already qualified, it can make you stand out from the pack and be accepted if you’re already qualified. Try to start working on it (at least brainstorming) the summer before your senior year so that you’re not stuck doing it at the last minute when you’re overwhelmed with school-related activities., Your first idea is probably not going to be the one that you stick with. Start a brainstorming list, outline, concept map, or whatever works for you as soon as you read the prompt. Sleep on it and return to it every day for a few days until you decide what your prompt will be. Consider:


What people, dilemmas, animals, books, places, trips, or experiences have had an impact on your life? Can you think of a time when someone or something challenged your thinking? A time when you struggled? A time when you triumphed? It’s okay if you pick a topic that seems quite basic -- as long as you care about it and can write passionately about it.What are your major accomplishments? What events led up to these accomplishments, and what makes you feel proud about them? (Think beyond school-related accomplishments. Surviving your parents’ divorce or the death of your dog might be an accomplishment that you’re proud of in hindsight, so if you can write about why that was important to you, go for it.)When you think of the topic, be sure that you also brainstorm about its effect on your life. For example, anyone can write about working for Habitat for Humanity. What will be interesting and compelling is the story of what working for Habitat meant to you or how it changed your views on the world.

, Focus on the prompt. You must respond to the question you’re given, so even if your brainstorming led to some great ideas, make sure the one you choose is appropriate for the question. Chances are good that you will be writing quite of few of these essays. Don’t reuse another old essay unless the prompt is almost exactly the same.Spend the most time on your introduction. If it’s not compelling, admissions officers will not move past it. Try to create a bit of intrigue in this paragraph. Make your readers want to find out what comes next.
Be sure that all of your body paragraphs relate back to the intro and fulfil its promises by giving more information about the topic you introduced there.
Remember that the conclusion is your last chance to impress. Avoid phrases like “in conclusion” or “in summary.” Your essay is probably fewer than 500 words, so you don’t have time to summarize. Instead, link back to your intro paragraph by reiterating a word or phrase used there. Alternatively, briefly discuss the implications of your topic in a larger context.Distinguish yourself from others. This is the number one piece of advice from college admissions officers, and it may be the hardest for high school seniors to accomplish.The key is to show and not tell. For example, don’t simply write that you are a kind and caring person, show the reader that you are kind and caring by telling a story of a time that you exemplified those traits., Don’t write about how much you love softball if almost all of your application is about your four years on the team, your time as captain, and your all-district medals. Don’t mention your GPA or standardized test scores., Yes, you should have an adult edit the essay for you, but don’t let them change the language so dramatically that it no longer sounds like you. This is absolutely not the time to dig out the thesaurus. It will be very clear to admissions staff if you are using words and phrases that you don’t quite understand., Don’t fall into the trap of trying so hard to stand out that you use lots of slang or colloquialisms. Don’t do anything gimmicky like writing the whole essay as a sonnet. It’s okay to share your opinions, but avoid anything super controversial. More than one person will read your essay, and there is no way of knowing who that person will be, so you must appeal to a wide audience., Yes, a dozen. Have your parents, your grandparents, your teachers, your friends, your counselors - anyone who is willing - read it and check for errors. You will immediately lose credibility if you have typos, spelling errors, or grammatical mishaps. "

Show up to class on time.,
Go to class regularly.,
Ask the professor thoughtful questions.,
Participate in class discussions.,
Complete your assignments for the class.",How to Befriend a Professor2," Professors often pay attention to students who sit at the front of the class. Sit up front so the professor knows you are there to learn and pay attention to what they have to say. Make a point of sitting in the front row each class, with your pen and notebook ready.Sitting in the front row will also allow you to ask the professor questions and hear what the professor has to say clearly and easily.

, Showing up on time will show the professor that you are eager to learn and want to be a good student. It will also make it clear that you care about the class and want to be present for it.If possible, try to get to the class a little early so you can get a front row seat.

, Be an active participant in the class by asking the professor questions that are thoughtful and engaging. Asking thoughtful questions will demonstrate to the professor that you are paying attention and interested in the class.For example, you may ask a clarifying question during a professor’s lectures like, “Professor, would you mind explaining the main concept in a bit more detail?”
You can also ask thought-provoking questions like, “Professor, why does the author describe female characters differently than male characters in the text?”

, Encourage your classmates to participate in class discussions by asking them thoughtful questions. Pose thoughtful questions to the room. Make interesting remarks to keep the discussion going. This will show the professor that you are a good class leader and interact well with your peers.For example, you may ask the class, “Did anyone else find the passage confusing?” or you may say, “I’d love to know what others thought of the solution to the problem.”

, Another way you can get on your professor’s good side is to complete your assignments for the class to the best of your abilities. Hand in your assignments on time. Follow the professor’s requirements for the assignments to the letter. This will show them that you are a dedicated student worth befriending.If you have questions about the assignments, communicate with the professor. Doing this will help you to build rapport with the professor and show them you care about doing well in the class.

Attend campus events promoted by the professor.,
Respect the professor-student relationship.",How to Befriend a Professor3," Let the professor know that you are open to earning extra credit for the class, especially if you have missed a class or are trying to make up an assignment you missed. Talk to them about extra assignments you can do for credit. Ask them if there are events you can attend that would count as extra credit. This will show them you are committed to doing well in their class., If the professor mentions an event on campus that they are hosting or are involved with, make an effort to attend. Sign up for any initiatives put on by the professor. Participate in campus events the professor is a part of to show them you want to be supportive., While you may want to be friendly with your professor, do not overstep their boundaries. Respect their time and space as your professor. Do not try to contact them outside of class using their phone number or private email. Maintain a professional demeanor with the professor so they respect you as their student.Being respectful of the professor-student relationship does not mean you cannot be friendly or chatty with the professor. It just means you should be aware of the boundaries of the relationship and abide by them.

Find support.",How to Be a Sorority Mother," Most universities or sorority houses will prefer that you have a bachelor's degree, or at the very least, the professional experience equivalent of a bachelor's degree. To be a sorority mother, you'll need to have more experience than the girls your supervising, which is why most schools require that you be finished with your bachelor's degree first.Usually, it doesn't matter what degree you have, as long as you have one.
However, a degree in management or psychology would be good choices.;
, Most sorority houses will not hire a guy to be the house director because they feel like a woman can relate to the girls better. In addition, it may make it easier to be a single woman, as you will be living in the house with the girls, and most places frown on having a live-in spouse., To be a sorority mom, you will need to manage the house, deal with any staff, provide support for the girls, and help manage the meals. That means you need to know how to manage staff, counsel people, provide guidance, and have plans in place for emergencies.Beyond planning meals, you may also be responsible for buying food and sticking to a household budget.
You may also be responsible for household inventories each year.You may also need to know how to do basic maintenance on the house.

, Part of running a sorority house is working with staff and managing them, much like you would at a small motel. You not only manage staff, you also help plan events and make sure the house has the appropriate food and menus. Therefore, having experience in these areas can help you get a job in this field, as well as do a good job.For instance, having experience in restaurant management or event planning can be useful.
If you've never worked in these fields, consider taking a training course at your local community college.

, To perform this job, you need to have basic computer skills, such as being able to work with Microsoft Office and QuickBooks, as well as be able to manage an email account and browse the Internet. If you don't have these skills, most libraries offer classes to anyone who needs them for free., Sometimes being a sorority mother puts you in a difficult position because you are between the sorority's board and the current members. In other words, you need to learn how to deal with difficult situations in a tactful manner, which can be difficult when you're in the middle.One way to learn diplomacy is to take a class in counseling, as the skills you learn there will help you when you find yourself in a hard situation.
Learn the basics of diplomacy. For instance, if you are diplomatic, you'll look at facts rather than feelings, be honest but gentle,avoid spreading gossip or negative ideas, and get to know people so you aren't quick to make a snap judgment., When living in a sorority, the girls are going to come to you with problems. You need to be able to advise them or at least help them find a solution for themselves. Knowing some basic counseling skills can help you help them. Consider taking a class in counseling to improve your skills.

, While it helps to have worked with college-age students before, it's essential to enjoy working with this age group. You'll not only be working with people of this age, you'll be living with them, and they will look up to you as a mentor.To mentor young adults, you need to be mature enough to rise above their problems. You need to be able to listen to what they're going through without getting sucked into their drama.
If you're not sure if you would like this age group, consider taking a class at a local community college as a way of interacting with them.

, Many times, you'll find listing for this job on university websites. The positions may be listed with the regular university jobs, but sometimes, they are listed on the pages about Greek life in addition to or in place of the main job listings.You can also use websites dedicated to sorority moms to find jobs or post resumes, such as this one: http://www.sororitymom.com/jobs/.
Look for jobs on the national websites for the sororities, as well as national job search sites.

, You will need to send in a cover letter and a resume and have a background check. You may also need to fill out an application. In some cases, you will send it to one organization on campus that will pass the information along, while in other cases, you'll send it directly to the sorority's board. The job listing should tell you what to do.On your resume, make sure to point out any positions you held in the past where you showed leadership or management skills or worked with young adults.

, Most boards are looking for someone who's smart and capable but who also has the enthusiasm to work with young adults. It will probably help if you were in a sorority in college, but that's not an absolute requirement.


In other words, it's important to show enthusiasm when talking about working with college students. Smile and show with your tone of voice that you are looking forward to it, in addition to what you're saying.

, Know what your living arrangement is ahead of time. You will likely have a small apartment to yourself, which may or may not have a kitchen. In addition, you may be required to work all year, while in other places, you may only work 9 to 10 months out of the year. You may need to find a different place to live in the summer, for instance., Often, you'll have more trouble with the the board than the students. The students may come to you with problems and issues, but the board will be the one telling you how they expect things to be run. That may not be true for every chapter, but it can make life more difficult for you at times.It can be good to sit down with both the board and the students (at separate times) to learn how things should be run and what's expected of you. You may run into a lot of unspoken rules that you'll need to learn to follow.

, As a sorority mom, you will need to know a lot of rules, from university policyto house and sorority rules. You'll also need to know about the plans you need to set in motion in case of an emergency. Spend some time reading up on all these policies when you first enter the position., While you need to be there for the girls, that doesn't mean you need to be on call 24 hours a day for every little thing. For instance, you can set sleep hours where the girls must leave you alone unless it is an emergency. Also, though you need to accommodate food allergies and religious preferences, you may need to make it clear that you won't cater to every picky person., When doing this job, you'll likely move to a new community, and you'll be living on a campus. You'll need the support of other people, if just to vent once and awhile. You might try befriending other house moms on campus or even professors who understand how rewarding and challenging it can be at times."

Remember that while looking good is important, it can never be the most important thing in your life or the only good or notorious thing about you.,
Take a couple hours to devise a routine with your new beauty goals incorporated in it so it becomes a part of your lifestyle.,
Start with your hair.,
Consider skin care.,
Get your brows professionally done, even if only once.,
Pay attention to your facial features.,
Keep your nails clean and trimmed and moisturize every night.,
Try to figure out your own style.",How to Be Pretty and Smart As a College Girl2," Take beauty lightheartedly, aiming for simplicity and health.;
, When done right, it shouldn't take more than half an hour each morning and night.

, If you feel your hair looks drab, research your face shape and a haircut that would bring out your best features (ask your stylist for help). Generally you should aim for hair that is clean, shiny and healthy. You can achieve this by washing as needed and conditioning as often as necessary for your hair type. Also, embrace your natural texture and heat-style as little as you can. There are plenty of wikiHow articles that can help you with that.

, If you drink plenty of water, get plenty of rest and eat healthy, your beautiful skin will shine through. If it still needs some help, get products for your specific problem. A cleanser, toner and moisturizer should solve most of it. A scrub made with sugar drenched in olive oil should wash away blackheads and acne after some uses.

, You can then keep up the brow grooming yourself with tweezers. Keep lashes lush by applying petroleum jelly every night. If you feel strongly about your eye shape, try simple makeup tricks to make yourself look better like a little liner or producing optical illusions with highlighter.

, You can improve the looks of nearly anything with clever makeup tricks like wearing darker blush under the cheekbones to make them more pronounced. Be careful when choosing products for facial use such as foundation or blush, ask for help from professionals (but forgo as many products as you can). Also seek help of you are unsure on how to apply makeup. Nothing looks worse than poorly applied makeup, no matter how bad do you think you'll look without it.

, Then embellish however you like with nail polish or nail art. A weekly manicure done at home is highly recommended, even if you don't paint your nails, just trim and file.

, First and foremost clean out your closet and research what would make your best features stand out, and dress for your body shape. Then write down a couple outfits to wear when you don't have the time or patience to make a nice outfit. Or better, spend about one hour per season writing down many outfits and you're practically set! Make variations of each outfit like: jeans + colored flats + white top + bright cardigan or something like sweater dress + bright tights + black boots. Then accessorize as you like!

, See where your strengths and weaknesses are. Talk to teachers about what you should do to improve. Study weekly. Guide yourself with previous exams. Make flashcards. Try your hardest, for real, and you'll make it.

, Cute school supplies help you want to study. Nice pens and pretty notebooks will pay off if they encourage you to work harder. Also, more special rewards for extra hard goals are in order. Something like a night out or a new accessory.

, Choose things that interest you and educate yourself. Things like a foreign language or history of art can be self taught if you're passionate enough. If you are lacking in discipline, try signing up for a class

, Don't forget to make time for sports and other non-academic activities like going out or gardening or whatever you like. Try hard to make time to just do nothing and you'll feel much better.

Focus on your studies.,
Join student groups.,
Build up your resume.,
Feel free to date casually.",How to Be Single in College1," Focus on the reason why you came to college: getting a degree. Spend extra time going to tutoring, office hours, and review sessions. Use all of the academic resources you have, such as the library and the writing center. Make sure you understand what’s going on in all of your classes and are getting the most out of the classes you’re taking.


If you’re struggling in a class, ask your TA or professor what kinds of resources you can use.
Make sure to do all of the reading for your classes! Even if it seems like a lot, it will pay off in the end.
When you get an assessment back, be sure to look not just at the grade but also at the comments written on it and the specific places where you made mistakes.;
, A great way to meet people, build on your skills, and do something for a cause you love is to join a student group. Whether you want to do intramural soccer or write for a literary magazine, student groups can be really fun and rewarding. Many of them let in everyone who wants to join, but they also have leadership positions available for people who show commitment and responsibility. Here are some kinds of student groups you can look into joining:


Political groups
Club or intramural sports teams
Women’s groups
LGTBQIA+ groups
Community service groups
Fraternities and sororities

, College is a great time to build up your resume so that you’re prepared when it’s time to look for a job. In particular, building different experiences will strengthen your resume. Here are some activities you can do at college that will strengthen your resume:Leadership of any sort
Sports teams
Student groups
Student government
Volunteer activities
Part-time jobs
Research assistant jobs
Entrepreneurial endeavors

, College is a great time to meet a lot of new, interesting people. Just because you don't want to commit yourself to a relationship doesn't mean that you should stop yourself from dating entirely. You can meet potential dates at parties, dances, in classes, or at the campus coffee shop. Whether you ask someone out or they ask you out, feel free to date casually.


However, you should be clear from the beginning that you don't want a relationship. You can say something like, ""I've been having a great time with you, but I'm really not looking for a relationship right now."" You could also say, ""I'm happy to go on a date with you, but I just want to be honest about the fact that I am not interested in a relationship.""
Fun places for casual dates include coffee dates, lunch dates, mini golf, and parties or dances. Someone you're casually dating can also hang out with you and your friends. No matter what, though, be clear that you are not looking for a relationship.

Book a campus tour.,
Download a map of the college or university.,
Explore the campus.,
Write down key buildings and regular path.,
Retrace your steps.,
Ask for directions.",How to Avoid Getting Lost on a College Campus1," Contact the college admissions office and request a date and time to tour the campus.If you have already had a campus tour, perhaps before deciding to enroll, there’s no harm in doing another. This tour would be more helpful in really getting to know the area and asking more specific questions of the staff, such as the best routes to take from the dorms or how long it takes to get to the cafeteria from the library.;
, Once you’ve got the basics down from a formal campus tour, get a campus map. You can request one from the admissions office or download one from your school’s main website. On the college’s homepage, locate the search bar; it’s usually at the top of the page. Inside the search bar, type the word “map.” The search result should pull up a link to the campus map., When you have a free day, preferably before classes start, walk around campus and get to know the buildings and landmarks. Take a separate notebook to make notes of where all the main buildings are, such as the library, student common area, gym and cafeteria. These places will generally have a map of the campus located inside that can assist you in finding your way in the event you get lost.

, When you have your class schedule, take time to find each class and find the best path to get to and from each one. Note how long each route will take so you know how to prepare for each day.


Campus maps are generally easy to read and navigate. They will display a guide on what symbols stand for, such as buildings and paths, and generally provide pictures.For colleges or universities that have multiple campuses, search for the specific campus and then search for “map” in the search box. For example, Florida International University has two main campuses: The Modesto Maidique Campus and The Biscayne Bay Campus. A quick google search can provide the main page for each campus and there a quick search for the campus map should display exactly what you need.

, Practice makes perfect. After you have done your initial exploration and walk around notating key buildings and landmarks, retrace your steps back to your original spot, such as your dorm or from the parking lot. This will help with committing the buildings and paths to memory as well as fill in any gaps or holes you may have had on the initial journey.

, In the event you get lost, (hey, maps can be tricky), ask someone for directions. Most people on a college campus are friendly and always willing to point you in the right direction if you ask for assistance.

Don't put on a front.,
Be kind.,
Be friendly.,
Have a good sense of humor.,
Dress in stylish clothes.,
You don't have to party.,
Don't join too many clubs.,
Show your dorky side too.,
Get good grades.,
Don't be addicted to Facebook and other social networking and dating sites such as Myspace.,
You do not need a girlfriend/boyfriend or to have sex to be cool.,
Don't be afraid to express yourself.,
Have an open mind.,
Remember what you are actually there for.,
If all else fails, take online classes.",How to Be Cool in College," People can tell you are a fake right away. You have to be the real deal so be who you are and be proud of who you are. Think about how cool some of the things about you are. Most people have outgrown their high school persona by the time they are in college. If you haven't, there is a lot of growing up you need to do. College is a time to learn more about yourself and by the time you get your major established, be proud of what you are going into because that might be your adult identity and career.;
, Open doors to people, offer some help carrying books, offer some help with homework, help a person find their way around the college. Niceness is what does it.

, Try to make small talk with everyone. Make it an effort to talk to someone or help someone that you don't normally do each day. Don't be a stick in a mud. Try to talk about stuff such as weather, sports, classes, college life, travel, hobbies, plans for the weekend or vacation, movies, music, and favorite TV shows. Keep up to date with the latest celebrity gossip, news, and sports so you always have something to talk about. The weather does get very boring.

, Don't tell dumb cliché jokes. Be witty. Look up funny stuff on the Internet or watch funny TV shows or movies to get ideas.

, You don't have to be Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian to look cool, or you don't have to dress like you have just come out of bed, since some college students do. I have seen some come to school in pajamas. For guys, a nice button down shirt, t-shirt, polo, or sweatshirt with jeans or shorts will do the trick. Hoodies are great too. For girls, a cute top with a nice looking hairstyle, modest makeup, and the like will do it as well. Try to dress according to your climate and your location as well. Many college students once they have declared their major start to dress similar to the way they will be at work, e.g. business casual for business majors, more artsy clothing for art majors, especially when doing internships, etc. Many will be wearing work clothes in college especially if they have a job after classes. Some majors will require you to wear a uniform such as scrubs for nursing or dental majors, cop outfits for law enforcement, etc. There are girls that are wearing dresses and skirts to school lately, so if you have a nice attractive looking dress, don't be afraid to wear it.

, Going to parties all the time is for amateurs. Drinking is a sign that you're not confident and you need to chug alcohol to make you confident. Really cool people do not need that booster. Go to a good party once in a while (probably a relative's wedding dance) but don't make it a lifestyle. Unless that's your thing, then do your thing.

, Joining too many clubs are a sign that you are desperate and you just want to fit in too much. Only join clubs and activities that you are honestly interested in or related to your major. Don't join a nursing club if you are not considering nursing.

, College is the place where it all comes out. Don't be afraid to do something you'll regret doing since it is ""not cool"". Who is determining the standards of what is cool anyway. Everyone has a different perception of what cool is, and there are many other things that determine cool such as where you live. You are trying to hard. Relax. Who cares if you like Justin Bieber or watch Tom and Jerry in your dorm or even listen to Lawrence Welk. If you like Justin Beiber, don't be afraid to blast it out of your loudspeakers. College students these days like to be ""ironic"" anyway.

, The grades are not a nerd thing. Grades give you something that is cool: A job that will give you the money to buy cool cars, houses, etc.

, Facebooking too much wastes time and most of it is probably playing some dumb game. When you are on the Internet, stick to more listening to music, looking up funny jokes and pictures, watching YouTube, and if everything else fails, study.

, Sometimes having a girlfriend/boyfriend in college can take you away from the other cool stuff you can be doing or the main purpose of your career in college, to get an education for your future career. But if you find someone you like, don't afraid to make the first move. Remember there is a lot of drama involved as well.

, Don't be afraid to stand up what you believe in and to do what is right, even though it may be popular. Everyone has different opinions about stuff so be sure to respect other peoples differences and treat everyone the same. If you don't believe in having sex or partying, even though it is ""cool"", or voting for some political candidate that is not cool, do it anyway.

, College is a place where you'll be exposed to totally different cultures, races, nationalities, religions, political views, lifestyles, and ages, so don't be afraid to to think outside of the box and try something new. College is a place for identity formation so be open.

, In college is where your grades count; your GPA pretty much determines your paycheck so if you want bucks in the future, you should actually crack a book and study. You can still have a social life but the primary reason for college is to get that degree so you can eventually get a job. Go to class too; why are you paying for it?

, You can ""go to school"" in the comfort of your home, where you don't have to worry about fitting in.

Say “yes” more.,
Try new things.,
Pursue interests outside of school.,
Work out.,
Find a cause you care about.",How to Be Single in College2," When you’re not in a relationship, you probably have room in your life to say “yes” to more. Whether it’s a spontaneous trip to a concert on a Friday night, taking a spring break trip, or studying abroad for a semester, being single means that you have the freedom to do anything without worrying about affecting your significant other. Embrace your freedom and take risks on new experiences.If you feel like you haven’t had the opportunity to say “yes” in a while, here are some suggestions:


Go away for the weekend.
Find a concert near you and go, no matter what the band is.
Grab a friend and find somewhere to sleep outside.

, College is a great time to try new things, both in an academic and social sense. In college, you have so many opportunities to try new things and have new experiences. Whether it’s taking a class outside your academic field or trying to learn a new sport, you should take the opportunity to try a lot of new things. When you’re single, you have more time to explore. Here are just a few things you could try:


Learn a new instrument
Take a class you never thought you would take (astronomy, basket weaving, ceramics -- the options are endless!)
Try out for a dance or a capella group

, Being in a relationship takes up a lot of time. When you’re single, though, you might find yourself with some time to spare. What do you look forward to when your problem sets are done, your friends are busy, and you have some alone time? Think about skills you want to develop or things you’ve always wanted to learn. Now is the time! Here are some suggestions to get you started; you could learn to:


Play the piano
Identify constellations
Rock climb
Tutor underserved students

, Exercise is beneficial for your mental, emotional, and physical health. Hit the gym five days a week: twice for cardio, three times for strength training. Don’t forget to incorporate two rest days into your routine.Here are some different ways that you can exercise:


Take a spinning class.
Rock climb.
Lift weights with a friend. Many schools offer weight lifting classes, too.
Swim laps.
Go for a hike with a friend.
Take a “boot camp” style class.

, College is a great time to explore potential ways you want to spend your professional career. Many people find one of their passions in college and pursue it after they graduate. Whether you're interested in hedge funds or public service, there are many opportunities you can pursue in college. Here are some ways that you can get involved with potential career paths or causes:


Volunteer at an animal shelter
Intern at a company near your school
Tutor underserved students
Volunteer in a community garden
Protest a political issue
Intern with a government official
Write for the school newspaper or magazine

"
"
Spend time with your friends.,
Call your parents.,
Talk to professors.",How to Be Single in College3," Single people more frequently have closer ties with friends, have more friends, and are better friends to others. This phenomenon occurs because single people have more time to spend with their friends.Take advantage of your single lifestyle to hang out with your friends, make new friends, and forge better relationships with friends both new and old.


Instead of going to parties with your significant other, you can go with your group of friends. You don’t have to worry about keeping track of your date or making awkward small talk.
Designate at least one night a week where you and your friends spend quality time with each other. Whether it’s a movie night or watching a sports game, make time to hang out with your friends.

, Sometimes it’s easy to forget about your parents and other family members when you’re away at college, but they will certainly appreciate it if you give them a call or even send a text. Try to call your parents at least once a week to update them on your life and your studies. Calling family is also a good way to combat the loneliness that a lot of people feel while they are away at college.


If you keep forgetting to call your parents, set a regular time when you call them. Set an alarm on your phone, or ask them to call you at that time.

, Professors have office hours where you can go talk to them about the material from the class, but many of them are also happy to talk to you about academics and life and general. You can only forge relationships with professors in college, so you should take advantage of this opportunity. Look at a schedule to see when your professors’ office hours are, or you can email them to ask to meet individually.

Research the college’s parking rules.,
Research the college's inter-transportation system.,
Research the public transportation system.",How to Avoid Getting Lost on a College Campus2," If you plan on driving to the school, find out how parking works. Some colleges have designated parking lots for students and visitors, while others have limited or no parking for students. If parking is limited to students, find out the best way to better your chances at receiving it.


Find out where you can obtain a parking pass if one is required. If your school allows parking on campus, most will charge a fee so find out how much parking costs. Most times, this fee will come directly out of your tuition costs.

, Some schools have their very own transportation for students to get around either throughout campus, or from campus to campus, if they have multiple campuses that are located far from each other. Schools may have a system of buses, cars, or golf carts. While taking the campus tour, you could also inquire on the different means of how students get around the campus.

, If you plan on taking public transportation to and from school, find out the appropriate bus (or train) route that will get you to school in the fastest and most efficient way.

"
"
Find the student center.,
Find the bookstore.,
Find the campus library.",How to Avoid Getting Lost on a College Campus3," Locate the main student center where lots of important information and resources can be found. Here, there is usually a help desk to assist students and visitors find the area they are looking for, or to provide other usual information. They may also provide you with a campus map.

, Locate the bookstore on the campus. The bookstore is a hub of resources available to students, especially first timers. Here, you are able to download a schedule of your classes, purchase all your required books and any school supplies you may need.


Some campuses, depending on its size, have multiple bookstores. Locate the nearest one to you, such as the one closest to your residence hall or the parking lot that you park in to get to class.
Prepare your schedule. Once you have all your classes, keep a calendar to help keep track of all the times and locations of them for each day. You can do a regular calendar (manual input) or keep one on your computer.
If you need help deciding on a calendar, try Google Calendar. With Google Calendar, you can input your classes just once and it allows you to select a repeat option so you don’t have to manually complete the calendar for the entire semester. You have the option of inputting the class start time, class location, and any other useful notes that you need. You can also synch the calendar with your phone to send you notifications of when class will begin., The library will be your home away from home. It has the benefit of providing you with a quiet and studious atmosphere while you study for classes and exams. Most libraries also have a little café shop where you can purchase coffee, snacks, or other energy snacks to keep you focused and awake as you study.

"
"
Talk to your Resident Assistant.,
Make a friend.,
Introduce yourself to the professor.",How to Avoid Getting Lost on a College Campus4," If you are living in student housing, your designated Resident Assistant is a great resource. The RA is an upperclassman and has been on the campus for at least one semester longer than you. Find your RA and ask them the best route to get to your class or any other building on the campus.

, Start befriending other students you see in your dorm and class. By making friends, you have less of a chance of getting lost because you’ll most likely be heading to the same place. This is also advantageous because if you do get lost, you won't be by yourself.

, If you know beforehand who your professors will be, send them an email introducing yourself. This will make for a good impression with the professor and in the event you get lost and end up late to class on the first day, they will be much more understanding.

The current GRE has a verbal, math, and essay section. Most humanities departments, religion included, will be more interested in the verbal/writing scores.Get a practice test and take them to improve your score on the actual test.
The scoring scheme for this test changes from time to time.
Check your prospective program's guides for average accepted scores.
Scores older than ten years will usually not be accepted by your program.
Select the school(s) you are applying to for submission of your scores during the live test.;
, The humanities and/or social sciences can cover many subjects. Consider getting your earlier degrees in topics related to religion.Examine your prospective Master's program's degree offerings for a religion or philosophy department.
Contact the Master's program's professor(s) for recommendations of their program as a starting point for an academic career in theological studies. Otherwise, they may be able to direct you elsewhere.
Look into the similar fields of history, literature, and anthropology for programs and classes that will benefit your studies.

, If you're already in a master's program for theological studies, you might ask about staying at your school for the doctorate. You may be able to combine your master degree achievements into the doctorate.


Make sure you make any decisions on the ""fast track"" by your program's deadline.
Get an accurate list of the requirements of the doctorate program. Look for increased credit hours, dissertation requirements (the final written research composition you will produce), and course options.Even without a ""fast track"" option, you may stay in your current school for the Ph.D. However, this may require a fresh application.

, Most humanities doctoral programs in the United States, theology included, require a minimum of reading knowledge of one foreign language. If your thesis or dissertation involve international research--you will probably need to learn another language beyond that.


Check your prospective program's course lists for what languages are regularly offered.
Get a schedule of when the official knowledge reading exams or equivalent tests are given each semester.
Ask your prospective program about their rules for passage of the language credit. Find out if a class and/or exam are needed to pass the credit.

, The thesis is the major research writing project at the end of a master's degree. These projects, in the humanities, are primary source based works with you as interpreter of the evidence.


Select a topic that adds to or fills a gap in the existing field. Don't ""reinvent the wheel,"" and write about what's already been done. Find something new or find a different angle within a well known topic.
Save your research. The books (secondary sources), manuscripts, interviews, and archives you visit may help you again in your doctoral work.

, Peruse your prospective schools' departments to see if they have a theology department or similar--religion or philosophy.Read the faculty lists of the programs you are most interested in and narrow them down to the professors that cover the subfields of theology you want to study. , They will be directing your program of study and dissertation.


Introduce yourself and your ideas for the theological project you would like to work on with this faculty member.
Discuss the work you've already done--especially your master's program work. Engage the faculty member on theological ideas and see if you can form a good professional bond.

, Physically going to your top program choices may help make your decision about where to spend the next few years it may take to get your degree.Schedule time to meet with the professor(s) you may work with. See if you can at least with your potential major advisor to go over likely dissertation subjects, courses, and program expectations.
Visit the department you would study with. Find out what work the other religion, philosophy, and theology professors and grad students are doing.
Ask about religious organizations that work with the department or university that could contribute to your topic. Get their contact information., Universities vary on requirements, but beyond personal information, you will need letters of recommendation that include some from your master's program faculty--especially your thesis advisor.Submit transcripts from your undergraduate and master's program. Make sure they arrived at your prospective doctoral school by it's application deadline.
Send writing samples. Most doctorate programs require a writing sample. This can sometimes be a research paper or a thesis chapter. You may also need to provide an additional original essay. Read your program's application requirements carefully.

, Consider applying to at least half a dozen schools, if not more. These departments can vary considerably in size and funding, how much competition you will be facing can be unpredictable.

, The names of the major field may differ by school, but some examples include: Ancient Religious History, Ethnography, Iconography, Ethics and Philosophy, and Philosophical Theology.


Most universities require a major field to be taken along with several minor fields to improve a graduate's academic credentials.
Pick a committee. These professors will lead your minor fields and consult for your comprehensive exams in addition to your major advisor. They may or may not also serve on your dissertation committee.
Meet with your department's academic advisor and your major professor frequently to make sure you're satisfying the required credits for your major and minor fields.

, In most doctorate of theology programs, a minimum of 2 years or 30 credit hours of full-time course work is required for the degree beyond the master's degree.


Pick classes that also help your dissertation along with the research and papers that you will complete for them.

, Graduate programs generally fund their students through assistantships--frequently grading or some other form of part-time assistance to professors and the department during the semester.


Instruct a class if you get the opportunity. This is both practice for real teaching positions, and a highlight for your job applications.

, Most colleges, universities and seminaries require students to pass a written and/or oral comprehensive exam to become a Ph.D. candidate. At this point, all coursework is complete and only the dissertation stands between you and the degree.


This test will cover the major/minor concentration fields.
Get questions and/or prepare with your committee members well ahead of time.

, Your status at this point sometimes is called ""ABD"" (all but dissertation).

, Meet often with your major advisor about your work. It is best if you can continue on a topic your master's thesis related to, but either way you will be doing a substantial amount of additional research and writing.Outline your ideas, theological problems, religious theories, sources, philosophical arguments, methodology, and working bibliography.

, Outline the dissertation chapter headings, subtopics, and working bibliography.

, There are numerous research and writing funding opportunities for humanities scholars and graduate students. Look into your program's and college's listings as well as any academic societies you may belong to.


Check your funding opportunities so they match the right stage of your work ""pre-dissertation"" while you're researching and others while you're in the writing phase near completion.

, This will be mostly primary source based work supported with secondary sources. Use the work for your master's degree if applicable.


Request archivists for help in locating more information on your subject. They can find items than you might not be finding in catalogs.
Present at conferences to get early feedback on research and writing you do. You can do this even if your writing is not in its final form. You can exchange research and theological concepts you had not considered.

, Keeping a steady writing schedule can be extremely difficult, especially as one is likely to have other life distractions.


Try to write just a little daily, maybe a couple of hours. Otherwise, set aside blocks of time you know you won't be disturbed on particular days of the week.
Share parts of what you write to your major advisor, academic mentors, and/or graduate students at a similar level of progress. For graduate students, this can be mutually motivating.

, Upon completion of the dissertation manuscript, each student meets with a dissertation committee--usually the major advisor, a specified number from your department, and one ""out of area"" faculty member. If the committee approves the dissertation and defense, the degree will be awarded.

, For a weekly study group more than 6 people is unlikely to be very efficient (and hard to schedule!). In exams times a larger group can work well as a one-off.

, Look for a place with the least amount of distractions. The school library is a good starting point so long as other people don't interrupt. However they may operate a silence policy. Look for the group-study area, a cafe or book a classroom.

, Ideally start by keeping up with the course reviewing each class weekly. Consulting an old study guide from a past exam can also be useful. It may be easier to split up the varying material amongst group members that have particular specialties, i.e. splitting up chapters or take turns weekly.

, There's a variety of different resources such as Course Hero that facilitate the exchange of study resources both old and new. Many courses will also have facebook groups and if yours don't you can always create one.

,, Having the ability to talk about a given subject and speak knowledgeably about it will improve your memory come test time.

, Make mock test questions that may be on the test or quiz. Try to keep each other sharp and informed about what you read.

Relax.",How to Develop Good Study Habits for College," Skim through the textbooks. Try to buy your textbooks a few weeks before the semester begins for a glimpse of your classes.

,, Why are you buying the textbook for it to collect dust? They have textbooks and lab manuals for a purpose. You will be graded mostly on the book because this is mainly the bulk of the class. Professors are usually here to interpret and clarify the text, and sometimes give their opinion; you are to learn most of the material yourself.

, Highlight the parts emphasized, and listen to the way your professor relates it to what you've already learned. Remember that the professor may be biased so if you tend to not agree with the professor, just stick to the facts.

,, For each lecture hour you should expect at least 1-3 hours needed for study- more if it's a challenging class. Studying could involve reading the book, checking out your notes, assignments, using the DVD with the book, browsing the web for information on your class, etc. Many colleges have online learning tools and assignment portals that help you learn your stuff.

, If you have to be social, it is great to have a study group. More shy college students benefit with this.

, If you must make the Saturday night party, know you'll have to spend the afternoon at the library. If you're spending the day hitting the books, plan an hour off at suppertime, and a treat for dessert.

,, Midnight power walks make great memories.

, 12 credits is a good amount of credits to schedule for each semester. That will ensure up to 12-24 hours of studying, assuming that each class has at least 1 hour of studying per credit.

, These might not be covered by the professor because he'll assume that you're already reading the text. So beware, even things not lectured on may appear on the test.

, This is not high school, where you can just get on the honor roll. The grades you get may affect the amount of money you get in your paycheck, or the chances of even getting a job in this economy.

, Allow yourself to get enough sleep without wasting the entire day. Set a curfew and stick to it, and get up at a reasonable time in the morning. Set your alarm!;
, Figure out which finals you need to study for first.

, Cut yourself off from the world while you study and focus on your work.

, Those are a good way to get an idea for what the final will be like, and an excellent idea to get a good concept of what will be on the test.

, They can only help, and will give you a good idea of what you should know. Many teachers also drop hints about specific questions that will be on the final.

, Set aside time to de-stress. You don't want to burn yourself out before the final!

Start over.,
Create a new schedule.,
Look at what you've made and change it.,
Find a place to study that works for you.,
Find a method to study.,
Adjust to your study schedule.,
Stay flexible.",How to Develop a Study System," Write down everything that you did in order to study last time. Write where you studied, what you studied, how much you studied, and how. Consider these to be 'variables' in what is making you unable to get positive results. By learning from your mistakes, you can create a better future.;
, Whether it be a planner, a calendar, a diary-like log, you have to find a way to keep track of what to do. Some prefer planners because of their ability to be carried almost everywhere. Others prefer calendars that can be hung on the walls because of their more organized and easy to read look. Think about what you have to do each day. Not specifically studying, but generic chores that you've learned to do on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis. It's important to take into consideration everything that consumes extra time in your day.

, You have to learn to edit what you do as you learn. You may use this schedule for a day or two and discover that it doesn't work for you unless you color code what needs to be done for school and what needs to be done for personal reasons. Another option is using stickers that symbolize activities. For example, a soccer ball sticker is the equivalent to a notice reminding you that you have soccer practice. Be flexible and willing to change your schedule. Rome wasn't built in a day, and your schedule won't be, either.

, It's important to choose an environment that is quiet, comfortable, and a good size. Working in a huge environment with empty space can be incredibly distracting, whereas working in a small area can get claustrophobic and stuffy. Open windows are a good attribute to a study area. Playing music or leaving on the tv can be helpful to some people, however keep in mind that it can get distracting. Switching music, watching the TV, and spacing out in general can all happen when you use electronic devices to 'help' you work.

, This doesn't mean that you should do only your homework-If you're having trouble in a subject, you will surely have to do more than just work off of the classwork. Get some material, whether it be notes or another wikiHow article explaining how to do work, or maybe something else entirely. When you read through your notes, don't feel like you can't mark them. Write questions and tips on the notes. From here, you mainly should just work through trial and error to find the method of studying that works for you. You can allot your own time to the subjects according to the level of difficulty in the subjects.

, Don't work every second you have allotted to study science. Studying is best done when you work no more than an hour followed by a break lasting no more than 10 minutes. If you feel the need to, change your schedule to consider these breaks by adding extra time studying to each subject.

, Nothing is set in stone, everything can be moved around and edited. Some things won't work for everyone. By changing your schedule and organizational habits, you're also changing your study habits. Those are most important when it comes to school organization, as good study habits result in success in class.

Avoid talking to strangers during lectures and tutorials.,
Avoid talking to your friends.,
Listen to classical music.,
Avoid mucking about on the internet during class.,
Keep social drugs to a minimum.,
Get a good night's sleep: having a full night's sleep will help you feel refreshed and attentive for lectures.,
Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend that you have studies to be getting on with.",How to Concentrate at University Level Classes," While it might be nice meeting new people and discovering their interests, there are better times for doing this than during teaching sessions when you need to be concentrating.;
, They're your friends and they'll still be there after the lecture/class/tutorial. In fact, they might start getting on your nerves if they're around too much over-analyzing all the work in front of all of you. So chill the chat during class and concentrate on what is in front of you. You can debrief with the friends later.

, Classical music is thought to enhance the ability to concentrate while studying. Try Mozart and see if it works for you. If you don't like classical music, you can try listening to trance music, which has many classical elements that are good for the mind and is for spiritual development and relaxation. Studies shown that classical music made during the Baroque period that are played around 70-80 beats per minutes are good for concentration. Think about composers such as Pachelbel or Purcell. See Appreciate Classical Music.

, This means dropping the urge to play Risk with your friends, update your Facebook profile or add your wisdom and ""knowledge"" to a wiki. Again, all of this has a time and a place and can wait until later. It is much easier to listen to what is being said in class now than to rehash it by having to read it all later. This is something you should watch out for when you are on a computer orientated class, such as a computer science, information technology, business, or music production. Try not to mess around with the games and other applications as well.

, Try avoiding over-indulgence in alcohol or smoking a lot. Both impact your health, energy levels and ability to get up bright and early with enthusiasm.

, If you do not get enough sleep your mind is more likely to wander in lectures. Students do not often have great sleeping patterns. If you do not feel refreshed the first time you have a full night's sleep, this may be because your body is not used to this new sleep pattern. You may have to go to bed early for several consecutive nights before it has an effect. The important thing is having regular sleep.

, Play comes after the studies are done. They'll get used to it. If not, find someone who understands or is going through the same issues as you.

Remember that professors are there to help you.,
Make sure your professor is the right person to contact.,
Double check your syllabus.,
Decide on a communication method.,
Review what you are going to say.,
Gather your materials.,
Write a respectful email.,
Ask questions at the end of class.,
Meet your professor in-office.,

Decide whether you need more information.,
Reach out to a peer.,
Participate in class.",How to Communicate With Your Professor," Approach your professor as a resource rather than an authority figure. They do better as teachers in the eyes of the school when you do well as a student. That is why professors open their offices to students.


Most professors at the college level are passionate about their subject. They want students to understand and succeed.;
, Large lecture style classes might have teachers assistants (TAs) assigned to them to help students with certain subjects.


If you need clarification on dates and times, a TA might be able to help you much faster than your professor can.
TAs may have taken this course before, or might be studying the subject being taught. Check with your TA to see if they can meet with you to help clarify general concepts about the subject.
If you have questions that relate to the school but not to a particular class, your professor might not have the answer. Direct questions like ""How do I check my grades?"" or ""How do I add and drop classes?"" to your school's student services department.

, The syllabus generally includes a basic course outline, dates for assignments and exams, reading lists, and class policies. Look over your syllabus to see if you can find the answer to your question.


If your school uses a tool like Blackboard or Moodle, see if there is a calendar listed for your course that has assignment dates and readings listed.
Check with a classmate or the TA before going to your professor with questions that are not about understanding course content.

, The type of question you have can help you choose how you approach your professor. Ask simple questions with short responses through email. If a question involves information about grades or a longer answer, choose to meet in person.E-mail your professor for questions that involve confirming dates and times or asking for verification. Ask “Is this assignment due next week?” and “What books are required for this course?” via email.
Meet your professor in person for questions like “What is my grade on this assignment?” or “Why did I receive this grade?” If there are class materials such as readings you want to discuss with your professor, do so in person.
Visit your professor during their office hours or set up a meeting with them in advance. If you do not know your professor’s office hours, or if you want to set up a meeting, email your professor to confirm.
Be conscientious of your professor’s requests. If they state they prefer only email or only office visits, show them respect by following their wishes.

, If you are writing an email, this includes proofreading to make sure your intent is clear. If you are meeting in person, this includes planning out what you need to say to your professor.Bring a notecard or outline with the topics that you need to cover. This helps ensure that you do not forget anything.
If you are very nervous, practicing your talking points in front of a mirror or with a peer may help.
If you're asking for help with a subject, remember that your professor is there to make sure you understand. Approach them with clear questions, and be open to a discussion.
Understand that if you are asking a favor, like an extension for a deadline or a letter of recommendation, your professor has the right to say no. Be prepared to approach multiple professors for letters of recommendation.

, Keep your notecard with your questions handy when you speak with your professor, and bring any other materials relevant to your question.If you are asking about an assignment or exam, bring a copy with you.
If you are asking a professor to review a paper or assignment, send it to them in advance. Try to give your professor at least a week to review your work before meeting with them.
Always have your syllabus ready when meeting with your professor, and familiarize yourself with its contents before you meet.
If you have a question about course materials, bring the texts with you so that they are easy to reference.

, It is alright to have a short email, but keep it formal. Do not use any slang and make sure there is a salutation and closing.Use the right title. A doctor is a professor with a PhD. Address doctors as “Dr. ”, and other professors as “Professor ” unless otherwise instructed. If you are unsure, use Professor as an all-purpose title.
Introduce yourself in your email. Your professor probably has multiple classes and many students. Starting off with “This is John Doe from your Biology 101 course” lets them know both who you are and the applicable course for your question.
Keep it short. Professors generally receive many e-mails throughout the day. Keeping your text brief enables your professor to read and respond to you faster.
Proofread your email to make sure there are no typos, and that your question is clear and concise.

, You may feel more comfortable around your professor after you've just spent time with them. If you have a quick question or one related to material covered that day, approaching your professor immediately after class is often acceptable.


If there is a mob of students already waiting to talk to the professor, check your syllabus to see when you can come in for office hours.

, Meeting with your professor in-office is a good time to build a positive relationship and demonstrate that you are working hard in class. Do this by showing that you are familiar with the material and asking specific questions about where you want help.The best time to meet with your professor is during their designated office hours, which are usually listed in the course syllabus.
If you have conflicts with the office hour times, you should schedule a meeting with your professor via e-mail.
Arrive punctually to scheduled appointments. If you are going to be late, call your professor or send them a quick email to let them know.
Keep things on track. You know what you want from a meeting better than your professor. If you start getting off-track, redirect the conversation back to your original questions by saying “I think I still need help with this aspect of the material.”
Do not be afraid to take notes when you meet. Make sure you have a pen and paper to jot down conversation points before you go in.
Meet with your professor regularly to stay on track and ensure you are making good progress in class. Try to meet early in the semester, after the first exam, at midterms, and before finals., If your professor responds to your email, send them a short thank you note for their time and effort. “Thank you for clarifying that point. I will see you in class next week” is a good way to acknowledge that they answered your question.If you met with your professor in-person, you may still want to send a thank you email, especially if they took extra time to help you with a concept or worked with you over several meetings.

, Look at your talking points to see if your professor answered all of your questions. If they did not, email them to follow up.


Briefly explain that you still have some questions about the subjects you were discussing.
Request clarification by stating your unanswered questions in a new way. If you did not get an answer to “When is the exam?” try asking “What is the date and time for the exam?”
If there are large areas of information you did not cover during your meeting, request to schedule a second meeting. Let your professor know what specific matters you still want to discuss.
If you are working on a continued goal or long-term improvement in the course, ask to set up weekly meetings to check in with your professor., If your professor was unable to answer your question and you do not want to meet with them again, check with your peers to see if they have the information you need.


If you are looking for feedback on an exam or assignment, participate in a peer review. Exchange assignments with a classmate and mutually review each other's work.
If your school has a writing center, check to see if they offer paper review services.
If your class has a teacher’s assistant or graduate student assigned to it, schedule a meeting with them. TAs are there to help support the students as well as the professor. Meet with them to see if you can get a better understanding of the information you need.

, No matter what you asked your professor, one of the best ways to communicate with them and show that you have taken their words to heart is to be active in class.Ask questions during class time to make sure you continue to understand the material.
Pay attention to due dates and assignment requirements to ensure you get required work in by its deadline.

Be sure to take care of your health.,

",How to Do Well in College," Why else would you pay for tuition or pay taxes for financial aid? Don't make excuses, just go. Even when you don't feel like it. Just go. You might get participation points, and the professor will also get to know you better. It will keep you in the flow of the class, and prepare you for anything that might come along. Many classes have in class assignments, pop quizzes, and case studies that only could be taken in class, if you are not there, you might lose points. Besides that, paying attention in class does wonders to your memory. It is never the same as revising it on your own. Some things are best seen, heard and noted down.;
, College is all about multitasking. Planners can really help you to balance homework, due dates and tests. You should try to get your work done early, then you will have less stress. Some colleges have an online learning tool to help you keep track of assignments and the like. If you don't like the internet, try to use the good old assignment notebook. You can buy one at a WalMart or local dollar store for cheap. A binder is the best way to keep your stuff organized.

, Or, if you have to, make sure you only use it for the task at hand. A study has shown that students who did multiple things on a laptop during a lecture scored lower on a test compared to those who did not multitask. Likewise, students who were in direct view of someone multitasking on their laptop also scored lower on a test compared to those who were not. , If you had a job you would have to go to your job at 9 AM and stay there until 5PM. The rest of the day would be your own time. If you did the same thing in college, you would do great. Go to class, go to the library, study seriously, at 5pm put away the books and go home. It's that simple. Once in a while you might have to work late, just like at a real job, but in general if you were spending 40 hours a week attending to school you would be a Dean's List student. Act like a professional, adult person. Treat your college education as it's like on the job training.

, Everyone studies differently. Some can study with a lot of noise and others want silence. Some like the library and some like to study with friends, or even outside. Studies show that studying with others is best but only if you actually work. They also show that people cannot multitask and performance suffers when you try two things at once.If you find your own ideal study method, your understanding and recall will improve, likely leading to better grades.

, Many students start to mess up in college because they want to hang out with their friends every minute. There will always be time for partying in college. Pull yourself away from partying so that you can take care of business.

, Do not procrastinate on assignments. Try to make progress every day on what is assigned. For example, if you have a report due in 6 weeks, do not wait until 3 days before it's due to begin working on it. Instead, work on it every day for 30 to 60 minutes. Once you get into it, it will actually be enjoyable seeing the progress unfold versus being stressed out and worried about an important assignment that has been put off and whose due date continuously gets closer and closer

, Ancient Roman poet Juvenal said ""una mente sana in un corpo sano"" which means ""a healthy mind in a healthy body"". Join a sports team or exercise, don't overdo the junk food, and try to get as much sleep as possible. Not only will you feel better, you'll be able to think and learn better too.

, Some students start better than they finish. They do that in order to give themselves room to slack near the end of the semester, which can be a costly mistake. Push yourself to do your best on every assignment given out and make sure to check your syllabus to see which assignments are due when. Stay on top of your game and don't lose focus.

Go to class.,
Search out the best professors, regardless of their field.,
Go to office hours.,
Build effective study habits.,
Focus on your writing skills, no matter what your major.,
Plan ahead for major tests, essays, and projects.,
Learn for learning's sake, not for grades.",How to Be Successful in College1," If it seems obvious, that is because it is. That doesn't mean it is not the single most important thing you can do to succeed in college. In general, class is a small part of your overall day -- most students only have a few hours a day -- but they are the most important hours you have. This is where you get to learn, get to grow, and get to meet new people. Not every class, of course, will be a winner. But success requires that you challenge yourself every now and then. Suck it up, get out of bed, and get to class.


If you don't like your classes, or don't see the use for them, consider changing majors. Classes should not be a chore, they should be enjoyable.
Just because a professor doesn't take attendance doesn't mean you have a free pass to skip out. They know, however, that you only get out of a class what you put into it.;
, You're going to have to take some required classes, and you're obviously going to have to take many classes in your major. But the beauty of college comes from the in-between classes. Whenever possible, choose classes with the best professors, even if the class doesn't seem interesting at first. A great professor will turn a ""boring"" subject into a revelation, and a poor one will turn a subject you love into a bore. Professors are the difference makers in college -- seek them out.


Talk to older students, your adviser, or visit rating sites like Rate My Professor to get an idea of the most engaging professors.

, Professors have them for a reason, and most of them love to see and chat with students. Your professors are not like your high school teachers, for the most part. They want individual time to discuss and debate your questions. They're happy to help you when you struggle. Since most college classes are elective, meaning you choose to be there, they are happy to have people interested in their subject.


Professors make great job references later on, but don't expect a glowing review if you only see them in class.
In many fields, professors can open up research jobs, internships, and student scholarships for engaged and hard-working students.

, Getting your work done without someone over your shoulder is hard at first. But studying is a crucial part of college and something you're going to have to actively make time for. Research shows that the most successful students study at least 20 hours a week, roughly 2-3 hours each day. Many professors suggest spending two hours studying for each one hour in class.Make the most of your time by:


Finding a study spot, like the library or a classroom, outside of your dorm.
Studying in 1-hour chunks, taking short breaks in between.
Studying in groups, or with a tutor, when possible.
Asking for help and clarification from professors and fellow students.
Starting the work in advance instead of procrastinating, giving you time to ask questions if you get stuck.

, Good writers get jobs in every single field. That is because effective communication is useful no matter what you're doing -- and not enough people are good at it. Don't wait to write your papers until the last minute, as you're only shooting your future-self in the foot when you do. Go to office hours to discuss paper ideas or rough drafts with professors, and if you get a bad grade on the essay, ask why. Most professors are happy to help you improve, and some will even bump the grade if you show genuine interest in being a better writer.


Search out your college's writing tutors if you're really struggling. They are usually fellow students who can bat ideas around with you casually, helping find the best way to express them in writing., First and foremost, make sure that you understand the assignment completely, asking for clarification if you need. This, along with regular attendance, will almost assure that you do fine on every assignment. For major projects, get started a few weeks in advance. Even one hour of work here and there will pay dividends since it gets your brain thinking about the work and exposes any questions or holes in your knowledge early on.


Make a ""master calendar"" once you have all your assignments on the syllabus. This helps you see, and prepare for, difficult weeks well in advance. If you've got two papers due on the same day, you'll need to get one started ahead of time., College is one of the most incredible, mind-expanding periods of your entire life. Your job is to learn -- and that's it. How cool is that? If you focus on learning, finding the classes, professors, lectures, and events that genuinely interest you, your GPA will follow. Try to stay in the moment and appreciate your classes as a chance to grow intellectually, personally, and socially.Make an effort to speak at least once in every discussion class, even if it is scary at first.
Colleges bring in incredible speakers and guest lecturers every semester-- take some time to find and see the ones that catch your interest.
Your classmates are just as good a source of knowledge as anyone else. Ask about their interests, what they're studying, and where they came from.

Choose the salad bar.,
Cut back on sugar.,
Get up in time for breakfast.,
Consider the sandwich bar.",How to Avoid the Freshman 151," Most cafeterias have a salad bar. If you add lean proteins, like chicken or turkey slices, to a salad you can make a full meal. This can be a good choice for a light lunch or dinner, especially if the cafeteria is serving something like pizza or burgers for your main meal; however, avoid stocking up on certain ingredients. Croutons and high fat meat options like bacon bits can result in weight gain. When it comes to dressing, go for a light vinaigrette over creamier options that tend to be high in calories.If a salad isn't super filling, add a smaller portion of the main meal. If you're craving the mac and cheese the cafeteria is serving that night, for example, try having a big salad first and then a smaller helping of pasta. You'll fill up a bit on vegetables before indulging in a less healthy option.;
, Many items you'll find your college's cafeteria may be high in sugar. Sugar is a major culprit when it comes to weight gain. Try to be conscious of your sugar consumption if you want to avoid the freshman 15.


Many cafeterias offer a lot of sugary snacks for dessert. It can be easy to indulge, especially if you're stressed and craving a treat; however, too much sugar can lead to weight gain. If you want something sweet after your dinner, go for a piece of fruit or a bowl of low-fat yogurt.Sugar and high fructose corn syrup are a common ingredient in juices and sodas. Many school cafeterias offer soda and juice as a beverage option. Try to avoid these choices, as such drinks are often high in added sugar. Go for water if you're thirsty — it will hydrate you and won't cause any weight gain. If you want your water to be more flavorful, try adding a wedge of lemon or lime. If you're craving a sweet drink once in awhile, try diet soda or fruit juice without added sugar., Most cafeterias serve breakfast, but this meal is commonly skipped by college students due to late nights studying. While the extra hours of sleep may seem tempting, breakfast is important. When you wake up in the morning, you've gone 5 to 9 hours without food. Breakfast helps jump start your metabolism for the day, can help you feel full longer to avoid overeating later, as well as help your brain work more efficiently — and lets face it, college is a time when this is needed in full force.Go for a healthy breakfast option in your cafeteria. Try whole wheat toast and fruit, whole grain cereal, oatmeal, or hardboiled eggs. Avoid sugary breakfast options, like french toast or pancakes.
If you have an early morning class and want to avoid the cafeteria altogether, try to pack a breakfast the night before. A whole wheat bagel and some fruit can make a nutritious breakfast you can eat on the go.
If you're really pressed for time, try to grab something small from your cafeteria. Even a piece of fruit is better than nothing.

, Many cafeterias have a sandwich bar where you can choose ingredients. Make a sandwich with whole wheat bread, lean protein, and lots of veggies. Avoid calorie-heavy condiments, like mayonnaise. This can be a healthy dinner or lunch option.


Even if you are choosing lean meats or low-fat cheeses, don't go overboard on these items. You still need to be conscious of how many calories you consume, even when eating healthier items.

Get involved in student activities.,
Be yourself: you have much more freedom to do so now.,
Make 1-2 good friends.,
Set ground rules early on with your roommate.,
Make stress management a priority.,
Take care of your body.",How to Be Successful in College2," The amount of clubs, groups, and events on most campuses is staggering. The best way to meet people is to dive in feet-first. Pick something you love doing, or pick something totally new and weird that interests you. Remember, there is no commitment to most of these groups, so it's okay to go try things and see if you like them. Student activities are your chance to find a small group of people and get to know them, bonding over a common interest.


If you played sports in high school, try out a low-key club sport or intramural team. You can usually sign up as a ""free agent,"" meaning you'll be placed with a random team and get to know new people.
The local arts groups, such as the radio station, newspaper, and theater teams are big, inclusive organizations on 99% of campuses., In high school, you're forced to be with the same people every day for 7-8 hours. Many people feel stifled by their options, their classmates, and their schedule, and worry that the same thing will happen in college. But in college you're free to join whatever clubs and classes you want. You go to lunch whenever you want. You can always go back to your room if you don't like someone or some situation. So be you and enjoy the kind of life you want to live.


Following your passions, however odd or quirky, will lead you to like-minded people.
A college social life does not have to revolve around drinking. Check your activities board or student groups for a wide variety of other activities and events.
Realize that the teen-like judgment common in high school starts to disappear with age. If you want to hang out with someone, you can. If not, then you don't have to see them again. People have little need to become bullies at universities.

, Don't be afraid to get to know people deeply. Ask questions and listen genuinely to the answers. Get to know your dorm mates and ask fellow classmates to come grab lunch with you after class. Everyone has a story, a history, and a passion worth following. If you show kind, genuine interest in that, you'll naturally find a few people you happily call your close friends., Whether you're about to become best friends or worst enemies, you should make your own expectations clear early on to avoid trouble. This isn't (and shouldn't be) a Constitution or set of laws, but rather a basic understanding of how you'll be living together. Doing this early on will ensure that, no matter how well you get along, you'll at least have general respect established. In the first week, casually let them know:


What you brought that is communal, and what is only for you.
Where your ""area"" or side of the room is.
Any major concerns, worries, or pet peeves.
How to get in touch with you., Stress is going to happen, and you will never complete remove it from your life. But you need to find a way to manage it on your own now. While studying is important and classes essential, college is also about having fun. If you make it a priority to do something fun every day, you'll see your stress melting away.


It is natural to feel extra stressed during finals or midterms. Just know that they'll be over soon enough.
Get to know your counseling center if you're struggling to manage stress. They are there to talk to you once a semester or once a week, even if just informally., The first thing many people forget in the whirlwind first year of college is themselves. You start to eat (and drink) much worse, drop your old exercise habits, and stay up until the crack of dawn every night. This is totally to be expected when you're suddenly left with the freedom and resources to decide what you do with your life. But you need to remember to put yourself first. Your social and academic life will both succeed as a result.

Choose the major you love, not the one you think you need.,
Schedule a visit to the career center once a year.,
Find part-time work in a field of your interest.,
Meet and chat with alumni.,
Challenge yourself socially, intellectually, and personally and you will succeed in any field.",How to Be Successful in College3," Only 27% of college graduates actually have a job in the same field as their degree.College is about intellectual exploration and excitement, not cementing your entire future. Choose a major that genuinely interests you and the classes will fly by with ease. Your grades will be better, you'll be happier, and your job prospects will be no worse for the wear.


If you choose to go a pre-professional route after graduation (medical school, law school, etc.) be sure to talk to your career center about fulfilling your requirements for graduate school.

, Your college's career center is an invaluable resource for you, and it is never too early to stop in for a visit. Make an appointment, even if you're unsure what you want to do or don't think you need to plan until senior year. You career center often has internships, connections with alumni, and even grant money to help you chart your path after college.


The career center is a great place for practical advice on what classes you need, where to send resumes, and potential jobs based on your interests.
You don't need to chart out every step of your career from freshman year on. Simply stop in to find out what exactly your career center has to offer you.

, Whether it is research with a professor, a fellowship to produce a book of poetry, or a campus job in IT, finding time to work while in college builds valuable experience and connections. While your career center should have some advice, don't be afraid to ask your professors if they know of any work or research opportunities as well. Many will be happy to sponsor you, or help you find a good fit in their field., Your college's alumni are going to be an incredible, supportive network for you. They will be the ones who uncover a new job position that you're perfect for, that go to bat for you in an interview, and spend an hour or two on the phone giving advice and reminiscing about your alma mater. It seems too good to be true, but the built-in connect you have with alumni will help you in the future whether you realize it or not. While asking for a job directly is generally frowned upon, try out these conversation starters:


""What do you enjoy about your work?""
""How did prepare you for what came next?""
""What advice do you have for a graduate interested in the _________ field?"", You'll get the most out of college only if you're willing to push yourself. Try out a new class that you're interested in but intimidated by. Perform your first stand-up routine at an open mic. Go to parties and pretend you're not naturally shy. If you challenge yourself now, putting aside temporary discomfort for long-term happiness, you have no idea what kind of doors will open up. When you do finally graduate, you'll be able to walk through any challenge or career with your head held high.

Make healthy choices when eating socially.,
Avoid emotional eating.,
Eat a salad before indulging in pizza.,
Drink more water.,
Stay away from trans fats and processed carbs.",How to Avoid the Freshman 152," Social eating is a major cause of weight gain for many college students. You may go to the cafeteria when you're not hungry to spend time with friends. You might also find yourself eating out as a social event. Try to make healthy choices when eating socially to help curb weight gain.


If you end up in the cafeteria after eating, try to avoid eating a second meal altogether. Instead, have a cup of coffee or a piece of fruit while chatting with your friends. They'll understand that you already ate and will simply enjoy your company.Make wise choices when eating out. Avoid foods high in processed carbs, like white breads or pastas. Order something light, like a salad, when eating at a restaurant. Try sharing an entree or appetizer with a friend if you're craving a treat. This will cut the amount of calories you consume in half., Try to be conscious of why you're eating. Emotional eating is a major cause of weight gain for college students. You may eat due to stress or boredom, for example. If you find yourself stopping for a snack on the way home from class, pause and ask yourself, ""Am I eating because I'm hungry or because I'm stressed?"" If the answer is the latter, try doing something else to de-stress. Go for a long walk or watch a movie you enjoy. This is a healthier option than eating due to emotional stress.

, Pizza is a treat frequently consumed by college freshmen. Oftentimes, you'll end up ordering pizza during a late night study party or stopping at a pizza place on your way home. A good way to cut back on how much pizza you consume is to order a salad first. Get a large salad and eat all of it. That way, you'll be fuller when you reach for the pizza. Instead of eating two or three slices, you may feel compelled to stop at one., Oftentimes, dehydration is mistaken for hunger. Drinking water before and during meals can help fill you up faster, lessening the likelihood of overeating. Make a conscious effort to consume more water throughout the day. Carry a reusable water bottle with you to class each day. Go for water over soda or juice when choosing beverage options in the cafeteria., A lot of convenience foods, popular with college students, are stocked with unhealthy ingredients. Foods high in processed carbs and trans fats can easily translate to weight gain. Avoid foods of this nature if you want to keep off the freshman 15.


Some fats, like those found in fruits like avocados, are healthy and necessary for your body to function and should be consumed in moderation. Processed foods, on the other hand, are often high in trans fats. These fats can cause weight gain and increase your risk for cardiovascular problems. A good way to cut out trans fats is to avoid processed foods, which are popular for college students. Ditch the frozen dinners. If you're looking for a quick meal, fix a healthy sandwich or salad rather than popping a plate of pizza puffs in the microwave.Processed carbs are often found in food made from white flour. White rice, white bread, and white pasta are all processed carbs. A lot of popular restaurants on college campuses may offer foods heavy in processed carbs. Look for opportunities to switch to whole grain or whole wheat products when possible. See if you can get brown rice with your Chinese take-out. Ask your favorite campus pizza place if they offer whole wheat crusts.

Walk to classes and events.,
Join a sports club.,
Exercise whenever possible, even in small amounts.,
Use your campus fitness centers.",How to Avoid the Freshman 153," It can be tempting to ask for a ride, take a cab, or ride the bus to classes or social events; however, walking is great for exercise and can help keep excess pounds off. Try to walk to events when possible. This will force you to get a little extra exercise in each day.Instead of driving to the grocery store, walk. You'll burn a lot of calories carrying bags of food home with you.

, College campuses have many clubs and organizations students can join. Try joining a club centered around sports or athletics. You'll be more likely to exercise regularly if you're making new friends in the process. Sign up for a swimming team, a baseball league, or another club that revolves around physical activity., Tiny alterations can often result in keeping weight off. Embracing a more active lifestyle is a good way to avoid the freshman 15. Try to make small changes to incorporate more physical activity into your daily routine.


When in your dorm, a lecture hall, or at your apartment, take the elevator over the stairs.Try to exercise while watching television. If you love watching The Daily Show each night after class, do some sit-ups or crunches during the episode.Exercise can help reduce stress and can be a positive way to cope with the demands of college. Exercise releases feel-good chemicals called endorphins, it can help you sleep better, can help with anxiety and depression, increase self-confidence, and even be used as a form of meditation to forget the worries of the day., If your campus has a gym or fitness center, take advantage of that. While many people neglect regular exercise in college, college is actually a great time to get active and make exercise a habit. As campus fitness centers, gyms, and pools are usually free to students, you won't have to worry about paying gym fees in order to use top-notch equipment. Try to make time each week to hit the campus gym to work out.Aim for 75 minutes of intense aerobic activity a week or 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity. This is ideal when it comes to maintaining a healthy weight."
"
Consume alcohol in moderation.,
Drink your coffee black.,
Manage stress.,
Get lots of sleep.",How to Avoid the Freshman 154," Binge drinking is a major cause of weight gain in college. If you're a freshman, drinking too much can cause you to gain the freshman 15. Also, as you're likely under 21, there are legal repercussions as well. Try to stay away from alcohol altogether until you're old enough to legally drink; however, if you make the choice to drink anyway there are some ways you can curb alcohol's effect on weight gain.


Light beers, wine, and mixed drinks made with diet soda or juice contain fewer calories. If you're drinking, try to stick to these options.Try to avoid binge eating when drinking. Students often think they should eat less throughout the day; however, drinking on an empty stomach will get you intoxicated faster. This can lower your inhibitions, leading to unhealthy late night snacking. If you're going to be drinking later, have a healthy dinner first., Coffee is a major component of many college students' lives. Coffee has no calories on its own, but additives like sugars and creamers can increase the calorie load. If you're used to drinking lattes or coffee diluted with cream and sugar, try to make the effort to switch to black coffee. This can lead to you consuming less liquid calories.


However, do not overdo it on caffeine. You should strive to limit your caffeine consumption to 400 milligrams a day. This is roughly four cups of brewed coffee., Stress can cause overeating and may also affect metabolism. College can be an incredibly stressful time. Managing your stress can help reduce overeating and weight gain.


Look into joining yoga or meditation clubs. These activities help you learn how to live in the moment, which can help curb stress.
Talk to your friends about what's bothering you. A strong social network can help you navigate the stresses of college. If you're worrying about exams or a paper, chances are your friends have similar worries. Venting to one another can greatly reduce stress.
If you're having chronic difficulties managing stress, make an appointment with your college counseling center. Certain mental health conditions, like generalized anxiety disorder, can affect your ability to regulate stress. A qualified therapist can help diagnose and treat such disorders.

, Sleep may affect your eating habits in several ways. You may be prone to late night eating if you're up late working. You may also be more likely to skip breakfast when you're not getting enough sleep as you'll be inclined to sleep in. Being tired may also cause you to make bad choices when it comes to the foods you eat. Practicing good sleep hygiene will help you stay healthy and make good decisions.


Stick to a strict sleep schedule, even on weekends. If you go to bed and get up at roughly the same time every day, your body will adapt to a regular sleep/wake cycle. You'll end up naturally nodding off and waking up at the same times.Engage in a ritual before bed. Reading a book, listening to music, or taking a hot shower can help prep your body for sleep.Avoid going on your laptop or phone before bed. The lights emitted from such screens can stimulate brain activity, keeping you awake."

Make a backup plan.",How to Get a Doctorate in Education," The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is the standard entrance exam for admission to graduate schools of all kinds, including graduate education programs. Your score on the GRE will help determine the schools you are admitted to and the financial aid you are eligible for. The format of the test is similar to the SATs, but the material is more advanced. It is administered on a computer, and takes about four hours to complete.
The fee for taking the GRE in 2016 is $160 for those taking the test in the US, and $190 for those taking it outside of the US.;
, The two types of doctorates in the field of Education, the PhD and the EdD, prepare you for different types of careers. Even if you know Education is the right field for you, until you know what type of career you want to pursue, you won’t have a good idea of which type of degree is right for you.The PhD stands for Doctorate of Philosophy. A student who gets a PhD in Education will study educational theory—the goals of education, the best ways of conducting research, teacher training, etc. Most PhDs in Education don’t actually work in the classrooms or administration of elementary or secondary schools. Rather they primarily function as university level researchers. To the extent they teach at all, they teach prospective teachers in colleges and universities. Pursuing a PhD online is not ideal.
The EdD stands for Doctorate of Education. The EdD is commonly pursued by aspiring or current school administrators, but some classroom teachers have them as well. An EdD student focuses on the practical methods of education—implementing and executing best practices rather than experimenting to find out what works best.

, Familial and professional responsibilities will narrow the range of educational options a student may have. If your family counts on your financial support, you’ll probably need to look at schools close to home offering part-time programs.Unfortunately, a student with a family to support will probably have to pay more for their education, because the stipends offered from graduate assistantships is typically too low to provide for a family.

, Magazine rankings like US News’ Best Colleges are often the first thing people look at when they’re choosing a grad school. While a high rank is nice, it doesn’t make as much of a difference in career outcomes as you might think. Notable research and a strong local reputation matter at least as much in terms of gaining employment.A good way to get a sense of the local reputation of a school is to ask local teachers and educational administrators their opinions about the program.

, In general, graduate students will enroll in courses and complete research the faculty is interested in. The reality is that the graduate student’s preference with respect to research interests matters very little in terms of their overall educational orientation.For example, say your research interest was best practices for teaching poor students. While it’s a fine topic to learn about, if none of the faculty at your school research that same topic, you’re going to struggle to find classes about the subject and a faculty advisor for your dissertation.
You can find out about the research interests of the faculty members by going to the webpage for your program. There will be a listing of faculty, along with a CV or brief description of publications and research topics.

, Ask the admission office about the types of career services assistance they offer to students and alumni. The better jobs the alumni get, the better a school’s reputation will become, so a school with an apathetic attitude toward career development assistance is a bad sign.Also ask how many alumni go on to secure employment in their chosen field and how long it takes them to secure that employment.

, When you apply to schools, you should apply to three or four you feel evenly match your academic accomplishments, two you’re overqualified for and one or two you’re underqualified for (your dream schools).If you want an assistantship—an arrangement where your tuition is waived in exchange for providing research and teaching assistance—you’ll typically apply for it at the same time you would apply for admission.

, As you’re narrowing down your selections, it often helps to visit the school’s physical campus. While you are going to school to earn your doctorate, you should also factor your quality of life into the decision-making process. An unhappy student is more likely to be a poor student. Along with any other factors of importance to you, consider the following:The size of the school. A large state school with thousands of students won’t be the ideal environment for everyone, especially shy people. Conversely, the culture of a very small school might feel suffocating to a student who doesn’t share that culture.
The city environment. Along with the school’s size, take into account the size of the city where the school is located. You’re likely to spend several years in the city—make sure it’s right for you.
Diversity amongst the faculty and student body. Even a very large school can feel alienating and isolating if no one on campus shares your background. While you may want to expand your horizons, you should make sure the school population is interested in doing the same.
The condition of the facilities. A school with facilities in decay is a bad sign, because it means their budget is too small to conduct maintenance and repairs. Students at schools in financial trouble are far more likely to experience disruptions in their course of study than students at financially sound institutions.

, During the first stage of doctoral study, the student completes coursework preparing them to do the type of original research that is a prerequisite to the granting of the degree.Required coursework typically consists of a set of core classes that everyone takes and another set of electives you can personally choose. Your electives should prepare you for your eventual specialization in the field of education.
In a typical, four year doctoral program, completing the required coursework usually takes between two and three years.

, Comprehensive exams (comps) are oral or written examinations certifying a doctoral candidate’s depth and breadth of knowledge in their field. Comps aren’t unique to graduate programs in education; most graduate programs administer them in some form.The particular format will largely depend on your school’s program, but comps are usually structured around a set of questions given in advance of the examination or a reading list, or both. Typically, a student must pass their comps before they can move onto the research component of the doctorate.

, Once the coursework for the doctorate is completed, the student focuses full time on the research component of the degree, the dissertation. A student will work with faculty members to find a topic for research appropriate to their interests and capabilities, and when the student has narrowed the topic sufficiently, they write a dissertation proposal and submit it to a faculty committee, who approves it or rejects it.A dissertation proposal is usually about ten to twenty pages long. It should describe the research project and explain why it is significant, review the published literature about the topic, outline the dissertation, explain the research methods, and develop a timeline for the research and completion of the dissertation.It would be unusual for a faculty committee to reject a dissertation proposal outright. More commonly, they would point to a specific area (like research methods) and ask the student to improve up on it.
A dissertation in an EdD program would typically focus on an academic situation, while a PhD in education would focus on an educational theory. For instance, “Defiant Behaviors in South Atlanta High Schools” might be a dissertation topic for an EdD, while “The Failure of Multiple Intelligence Theory to Predict Student Engagement” might be a PhD topic., Once you have faculty approval for the topic of your dissertation, you have to finish researching and writing it. The length of time it takes for an individual student to complete their dissertation varies widely (from three months to two years) and is based on factors such as:Research. A doctoral student’s dissertation may be delayed because they are awaiting the results of a particular research project.
Faculty guidance. A faculty advisor will assist the doctoral student during the course of writing. If the advisor suggests extensive revisions, the writing process will take longer.
Writing speed. The length of a typical dissertation in an educational field is between 200-300 pages, and a slow writer will take considerably longer to complete a project of that size.

, The dissertation defense is a presentation the student gives to the faculty committee. The student makes their presentation and takes questions from the committee. If the dissertation is successfully defended, the student will be awarded their doctorate. If not, the committee will suggest revisions. After the student makes the suggested revisions, they will be given the opportunity to present their defense once again.The typical presentation portion of the defense will amount to forty minutes to an hour, not including faculty question and answer. You should begin preparations at least two weeks in advance.

, The market for tenure track academic jobs is competitive (some might say downright cutthroat) because there aren't a lot of positions to go around. When the jobs openings in a particular field may number no more than a few dozen, it's important to search for positions nationwide rather than locally.Good sources for job openings can be found online., Good letters of recommendation are some of the best ways to make your application stand out from the dozens (or even hundreds) of other applications for the position you're applying for. They're an actual review of your specific capabilities from a third party and not just a dry recitation of publicized works, grade point averages, and places where you studied.The best letters of recommendation come from people connected to faculty on the hiring committee or people who work at the university you're applying at. The next best are from eminent scholars in your field. Of course, the more eminent, the better, but if you can't get a letter of recommendation from a figure of that stature, get one from a professor you did actual research work for. If one of your recommenders is willing to make a call on your behalf, it's even better.

, Universities grant tenure to professors who do important research, who make lasting contributions to their field. The tenure track positions go to those candidates who seem likeliest to complete that type of impactful research. The best way to convey that type of potential is by publishing research in reputable journals from the very earliest stages of your academic career.Although it may not seem as though you have anything meaningful to say as a new doctoral student, that's not necessarily the case. You'll never know until you make submissions for publication. And even if your submissions aren't accepted, you'll have a better idea of what academic journals are looking for, making publication more likely in the future.

, Academic jobs aren't like typical jobs that only require a cover letter, a resume and application to be considered for a position. To be considered for an academic job, you'll have to submit what's called a dossier. What's included in a dossier varies considerably from school to school, but personal statements and CVs are almost always included.A personal statement is a lot like a cover letter. It will talk a bit about yourself and why you want the position you're applying for, along with a narrative account of your most relevant work experience.
A curriculum vitae, or CV, is similar to a resume, but geared toward positions in the academy and positions where academic qualifications are more important than vocational ones. It will cover your educational background, your thesis and dissertation, academic honors and awards, your research interests, teaching and research experience, references, and most importantly, publications. CVs are longer than resumes, and go into more detail about each subject area. You can look at examples online. Other items appearing in some dossiers include videos of your teaching, student reviews, and account of your academic philosophy, and anything else the hiring committee might choose to include.

, A lot of people applying right out of graduate school don't get the kinds of positions they're looking to get. Therefore, you should put together a backup plan while you're applying for the jobs you really want. Concentrate on postdoctoral fellowships and visiting/adjunct professor positions.Adjunct faculty positions come and go on short notice, so be vigilant when looking.

Work on managing stress.",How to Be a Lazy College Student," There are many reasons why a college degree is desirable, not least that it is still considered highly valuable by many employers.Your own reasons for pursuing a college degree may be more personal, but spend some time working out exactly what these reasons are. Consider why college is important to you.


Do you want to learn important skills like critical thinking and problem-solving?
Do you want to make friends, network and get to know other people?
Do you want to get good grades for further study?
Do you want to get a particular job that requires a college degree?
Spend some time reflecting on these questions and come up with your own answers. It might even be a good idea to write them down. This will help you to recognize what's important to you, so that you can focus on the essential things.;
, After you have determined what's important to you as a college student, then you can make better decisions about pursuing a major or particular classes that will help you achieve your goals.Speak to your academic advisor. It is their job to provide information about what certain majors entail and what courses are necessary.
Ask other students for information about the class. Ask questions like, is the course time-consuming? Is the professor fair? What are the assignments like?
If you don't know any other students, look online. There are many websites, some more general and others specific to particular schools where students share this kind of information.
Be aware that what is on these sites are merely individual opinions, and your own experience of the course may be different.

, Preparation is key and doing what you can before the semester starts will help things run more smoothly later on.For example, ask the professor for a copy of the syllabus ahead of time so that you can order the necessary materials before the semester starts.
Familiarize yourself with the course materials. You can even start reading early to get ahead!

, This is key to being a lazy, yet productive, college student.


Professors often cut material from the syllabus as the class goes on. Usually the syllabus contains more material than it is possible to get through in a single semester.Ask your professor what is required reading and what materials or course readings may be more supplementary, i.e. they will not appear on exams or in assignments.
Pay attention to what kinds of materials come up most frequently in lectures. For example, there may be a textbook chapter and several articles assigned for each class, yet the professor usually focuses on the textbook chapters in lecture. If you can determine a pattern then you can use this in your own preparation for the class.

, Being a college student is not simply about going to class, many students are also part of sports teams, fraternities/ sororities, student associations and take on other voluntary roles. These are obviously important and worthwhile activities, but ask yourself if there are any commitments you could scale back on.
Identify particular commitments that are not necessary to the goals that you have chosen to focus on.
Accept that you can't do everything.

, Timing is essential to being a lazy college student. While procrastination can be appealing, there are some activities that are best done at certain times.Here are some examples.


Do your homework straight after class when the content is fresh in your mind. This will save you time as you won't have to re-visit the material at a later date, when you might have forgotten it.
Write out an essay plan or outline immediately after discussing it with the teaching assistant or professor in office hours. Again, if you spend some time getting your ideas on paper at the right moment then you'll save yourself time in the future, because you won't have to worry about all the good ideas you might have forgotten.

, At some point, you will have to engage with the course materials. If you take good notes the first time round, then at the end of the semester or when an assignment is due you can use these notes and avoid having to re-visit what you have already read.


Write good summaries. Try to distill the argument of a text or the main points in a chapter into a single paragraph. This will serve you well when you come back to look at your notes.
Figure out if typing notes works best for you or if you prefer to write them long-hand.
Annotate and highlight the text.
Use sticky notes to mark important parts.

, Most college courses require you to read a high volume of complex material. Learning to read quickly and effectively is one of the key skills you learn in college.


Preview the passage before you start reading it. Take a minute or two to look at the title, the headings or subheadings, any pictures, charts or graphs.
Skim over the passage by reading the first and last paragraph, and the first sentence of every paragraph.
Researchers suggest that these techniques improves reading comprehension, which will ultimately save you time as you already begin reading with a sense of what's important in the passage.Read in the right environment so that you actually take in what you are reading. This will prevent wasting time by re-reading certain parts that you missed. This requires good lighting, a comfortable upright reading position, minimal distraction and regular breaks. , This refers to the hours in the day spent in routine, non-productive tasks. The idea is that focusing in these key moments can actually give you more free time to relax and be lazy.For example, those 30 minutes spent staring out the bus window during your daily commute could be utilized for productive tasks like reading over your notes or listening to the lecture that you recorded.
If you have free time in between classes, go to the library or the nearest cafe and spend the time studying.

, Colleges often provide writing centers and tutoring services to their students. It is a good idea to make use of these services as they will help you get the work done faster and prevent you wasting time being stuck on a particular problem or difficult assignment.

, Collaborating with other students in study groups can be an excellent way to share the workload.When prepping for the final exam, delegate different topics to different members of the study group to make notes on. This can be a great time saver, although you will obviously still need to make sure that you are familiar with all the course content.
Make sure everyone in the study group is on the same page and shares the work equally.

, Remember there is no shame in getting help when you need it. Most professors and teaching assistants have weekly office hours. They can help you strategize for success in the class.


Get advice on assignments and exam preparation, often this will prevent you wasting time on what isn't essential to the course.

, There is lots of technology that can help you as a college student, a laptop being the most obvious investment.


Consider investing in a recording device. This can prove useful especially if you have difficulty concentrating in lecture or are going to miss a key class. Always remember to ask the professor for permission before you record them!
Use software to help with referencing and citations. Many college papers, especially research papers, require correctly formatted references and bibliographies. There are many programs available to help with this, which will ultimately save you time and avoid any issues with incorrect citations.

, College can be stressful, for many students it is the first time living away from home and there are increasing financial pressures on students, many of whom work to sustain themselves throughout college.Acknowledge that stress is normal, but be aware that too much time spent worrying or stressing can be unhealthy and stop you from succeeding.
Engage with your college's resources for managing stress. Many colleges provide programming for students to help with stress management, especially during finals period.
Some key ways to manage stress are to engage in physical exercise, make time for relaxing activities, and try to get enough sleep. When it comes to managing stress, being lazy sometimes can be a good thing!

Go to class.,
Be attentive in class.,
Take good notes.,
Read material before class.,
Ask questions.,
Study outside of class.,
Surround yourself with other engineering students.,
Don’t stress out.",How to Be an Effective Engineering Student," Yes, every class. Falling behind in engineering school is almost impossible to recover from, so don’t miss class unless you absolutely have to.


Try to never miss a class unless there is a mandatory event you have to go to or you are very sick.
Make it a top priority to personalize your class schedule to fit your availability. If you are not a morning person, try not to schedule a lecture at 8 am! This is a key first step to success in engineering or any other major.;
, Put away your phone, and don't mess around on your laptop if you use it to take notes. Paying attention to the flow of a lecture allows you to have a firm and smooth understanding of all the course material.


In fast-paced classes like calculus and chemistry, losing focus for even a minute can leave you completely lost. Make it a priority to focus for the entire class period, then let yourself unwind when the class concludes.
Lecture classes are the easiest to get distracted from, especially those that last a long time, and especially when you're tired. If you can, try to arrive at class well-rested and free from other distractions.

, It might seem like you'll remember everything later, but after a few lectures it can all become a blur. Good notes can be the key to refreshing your memory, working through problem sets and studying for exams.


Don't waste time copying down everything the professor writes if it's already in your textbook. It's easy to become so focused on writing equations that you stop following the content of the lecture! Focus on capturing the professor's insights and examples that you can't find anywhere else.
Consider whether to take notes on a laptop or in a notebook, depending on the class. When most of your notes are words, a laptop can be much faster. But when notes are mostly equations and drawings, a good old fashioned notebook and pencil may be easiest. Some people even take notes and make drawings on a tablet. Try different options to see what is fastest and least distracting for you.

, Most people need to see something at least several times to learn it, so give yourself a head start!


Make it a point to read the material that will be covered in lecture the day before. This gives you a foundation for what you'll hear in class and helps you feel more confident during a fast-paced lecture, so you can focus on deepening your understanding instead of trying to keep up with the basics.
Prepare questions in advance for parts that confuse you. If the lecture doesn't clarify the concepts for you, ask your questions during class.

, Professors are not perfect and every student learns differently, so there will be times you don't understand something. Asking questions is one way to take charge of your own learning and ensure you get the information you need to succeed. Interacting with your professors helps you engage with the material more deeply and get personalized assistance when you need it.


In most cultures and classes, students ask questions by raising their hand and asking the professor directly during class.
Asking questions in class can sometimes be intimidating, but don't be scared! If you are confused by something, chances are others in the class are too, and you will be doing them a favor by asking about it. It is your right to ask all the questions you need in order to learn the material.
If you missed the chance to speak with your professor during class, attend their office hours to receive one on one help.
In larger classes, teaching assistants may hold extra office hours or problem sessions. Attending these can be a great way to get extra help and learn from other students.

,


A good rule of thumb is to look at the number of credit hours for your class, then spend the same number of hours per week studying outside of class. For example, if you are taking a four credit class then you should spend at least four hours per week reviewing material, re-writing notes, and doing homework. This is just a guideline; adjust based on how much time you need to learn the material well.
This does not have to be all at one time; space out your study sessions to be more effective.

, Collaboration is a key part of being an engineer, so get involved and don't be afraid to ask for help.


Get involved with the engineering student community. One good way is to join an engineering association in your school or community (ASME, ASCE, ASCHE, etc.).
Find a study buddy or group. Whether you are quizzing each other, going over homework, or discussing questions about the lecture, studying with others is very valuable. The optimal size for a study group is around 3-5 people, but even one person makes a huge difference. You will learn from seeing how other students approach problems and think about questions, and explaining your own thoughts to others will solidify your understanding.
Learn to work in teams. A lot of your work as an engineer will be team oriented. The sooner that you can surround yourself with others and learn to work in a team, the better.
Being an engineer is hard! The more people you have in your support network, the easier it will be.
The relationships you form can be great networking opportunities for the future.

, There will be times in engineering school where you have 2-3 difficult exams in one week. Prepare yourself ahead of time and don’t panic, because stress lessens the effectiveness of your study time.


As an engineering student you’re going to be put in stressful situations. Take study breaks to help you relax and give your mind a break so you can return to studying with more focus. Just remember that one exam or quiz isn’t going to define you as an engineer.

Make a repayment plan.",How to Get Financial Aid for College if You Are a Convicted Felon1," Being a felon may not restrict you from federal financial aid, but there are other steps you need to take to make sure you can receive money. You must have a valid Social Security Number, comply with Selective Service registration if required, have a high school diploma, GED certificate, or have passed an ATB test, and be enrolled at a school that accepts federal aid.Other requirements include that you must not owe a refund on a federal grant, or be in default on a federal student loan. You must also have a financial need, but you prove that by filling out the FAFSA.;
, The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the main form you fill out to determine your eligibility for financial aid programs. You can fill out and submit the application through the Department of Education’s website.


The FAFSA determines eligibility for federal programs, but is also used for state-level programs. Even if you don’t qualify for federal programs, filling out the FAFSA may open up other opportunities for you.Be honest about your conviction. Throughout the entire process, you will be asked a variety of questions about your conviction. Lying on a financial aid form is considered fraud, which is a federal offense. If convicted, you may need to pay a fine, serve time in prison or both.You do not need to report a conviction that has been erased from your record., When you are filling out the application, make sure you use the proper address on the form. Your address is that of your current correctional or juvenile facility location.Once you are released, you need to change your current address. You can do that online at the FAFSA website or by calling the office at 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243).

, Applying for financial aid can be a complicated process. Don’t let yourself get stuck or make a mistake. If you have questions, or trouble while filling out the application, talk to the education coordinator at your correctional or juvenile facility. You can also contact the financial aid office at the school you plan to attend, or the Federal Student Aid Information Center by phone (toll free: 1-800-4-FED-AID; toll: 319-337-5665) or email (studentaid@ed.gov).

, Once you finish your degree, you will need to start paying back your loans. When you sign up for classes, be sure to consider your future employment, and your ability to pay back your student loans. Remember that, as a felon, many of your postgraduate employment options will be limited. As soon as you graduate, you will need to contact the Department of Education to set up your payment plan."

Pell grants are mainly for undergrads, but certain students (namely those in teaching programs) qualify for them at the master's level.


It doesn't matter whether you're full-time, part-time, or even less than part time! Though the amount of money will decrease with fewer credit hours being taken, you'll still qualify.;
, This is just part of growing up as an American male. You have to register for the Selected Service at some point between the ages of 18 and 25.If you want federal aid, that time is now! (Just have your SSN at the ready.)


As with anything that's even semi up-to-date, you can do it online. While women are more than welcome into combat positions nowadays, they are still exempt from having to sign up. Legal aliens, on the other hand, are not exempt, and too must register.

, In order to fill out the FAFSA, you'll need documentation that you're a US citizen or otherwise eligible. You'll need a valid Social Security number unless you're from the Marshall Islands, Palau, or Micronesia.If you are not a US citizen, you will need a green card, an arrival-departure record, battered immigrant status, OR a T-Visa (or a parent with a T-1 Visa)., When you file the FAFSA, little government elves go to work, calculating your expected family contribution, or EFC. That number is subtracted from the cost of attendance, and after a few other considerations (dependent status, etc.), your EFC is determined.If your number is greater than $5,081 (for 2013-14), you do not qualify for a Pell grant.Households that make less than $24,000 will have an EFC of zero.For more information on the EFC and how its calculated, the Department of Education has formula guides online.You won't really know what your EFC is until you try -- so even if you think you or your family's income is too high, apply anyway! No harm, no foul. Generally, families that make up to $50,000 or so qualify., As long as you meet your school's financial aid deadline, you'll receive your Pell grant in full. However, it's always a good idea to get these things done sooner rather than later. The FAFSA can be filed (and the Pell grant thusly applied for) as soon as January 1st of each year.The closer you are to that date, the better off you'll be.


Other loans, however, are first come, first served. When you get your award letter from your institution, they may have given you other grants -- the likelihood of which is maximized if you act quickly.

, You'll need your social security card, tax information and pay stubs if available. If you have yet to file taxes for the year, you can give your estimated tax information based on last year, but you'll need to update eventually.


If you are a non-citizen, you'll need your records, such as you green card, to complete the FAFSA.

, This is your ""federal student aid pin."" It can be obtained here. This will be your number for the rest of your college career. Even though you'll file the FAFSA each year, you'll use the same pin over and over.


If you are a dependent, your parent(s) will need a pin, too.

, This takes about 30 minutes to fill out and is pretty straightforward. You may fill it out on paper, but doing it online is much, much, much quicker.You'll be asked personal questions (like your address (tough one!)), financial questions, and then your parents will have to answer questions, too. Nothing too prying!

You can fill out the FAFSA if you haven't been accepted (or done the accepting to) anywhere yet. Up to ten schools may be listed on the form., It should only take a few days to see your student aid report, or SAR. In fact, you can start checking the status online as soon as you submit your FAFSA. Once you get your SAR, you'll know how much aid you'll receive.


This is the part where you get notified of your EFC. It doesn't mean you have to pay it though! At least not right now. It's just used to calculate aid.

, Each school that you were accepted to will notify you of the aid you qualify for (if you listed them on your FAFSA). Most likely, each school will be different. When you filled out the FAFSA, each school you list was be notified of your information and is therefore able to award you accordingly. If you've been accepted to more than one, weigh them against each other!


If you qualified for the Pell grant, you will get it from every school. Each student that qualifies gets the amount they qualify for. However, cheaper schools may result in smaller grants., Once you've enrolled in a specific school, the aid will come to you. Your school will either issue you a check, apply the funds to your student account, or a mixture of both. It usually happens once per term.For the record, the maximum amount anyone can receive is $5,635 (2013-2014).And, of course, you can only receive it from one school at a time.

, Though every student who qualifies ""will receive their grant in full,"" there are a few small exceptions.The government likes to know you're going to stick to your word -- if you're failing out of college, they may deem you a lost cause and cease aid. What's more, the better your grades, the more other grants you may receive, so it's just good common sense.


If you receive a criminal conviction while you're a student, your eligibility may change. Don't assume you can't get funds, but do know that it may be more difficult. It all depends on your specific situation., You are only eligible for Pell grants for 12 semesters, or six years. They do not have to be consecutive, but that is the limit. You will receive a notification if you are nearing the checkpoint., In order to receive loans and grants, you have to file the FAFSA every year. This is because your tax information may change and has to be accounted for. Though you'll use the same pin, you still have to file.


Act quickly. Though the Pell grant is not awarded on a first come, first served basis, it is best to do it as quickly as possible.The earlier you apply, the more other grants you may receive.

Determine your eligibility.,
Complete a drug rehabilitation program.,
Stay clean.",How to Get Financial Aid for College if You Are a Convicted Felon2," On the FAFSA, you will be asked if you have a conviction for a drug-related offense while receiving student aid (Question 23).To help you answer the question properly, there is an additional form available from the Student Aid Office .


Just being convicted of a drug-related offense doesn’t mean you can’t get any money. Any drug-related conviction (felony or misdemeanor) that occurred while receiving financial aid will make you ineligible without further steps. If your conviction came when you were not receiving aid, you can still be eligible., If you were convicted for a drug-related offense while on federal aid, you will need to complete an acceptable rehabilitation program in order to regain your eligibility. Once one complete this program, you can contact the financial aid office at your school to get aid.An acceptable drug rehabilitation program must meet one of three requirements: include two unannounced drug tests, be qualified to receive funds from federal, state, or local government, or a state-licensed insurance company, or be administered by a federal, state, or local government agency, or a state-licensed health clinic, or medical doctor. Talk to your parole officer or health care provider to find a good program. Make sure you discuss with your school’s financial aid office what documentation you will need to prove that you completed the program., Once you have finished the program, you need to make sure you stay away from drugs. If you are convicted of possessing or selling drugs after you submit your FAFSA, you will need to notify your financial aid administrator immediately. At that point, you will no longer be eligible, and you must pay back all aid you received after your conviction."

Get a Pell Grant.,
Get a scholarship.,
Use the GI Bill.,
Apply for a private loan.",How to Get Financial Aid for College if You Are a Convicted Felon3," A Pell Grant is a need-based grant that you will not need to repay. Getting a Pell Grant is determined by your financial need, which is calculated with the FAFSA. It has nothing to do with merit or your grades. If you do get a Pell Grant, you need to remember to re-apply each year to make sure you keep getting the money, and make sure you graduate in six years.If you are currently incarcerated in a federal or state institution, you cannot get a Federal Pell Grant or federal student loans. However, you will not be considered incarcerated if you are in a halfway house, home detention, if you serve only on weekends, or if you are confined to a correctional institution while awaiting trial.Therefore, if you are not considered incarcerated, you may be eligible for federal student aid.

, There are hundreds of scholarships available for people of all backgrounds and for all types of programs. In most cases, being a convicted felon will not bar you from applying or receiving these scholarships. Look for scholarships that are designed to help someone like you, which may include references to your religion, family status, or personal background.You can consult colleges, libraries, online databases, or the Federal Student Aid website for lists of scholarships. Consider searching for scholarships that are meant for felons.Your felony conviction may make a powerful story if your scholarship requires an essay. If you decide to talk about your conviction, make sure you indicate how you have grown from the experience, and how it will make you a better college student.

, If you are a military veteran, or dependent of a veteran, you may be eligible for other academic assistance. Get your DD214 form to confirm your discharge in order to apply for benefits. Fill out a VA Form 22-1990, “Application for VA Education Benefits,” to see what you are eligible to get from the VA.It is important that your discharge from the military was an honorable one. If you are discharged for any other reason, you may not be eligible for other benefits.In terms of your conviction, it needs to have come from a civilian court, not a court martial. Court martial convictions may be considered felonies, though you should consult a lawyer to see if that is the case in your state., Once you have exhausted your options for federal and state aid, look into getting a loan from a bank or other financial institution. Make sure you look at the bank’s requirements to make sure you will qualify for their loans.There are many options out there for student loans. Before applying, make sure you will be able to get the amount of money you need, and that you will be able to pay it back. There are several websites out there to help you compare loan options, which you should look at before applying for one.As a felon, you probably will not have great credit, meaning you are a risk to a financial institution making a loan. To help your cause, you will need a cosigner, who is agreeing to assume responsibility if you cannot pay the debt. Cosigners are usually close relatives, like parents or siblings, but they can be any adult that you trust and has strong enough credit for the bank.Keep in mind that cosigners will be liable for your debts and will be responsible for paying them if you default. If you fail to pay your loans, your cosigner will be on the hook and it will most likely cause rifts in your relationship.

Get your employer to pay for your education.,
Work for a college or university.,
Consider joining the military.,
Apply to be a teaching assistant.",How to Get Paid to Go to College1," Many companies have tuition reimbursement programs, typically aimed towards helping their employees with their professional development and advancement. Many times there are restrictions on areas of study and institutions.


Some companies require that you stay with the company for a certain period of time, or else you'll have to pay them back. If you can find a tuition reimbursement program that works for you, however, and you can balance school and work, you'll be making money while your employer picks up the educational tab.;
, Most institutions allow eligible employees to pursue an education at no charge, meaning that you'll be working and making money as well as getting schooling for free. If you can get hired at a school, you can probably go there for free, whether you're an administrative assistant or a cook.


Eligibility varies, of course, and some schools are more generous than others. You'll have to do your homework, but there are many opportunities to be had with this route, like taking classes for free at Harvard University while working 20 hours a week as a janitor., Various branches of the military in several countries have programs which will pay for your school, and then some. Most of them have a service requirement that you must fulfill during and/or after school. To learn more about the programs in your country, visit the recruiting office for each branch of the military and ask lots of questions. Here are a few programs you might be interested in:



Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC). In the US, you can join ROTC and get up to a full four-year scholarship plus an annual stipend. It's also a good idea to check out service academies. American cadets who get accepted into service academies earn a monthly salary and a commission when they graduate.

, While these positions are usually only available to students who've already completed a Bachelor's degree and are applying to graduate school, most Graduate programs hire qualified candidates to teach introductory courses in their degree field, or to assist in the classrooms of full professors. These positions come with a stipend and a remission of all tuition costs, meaning that you'll be making a profit while attending school.

The first step of this process is to obtain a Federal Student Aid (""FSA"") ID. The process to obtain one is quite simple:Visit the Federal Student Aid website.Provide your e-mail address and choose a unique username and password.
Enter any required personal information (name, social-security number, address, etc.)
Confirm and submit.
The Social Security Administration will then review your information and, assuming everything checks out, send you an e-mail indicating you can use your new FSA ID. This process takes between one and three days.
This ID consists of both a username and a password that is used by the U.S. Department of Education to verify your identity when applying for federal aid.;
, While the information needed to complete the FAFSA will vary depending on your particular situation (country of citizenship, dependent status, etc.), try to gather at least the following before beginning the process, as this will make filling out this rather complex form much more manageable:Your social-security number and driver's license number.
Your most recent tax return.
Information relating to how much money you have (bank-account balances, list of investments, real estate, business assets, etc.).

, Once you have your FSA ID and have collected the information you will need to apply, navigate to the FAFSA websiteand click on the button to ""Start a New FAFSA."" Follow the on-screen directions and enter your basic personal information (name, social-security number, etc.).


You can save your application and resume it later if you don't wish to complete it in one sitting.
Since you will be entering a lot of personal/sensitive information, you can use the ""virtual keyboard"" option for added security.

, The next step in the process is to let the federal government know which schools will be receiving information regarding your federal aid determination. The law schools you have selected will use the information sent by the federal government after it processes your FAFSA to calculate the financial-aid package they will offer you. You can list up to ten schools in the online application.While the order in which you list the schools does not matter for federal purposes, some states require you to list state schools you may attend first if wish to be considered for state aid.
If you don't want the schools on the list to see the other schools you have indicated on the FAFSA for some reason, you can complete the FAFSA for one school, wait until the application is processed, go back and delete that school, and then add another.Repeat as necessary.

, As you are completing the FAFSA, the application will ask you several questions aimed at determining whether you are an independent or dependent student (i.e., do your parents or someone else claim you as a dependent on their tax returns).


If you are classified as dependent, you must provide information relating to your parents' financial situation in addition to your own.

, Before making you an offer of financial aid, the federal government needs to know your financial situation to see if you qualify for need-based aid. In addition to personal finances (such as bank-account balances or other assets), you will need to provide information from the federal-income-tax return for the year prior to the academic year for which you are applying for aid.If you haven't filed the relevant tax return yet, you are allowed to estimate the necessary information while filling out the FAFSA.

, After you have completed the application, verify the information you have provided for accuracy and, when you are satisfied, use your FSA ID to electronically sign and submit the FAFSA for processing.


The federal deadline for submitting your FAFSA is June 30 for each academic year.Also pay attention to relevant state deadlines, along with those of your chosen schools, as they might differ from the federal deadline.
In any case, it is best to complete this process as soon as possible.

, Your best source for obtaining grants will be the law school that you plan to attend.Each school offers its own grant programs, and the best place to find out information relating to these programs is the law school's financial aid office.


You can likely find information relating to particular grants on the website of your law school's financial-aid office, but it is probably best to actually call and speak with someone in that office to get an idea of which grants your school offers and the ones for which you may qualify.
Check for the office's phone number on its website.

, Some states offer grants for students who meet certain criteria, such as attending a particular state school or being a resident of that state.The best way to find out what opportunities may be available from either your state or the state in which you plan to go to law school is to contact your state's higher-education agency. Contact information for each of these state agencies is available online., There are a great deal of private organizations that offer grants for prospective law students, awarded based on anything from past academic performance, to intended career path after law school, to qualifying minority or military status.While you will likely have to spend a good amount of time searching online for grants that may be applicable to you, start with the websites of the American Bar Associationin additional to your local or state bar association. Not only will these associations offer grants themselves, their websites are a great source of information relating to this process as a whole.
There are also websites that allow an applicant to search for law-school grants based on specified criteria, such as background experience, future career path, or state of residence., Certain law firms also offer grants to prospective law students, and usually require that the grantee work for that firm during the school year or during summers.Try checking the web pages for firms in your area or the area in which you hope to practice to see if they offer this type of grant. You can also try calling these firms using the contact information on their websites.

, After you have completed the FAFSA and your law school has sent you your financial-aid award package, which include any federal, state, or university grants you have been awarded, you have the option of trying to negotiate the terms of your award package with the law school.The first step in this process is to understand what attending that particular law school will cost you over the next three years.Don't only consider the costs of tuition. Also budget for books, a computer, housing, a car, food, and some discretionary income.
If any of your award package is contingent on you satisfying some condition, like maintaining a certain GPA, you should take this into account as well.

, Once you have determined how much it will cost to attend a particular law school, compare these figures with the award package the school offered you. The financial-aid package will cover the whole cost of attendance, but will likely comprise a mixture of need-based aid, merit-based aid, and loans. If you are uncomfortable with the amount of money awarded via loans, you can try to negotiate with the school.

, Before you begin this process in earnest, you should contact the financial-aid office of the particular law school. Ask the office how they handle financial-aid negotiations. Some schools will prefer to do this over the phone, but most prefer written correspondence., This type of negotiation is best done in writing, so either e-mail or mail a hard copy of a letter detailing your desire to negotiate your award package. Detail how the award offer does not fully satisfy your budget, and indicate to the school your desire to attend if they can provide more financial assistance.


Make sure your tone is professional and polite.
For example, don't demand more money; ask if there is anything the school can do to help you attend in a financially secure way.
Attach any other award letters you have received from other schools if you think it will help your position., If the law school responds with a better financial-aid offer, compare the new offer with your calculated cost of attendance to see if this new offer satisfies your budget in a way you are comfortable with. If it doesn't, you can try to repeat this process to see if the law school will offer you a better deal.


Again, be sure to remain cordial during this entire process. Not only does this increase your chance of successful negotiation, it also ensures you won't begin your law-school career in a negative fashion if you do ultimately choose to attend that law school.

This Federal student aid usually consists of grants (free money which doesn't need to be paid back) and loans (borrowed money that does need to be paid back when done with school, but at very reasonable interest rates and repayment terms), which are the largest sources of student aid.;
, In a few days you will have access (at the same web site) to your Student Aid Report (SAR) which is what you get after the FAFSA is processed.  Double-check the SAR for any data entry errors and make corrections online if necessary.  Also make sure that the school or college you plan to attend is listed as one of the schools on your SAR.

Get a job off campus.,
Keep your work hours manageable.,
Schedule your classes early.",How to Get Paid to Go to College2," Most campus jobs are reserved to students who are financially independent and make under a certain amount of money annually. These jobs typically offer decent wages, favorable tax rates, and a convenient location and hours for students. If at all possible, a work study job would be ideal for a working student.


Typically, work study jobs are clerical and service oriented, including anything from answering phones in the student center to slinging burgers in the cafeteria. Other options, like taking notes for visually impaired students, tutoring, or doing a variety of other tasks are also available, however, at some universities. Explore all your options.

, Work study positions are part-time. If you don't qualify for work study, or you need to work more hours, it's typically a better idea to work off campus to give yourself more options. Ideally, it'd be nice to get something in your degree field to be gaining professional experience at the same time that you're studying, any of the following are common student jobs:


Waiting tables
Bartending
Cooking
Working at a coffee shop
Being a clerk or secretary
Telemarketing

, In your effort to make money and stay ahead of your tuition bills, make sure that your schoolwork doesn't take a backseat to your work responsibilities. Try to find a healthy balance between your work hours and your classroom hours. Save back enough time to get all your schoolwork finished, so you're making it worth your while.


Ideally, you want a job that you won't have to ""take home"" with you. Certain secretarial jobs can include some at-home components, which can seriously cut into your homework time. Service jobs can be easily left at work.

, If you've got a set work schedule, each semester change-over can get a little hectic when you've got to schedule new classes around it. Don't wait until the ideal class times are all filled. Sign up for your classes early so you don't put a strain on your work schedule and have to be in two places at once.


Be firm with your schedule. If your job requires you to be ""on call"" at any point to cover shifts, you need to make sure that your superiors know about your school hours and that you take your studies seriously. Don't be bullied by off-campus bosses who want you to work more.

Apply for financial aid.,
Pursue a variety of scholarship opportunities.,
Look for tuition waivers.,
Apply to a school that has no tuition.,
Adjust your expectations.",How to Get Paid to Go to College3," Financial aid packages are used to help pay for college with a variety of grants, which you don't have to pay back, and loans, which you do. This is also the way to find out whether or not you qualify for a work-study position on campus, which can further alleviate the financial burden of attending school.


To receive financial aid in the U.S., you'll need to fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). While it's possible to use loans to get extra money during college, you're not really getting paid (even though it might feel that way). You'll have to pay all of it back eventually, plus interest. So when you receive a financial aid offer, focus on grants and ignore loans.

, Scholarships are like grants in that you don't have to pay them back, but they can be awarded by any organization--not just the government. The conditions to apply for scholarships vary widely. Some are need-based, some are merit-based, and some have very quirky requirements (like being tall, left-handed, or very good at duck calling. No, seriously.


Apply for a National Merit Scholarship, if your grades are good enough. While it's uncommon, a student at University of Alabama reportedly profited over $30,000 from his college experience, having received a tier one scholarship that covered all of his tuition and housing expense and included a $1,000 each semester, supplemented by a National Merit Scholarship. This is extremely uncommon.

, When checking out schools, ask about tuition waivers. You might have to do a lot of asking, though. They can be like hidden gems. For example, you might get a waiver for working on the school's newspaper, being a lab assistant, being a teaching assistant, or taking on the responsibilities of a resident assistant (RA). In addition, some tuition waivers are offered by the government. In Illinois, for example, you can receive a four-year tuition waiver if you commit to teaching in that state in special education once you graduate.Usually, state-based tuition waivers are offered to residents of that particular state, so do an Internet search for the state you're already a resident of and ""tuition waiver"" (like +Nebraska +""tuition waiver"").

, Keeping in mind that there might be a work requirement, many schools are beginning to waive tuition for students who meet certain income requirements. Stanford University, for example, doesn't charge tuition to students whose families earn less than $100,000 a year, and also waives room and board for students whose families earn less than $60,000 a year.In the US, other institutions include:


College of the Ozarks
Deep Springs College
Berea College
Olin College of Engineering
Curtis Institute of Music
Alice Lloyd College.

, Going to college isn't just about going to a big name University that might be out of your price range. You get out of school what you put into it. Be the big fish in a small pond. Make a great impression on professors and administrators who can serve as beaming references when you apply for jobs. Network. Participate in extracurricular activities. Get an internship. You can do all of these things without being buried in politics at a cut-throat, competitive school that'll break the bank.


According to some studies, a degree from a prestigious university like an Ivy League might be cost effective if your goal is a serious six-figure income, but doesn't give you much of an advantage if you choose certain careers, like business or teaching. In fact, the resulting debt might cripple your career flexibility, meaning that you might not be able to take a teaching job at a great public school because you won't make enough money to pay off your loans and stay financially afloat.
Living at home with your parents and commuting to school can save you thousands - possibly tens of thousands - of dollars in room and board costs.

Investigate private scholarships.,
Check with your work.,
Investigate state agencies.,
Ask your college.,
Get help paying for your education ""after the fact"" via federal tax credits and deductions.",How to Get Financial Aid as a Mature or Returning College Student2," Funds for education can come from a variety of private sources.  A free scholarship search web site can be a good source of information.  Besides your geographic location and your intended major or career field, be sure to search with keywords ""returning student"" and ""non-traditional student"" as some organizations look to help fund older students, especially those that had barriers to pursuing their education during their ""traditional"" college-age years.

, If you are working or in a labor union, ask your employer (human resources dept.) or union if they offer financial assistance to return to school to help upgrade your skills.  If you are a member of a church or any other type of organization, find out if they offer educational scholarships to their members.

, Most states also have their own student aid programs so look up the state agency that deals with higher (post-secondary) educational financial aid in your state of residency.  Some are intended for traditional college age students, but some are not.  Most are tied in to filing the FAFSA but some may require additional applications or documentation and may have early deadlines.

, The college you want to attend may have its own sources of student aid funding.  Most colleges have foundations that have fundraising and endowments specifically earmarked for student aid and scholarships.  Contact the Financial Aid or Scholarship Department and/or Foundation of your college.  If you know your intended academic major, also contact that academic department to see if there are scholarships for that specific major or department.

,  In other words, you pay for certain education-related expenses (tuition, fees, books, supplies and required equipment) ""up front"" and then you recover some or all of these outlays in the form of tax credits and/or deductions the following year when you file your federal tax return.  Remember that credits (which directly reduces income taxes owed) are generally better than deductions (which reduces the amount of your income subject to taxes) and you normally can't do both.

 

The American Opportunity Credit can be used for your first four years of undergraduate (pre-bachelor's degree) education.  The Lifetime Learning Credit can be used for most other higher education or training.  Tuition and fees can be deducted from income, as can interest paid on student loans -- even if you don't itemize your deductions.   See a professional tax preparer or IRS Publication 970 (at www.irs.gov) for more details.

Track your spending.,
At the end of the month, look carefully at what you wrote.,
In a separate paper, write down all your income.,
Write down your living expenses.,
If your income cannot support your basic living expenses you need to make more money!,
Write down your ""necessary"" expenses.,
Even if you can afford your personal luxuries, think about cutting back.,

Every month, after you put your savings aside, tackle your fixed expenses.,
Now you're left with spendable money.,
The jar can get you through unforeseen small expenses.,
With the savings you put aside, you can go two ways.,
Keep substituting spending habits for almost free ones, to save more.",How to Build Your Savings in College," Before making any changes, write down all your spendings (in a planner, notebook or whatever you want). Write down what you bought, how much it cost and why you bought it. Also write down any income you come across.;
, Think hard about your spending habits. Deep down you know where you should cut in order to save, but we'll tackle that next.

, From work or an allowance from your parents, scholarships, all of it! The money you're allowed to spend on a credit card does not count as income and it's not spendable money. Save credit cards for emergencies. If you'll be tempted to use it before that, try some drastic measures like freezing it in a giant ice cube or give it to someone you trust for keeping but who wouldn't give it back without explanation (maybe mom?)

, Maybe arrange them by categories if you'd like. Things like gas, hygiene products, food, water bills and such fit into this category. If you add them up and the total is less than your income, you're in the clear, for now.

, Resorting to credit throughout college to pay for basic needs is a big red flag and it means you're in trouble. Try all you can to find another steady source of income like a job, applying for financial aid or doing odd jobs like tutoring or babysitting. Hopefully your basic expenses are covered and you can move in to the next step.

, These are those buys you wish you could keep but can cut out if drastic measures are needed to keep you out of debt. Things like new clothes, a latte every morning and dinners out are little luxuries you may not be able to afford. If the total, added to your living expenses is higher than your income this is where you need to cut, in order to live comfortably and still have some money left at the end of the month.

, Consider how much money you have left in your budget to put aside to savings. Do the math for how much you save each year, with and without the unnecessary spending. For example, if you have a latte a day, you can save 20$ each month. If you only have one a week, you can save 50$ or more depending on where you live and what lattes cost.

, As soon as you get your income, set your savings aside, in an envelope or a savings account. Do not resort to this money for spending unless you have no choice. This means needing money for a new calculator because your died on you; fabulous new shoes don't count.

, Set money aside and pay them off. Search for ways to cut these expenses if possible like a cheaper texting plan or taking shorter baths. The internet is riddled with saving tips.

, Divide it by the number of week or days you must go without needing more. Say, if you have 100$ left and must live from them a month before you get more income, you have 25$ a week. Stick to that, no matter what. If by the end of the week you've only spent 20$, put the rest in a jar, separated from your savings.

, Like someone's birthday or needing a new notebook. When this jar reaches a reasonable amount (you decide), use some of the money to treat yourself, maybe to a fancy dinner or shopping for a new item you've been coveting. Treating yourself encourages further saving and prevents spending sprees. Also, you can add jar money to your saving when you have a nearly full jar.

, Keep the money with you (and only tap into in in an emergency) or putting it in the bank, earning interest in a savings account, separate from your checking account. In both situations, try to keep at least one (ideally three) month(s) expenses on you and only after that start saving for when college is over. A sudden emergency like a job loss or needing a new computer should not have to destroy your saving efforts.

, This will make it so you have more money to put in your jar at the end of the week. Instead of going out to dinner, have a potluck with your friends, or a movie marathon night. Ask some girl friends over and have a spa night much cheaper than actually going to the spa. The choices are endless to have fun without spending money

If you're unsure of your answers for any of the items they ask you about, ask your parents or check your records, rather than guessing. Answering incorrectly or incompletely may affect the aid you're awarded.

, For the education portion it is just asking where you went to school, and if your received a diploma. Shortly after, it will take you to the college link page.

Apply to your top schools in state first.,
Find out what financial aid options your top schools offer.,
Fill out the financial aid application at each school.,
Demonstrate financial need.,
Cast a wide net.",How to Get a Full Scholarship1," There are two major ways to get a big scholarship to attend school as an undergraduate: winning a scholarship from the school itself, or winning a private or federal scholarship that can be used at any school. Both varieties of scholarship are typically given for a combination of demonstrable financial need and excellence in achievement. To start narrowing it down, think about nearby schools that will value in-state applicants.


Typically, but not in all cases, state schools offer more full scholarships to in-state applicants with fewer criteria that need checked off to apply. In other words, the only criteria to apply needs to be that you're a resident of the state in which you're applying, in many cases. Because the rent covered by the full scholarship is a lesser amount, more of these scholarships are sometimes offered. Smaller, more expensive private schools out of state typically offer the fewest scholarship options.
Getting a big scholarship will have more to do with how well the application board thinks you'll fit in with their mission for the university, meaning that you'll stand a better chance of big scholarships at schools where you think you'll fit in.;
, The scholarship opportunities and financial aid packages that each school offers will vary based on a number of factors, including the school's endowment, the enrollment numbers in a given year, and their focus on attracting specific varieties of students. Each school will offer a limited number of scholarships to students based on merit and other factors.


Typically, you can learn everything you'll need to know on the website of the university to which you're applying by clicking on ""Financial Aid"" and selecting ""Scholarships."" Most schools will separate the scholarships available to in-state, out-of-state, and international students, so you can find the scholarships available to you.

, To apply for scholarships at a university, you don't need to apply for individual scholarships separately, but you do need to mark on your financial aid application that you'd like to be considered. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the universal template for applying for aid in the United States, and it's typically due around the same time as the general admission application, and will come with a variety of other supplementary materials to determine what financial aid to offer you. This includes loans, scholarships, and grants, including the Pell Grant.To start the process, you'll usually need to register on the FAFSA website and receive a PIN number to get started entering your information. You can access FAFSA here.
After starting an account, you'll need to fill out your financial information regarding income, savings, investments, and other holdings, or provide this basic information about your parents if you're applying to college as a dependent. The application process will help you determine whether or not you're a dependent.

, Full scholarships are primarily offered to in-state applicants who wouldn't be able to pay for college otherwise, with some being offered to exceptional students and athletes variously, depending on the institution. On your FAFSA application, then, it's important that you demonstrate a lack of the essential funds and holdings that would make you able to pay for your education otherwise, and for your application to be as strong as possible in demonstrating your potential to succeed at the school you choose.


For most students, applying for FAFSA as a dependent means that you won't qualify for any full scholarships offered by the university that are offered on a need basis. If you're up in the air about how to apply, it might be smarter to apply as an emancipated or an independent student.

, You should be applying to a variety of schools, the financial aid packages at each, and looking for private and federal ways to pay for your schooling on top of university scholarships. For the most part, paying for college is like a patchwork, you'll be accounting for it from a variety of different places, meaning that you'll want to give yourself the most possible options.

Find your tax table.",How to Calculate Taxes on Scholarships and Grants," Your scholarships and grants may be tax free if you attend an eligible educational institution. The IRS defines an eligible institution as one whose primary function is to present formal instruction. It must have a regular curriculum and faculty along with a regular student body enrolled in the school.The school can be a primary or secondary school, or a college or university.
The school must also be accredited by a national accreditation agency. If you are unsure, then stop into your Financial Aid or Bursar’s Office and ask.
You must also be a degree candidate at this school, though you can be part-time or full-time.;
, If your qualified educational expenses exceed your scholarship and grant money, then you will pay no taxes. It doesn’t matter if you actually used other money (such as employment income) to pay these expenses. Qualified educational expenses include the following:tuition
required fees
required books, supplies, and equipment

, For example, your total qualified educational expenses might total $40,000 in tuition and required fees. If your total scholarships and grants are less than this amount, then the entire amount is tax-free.


However, your scholarships and grants might exceed the total amount of your qualified educational expenses. For example, your expenses could total $25,000. If your scholarships and grants add up to $30,000, then $5,000 is taxable.

, Remember to hold onto all receipts and bills, so that you have proof of the amount of your qualified educational expenses.Put all of these documents into a folder and preserve the information for tax time.

, Some scholarships and grants are taxable, even if they are not in excess of your total qualified educational expenses. For example, a health insurance grant is taxable.


Look for scholarships and grants that are earmarked for expenses other than tuitions, fees, and books/equipment. This money is generally taxable.For example, a grant earmarked for room and board is taxable much like the health insurance grant. Neither health insurance nor room/board are qualified educational expenses, so money received to pay for them is taxable.
Grants and scholarships that are payments for teaching, research, or other services are also generally taxable. However, exceptions are made if you receive the money under the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program or the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship and Financial Assistance Program., You should use IRS tax forms to make the process of estimating your taxes easier. You can find forms to print off at the IRS website. Choose the right form, based on the following:You can typically use Form 1040EZ if your taxable income is less than $100,000 and you are filing single or married filing jointly. You can’t itemize deductions on this form.
You can use Form 1040A if your income is less than $100,000 and you aren’t itemizing deductions.
All others must use Form 1040.

, The amount of taxes you pay will depend on how much income you have earned in a year. Your taxable scholarship/grant money will be considered income. However, you need to add up all other sources of income, such as the following:wages
salaries
bonuses
tips
child support
alimony payments
unemployment and disability payments

, When filling out your taxes, you must report all taxable income on a certain line. Remember to add your excess scholarship/grant money to your taxable income. You should write your income on the following line depending on which form you use:Form 1040EZ, Line 1
Form 1040A, Line 7
Form 1040, Line 7

, Each taxpayer can claim an exemption amount of $4,050 for themselves. You can also claim an exemption for your spouse and each dependent you are claiming. In 2016, the exemption amount is $4,050 per person. However, you can’t claim an exemption if someone else claims you as a dependent.For example, if your parents claim you on their tax return, then you can’t take an exemption.


If your income is less than the exemption amount, then you won’t pay taxes. For example, your total income might be $2,000. If you claim $4,050 as an exemption, you owe no taxes.
However, your income might exceed the exemption amount. In this situation, subtract the exemption.

, You can choose to itemize your tax deductions. However, most taxpayers will choose the standard deduction. In 2016, the standard deduction is $6,300 for a single person, $9,300 for a head of household, and $12,600 for married filing jointly.Subtract the standard deduction from your income.
As you can see, your exemption plus standard deduction means that a single person can have $10,350 in income before having to pay taxes. This means your scholarship or grant would have to exceed your qualified educational expenses by $10,350 before you pay any taxes on it (unless you have other income).
Most people who pay taxes on their scholarship probably also have other sources of income they are reporting.

, Once you have calculated all of your deductions, you will be left with a total taxable amount of income. You should find your tax table, which will depend on whether you are filing as a single person, married filing jointly, or as a head of household. The tax table for single people is as follows:10% tax on $0-9,275
15% tax on $9,276-37,650
25% tax on $37,651-91,150
28% tax on $91,151-190,150
33% tax on $190,151-413,350
35% tax on 413,351-415,050
39.6% tax on income over $415,051

Take the pre-SAT to qualify for National Merit Scholarships.",How to Get a Full Scholarship2," Established by Bill and Melinda Gates, this scholarship offers a certain number of students of African-American, Asian and Pacific Islander-American, Hispanic-American, and American Indian descent full scholarships to the school of their choice. To apply, you must be recommended by a teacher and fill out an application here. You'll need to do this after having applied to and been accepted to a school, as well as applying for the FAFSA.


Ron Brown Scholars are available specifically to students of African-American decent, between 10 and 20 each application year. This foundation provides $10,000 scholarships on a renewable basis, meaning that the total scholarship can be worth up to $40,000 dollars over the course of a four-year degree.

, By completing a project in science, technology, mathematics, music, literature, philosophy, or a miscellaneous category called ""Outside the Box,"" students under the age of 18 can qualify for a scholarship anywhere between $10,000 as a Davidson Fellow and $50,000 dollars as a Davidson Fellow Laureate for use at the school of their choice. You can apply here.

, If you've demonstrated serious advanced abilities in science and technology, the Siemens Corporation holds a yearly competition in which science, mathematics, and technology students may compete for scholarships up to $100,000 for the national finalists. You need to register your project online in May, and the project will be typically due at the end of September. You can register your project here.


The Intel Science Talent Search is another science and technology competition to which you can apply for your same research materials. To apply, you'll need to answer some essay questions, provide a recommendation from a teacher, as well as a transcript.Then you'll fill out the application online and upload your research reports and other materials.
Many of the same students are finalists for both of these competitions, making them an excellent resource for students with an excellent mind for research and an interest in science.

, This is the easiest scholarship to apply for outside of the university. By signing up for and scoring highly on the pre-SAT, you'll automatically be considered for a National Merit Scholarship, which are awarded to students who demonstrate excellence.

Maintain an exceptionally high grade-point average.,
Get involved in lots of extracurricular activities.,
Write an excellent personal statement.,
Highlight your disadvantages.",How to Get a Full Scholarship3," To qualify for a full scholarship, whether you're applying for money from private foundations or applying to university scholarships, you need to demonstrate your excellence first by maintaining good grades. Most scholarships have a cut-off somewhere around 3.3 or 3.5 GPA, but you'll probably need more like a 4.0 to really stand out. Focus on keeping your grades very high.

, When considering scholarship applicants, boards are looking specifically for well-rounded students with dynamic presences and personalities. In addition to academics, joining an extracurricular organization can help to demonstrate that you're a serious and dedicated student.


Formal organizations such as Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) or Future Farmers of America (FFA) will demonstrate your commitment to a particular field, while also offering networking privileges and insider info on securing scholarships and applying.
Take small steps by joining clubs and school organizations early on in your high school career and becoming a president or officer by the end of your time in high school. Being a part of athletics, bands, and other types of extra curricular activities can be an excellent way of standing out.

, Well before your scholarship applications and college applications are due, you should start crafting a personal statement that you can use to apply for colleges, and tailor to specific scholarships as needed. The personal statement should introduce you to the organization by articulating your interests, your goals, and your personality. Many people use the personal statement to describe an obstacle overcome or a challenge met.


Don't use your personal statement to list things that can be easily found on your resume. Instead, use the personal statement to highlight your goals and your personal connection to those achievements and events. Where do you want to go from here? The personal statement should address that question primarily.
Revise your personal statement every time you submit it. You shouldn't use a single blanket statement that you send everywhere, instead choosing to do a little bit of digging and make your personal statement specific to the institution to which you're applying. How does your mission fit in with this school? With this scholarship organization?
Personal statements aren't the best time to start experimenting with form. You don't need to write an experimental meta-short-story full of $20 vocab words to try to trick the admissions board into thinking they've got a genius on their hands. Write with concision. Use the thesaurus sparingly.

, So you didn't go to a prestigious prep school. So you didn't enjoy reading in school when you were younger. So your parents haven't been to college. These aren't things to hide on your application, these are things to highlight. Scholarships are most often awarded to students who've faced an uphill battle, not students who've been handed a silver spoon. Don't worry about whether or not your application will look prestigious, make it true to you and your experience.

Keep looking until the last minute.",How to Get a Full Scholarship4," ROTC stands for Reserved Officers' Training Corps. The Navy, Air Force, and the Army all have programs in place at a variety of universities to train commissioned officers who will serve actively following graduation, in exchange for money toward college. Full and partial scholarships are available through ROTC programs. To join, sign up for the ROTC Basic Course in school, or you can take it before school starts in the summer. Your success in this course will qualify you for ROTC. In some high schools, you can join Junior ROTC to help prepare you and give you a better chance of being accepted into the program. Research the options available at your school if you think this option might be right for you.
The Coast Guard offers a similar training program called CSPI. Offered at fewer schools (primarily coastal universities), this can be another good option for qualified candidates., If you're a very talented athlete, lots of teams offer free tuition in exchange for committing your talents to the team. If you're a talented athlete, get in touch with the coaches at schools you're interested in and see if you can get in for a workout or a tryout to get a sense of your chances.Many different schools and sports offer scholarships to players, starting in the junior and senior year of high school. You may start getting interest from schools who'll be in touch and scouting you as a potential player. If you haven't been in touch with any interested schools by the time of your senior year, though, you probably need to make other plans.
It's important to understand that most full-ride scholarships are reserved for sports that bring lots of revenue into the school, mostly men's football and basketball. Other sports do offer scholarships, some substantial, but many fewer full scholarships. If you're a softball player, for example, going to school for free may be difficult.

, If you're already a college student studying computer-science, Microsoft University offers free tuition to students looking to transfer and get trained in a slightly different, more innovative way. This can be an excellent but competitive way of getting trained, and all but guarantees you a high-paying job on the other side of your degree., If scholarship opportunities don't pan out, you'll need to pay for as much of tuition as you can by exhausting your federal loan options. These offer competitive interest rates, compared to private loans, and are easy to defer until after college. It's in your incentive to pay them off quickly to avoid accruing extra interest, but it's also easy to win deferments in the short term while you complete your degree and post-graduate degrees and seek gainful employment.

, Federal loans often won't cover the whole package, which can put some student families in a tight spot, making private loans a necessary supplement. Fortunately, you can often work to consolidate these loans after college, and defer the payments until you're finished with school. If you've got no way to pay for school otherwise, these are reliable and readily available options for students in need.


You may have to get your parents to help cosign for these loans, unless you have a credit history that's significant, depending on the lending institution. Sallie Mae, in particular, caters to students, helping to take out loans to help pay for college.

, Much like a 401k, a 529 savings plan allows you to invest a certain amount of money with a financial advisor, attempting to make school money with mutual funds. Each state handles 529 plans differently, but nearly every state has a plan in place to allow students to save tax-free money for college., Work study programs are available that allow you to work on campus in some capacity, in exchange for a break on tuition, or pay that you can then put toward tuition. Work-study will be a part of financial aid that you'll qualify for if you can demonstrate need, but you'll still need to find campus jobs and apply for them to get this variety of aid.


If you don't qualify for financial aid, get an off-campus job to make money and put it toward your tuition payments, as much as possible on top of loans.

, Don't stop looking for scholarship opportunities and seeking out different options when you get in campus. Most students will have already enrolled and started classes before becoming aware of different university-specific funding options and scholarships available. Talk to a financial advisor in the registrar's office at your school to stay updated on new scholarships and options for paying for school. Don't give up."

Plan carefully what career field you want to be trained in and start looking at colleges early.,
Consider less expensive colleges.,
Plan to work while you're in college.",How to Avoid Debt as a College Student1," Save $100-200 dollars per month from the age of 14 on. This adds up to $4,800-9,600 by the time you turn 18. If you're already in college, choose a bank with ATMs on or near campus so you don't have to pay extra fees withdrawing money from another bank's ATMs.;
, Use mobile banking or an app to help to prevent costly overdraft fees.

,, Saving now (when you have 10 to 15 years of possible earnings on your investments) means you can have more to spend when you're in college.

, Take both the ACT/SAT, and use the highest score to your college application. Higher GPAs and ACT/SAT scores are typically eligible for more scholarships then lower performing students.

, One of the best ways to save money while paying for college is to find an inexpensive community college to begin your studies. You can transfer to another school (or schools) after the first two years when the general education part of your degree is completed. This can save you thousands of dollars in tuition each year. The average cost of a community college per year is $2,272 compared with $5,836 for a four-year college, according to the American Association of Community Colleges.

, Remember, in-state schools are usually less expensive than out-of state; public schools are less expensive than private schools. Compare total cost (tuition and housing) to financial aid packages before choosing.


Consider going to community college. Take general courses and transfer those credits to a 4-year institution, saving you money and reducing student loan debt.
Consider taking summer classes at community college. Only do so if it cheaper to take the class at community college than it is to do so at your college. You may need a Letter of Good Standing from your college to do so. Also, make sure the summer course will transfer back to your main 4-year institution

, Working while in school has been shown to help with grades, as long as the hours worked don't exceed about 20 per week. Think about what part time work you enjoy doing and learn the skills now to do it. Typing, word processing, office skills, waiting tables, caring for children (in a babysitting or child care mode) all can help pay for expenses while you're in college.

First of all, you want to consider whether or not University is the right path for you.,
Next, take some time to consider which course or subject you would like to study.,
Now you want to think about WHICH university is best for you.,
Right, you have a list of Unis.,
Have a look at the University itself on the website.,
When you have narrowed your list down, write down the ones you have chosen.,
Order prospectuses and book open days for your chosen schools.,
Once you've visited the Universities you should have a feel for which one/s you like the most.",How to Find the Right University for You," It's much more expensive to go to Uni now than it was a few years ago after tuition fees rocketed up in price, so you need to be sure you are making the right decision. Discuss it with your parents, teachers or a career advisor to gain extra help with your choice. Plus, if you already know which career path you want to take, do some Internet research into the qualifications you will need. After all, you may find that your dream job does not require a degree.;
, Choose something you are passionate about. It does not have to be a specific decision right away - after all, with some Universities, you can study courses which you may never have even heard of before. For instance, if you love Science, think of that as your first branch. Once you begin to look at which University you want to go to, you are sure to find many courses related to the topic you are interested in within a certain field. E.g. within Science, you may find Biophysics courses, Biochemistry courses etc.

, The best way I have found from my experience is to consider your predicted grades for your exams or calculate your UCAS points (to do this, use the UCAS points tariff at: https://www.ucas.com/ucas/undergraduate/getting-started/entry-requirements/tariff/tariff-tables). The next best step is to check out University league tables. These tables will tell you where a University has ranked nationally with regard to a specific course or subject, the satisfaction rates of the students studying this course, and how many points you need to be accepted on that course. The best one used by most is The Guardian's University Guide at http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/series/university-guide-2013-subjects. When looking at this table, narrow it down by researching the Universities requiring roughly the same amount of UCAS points you are likely to achieve. For example, if you were applying to study Maths and was predicted to achieve 450 points, consider looking at Leeds, which requires 450 points, or Sheffield, 448 points. Other league tables or guides you could look at are The Times University Guide: (for which you will require login details) http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/gug/, and The Telegraph Uni Guide: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/

, Now have a look on their websites and the courses they offer you. Look at the course content. What will you be doing on your course? What will you need? How will you been examined? Does this course offer you any other opportunities, such as a work experience placement or a chance to study abroad for a year? Does this University offer you a more specific course which suits your interests which you might prefer to study? Make sure you really look, don't skim read. Write down some notes if you need to.

, What is the campus like? What is student life like at this Uni? What is the accommodation like? How much does accommodation cost?

, Jot down the course name, the entry requirements, the distance from home (if that's a factor in your decision), and when the open days are. Decorate it if you like and stick it on your wall. This will allow you to give your choices some thought, take your time and consider every aspect of your decision.

, This will make a huge difference in which path you choose to take. It's all very well if the University looks great on the website, but you need to actually see the place first just in case you find it isn't what you thought it would be. This will help you get a feel for the Uni, think about if you can imagine yourself being there, walking around the campus with your mates. Talk to the tutors, see what they're like and consider that they might be teaching you for the next few years. Ask questions and make notes while you're there if you want to.

, If not, that's perfectly fine! You still have time to make a decision, don't rush into anything because you feel like you have to. A suggestion would be to make a list of pro's and con's if this helps you in your decision.

If living on-campus, pick a housing option you can afford.",How to Avoid Debt as a College Student3," While in college try to eat inexpensively and not eat out too much. Remember that fast food restaurants are not cheaper than the grocery store and look after your health by eating well.

, Most colleges require those who live on campus to buy a meal plan. Use to-go boxes to take food from dining halls to eat later, especially if it can be stored easily.

, Keep them simple. A potluck with friends can be just as fun or more fun than eating at a noisy, crowded restaurant.

, By doing so, you avoid having to pay for gas, maintenance, or parking. Plus, not bring a car keeps you closer to campus. Instead, use cheaper modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transportation. This is easier to do in more urban cities

, Used or rental books are cheaper than new. Compare prices those from Chegg, Amazon, and your school bookstore. Or, you can buy or share books with a friend. Sell back used textbooks after you are done with them.

, Try to pick apartments that include appliances. Unlike on-campus dorms, off-campus housing are usually cheaper (depending on the city) and don't require you to buy a meal plan. Just make sure that you don't live too far from campus and factor in grocery cost

, Stock up on storable ""dorm food"" that don't require appliances such as cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, granola bars,Ramen noodles, crackers, peanut butter or hazelnut spread. Save even more money by taking some food, drinks, or condiments to-go from dining halls.

, Check your university's housing options and rates. Doubles-rooms are usually cheaper than single or suite-style, but also means less room and privacy. Weigh pros and cons before choosing.

This may be a great opportunity to not only make money, but to gain valuable experience and earn a recommendation for future study or employment.

, Universities are always raising money, especially by contacting alumni. Most universities will have a call center staffed with current students. Your job would be to dial up former students and ask for donations. While this work may sound tedious, picking up a few occasional shifts can help pad your wallet. Contact your school's call center to ask about employment opportunities, or apply directly if you see a flyer or other posting for a call center job.

, Art classes need living, breathing models for students to draw and sculpt. If you are comfortable being partly or fully nude in a room full of art students, for hours at a time, this could be the job for you. You could try to ask the art department at your school whether they need models for classes; alternatively, you could find a local art studio and inquire there about modeling opportunities.

Also, pay attention to a school's preferences regarding online or print applications. While most schools prefer information be turned in online, some schools may still prefer paper applications or want certain parts of the application printed. You want to make sure you're following basic directions correctly before beginning an application., To start, the application will ask for basic contact information. While this is the easiest section to fill out, go slowly. You want to make sure you write everything down accurately.


Include your full name, as written on your birth certificate. Nicknames should not be used. For example, if your name is Angelica but you go by ""Angie,"" write Angelica in the name section.Include a phone number and e-mail address if you have one.

Sports, clubs, the arts, formal organizations, and volunteer work are all good extracurriculars to include. Try to list anything you've done in your academic career. You do not have to limit your list to school-based extracurriculars. If you took piano lessons for 8 years from a private tutor, this is worth mentioning.Part time or summer jobs can also help, especially if they were more professional in nature. An internship is definitely worth mentioning on a college application.Achievements are also important. List any semesters you made the honor roll. If you've won or placed in any contests, write that down here. If you set any records on a sports team, mention it., Some college applications have a series of questions you have to answer. For example, you may be asked to provide an explanation of some of your achievements. You may be asked about academic goals or scholarly interests. Spend some time answering these questions to the best of your abilities.


Go for action verbs and detailed descriptions. For example, if an applications wants you to explain an achievement, don't just write, ""I worked at a law firm for a summer."" Instead, say something like, ""I spent my summer vacation learning about the inside workings of the legal profession, assisting lawyers with research and organizing paperwork.""Use your words wisely if necessary.

Follow the essay prompts carefully.,
Write as your best self.,
Think of the audience.,
Revise.,
Proofread.",How to Fill out a College Application3," Many college applications have an essay question. The essay will respond to your choice of prompts provided by the application. Make sure you read and follow the prompts carefully to make sure you're addressing everything.


College essay prompts are usually designed to help you showcase your value as potential scholar. Prompts often ask you to talk about a difficult experience you've overcome or comment on something to do with current events or history.
Make sure you read the prompt carefully. You want to make sure you're writing to the prompt. A prompt might ask you to, say, compare and contrast your world outlook now as opposed to when you were in kindergarten. You might write a wonderful, insightful essay describing your current world outlook, but if you neglect to compare your current self to your former self you're not addressing the prompt. College applications boards will notice if you fail to follow directions.You should also follow the most basic directions when answering essay questions. For example, don't write a 1,000 word essay if the prompt asks for a 1,000 character essay., College admissions boards see thousands of essay each year. If you want your essay to stand out, you'll need to focus on highlighting your best self. Spend some time working on your essay. Take it as an opportunity to showcase the best version of yourself.


Before you start writing, consider what you want an admissions board to know about you. What do you consider your best qualities? What unique talents and perspectives would you bring to this college or university? How can you fit these attributes into the essay prompt provided?If you're struggling to start, ask your friends and family members to make a list of your most noticeable qualities. This can help you get a sense of what you should brag about in the application essay.Try to use your own voice in a slightly elevated style. You should strive to write high quality prose in a college application essay, but you do not need to write an academic paper. Try to keep your own voice, sense of humor, and sense of self preserved in your writing. Include references to things your'e interested in, for example, and speak in terms you understand., Consider your audience while you're writing the essay. If you ever feel lost during the process, pause and consider the college admission board. They are looking for students who will contribute to the academic community. However, they also read many, many application essays each year in which students may often say the same things. Therefore, strive to talk yourself up but also be a little bit different from the bunch. If you've had a unique experience, talk about it. If you have a heavy amount of knowledge of art, history, or literature, throw in some impressive allusions or references. Anything you can do to set yourself apart is good when it comes to the application essay., When you finish your application essay, revise it. You should never turn in the first draft of such an important aspect of your application. Comb through the essay once more, looking for where you can improve.


Add illustrative details when possible. It's always better to go deeper and look for concrete examples that exemplify your personality and talents. If, in your first draft, you mention that you've always had a curious mind, try to elaborate on this in your second draft. Is there an anecdote you could share? Maybe when you were 6 years-old, your parents found you trying to read the dictionary cover to cover and you explained you wanted to learn every word in the English language.Watch your writing style as well. While you want to convey your voice, slang and teen speak should be avoided in an application essay. You want to write in a style that conveys a certain sophistication and scholarly achievement.Make sure all your ideas flow together smoothly. If you move to a new idea, make sure you add some kind of transition. A small sentence or thought should lead your reader between one idea and the next.
Don't be afraid to set the essay aside for a few days. Sometimes, a little brain space from a piece of writing gives you the necessary opportunity to reflect.

, You should always proofread your application essay several times. Your essay should be completely free of spelling and grammatical errors when you send it out. Do not rely solely on spellcheck software. Print your essay out and reread it. You should also ask a few friends and family members to read over the essay for you. A second pair of eyes can help you catch common mistakes like typos and missing words.

If you are applying through a school, college, careers centre or any other organisation, make sure you know the buzzword. This will have been set up by your school or college, and you need to enter it when you're asked for it, to associate you with your place of study. This is very important when they come to write your reference and it allows your school or college to check your application before you send it off to the universities. They can't change anything on your application, however, so you don't need to worry about sabotage!
If you're not going to a school or college, you can apply to UCAS as an individual. This means you don't need a buzzword.

, When you've completed the form, you should receive an email with a verification link in it. Click on this to finish the process.

, You will be greeted with a welcome page. Make sure you really do write down the Personal ID and keep it in a safe place - it will be very important if you ever have to ring customer services (it happens more often than you might think!)

,


Most of these details are very straightforward, however, one that often causes confusion is Student Support. Most people should select 02 UK, ChI, loM or EU student finance services - this is if you are planning to take out a student loan to pay for your tuition fees. If you select this option, you will have to fill in an additional field to tell UCAS which area your finance arrangements will come from (most likely the place in which you are currently living).
In the Nominated access section, fill in the details of someone you want to be in charge of your university application if you can't be contacted. This could be your parents, although if you are planning to go on holiday during the time in which you will be making decisions on university, make sure it is somebody who will still be at home.

, Again, this is relatively straightforward.

, If you will be applying through Student Finance England, you will probably want to answer ""yes"" to all of the questions for convenience.

, You can enter up to 5 choices. To do this, go to the Choices section and click on Add a Choice near the top of the page.


To choose your university, click on the see list button to the right of the Institution code box. It's a good idea to always use the see list button where it's available to make sure you enter the correct code.
When it comes to entering your start date, you will probably have the choice of two September start dates: the second one should only be selected if you want to defer your application (take a gap year).
Most people should leave the Point of entry box blank. If you plan to start in the second year of the course for example, consult with the university you're applying to for what to put in this box.
On clicking submit, for some courses such as medicine, you will be asked if you have any criminal convictions. There is plenty of information available on this step, and so it should be fairly self-explanatory.

, This is by far the most complicated of the steps. These tips apply mainly for those taking A Levels.


Find out your GCSE certificates and AS Level results slips. It's best to enter your results directly from these, so that you know you're selecting the right course and grade.
Start by entering your schools and colleges. Go to Add new school/college/centre and enter the relevant details. Make sure you enter the correct finish date, as the form won't allow you to add A Level results that are certified after the date you leave the centre. You can find your centre number at the top of results slips, if you haven't already got it memorized from the countless times you've had to write it at the top of exam papers!
Now enter your GCSEs. Go to Add qualifications and have a look at the list of different qualifications you can add. This list is edited by your school/college, so it should reflect the qualifications you are most likely to have. However, if you can't see your qualification on the list, click on the Other qualifications type option and search for it. The information you need to fill in should be easy enough to find on your certificates.
Add your AS levels. You should already have your results slip, so it's simply a matter of transferring the information again. You can also add unit grades.
Add your A levels. If you don't have the results for these yet, simply select Pending in the grade box. Do this for all the units you are going to take too.
Most people should probably select Below honours degree level qualifications in the box at the bottom of the Education section. Obviously, people who already have a degree should choose another option.

, This section is for paid employment only - voluntary work experience you've done should be written into your personal statement. The information required if you have any paid work experience is fairly self-explanatory.

, This is a big job: see How to Write a Personal Statement for UCAS. It has to be within the limit of 4000 characters (letters and spaces) or 47 lines, whichever is shortest.


It's best to write your statement in a word processor before copying and pasting it into UCAS, because the form doesn't have a spell checker. Keep in mind that the word-processing programs tend to underestimate both the character and line counts, so you may find that it doesn't fit when you paste it in.
Before you click Save, make sure that you read your statement over. If it's slightly too long, UCAS will cut off the last bit to make it fit the character requirements.

, Make sure you double check all of the information you've entered, then select the tick-box at the bottom of each section, before clicking Save.

, This is your last chance to review everything. When you're done, mark it as complete.

, You will have to agree to a few conditions once again, and then it's simply a matter of entering your card details. The cost of submitting your application depends on how many universities you are applying to: for 2013 applications, the fee is £23 for most people or £12 if you're only applying to one university. , Applying to university really is a waiting game. Universities will reply with offers if they want to accept you over a period of time. Good luck, and try not to be too nervous!

Do your research.,
Look at lots of schools.,
Consider the location.,
Find out about facilities and available resources.,
Meet with instructors.,
Consult with trusted individuals.,
Be realistic.,
Apply to more than one school.",How to Choose a College1," Don't just choose a school primarily because someone said it was a good school. Generally research every school you wish to attend. Research in general to find different schools to apply to. You can look online or use guidebooks, published by a number of foundations, talking about the relative merits of different schools. Remember to take everything with a grain of salt, however. Many of the rankings lists, for example, require schools to pay a fee to even appear on the list.;
, Don’t just look at one or two schools. Look at several in-state, out of state, and maybe even a few international schools. It is important to have lots of options and to know what is available to you. Applying to only one or two schools isn’t a very good idea, as it can be difficult to get into many schools and you may not be accepted.

, Consider where you would like to go to school. This is a place you will be living for anywhere from 2 to 10 years! It is important to choose a location which you will be happy with. This may be a big city, or a small college town. It might be close to where you grew up or it might be in another country.

, You will want to decide what kind of facilities and resources are important to you. Some schools provide health plans, different schools have different meal options, different housing options will be available, some schools will have gyms, some might have hospitals, special library facilities, theaters, or any number of other facilities.

, With the programs you consider, talk to the head of the depart which you plan on studying with. They might connect you with other professors who can tell you more about the program. This will allow you to see if these seem like people you would enjoy learning from. It will also help you get a better view of the kinds of things you will be studying. You can ask for a course catalog or you may even be able to request to sit in on a class, if the school is nearby or you will be visiting during the correct time of year.

, Talk about your options with friends, family and high school or college career counselors. Take the word of particular college employees with a grain of salt. The admissions office is their sales office. Get the advice of multiple people and try to get advice from those who do not have a bias.

, Understand that some schools are extremely difficult to get into and, though it may be your dream to attend, you might not be able to get in. You can have excellent grades, a wonderful essay, and a list of recommendations a mile long: sometimes it just cannot be. Don’t panic. Your life isn’t over. You can always apply to less competitive schools and transfer to more prestigious programs after a year or two.

, Most experts recommend 4, at least one being in-state. This way, you can have more options to choose from if something happens (ex: not getting enough aid, getting rejected or wait listed, changing your mind, etc)

"
"
Consider what you want to study.,
Research the best schools for that career.,
Ask people who are prominent in your chosen field.,
Consider the school’s location.",How to Choose a College2," This is the most difficult part. This is essentially deciding what you want to do with your life. You can always change your mind, of course, but you will want to try to choose a school which offers degrees in a field you would like to study. Not all universities or colleges offer all degrees. You can choose something you’ve always wanted to do or you can choose a big school with a variety of good programs if you are really unsure.

, If you know what general career path you want to follow, try to research and get into a school which is well-known for programs in that field. This will make you a better candidate for future jobs and also ensure that you are getting the best education in what you want to do.

, If you know what you want to do, ask either the manager at a place you would aspire to work for or someone with a great amount of experience in your chosen field. They should be able to tell you good schools or programs to get the jobs you want, as well as provide you with general advice for preparing yourself for that career path.

, The school’s location will also be important to your education goals. If you are wanting to be in a program which would benefit from internships, such as a business major or a medicine program, you will want the school to be in a location which will offer you good real-world experiences.


Business majors, for example, will benefit from choosing schools in big cities, where they can easily set up internships or introduce themselves into environments in which they can get jobs after graduation.
Medical students will want to be near major hospitals (a variety if possible, to experience different specialties).

"
"
Consider the school’s reputation.,
Consider the school’s cost.,
Consider your future income potential.,
Make sure the college or program is accredited.",How to Choose a College3," Consider the school’s overall reputation. If you’re going into a competitive field, you will want to go to a well-known school. If you have less ambitious goals, a small college may make more sense.

, You will need to take a hard look at the money you have available to you (via family, scholarships, grants, and loans) versus how much the school costs. Even with loans, more expensive schools may be out of the question.

, You should balance the cost of the school against your future income potential. If you choose a very expensive school and are paying mostly through loans, it may not be a very good idea to plan on becoming a professional artist (for example), as your future income will likely be minimal and sporadic.

, For example, business and accounting schools are accredited by the AACSB. Pharmacy schools use AACP. A college lacking accreditation may hurt your employability, chances of getting into graduate school, in addition to possibly having to take courses over if you decide to switch from an unaccredited school to an accredited one.

"
"
Look at the size and type of school.,
Decide if you want a Greek system.,
Find like-minded people.,
Research clubs and campus activities.,
Look into the school’s sports.",How to Choose a College4," Do you want a public university or a private college? A big school that is practically a city in itself or one which is very small? These things will determine the general feel of the environment, as well as the amount of help from professors is available to you. Some people may prefer smaller schools, some larger schools.

, For some people, the ability to participate in the Greek system (fraternities and sororities) is very important. Many schools do not have a Greek system, so look into that when deciding where to go.

, Ensure that the school and student population are similar to you and that you will fit in there. You won’t want to go to a school where you cannot feel included and welcome. However, it isn’t the worst idea to put yourself in a slightly different environment than normal (such as a public school if you have always gone to Christian schools). College is intended to challenge your views and help you expand your understanding of the world, something which is difficult to do if everyone around you agrees with everything you believe.

, Look into what clubs and activities are available at the schools you are considering. This will help you find out if there is potential for you to do the things you want to do and meet new friends with whom you have things in common. Examples of available social clubs and activities include anime clubs, dance clubs (where you can learn a variety of dance styles, often for free), film clubs, and sports clubs.

, If sports is important to you or plays a role in how you intend to finance your education, you will need to account for this. Find schools which offer sports scholarships and talk to them about what they’re looking for and how you can get on their teams. You may also just wish to play regular sports, in which case you will want to examine the available classes and clubs.

Research the program's academic ranking.,
Read about what current and former students think.,
Assess the expertise and experience of the faculty.,
Evaluate the school's teaching methodology.,
Look into the school's support network.,
Assess the learning opportunities at each program.,
Check each program graduate's average starting salary.,
Identify your career goals.,
Choose a type of program.,
Decide on a concentration.,
Think about the school's location.",How to Choose the Right MBA Program," One of the biggest factors in most students' graduate program evaluation is how each program ranks nationally. These rankings can give you a better idea of how a given program stacks up to other programs across the country, typically broken down into factors like graduation rate, internship opportunities, and cost of tuition.Start by talking to friends, colleagues, and professors to find out what type of reputation a given school's program has.
Read objective rankings online that compare programs across the country. You can find rankings through U.S. News and World Report, Business Week, The Wall Street Journal, and The Financial Times.
Find out more information about a program you're interested in by checking their website and contacting the appropriate representative/coordinator to ask for details.;
, A good way to get a feel for what it will be like attending a given program is to see what actual students like you think about the school. If you search online, you can generally find reviews written by students who are either currently attending or recently graduated from a given program.


Consider the quality of life for students at each school.Were students generally happy, and did the school deliver on its educational/training promises?
You can find reviews of MBA programs and colleges in general by searching online for ""student reviews of MBA programs."" There are a number of websites where current and former students publish their experiences and opinions.

, Many students look at who will be teaching their classes, and business school is no exception. Look into the educational and professional experience of the various faculty members you would be working with at each program to see how much you're likely to learn from them.Most college websites have a page dedicated to faculty bios. These bios list each instructor's education and work experience, and should be the first place you check to find out about the faculty at a given school.
In addition to the faculty bios, you might be able to learn more about an instructor by searching for their name online. This should give you information about publications and prominent positions held by a given faculty member.
Faculty members should have sufficient educational training and significant working experience.
Be wary of working with instructors who have just graduated and/or have only worked in the business world for a year or two.

, Different schools have different methods of teaching. While there isn't necessarily any right or wrong option when it comes to teaching methodology, it's important to get a feel for whether you would do well in a given learning environment.Are you more of a hands-on, experiential learner? Or do you prefer a strong foundation in textual studies and analysis?
Consider whether work or internship experience is a required part of a program's curriculum. You can learn a great deal in the classroom, but you may also want some real-world work experience to graduate with.

, Graduate studies can be overwhelming for students. There are many stressors, both in and out of the classroom, that can make it difficult to get through alone. If you think you may need help at some point, it's worth knowing in advance what type of support network each school offers to students.Find out about any academic support opportunities, such as tutoring, that can help you manage your studies.
Ask about medical options on campus, including a doctor's/nurse's office and an on-campus therapist, if those options are important to you.

, Some schools leave their graduates better prepared for the workplace than others. Not all students take advantage of the learning opportunities available at each school, but if you intend to do so you should find out what options you would have in each program you're considering.In addition to the available courses, you should also consider the opportunities available for applied learning experiences (both internships and jobs).
Think about whether a given program focuses on local business or offers a global perspective on the business world.

, A high starting salary for recent graduates in a given program suggests that that program has done a good job preparing students for the business world. While business-related careers typically pay very well, a confirmed ranking of the salary most graduates start with will help you assess whether that school offers the training employers are looking for.You can usually find average starting salary information on a program's website or in a national ranking of programs.
Search online for this information. If you can't find it, contact someone from the program to ask about how much graduates typically start making.

, Rankings and student accounts will only tell you so much about actually attending a given program. The biggest thing to consider is whether that program would help you meet your own professional goals.What is your motivation for getting an MBA? What do you ultimately want to do with your degree?
Look into the careers and fields recent graduates work in, as well as how employable those fields are.
Think about your passions and interests. What were your favorite and least-favorite aspects of your previous jobs and internships?
Don't forget that you'll most likely be accruing significant debt while attending business school. Would you be making enough money after graduation to pay those loans back?

, There are several different options when it comes to the type of program you'd be attending. Which program you choose depends on your schedule and your relevant experience.The most common program formats include:


Full-time MBA - takes one to two years and is designed for students with over three years of professional experience.
Part-time MBA - takes over three years and is designed for students with some or no professional experience.
Online MBA - takes an average of two years and is designed for students with some or no professional experience.
Executive MBA - takes an average of two years and is designed for executives with significant professional experience (typically over eight years' worth).
Early Career MBA - takes over two years and is designed for students who recently completed their undergraduate studies.
Global MBA - takes one to two years and is designed for executives with significant managerial experience.

, Once you're in business school, you'll need to choose an area of concentration. However, unlike choosing an ordinary major, in business school you may be permitted (or even expected) to have multiple concentrations. Some schools encourage students to have three or even four concentrations.Some common concentrations include accounting, finance, business management, marketing, information technology, and even energy and the environment. Figure out your interests and goals, then choose a program that meets your needs.
Not all MBA programs will offer the same concentrations, so it's worth considering what you'd like to do with your degree before committing to a program.
Rehash your previous career choices and think about which job aspects and work environments you enjoyed the most. Your interests and preferences should help shape your concentration choices.
If you're still unsure about which concentration is for you, explore as many as you can. Network with other students and working professionals, and take as many diverse business courses as you can.Go see guest speakers and campus seminars, as these may help you realize where your interests and specialties lie.

, Location is an important factor to consider for any college decision. Location can mean the difference between a bustling urban campus, a small college town, and an isolated rural campus.While location can be an issue of comfort for many students, it can also affect what types of opportunities you have during and after attending a given program.


The location of a school may be a factor if you hope to stay close to home or remain within a given geographical region.
Think about the types of professional connections you might make in business school. Do you plan on staying where you attend school after graduation, and if so, what types of business-related opportunities are available there?You should also think about a given school's proximity to a regional financial market. For example, schools in Chicago, New York, and San Francisco are all conveniently located close to important regional markets."
"
Make sure that you start early enough.,
Decide if you want to do a distance learning course (such as Open University).,
Location, location, location.,
Decide if you would prefer to stay close to home, or to look further afield.,
Decide if you would like to be full-time or part-time.,
Narrow down your search by finding which universities offer your course.,
If you want to do a specific career, check that the course is accredited by the relevant organisation (for example the British Psychological Society) - their website should have a list of courses they accredit.,
Check that the grades required match with your ability level.,
Visit the university websites and read about your courses, the city/town and the social life.

,
Go to an Open Day at the universities you are interested in.,
If you are not able to attend Open Days (for example, if you are an international student), contact course coordinators and lecturers by phone or e-mail.,
Choose a university with good research and teaching reputation.,Speak to students who already study there or read an alternative guide

",How to Choose a University (UK)," Ideally you should start looking for a university about 18 months before commencement of the course and start applying about a year before commencement. British universities operate on first come, first served basis (more or less) and you do not want to be left out of your favourite course because you did not start looking early enough.;
, These are becoming increasingly popular as they require much less commitment.

, Would you prefer to live in a busy city neighbourhood or in a quiet town in the countryside? Apart from its impact on your lifestyle, location will have a huge impact on your cost of living. Cities are generally more expensive than towns, even when you live in university accommodation. London and the southeast are the most expensive. On the other hand, if you would like to have a part-time job while you study, a city will give you more work opportunities.

, Do you prefer to live close to your family and friends or are you the adventurous type?

, Working part-time while you study will help your finances, but it means that you will have less time for socialising or even studying.

, Use Search Engines in education-related websites to find which universities offer your preferred course.

, This can be very important when you are looking for a job after your graduation.

, If you have no qualifications, you can also research educational institutions that accept people with few or no qualifications (e.g. Ruskin College in Oxford, England).


Do you want a Russell Group University? (Oxford, Cambridge, Warwick, Liverpool, Nottingham, Imperial, Edinburgh etc.)

,, This is the only real way to make your mind up about a place. Remember that this is somewhere where you will spend 3 or 4 years of your life.

, Ask about assessments, modules, research interests and university life.

, Find relevant rankings about the University as well as the department you are interested in.

Have a background check performed.",How to Determine Eligibility for the 8(a) Business Development Program," In order to qualify for the Business Development Program, your business must be majority-owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.In particular, this means the following:The qualifying individuals own at least 51% of the business. SBA will check stock certificates and other documents to confirm.
The owners possess direct ownership. This means the firm isn’t owned by another firm or a trust (with a few exceptions).
The individuals own the business unconditionally. SBA will look at a variety of documents, including articles, bylaws, partnership agreements, and operating agreements.
The owner is entitled to receive distributions in equal share to their ownership, both annually and in the event stock is sold or the business dissolves.;
, Owners must also be citizens of the U.S., whether by birth or by naturalization.Check to make sure that your business satisfies this requirement.

, A disadvantaged majority owner must also control the business. Control is different than ownership. SBA wants to see one or more disadvantaged individuals who do the following:controls the board
acts as the highest officer
makes long-term business decisions
runs the day-to-day operations of the business
makes the most compensation
works full-time at the firm
possesses the experience or licenses that the firm relies on, or otherwise has authority over those who do

, Only small businesses qualify for the 8(a) Development Program.Accordingly, SBA will analyze whether you meet the criteria for a “small business,” which will be based on one of the following:The number of employees. You should use the Size Standards Tool available from SBA at https://www.sba.gov/tools/size-standards-tool.
The average of your business’s receipts over three years.

, SBA won’t let just any business participate in the 8(a) Development Program. Instead, your business must demonstrate potential for success.If your business has no revenue, then it will probably be ineligible.


SBA will probably want to see your business plan in order to judge the soundness of your business and its potential for success.
SBA will also want to see your business records for the past three years.

, A business may only participate in the SBA program once. Even if management changes completely, the business is ineligible if it has already been accepted once before.Also, a disadvantaged individual may only participate once as well.

, SBA declines applications from certain types of businesses. For example, SBA will decline the following types of businesses:nonprofits, except for community development corporations
brokers
businesses owned by another firm (unless the parent firm is owned by an Alaskan Native Corporation or Native Hawaiian Organization)
franchise, which will be analyzed on a case-by-case basis

, Members of certain ethnic groups have been subject to bias and hostility. Under the 8(a) Business Development Program, certain people are presumed disadvantaged when they belong to the following ethnic groups:Hispanic Americans
Black Americans
Asian Pacific Americans
Subcontinent Asian American
Native Americans

, SBA also performs a case-by-case assessment of whether you are socially disadvantaged even when you don’t fit into one of the “presumed disadvantaged” categories. You might qualify on an individual basis if you present evidence of the following:You have an objective distinguishing characteristic such as gender, race, physical handicap, ethnic origin, or other characteristic such as having experienced isolation from the social mainstream.
You have personal experience of chronic and significant social disadvantage within the U.S.
Your social disadvantage has negatively impacted your start in business or your advancement within it.

, It is not enough to be socially disadvantaged. To qualify for the 8(a) Business Development Program, you also must show economic disadvantage. SBA will look at the following:The fair market value of your assets, which cannot be more than $4 million.
All of your income from the prior three years, which cannot average more than $250,000.
Your net worth, which cannot exceed $250,000.
Whether you have transferred assets to a trust or an immediate family member.
Whether your retirement accounts are available.
Your business’s tax payments.

, If you are married, then SBA will also analyze your spouse’s financial situation as well. You should gather the same financial information for your spouse as you have for yourself., If you are unsure about whether you qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged, then you can contact an SBA office or a resource center for help. A map is available at the SBA website: https://www.sba.gov/tools/local-assistance.

, All principals in the business must meet the good character requirement. The following are principals for SBA purposes:anyone who owns more than 10% of the business
officers
members
partners
directors
other key employees

, SBA will look at a variety of information in order to determine whether you have the necessary good character. However, your firm will be rejected automatically if any of the following apply to a principal at the business:guilty pleas, indictments, convictions, judgments or settlements
current imprisonment or time on parole or probation
failure to pay money owed to the federal government, such as taxes

, If you aren’t automatically declined, then SBA must still analyze other factors in order to come to a decision. In particular, SBA will look at the following:whether it has information that you have engaged in criminal conduct
any violations of SBA regulations
whether you or your firm has been suspended or debarred
any false information you submitted during the application process or after you have been approved

, SBA will require that every principal of your business undergo a Federal Bureau of Investigation’s background check before approving you.If you are unsure of your criminal history, you might want to do your own background check, even it isn’t as thorough as an FBI check.

While it's a good idea to remain open to the possibility of changing majors, you may also want to have at least a rough idea of what general academic path you're interested in. That way you can compare programs and find one that meets your needs.


Choose something you're passionate about. You'll want a career that you enjoy working in for the rest of your life, so make sure you study something that's important to you.Consider how employable a given major might be. While any college major can help you land a job, some career fields are oversaturated or otherwise difficult to break into.
Some schools offer an academic major quiz online to help students figure out what field of study would be best for them.Some students, including medical, engineering, physical therapy, and nursing students, need to enter their field of study as quickly as possible.These students may need to choose a major early and stick with it.;
, If you know what subject you intend to major in, you may want to narrow your search to ensure that the colleges you apply to offer it. Check each school's website, as they will list all of their offered majors and minors online. You can also call or email someone from the admissions office to request more information on a given school's program.

, Colleges usually host an open house each year, but you can also visit the campus independently and request a tour. The advantage of going during an open house is that the faculty often make themselves available for questions and demonstrations, which can give you a better idea of what to expect if you enroll at that college.


Try to visit any college you're seriously considering. If you don't live near any of the colleges you'll be applying to, then focus on trying to visit your top two or three schools.

, If you're applying to graduate school, the faculty you work with will be extremely important.However, the experience and credentials of the faculty at a given school should be a consideration for every level of education, including undergraduate students. Most college websites offer an online directory of each professor within a given department, and their bio pages often detail each professor's educational background, professional experience, and other qualifications.


If a college's website doesn't offer information on the faculty you would be working with, reach out to the head of your desired department and ask that individual for more information on whom you would be working with.

, The U.S. Department of Education compiles information on colleges and their programs. You can request information and rankings based on the program or degree you're interested in, the location of the school, or the size of the college., As of 2013, the six-year national graduation rate for full-time undergraduate students in the United States was 59 percent. This means that 59 percent of full-time students graduated within six years. Many colleges have high graduation/completion rates, while many others have very low graduation/completion rates.Check the graduation/completion rates for each of the schools you're interested in. If a school does not advertise this information on their website, you can find it by looking at that school's national rankings online., Most state schools are subsidized with state taxes, and tax payers don't want to fund someone who's not a resident. Because of this, tuition for an in-state student is almost always cheaper than for an out-of-state student, which may be a consideration that affects your budget.When looking at the estimated tuition costs for a given school, make sure you check if there are tuition differences based on residency. If it's a state school, this will almost certainly be the case.
If you're dead set on a school but can't afford out-of-state tuition, you may be able to defer enrollment for one year and move there to establish residency.However, not everyone is willing to delay attendance by a year, and not all schools will let you defer without having to reapply.

, Tuition is the most expensive cost associated with attending college, but it's not the only cost. Additional costs can add up to thousands of dollars each year, or even each semester (depending on your program). Most colleges offer some type of cost-of-attendance calculator on their websites, usually under the financial aid department. Check to see what you'll be responsible for when all is said and done, should you attend a given program.In addition to tuition, many colleges charge campus fees, housing costs (if you'll be residing in a dorm), books and classroom supplies, and various miscellaneous expenses.
These additional expenses can add up very quickly, so take them into account as you examine the cost of attendance at each school.
Your financial aid may not cover expenses outside of tuition, so talk to someone in the financial aid office so you know what to expect.

, If you were accepted to a school, you should have received some type of financial aid information with your acceptance letter. Most schools offer some type of financial aid, though the amount and the form it takes may vary considerably.Look at how much of your financial needs are being met in relation to the cost of attendance.
A bigger award offer isn't always necessarily better if the tuition is significantly more expensive. You'll need to factor in the total cost of attendance and your estimated personal/family contributions to arrive at how much money you actually need in awards.
Don't just look at the amount being offered in your award. Calculate how much money you need by subtracting any savings you've set aside from the total cost of attendance, then subtract the award amount to arrive at your remaining balance.

, As you compare award offers, you should also look at how your financial needs are met by each school. Colleges and universities typically offer awards packages that consist of a scholarship, a grant, a work study option, or some combination of these.Grants and scholarships are essentially free money offered by the school. You will not have to return this money, and it is subtracted directly from your tuition costs.Work study programs are a form of financial aid that allows you to get money or a reduction in tuition in exchange for regularly-scheduled work on campus. Depending on the positions available, though, this could be a valuable training experience and resume booster.
Remember that loans are borrowed money. You will need to pay back that money with interest, and the interest rates can be quite high.

, While crimes on campus can certainly be a concern, you should also look at how safe the surrounding neighborhoods are. If you commute to school or leave campus for food/entertainment, you should know how safe the neighborhood is that you'll be passing through.


You can typically check campus crime statistics online.Many colleges even make this information public on their websites.
The U.S. Department of Education website allows you to search for a college campus by name or by location to find out crime statistics for that campus., Like most students approaching a college for the first time, you probably won't know very many (if any) people on campus. College campuses can be an exciting place to meet new and interesting people, and some campuses facilitate that more than others. Whether you're interested in Greek life, extracurricular clubs, political organizations, or intramural sports, the best way to get a feel for the peer environment at a given college is to visit the campus and see how people interact there.Are all incoming students placed in the same dorm or group of dorms? If so, this may help you meet other incoming students who don't know anyone yet.
How important is diversity to you? Diversity helps foster social development, promotes creative thinking, and prepares you to be a global citizen, and some colleges are more diverse than others.Are politics important to you? If so, you may want to find out whether a given campus is predominately liberal or conservative, as you may encounter on-campus activists at some point.
Ask about what places on campus students can gather and hang out. You may want to look into both outdoor spaces (like a quad) and indoor spaces (like recreation rooms, dining halls, etc.).
Find out what the average student age on campus is, both for incoming students and current students. If you're an older student returning to school, will you feel comfortable being in a dorm with younger students, or vice versa?

, Some colleges have a reputation as party schools while other campuses are considered very studious. Some make it easy to explore the surrounding communities and others are very isolated. If you attend a given college, you'll spend about nine months of the year on campus. You'll want to make sure that you're comfortable in that environment, both on and off campus.Moving to a drastically different environment (in terms of location, culture, climate, etc.) can be very jarring for some students and exciting for others. Do you prefer something familiar or unpredictable?
Decide whether you prefer living in a large metropolitan area, a smaller city/college town, or a rural campus that's far removed from city life. Each setting comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, so figure out what you like.Is public transportation important to you? If you own a car, would you have a hard time finding parking on campus or in the surrounding community?
Make sure there are fun things to do in the nearby town/city. If you're interested in museums, shopping, or concerts, you may have a hard time finding entertainment at a rural campus.

, Depending on where a campus is located, you may still be interested in knowing what's nearby. Some colleges are in remote locations, which means that you'll have to travel further to find restaurants, coffee shops, bars (if you're old enough to drink), or even grocery stores and gas stations.


Consider how important convenience and availability are to you.
While this shouldn't necessarily be the most important factor, it may be an important factor nonetheless.

, The ratio of students to faculty may be worth investigating for a given college. Large class sizes typically mean a high ratio, with some larger universities having a single instructor teaching an auditorium with hundreds of students. It's a factor worth considering, especially if you're more of a hands-on learner or anticipate the need to ask questions and talk to your professor after class.


A low student-to-faculty ratio usually suggests that the students get more individual attention.
Check the student-to-faculty ratio by program, not just by school. Some schools may have large student bodies in some fields of study and much smaller class sizes in other areas of study.

, Another factor to consider is academic advising. Some schools have you meet with an academic advisor during orientation to plan out your schedule, while other schools may leave all of that responsibility in your hands.Find out how and when you can meet with an academic advisor.
Ask whether there is any wait time for meeting with an advisor. If there is, find out how long it usually is.
If you won't have a chance to meet with an academic advisor before you have to enroll in classes, you'll need to decide whether you can handle that responsibility alone.

, If you're going to school in a remote area, you may not be able to easily get to a doctor's or therapist's office from campus. Many colleges offer these and other services on campus, but not all colleges have equal facilities. Some services may also be difficult to access at certain colleges, especially during busy times of the year like finals week.Most college campuses have a doctor's or nurse's office. If you worry about keeping on top of your health, it may be a good idea to confirm that these facilities exist and are easy to access.
It's fairly common for colleges to offer some type of counseling or mental health services. Even if you don't currently need this type of assistance, it may be important to know that it's available.
If a college doesn't list this information on their website, check the college's directory and find out more information from someone at student health services or a similar campus office.

Colleges usually have an orientation pack that lists clearly what you will need. For example: Bedding such as sheets, pillows, blankets, mattress protectors.


What is prohibited? Many schools do not allow ""hot pots"", toaster ovens, space heaters and the like. This, too, will likely be stated very clearly.
What do upperclassmen recommend? Orientation is a good time to ask people familiar with campus what may not be absolutely necessary, but recommended. If not, usually the first week is good too. This may include dorm-sized refrigerators, fans (especially in warmer climates), lamps, small microwaves, small area carpets, and so on.
With apartments, generally you will need to provide furniture. This includes beds, dressers, couches and things like TV sets. However, be sure to ask if there is any furniture that comes with the apartment. Occasionally an apartment may have some furniture--often because the last tenant left it behind. Sometimes if you ask the tenant that is leaving, (especially if for a faraway place) he or she may leave you something or for a high discount.
Be careful of ""Back to School"" advertising. Retail stores will try to convince you that you need items that may be completely unnecessary. For instance, you may not have any room for an over-sized beanbag chair in your small dorm.;
, A list of common items to get you thinking can be found below in the Things You'll Need section. Consider the fact that space will undoubtedly be limited. Apartment living may require more. Use your judgment and common sense. Put the list in order of importance.


Also consider how long you will be there. A person spending one semester at a special program will likely need less than someone spending a school year on campus.
Remember that less brought in, the easier to pack and move out. If you live on campus, you will have to move out all your things in 9 months. Too much stuff also can be problematic if you have to take a bus or airplane home. Also, college students tend to move frequently, so it makes sense to keep your household goods light.
Sometimes it makes sense to make a running list as you go. As you settle into a space, you tend to figure out what you need, what size, and so on. It can also help you trigger your memory when you go shopping, or at a garage sale, or whatnot.
Shopping are usually readily available. While some colleges are in remote places with hard-to-reach shopping centers, but most will have retail places to buy things you need. Usually not everything has to be bought immediately. Even if there are few stores available, on-line shopping can make many things available to purchase.

, Most of the items you will need to get through college or for your first apartment do not need to last more than a few years at best. While you should always try to choose items of decent quality, the furnishing of your first place will likely not be the best.


Feel free to purchase cheap plastic items, such as plastic drawers, foldable tables, futons, or even patio furniture, can be an inexpensive way to to fulfill your needs.
However, be careful not to go with really low-quality furniture. An old lumpy futon will likely hurt your back. A plastic drawer set that never really works properly and breaks before winter break is no bargain.
Do not get too fussy. The things you use during the college years tend to be used for a few years at best, and not tend to be as nice as what you may have during your career. You may be used to your parent's house, which they have accumulated over the years. But for now, you will be unlikely to have a matching bedroom set, or anything resembling fine furnishings.

, if they have any unused or unwanted items that you can use. You may be surprised how many people have attics and drawers full of unused items in need of a good home. You may be doing them a favor by taking it off their hands. Start asking over the summer so they can keep their eyes open and set things aside.


Be careful about taking items from the family home. You do not want to come off as a greedy scavenger. If your father is thinking of upgrading the television, that may be an opportunity to discuss taking the old one to your apartment. However, do not expect to be given things that are being used in the home.
Suggest that if loved ones party to celebrate your graduation, buy gifts to help you prepare for college. Large chain stores like Target and Bed Bath & Beyond offer registries.
Do not make lavish requests. It is one thing to ask for a dorm-sized refrigerator, but a plasma TV may seem greedy. By keeping it simple and reasonable, people will appreciate your plight and feel more inclined to help you out.
You must send thank you notes to everyone who gives you a gift. Be grateful.

, Many people toss things instead of trying to sell or donate. This is common especially when people move, on trash day, or the day of or after a yard sale. Of course, only get items that can be washed and sanitized--problems with mold, bed bugs, and basic cleanliness can be an issue.


For the best stuff travel to more affluent areas. People with extra money to spend often toss out new and like new items just because they have gone out of style.
Recycling centers, thrift shops, and other second hand stores in such regions are also excellent resources (see below).

, In many landfills, there is a separate building where people can drop off lightly used furniture and other house items, which is usually categorized as ""Too Good to Throw Out."" Spring cleaning for county residents can mean a new couch for your apartment or a computer station for the dorm at no cost to you except energy to load the stuff into your vehicle. Be sure to visit these places frequently, as a full shed one morning can be bone dry the next.

, Check on websites such as Craigslist.org or Freecycle. Very often people will post items which is free for the asking.


Be extremely careful of bedbugs. Unfortunately, infestations are becoming commonplace in items such as mattresses, easy chairs, and couches. Curbside items such as these should be approached with extreme caution.

, They are often affiliated with a charity. Not only can you get cheap goods, the money you spend goes towards helping the charity. Check back often as their supply changes daily to weekly. You can easily pick up pots, pans, bowls and utensils for $1 or less. Also watch for church sales. Many older church goers unload great items to be sold super cheap at these sales.

, These are a great place to buy mops, brooms, kitchen items, and cleansers. Also try to pick up your toilet brushes and toilet plungers here. Those are two items you do not want to get used.


Dollar stores are also great places to buy picture frames. Photographs make great, personal, and inexpensive decorations.
Dollar stores are also typically excellent for a wealth of household items such as whiteboards, notepads, calendars, oven mitts, soap dishes and more.

, Yard sales are often great resources for the thrifty young adult. These will almost always be on the weekend (especially Saturday) and tend to start early and wrap up around 3 p.m.


Ask the person running yard sale for items you are specifically looking for, as they may be hidden or he or she might suddenly remember there is one that can be sold.
If the items are too pricey or can be found cheaper elsewhere you should wait. Some people price garage sale items too high. If so, forgo the yard sale or try again in mid-afternoon when the prices may drop.
Another tip is to quietly speak with the yard sale host. Explain that you are going off to college and are trying to find certain items. Give them your number and tell them you would be happy to take items off their hands should they not sell by the end of the day. Most people would rather give them to a friendly, personable, needy student than set them on the curb or throw it out.

, Many people put their unused items into storage and sometimes they forget to pay the storage bill. Those items are put up for auction. You may be able to stock up for just a few bucks. Most people try to get their hands on the treasures at auctions so the basics can be picked up super cheap.

, Antique stores are not all fancy old items. Surprisingly, antique stores often sell items at a price lower than new furniture. Also, although the term is ""antique store"" these stores often happily sell what is actually vintage and sometimes not even that old. Frankly, they will sell whatever they think they may make a profit on, old and valuable or not! They often have many decorative items as well. You can often bargain with them to receive a discount.

, They often will offer used office furniture, lamps, tools, and the like at reasonable prices.

, Some colleges operate ""loan closets"" on an honor basis, where you can get stuff for free if you agree to return it (and bring more stuff) as soon as you do not need it anymore.


Sometimes access to loan closets is restricted to people with special needs: international students, students of a certain department or school, or those in particularly need (such as a student who comes from an extremely impoverished background.)
However, it never hurts to ask.

, Slipcovers are available at discount stores or you can use sheets in a pinch. Be creative and have fun with it!

, You do not want to end up at school with a bunch of broken dishes and have to start allover. Be sure to label the boxes.

, Of course, this tends to work if you are driving to school, not if you are flying cross country. Stock up on canned items like soups, powdered drink mixes, tuna and ravioli, boxed mixes, and items that won't crush or go bad. Don't forget salt, pepper, mustard, ketchup, sugar, sweetener, non-dairy powder coffee creamer, Pam cooking spray, popcorn, cans of peanuts, etc.



Ask before taking! Parents tend to be fine about sending off their college-bound student with food. Some parents will insist. However, this should not be a surprise. Nor do you simply take another person's food without asking, even your parents.
Do not open anything that requires refrigeration before you leave for your new digs. Many jarred products are safe at room temperature until opened, like mayonnaise and salad dressings.
Talk to your parents about adding a few items to each weeks grocery list. If you start early you can have a great supply of food to last you while at school.
Also ask your parents about making a trip to the local discount shopping club and pick up some food in bulk.
Condiments such as salt and pepper are probably in good supply at your parent's house. Spices are expensive and you won't go through it quickly so ask your family to borrow from their supplies.

Consider the law school's extracurricular offerings.,
Consider employment prospects.,
Gauge your likelihood of admission at each school.,
Make a list of law schools.,
Visit the law schools at the top of your list.,
Apply to your chosen schools.",How to Choose a Law School," There are several publications online that offer law-school rankings.You will want to read through these and take them into account when deciding to which law school to apply, but take care not to place too much emphasis on these rankings.Outside of the top-14 schools (commonly referred to as the ""T14""), the rankings shift yearly and do not necessarily represent the best law school for you.


Be aware that the higher ranked a law school is, the less likely it is to give financial aid. High-ranked schools do not need to provide as much incentive for prospective applicants as do lower-ranked ones.
Also keep in mind that the primary and most oft-cited source of law-school rankings, U.S. News, is a for-profit company and therefore not a definitive source. When looking at any rankings list, be sure to take into account the factors that went into making those rankings.;
, If you already know what kind of law you want to practice, make sure the law school offers a good amount of courses in the subject areas in which you are interested.


However, don't let this be the sole factor in making your decision because the education you will receive in law school will be generalized, and most of the special training you will receive in your chosen area will be attained after law school once you enter the workforce.You might also change your mind about the type of law you want to practice once you have been in law school for some time.

, You will want to research what types of internship/externship programs, legal clinics, study-abroad opportunities, etc., that the law school offers.Law school courses give a great overview of the theory behind the law, and how to think like a lawyer. Hands-on experience, though, is offered through programs like internships, externships, and clinics.


Make sure the law school has a robust offering of these sorts of practical programs so you can supplement your academic learning with actual practice experience.

, You will want to research the law school's actual facilities themselves to determine if the school will provide you with the quality education you are looking for. Make sure it has a good library with plenty of legal resources and competent staff to assist you in your research. Also check to see if there are adequate spaces to study and that the classrooms and teaching facilities are of good quality (integrated technology, comfortable chairs, etc.).


It is also a good idea to consider how important the law school is in relation to the university as a whole.The more important the legal program is to the university of which it is a part, the more money will be allocated to the legal program, which results in higher quality overall.

, It is important to also examine the quality of the faculty that will be teaching you the law. Look into what your prospective professors have accomplished in the past, where they have worked/taught before, whether or not they publish regularly and, if so, where they have been published.


Be sure to also get a sense of how accessible your professors will be so they can help you outside of the classroom. If they are involved in a lot of things outside of their role as a professor, you might find it hard to schedule one-on-one time with them to discuss problems or seek mentorship.
Inquire as to how many classes the professors teach each year.The fewer classes each professor is responsible for in a given academic year, the more time and effort they can afford each one.

, Smaller classes are good for interaction and extended discussion between students and professors, allowing for a deeper understanding of the particular topics covered. Larger classes are good for being exposed to a diverse variety of opinions and reasoning, allowing for exposure to differing opinions or methods of arriving at a particular legal conclusion.You will probably want a mix of both, so check to see what the law school offers.
Pay attention to student–faculty ratio as well, as you will want to make sure the law school has enough professors on hand to make sure each student receives the best legal education possible.

, This is one of the most important factors to consider when choosing a law school. The school's location will determine your cost of living, the climate in which you will be living for three years, whether you will be in an urban or rural setting, and how far you will be from home. You will also want to pay attention to what the location offers outside of school, because you will have free time and will want to spend it doing things you like.


Be aware that public law schools favor residents of the state in which they are located during the admissions process.Most law graduates take the bar exam and become licensed in the state in which they went to law school.This means that you will likely be working in the state in which you attend law school.
Also keep in mind that a law school's reputation is strongest in the area in which it is situated. The law school's career center contacts are also likely local.

, This is also an incredibly important factor to consider, as the cost of a legal education is very high. While loans are available, you will want to keep your costs as low as possible, so weigh the cost of a particular law school against the scholarships you might receive to determine if it is in your budget to attend.


If you are looking at a public university, and you are a resident of the state in which the university is located, you will receive in-state tuition, which is considerably less than what an out-of-state student would pay. If you are an out-of-state student, inquire about the possibility of achieving in-state status for tuition purposes by working for the school in some capacity, such as being a research assistant for one of your professors.
Look up the percentage of students receiving financial aid from the law school, and also research the average amount of financial aid awarded for students attending that school., The law school will not exist in a vacuum, and therefore you will have access to the facilities of the university at large. So check to see what sorts of amenities the law school's parent university offers (e.g., gyms, sports fields, pools, etc.).

, You will have free time in law school, and so you will want to make sure that the school offers activities in which students can participate and get to know each other outside of class. Look for things like student organizations, law journals, and moot-court opportunities., This is the reason you went to law school—to find a job. Look into where the school places its graduates, which employers recruit at the school, the bar-passage rate of graduating students, and the percentage of students able to find employment in the legal field after graduation.This will help you get a sense of whether or not your three years of school and considerable financial investment will be worthwhile.

, As you are researching different law schools, compare your GPA and LSAT scores to those of recently admitted students to get a sense of your chances of admission at different schools.While other factors are important during the admissions process—like work experience, extracurricular activities, leadership experience, etc.—these two numbers are the most important predictor of admission., Once you have carefully considered the above criteria, make a list of between 6 and 12 schools that fit the mold of what you are looking for in a school. This will help you narrow down your options and make the application process more palatable.


One or two of the schools on your list should be ""reach"" schools (schools you would like to attend, but whose admissions numbers are higher than yours) and one or two should be ""safety"" schools (schools whose numbers are lower than yours and to which you will likely be admitted). The rest should be on par with your numbers such that you have a reasonable change of getting accepted.

, Once you have an idea of the schools to which you will be applying, it is best to take some time and visit the schools you are most interested in attending. While you are there, talk to students, professors, and the administrative staff. Also be sure to explore the campus and surrounding locale to get a feel for the place you will be spending the next three years.


The student body at some law schools is extremely competitive, while at others it is more collaborative and supportive. Get a sense of the campus attitude by talking to people around the law school when you visit, and decide if that environment is right for you.
If you can sit in on a class, do so. This will give you a great idea of how you will be spending most of your time over the next three years.

, After you have finally decided which law schools you would like to attend, it is time to actually apply. Then all you have to do is wait for your acceptance letters. Best of luck!

Be clear on your priorities.",How to Choose a Medical School," Different medical school can have drastically different courses that are ""required upon admission."" Take a close look at these to determine whether you are a suitable fit for a certain medical school.


Note that students who have studied the biological or health sciences are at an advantage in that they are far more likely to have met the prerequisite requirements for almost every medical school.
Students who have completed a Bachelor of Arts, or studied math or physics or a subject other than the traditional biological and health sciences may have a harder time finding medical schools where they meet the acceptance requirements. You may want to take additional classes to meet these requirements.
There are, however, medical schools with less rigid prerequisite requirements. If you do not have a traditional biological and health sciences undergraduate background, it may save you time and money to find a medical school that is more lenient with the courses they expect you to have upon admission.
It may be beneficial to purchase access to the Medical School Admission Requirements (MSAR) website, which will detail the requirements for individual schools in the U.S. and Canada. It will also give you applicant and acceptance statistics.;
, In the selection process for admission, some schools will emphasize your grades, some will emphasize prerequisite courses, and others will put a heavy emphasis on volunteer work and your prior in-hospital experience.


It is helpful to be aware of what different medical schools are looking for, as well as to know your own strengths and weaknesses, to improve your chances of being accepted.
Some medical schools also put a higher emphasis on your MCAT scores when considering you for admission. The MCAT stands for the Medical College Admission Test.
For those who are academically inclined and score very well on the MCAT, this could be to their advantage; however, for those will less stellar grades but excellent contributions to the community, it may be advantageous to look for a medical school that values students with extensive volunteer experiences.

, Some medical schools are open for application after two or three years of undergraduate study; others require a full Bachelors Degree first. When choosing a medical school, especially if you are early on in your undergraduate studies, consider whether you are interested in applying to one that offers ""early admission"" (admission without a full undergraduate degree). This could save you time and money, and it may help to fulfill your dream of becoming a doctor sooner rather than later.


Talk to the pre-health advisor or other academic advisor at your school. She may be able to help you determine which school is right for someone with your experience and strengths.

, Ultimately, what it comes down to for most prospective medical students is to apply to a variety of schools (often as many as possible), and to then make a choice based on the one(s) you are accepted into.


The competition to get into medical school is very high, which is why it is always a good idea to apply to multiple schools. Keep in mind the secondary costs of applying to schools, such as traveling to interviews and campus visits, as well as application fees. The average number of schools that students apply to is 15.Also, do not give up hope. Many students take two or three (and sometimes more) tries to be accepted into a medical school at all.
The good news is that the medical schools usually choose their selection dates to be on the same day (or a very similar day) so that if you get multiple offers into different medical schools you will be able to choose between them and pick the one that is your preference.

, Traditional teaching is where all of your training in the pre-clinical years is lecture and laboratory based, where you learn the concepts in great detail but do not spend much time applying them until you begin working in the hospital (usually in the last two years of medical school).


PBL (problem based learning), on the other hand, is more of a case-based approach where you are given one ""sample patient"" each week, and the patient relates to the week's learning theme. For instance, it would be a patient with a complex heart problem in the week you are studying the heart.
The goal of PBL is to get students together in small groups where they apply the knowledge they are learning in lecture to the featured patient case.
The downside of PBL as opposed to traditional medical school teaching, however, is that there are less total lecture hours. Therefore, students may need to spend more time reading up on their own about the fact-based information they are required to know.

, Usually the last two years of medical school are devoted to in-hospital work (they are called the ""clinical years""). You work hospital shifts alongside a qualified physician, and practice seeing patients and coming up with diagnoses and treatment plans.


The interesting thing about the clinical years is that the quality of education can vary dramatically depending upon your instructors.
If you can, ask other students in the medical school you are considering what they thought of the physicians they worked with during their ""clinical years."" These are some of the most pivotal years, and having a physician who is interested in teaching students (as opposed to working with doctors who are frustrated with having students on their service) can make a huge difference in your learning.

, After completing medical school, you must continue your training as a ""medical resident"" prior to becoming a fully qualified physician. Residency is the stage of training where you either choose to become a family doctor, or choose to specialize in any medical specialty.


Admission into many of the medical specialties after medical school is very competitive. Therefore, if you have your heart set on doing a particular residency (or specialty) once you graduate, it would be wise to consider which medical schools offer the best opportunities for you to get additional experience in your area of interest.
You may want to look at medical schools where there are experts in the field you are interested in on staff. Also look at schools that do a lot of research in your field of interest.

, Do you want to stay in your hometown? Are you open to studying abroad? Have you considered, if you go away for medical school, the implications this would have on getting a residency and/or of being able to practice medicine in your hometown once you graduate? These are all important questions to consider before choosing a medical school.

, If you have a significant other and/or children when you are applying to medical school, consider the profound impact going to medical school can have on your relationship and family life. When making a choice about what medical school to go to, consider factors like how the location suits your family, how long the program would be, how costly it is, and whether it is a choice that is win-win not only for you but for your family as well.

, Studying abroad is often far more expensive than studying in your home country. Also consider things such as living expenses, tuition fees, and the cost of traveling back home to visit family if you are living far away from loved ones.

, Some schools have more of a focus on research, and some may have MD/PHD programs that allow you to focus on research and obtain a PHD degree along with an MD degree. In addition, some schools have MD/MBA programs for those interested in the business of healthcare or administration.

, Medical school is a huge commitment. Before choosing a medical school, ask yourself what sacrifices you are willing to make to fulfill your dream of becoming a doctor. Make sure your heart is absolutely set on it before choosing a medical school.

Talk it over with anyone who has a stake in your education – probably your parents.,
Get a full-time job immediately, even if it's a job that you don't like, and even if you don't need the money.,
Motivate yourself.,
Visit different colleges and universities, even if you don't want to go back just yet.,
Find a job doing something you think you might want to do for the rest of your life.,
Go back to school if, and only if, you have a firm idea of the direction you'd like to take your life.",How to Get the Most out of a Break from College," Many colleges and universities offer you the chance to work full-time or study abroad while still earning credits. The downside is that you (or your parents) will still be paying tuition towards a degree that you're probably not even sure you want (or will ever use).


Another option to consider is taking a leave of absence. That way, if you decide to come back to that school, you can re-integrate more seamlessly than if you just drop out.;
, What were you expecting college to be like? How has your current school not satisfied your needs? Could those needs be fulfilled by attending another school? More importantly, what do you want to spend your life doing? And is it likely that having a college degree will help you in getting there? In other words, if you have a sneaking suspicion that your life's calling is to be a painter, then a degree in medical toxicology will probably do more harm than good (although a degree in graphic design would make better sense).

, Whether it's an emotional stake (a classic one being that your parents want you to have opportunities that they never did, even if they are opportunities you're not interested in at all) and/or a financial stake (are they footing the bill or the loans?), you have a better chance of enlisting their support if you ask for their input and outline your reasons before you take a leap.

, The last thing you want to do is mope around the house waiting for the next step to fall in your lap. It'll never happen, and you'll be well on your way to living in your parents' basement for the rest of your life. And if it's a job you hate, that's all the more motivation to go back to school so you can get a job that won't make you this miserable.

, Now that you don't have professors and deans hanging over your head, threatening you with failure, you have to learn push yourself. This is, by far, the most important lesson you can learn in taking time off from school. Sit down and write out some goals for yourself, and start moving towards them ASAP.

, It's good to see what's out there, and the perfect school you never knew existed might be waiting for you. Go online and pull up course catalogs and find out what courses of study are out there. If you find one you're interested in, contact schools that offer it and...

, There's nothing like getting paid to test the waters. It's much easier to switch jobs than it is to switch schools, so before you go back to college thinking for sure that you want to be an airline pilot, or a professional chef, or a clarinet player, work in the field for at least a few months and ask yourself: ""Can I imagine myself doing this for the rest of my life?""

, Otherwise, you'll be back to square one within a semester or two, wondering ""What am I doing here again?"" With a renewed sense of motivation, and some real life experience under your belt, you'll be a better student than ever.

If you can't get a room change, ask a friend if you could stay with them.",How to Deal with Loud College Roommates," When it gets too loud for you in the room, ask for exactly what you want. Assume that your roommate has no idea he is bothering you. Say ""hey, could you put on headphones? I'm reading,"" or ""I'm going to sleep now—can you take your phone call outside?""


If your roommate rolls his eyes or makes a sarcastic comment but complies, just let it go.
If your roommate does not comply, you can go on to explain what bothers you and why it's important. First, though, give him a chance to show he understands.
Ask directly instead of leaving a note or dropping hints. Your year together will be easier if you can both feel safe talking about your differences.
Don't tell everyone else how annoyed you are first. Word travels fast in a dorm: unless it gets really, really bad, keep it between you and your roommate.;
, Your roommate probably doesn't know he is noisy: noisy people don't usually know they are. Explain what is bothering you, and what you need from your roommate. Use ""I"" statements: rather than accusing your roommate of being noisy, say how it affects you.


""If I'm afraid I'll get woken up, I have trouble falling asleep. I really need to know that you'll check to see if I'm sleeping before you come in with a bunch of friends.""
If your roommate is surprised at how different your needs are, just shrug and say ""that's how I work!""

, Your goal is to communicate your needs without getting into a fight. Be prepared to stay calm if your college roommate reacts badly. Tell your roommate what you need without raising your voice or calling him names. Breathe deeply if you notice yourself getting angry or defensive.


If your roommate blows you off or says something rude, pause before responding. Think about what you want to say.
Explain that your need isn't going to change, and that the two of you need to come to some sort of deal.
Focus on the big picture of solving the problem. Nagging about the little things or making sarcastic remarks could make your room life hostile.
Even if your roommate is initially unpleasant, you know that he can't fault you for standing up for yourself. He won't respect you if you let him run all over you.

, Once you have asked for quiet, assume that your roommate will occasionally slip up. Remind him calmly. If he is trying to cooperate but still making noise, thank him and explain that you can still hear him. Say, ""Hey, I really appreciate that you put headphones on. I know you like to listen to loud music, and that you're doing this for me. I can still hear the music through your headphones, though—could you turn them down?""


If he really doesn't seem to get it, sit down with him and lay it out more seriously. Explain that you can't live with him, pass your classes, and feel sane if the room is always full of noise.

, If your roommate refuses to respect your needs, get outside help. Tell your roommate that you really want to work out a compromise with him, and that ignoring the problem isn't an option. Give him a day or two to agree to talk to you. Then ask the RA to mediate a conversation.


Your RA will sit down with both of you and help you determine a noise schedule.
Your RA will explain to your roommate that this sort of arrangement is normal and is expected.
If your roommate is so noisy the whole hall can hear him, ask a few of the neighboring rooms to also complain to the RA. Don't do this if you are still communicating in a friendly way with your roommate!
If your RA isn't helpful, talk to someone higher up in the Office of Residence Life.

, As soon as you can in the year, set ""house rules"" with your roommate. Your house rules should determine when it is okay to be noisy, when it isn't, and what constitutes noise. Start by discussing the priorities for both of you: what is most important to accomplish this year? What do you most want out of a dorm room?


Figure out from there how to protect the things that are the most important to each of you. If they are contradictory, compromise.
For instance, if it's super important for your roommate to have a social room where people come hang out, but it's important for you to be able to study in the bedroom, pick days of the week or hours of the day for each of you to control the room.

, Your roommate may be fine with adjusting sound as long as you ask nicely. Ask your roommate how he would like to be reminded when the sound is bothering you. Similarly, you may be fine with certain noisy activities as long as you are asked. Agree on what activities need to be cleared with all members of the room.


It is standard to ask permission before inviting a group into a room, for instance., Is studying always the priority in your bedroom? If it is for both of you, then the room should be quiet whenever anyone wants to study. If it is for one of you but not the other, determine quiet hours: the hours in the day that are best for studying, and the hours that can be taken up with sound.


If one of you needs far more hours of study, tends to pull all-nighters, or otherwise has a study routine that is difficult to contain, alternative spaces need to be considered.
Campuses are full of places to study. Make an agreement that studying at certain hours will take place in a library or other study zone.

, Sleep is always a priority, so make a rule that sleeping people be left undisturbed. That means no unnecessary noise until the person is awake. If you sleep at super different times, you'll have to get used to the noise of your roommate getting dressed, looking for books, etc.


Invest in a desk lamp so that the main lights of your room don't have to be turned on when one person is up at night.
If one of you needs noise to sleep, agree that that person should wear headphones.
If your roommate snores, suggest that he get a mouth guard or try sleeping on his side.

, Agree on a way to monitor phone calls. You might agree that if a call is short, it can be taken in the room. Another option is that certain hours could be used for phone and skype dates. Another is that the person who wants to talk should be responsible for politely asking the roommate if it's okay to take a call.


If your roommate has a close relative or a significant other who lives far away, he might want to make frequent phone calls in private.
Compromise by asking him to set a schedule so that you know when to leave him alone in the room.

, Does your roommate blast music? It is reasonable to ask that that happen only on weeknights or when you are not in the room. Do you both like loud music, but disagree on what music is best? Take turns determining the playlist. Do you need no music in the room while you study? Your roommate should agree to invest in headphones.


You might both agree that music can be played whenever, as long as the person who is playing it asks.
If your roommate is a musician, you will need to schedule times that he can practice. Remind him that he has other places he can play.

, Try getting earplugs or noise-canceling headphones. Earplugs aren't glamorous, but they can help you study. Wearing them at night can be dangerous, however, as you will be difficult to rouse. Noise-canceling headphones are bad at blocking out irregular noise, such as voices, but they can really block droning sound. If your roommate plays droning music, has noisy equipment, or plays video games with repetitive background noise, a pair of headphones might work.


Good noise-canceling headphones are expensive, and cheaper models tend not to work. If you can't afford them, skip them.

, Getting out of the room when your roommate is doing something that irritates you might not feel fair, but if it gets you the quiet space needed to get your studies done, it's worth the effort. Make a plan, so that you quickly know where to go the next time your roommate gets noisy.


Study in the library or the computer lab.
Visit a friend's room or the student center if you just need to escape.
See if there is a local cafe with a low level of noise for occasional study visits.
Get in the habit of working outside of the room. That way, you won't have to worry about noise when you start studying.

, If the noisy situation doesn't stop, ask for a room change or ""switch"" with someone else. It would be better to change rooms than to be kept awake all night through the semester, as this will affect your grades badly.Ask someone else in your dorm to switch. If you can find another noisy/quiet room pair, they may be happy to switch with you.
Another alternative may be to ask the offending roommate to leave. Read the rules of your dorm to see what's possible.
It can be hard to switch mid-semester, but if the situation is serious you can often be accommodated. Speak to someone in Residential Life and explain that you are living in a hostile dorm environment. You offered communication and compromise, and your roommate refused.
Talk to your RA and visit the Res Life website to see what your options are.

, This might be a temporary arrangement just to get you through exams or to catch up on lost sleep. It might also give you the space needed to find more permanent lodgings elsewhere.


Ask if any of your friends have an extra bed or a roommate who is never there. If you have a friend who spends a lot of time with a significant other, ask that friend if you could use the room when it's empty.

Seek out like-minded people.,
Live off campus.,
Support your like minded friends and fellow students.,
Enjoy a few parties minus the alcohol.,
Drink just a little.,
Go wild now and then.,
Avoid preaching.,
Find fun beyond parties.",How to Be Sober in College when Everyone is Drunk," Not everyone thinks that alcohol-infused hazes in between cramming and lecture attendance is what college is all about. Maintaining sobriety throughout college is the goal of quite a few college students, and not just those required to so for religious or teetotaler reasons. Notice the students who don't participate in the binge drinking, parties and all-night beer pong and seek to befriend them. In particular, look for companions through sport and hobby organizations/clubs –– people dedicated to training or pursuing a hobby are likely to have a lot less time and interest in getting drunk all of the time. Don't be afraid to ask whether people like partying a lot or not –– you'll soon get the answer you're looking for!;
, Another way to ease yourself out of permanent party time is to keep away from campus. Can you tee up with a friend or can you find suitable individual living digs somewhere else? By having a place to go to each day away from the influence of the constant party people, it can be a lot easier to avoid the temptation of yet-another-alcohol-infused event.


Take care about rooming blind –– you don't want to end up living with someone who drags the parties off-campus and right into your new home. Ask questions about the party preferences first! Or better yet, see if you can room with a friend or friend of a friend.

, Being drunk a lot of the time isn't cool but it's often paraded as cool by those who like to see themselves as the party animals of campus. Let them be but at the same time, don't put yourself down. Instead, be supportive to friends and students who also don't want to spend a lot of time partying and drinking, letting them know that it's okay to be this way and it's fine to want to pursue other interests. Go out together to the movies or a meal in place of all the parties, so that you can still have a great time together, just minus the alcohol.


Hang out in clubs or coffee houses that don’t serve alcohol. Plenty of hip coffee houses or the student union are alcohol free but allow for plenty of social interaction.

, Try not to spend your entire life wedged between the library stacks––getting out and enjoying the parties can form part of your sobriety plan. There are a few tricks to staying socially involved on campus without falling for the darker side of permanent hangovers. First of all, don't back out of all invitations; instead, be choosy. Go to those parties that seem like there will be some fun to be had and where you know the people going. Assess the worthiness of every drinking occasion thrown your way before agreeing to it and have a ratio of agreeing to say, one out of every three invites. When you actually do attend, here are some other tricks to keep you sober:


Find out where the non-alcoholic beverages are. Juice is great for making the pretense of participation without too many questions being asked––after all, anything could be in the juice, right? Or, while everyone is destroying brain cells with a vodka tonic, have a club soda with a twist on the rocks. Other party goers will think you're pounding vodkas while instead you're staying lucid and watching the circus unfold around you.
Sip your drink as though it has some strong potion inside. If you chug your non-alcoholic drink, partygoers who think they're being helpful might start ordering you shots to cover your lack of a drink. Instead, be nonchalant about how your nurse your drink and make more of the focus on trying to have a discussion with your pals.
Surround yourself with trusted friends also disinterested in getting drunk. Find a reasonably quiet spot to chat and observe from.
Set a decent time to leave, preferably before the party antics are way out of control. Dropping in for an hour or two should suffice and ensure you get the atmosphere, catch up with people, enjoy yourself a little and still get back to bed at a decent hour.

, While this step is optional, staying sober during college doesn't mean being a complete teetotaler. The real art is in drinking just enough to enjoy without becoming drunk––for most people this is in the order of having only one to two glasses for the entire night. It means that you can enjoy a taste of something (and always choose quality alcohol to make this worthwhile) but then you acknowledge your limit and finish. It takes willpower, which is something that will set you in good stead for the rest of your life so learning it now can't hurt.

, Let your hair down and be a little crazy around the drunk people––without actually being drunk yourself! The drunken mob around you won't remember if you danced the can-can or sang Lady Gaga songs at the top of your voice out of tune but they'll probably have a great laugh and even join in at the time. You don't need to be drunk to be a bit of an exhibitionist, and hanging in the drunk crowd can be the perfect excuse to let the crazy out then disappear back to your dorm quietly, with nobody remembering a thing the following day. (If they do remember, tell them they're exaggerating.)


Punk your friends. You have the advantage of being lucid and in total control, allowing you to play silly pranks on your pals while they're too drunk to know what is going on. The old hand in the warm water or mustache drawn on the face with eyeliner can be a fun way to get a little more mileage out of the evening and your sobriety. Obviously, don't do any pranking that involves something permanently damaging or harmful, including permanent alterations to the appearance, illegal activity, dangerous activity or reputation damage such as posting photos/videos on the Internet.

, There is nothing more boring and more inclined to turn away potential friends and supporters than to hear someone pontificating about how evil alcohol is and how every drunk person is doomed to fail. People just want to have fun when it comes to parties and leisure time and many of the people drinking have probably worked really hard all day and see the party as a way to relax. You've decided that having fun is possible without alcohol and that's great but it's a whole lot better to show your strength by example, in the doing, than to go on and on about how superior you are to people who can't control their drinking tendencies. Seek to get the balance right between encouraging others to drink less and simply letting be but showing how you can still enjoy life without relying on alcohol all the time.

, If the means of celebration has become a little too cliched and everyone heads off to the same bar or party hall each time, look for other ways to have fun at these times. Some examples include:


Hit some concerts. See a band with another sober-minded friend or group of friends. You can all focus on the music instead of drunken drama.
Go to dinner. With all the money you're saving on not having booze, you can most likely afford a meal that’s not Ramen or mac n’ cheese. Find a restaurant near campus you love and make a reservation and be sure to take a friend or two with you.
Enjoy a live sports game. Tee up a group of interested pals and head on to a sports match. Place limits on what can be drunk (if it's even allowed) and organize bets or some similar way of following the game that rewards everyone for making guesses about the event.
Enter a challenge of some sort, such as a sporting event, a competition related to your subject, etc., that involves travel or attending a large, exciting event. This can be something to look forward to, to prepare for and provides and opportunity to meet new people and discover new things or places.
Create parties that revolve around doing something themed rather than just turning up and drinking. Host a whodunnit night, plan lots of party games that require skill and bright thinking, show movies, run a book club, hold a cooking competition, etc. When people are focused on an actual activity rather than simply gathering, there is often a lot less pressure to drink and a lot more pressure to stay focused on the tasks at hand. It's still fun, as the mind is occupied in achieving something!

Don’t buy into claims of “exclusive offers.” The idea that one company would have exclusive information about a secret scholarship is not a credible proposition.,
Be skeptical of fees.,
Remember there are no guarantees.,
Steer clear of unsolicited offers.,
Make sure the proffered service is worthwhile.",How to Avoid Scholarship Scams1," All scholarships exist for the benefit of the public, so it doesn’t follow that a scholarship would have any incentive to keep their scholarship under wraps.Furthermore, most aid is Federal Aid, and the second largest source of aid are universities themselves. These are about as far from exclusive as you can get.;
, A number of scams charge an up-front fee to disburse the loan. Almost all legitimate lenders simply take the loan origination fee from the loan itself, so you should be wary of any company that wants the fee up front. What they’re really doing is tricking you into providing your credit card information. They often have no intention of giving you a loan of any kind. There are other companies that simply charge for finding scholarships. While that’s not illegal, it can get unethical. Again, scholarships have no incentive to hide their existence, so it’s usually not too difficult to find a scholarship all by yourself., Any company offering guaranteed scholarships is being dishonest if not lying outright. The only guaranteed form of student aid is Federal Aid, and it’s the government who is providing the guarantee and not the scholarship search company. Any other kind of financial aid will be subject to some type of conditions, whether it is creditworthiness, age, or income.There are also no real scholarships that give people money with no strings attached. They will at least want to check on an applicant’s grades and hear a bit about their story in the form of a personal essay. Any company that promises to do “all the work” for you for a fee should be regarded with suspicion.

, As always, if you get an offer of a scholarship out of the blue, be skeptical. A person will call you up out of nowhere to give you money just about as often as you’ve called someone out of nowhere to give them money. These calls are typically just pretexts for mining your personal information., A lot of dubious companies charge you a fee to find scholarships for which you’re eligible. Others charge for completing forms on your behalf. Most of the time, the information they’re charging you for is widely available to the public. Before you spend hundreds of dollars paying for a similar service, make sure you can’t find the same kind of information yourself.There are a number of sources of information for scholarships you might apply for. You might want to try the Department Of Labors’ Career One Stop Page at http://www.careeronestop.org/toolkit/training/find-scholarships.aspx, the Department of Education’s index of state level aid, http://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/state/index.html, and FastWeb’s index of private scholarships at http://www.fastweb.com/. Between the three of them, there are more than 1.6 million indexed scholarships.
There are some services that offer to “help” completing the Federal Application for Free Student Aid, or FAFSA. In no uncertain terms, these services are ripoffs. If you can read your Federal Income Tax return, you can fill out the FAFSA. Furthermore, the FAFSA itself offers assistance with completing the form at https://studentaidhelp.ed.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/181 and https://fafsa.gov/help.htm.

Be aware that drinking alcohol is often a result of peer pressure.,
Make your intention not to drink known in advance.,
Turn down a drink politely but firmly when you are offered one.,
Avoid taking negative attitudes and verbal criticism about your choice personally.,
Stay firm.",How to Avoid Alcohol While at College1," There is a tendency among college students to drink excessively, and this might lead others to think that drinking alcohol in large quantities is the socially accepted norm. Understanding this is the first step toward realizing that drinking should always be a choice rather than a way to conform, and you shouldn't let others dictate your personal choices and lifestyle.


Remember that social pressure can be both direct (if someone offers you a drink) or indirect (if you feel like drinking because those around you are all doing it).Once you identify these two different forms of pressure, you can learn how to deal with both by finding ways to say no or acting on your own will to curb your temptations.;
, You can inform your closer circle of friends that you have decided not to drink alcohol to avoid being offered a drink. This can help you sidestep awkward situations in which someone buys you a drink and you have to turn it down, or explain your decision each time you are in a drinking situation. For example, when you’re planning a night out with your friends you can tell them “I don’t think I’ll be drinking tonight, I’ve decided to take a break for a while”. If someone asks you to go to a club, say “I’m totally in, but I’ll take it easy and stick to soda” or make a little joke: “I’d love to come, are teetotalers allowed?”
The manner of the delivery of your explanation is important because you don't want to come across as alienating others by being condescending or judgmental.

, Being firm does not mean that you should be rude or explain why you prefer not to drink. Replying ""No thanks"" is enough to make your intentions clear and definitive.If you are asked why you are not drinking, provide a brief explanation as to your choice but still indicate that you recognize other people want to experiment and ""have fun"". For example:


""No thanks, I don't drink (often). I have some digestion issues and it's better for me to stick to soda.""
""No thanks, I don't drink because of my beliefs. But I've got a great mocktail here and the night's young, so let's party!""
""Thanks but I've already had my drink for the night and I'm sticking with water from here on. I've got a research paper to complete in the morning and it's already overdue.""

, It can be confronting to someone who wants to drink a lot to have someone who isn't drinking stand up for themselves. In a way, doing this in a drinking culture environment is breaking with conformity and for some people, this feels threatening. Rather than seeing their negative attitude toward you as personal, take it as a reflection of their own conflicted feelings about lacking control over alcohol consumption.

, Once you've announced clearly how you deal with alcohol, stick with it. Standing by principles and beliefs can be hard in the face of peer pressure, but learn to roll with being outside your comfort zone and remain a strong individual. And whatever you do, don't lose your cool.

Pick classes that spark your interest.,
Create a manageable schedule.,
Keep in mind required classes.,
Ask your advisor for help.,
Create a balanced schedule.",How to Adjust to College Classes1," Unlike high school, colleges offer hundreds of classes. This can make choosing classes intimidating. Look through the course catalog to see your options for classes. Take classes that you think you will find interesting and that will help you choose your major. Don’t be afraid to take a class that is brand new to you and to try something new., Try to spread your classes out in a way that works for you. Spreading your classes out throughout the week gives you time for studying and other activities each day. Try to choose times that are good for you. Don’t pick morning classes if you are not a morning person and don’t choose night classes if you can’t focus well at night.


Don’t take too many or too little credits. Start with the recommended amount by your school then adjust it if you need to., Try to get a few requirements out of the way each term. You will need to take core classes or general education classes such as math, history, and science courses. Try to take the majority of these classes your first two years of college so you can focus on your major later., At some schools you meet with your advisor at registration. Otherwise, try to meet with them before you register. Your advisor can help you figure out what classes you need to take to fulfil requirements and suggest classes for your interests.


Come to your meeting with your advisor with a list of questions., Don’t start off with classes that are too difficult, especially your first term of college. You want your schedule to be balanced in difficulty and variety. Don’t take too many classes in your easiest subjects or too many classes in your hardest subjects. Have a schedule with a mix of hard classes and easy classes.


Have different types of classes in your schedule. For example, don’t take all writing classes and end up having to write five essays a week."

Make an outline.,
Tape your outline to the side of your monitor and start writing furiously, glancing at it when in need of guidance.,
Remember that through your outline you should be able to get some fantastic transitions, where the last sentence in one paragraph is completely congruous with the first sentence of the next paragraph, like this one: “The advent of technology played a huge part in this and helped fuel the growth in political satire.,
Keep in mind that another great thing about creating an outline is that in your first run through of thinking about all that you want to talk about and setting it in an outline format, you can jot down lines and phrases that you want to include in your final paper, with such golden phrases as ""lackluster ivories"" (I'll Never Touch Those Ivories Again, by Jack Schultz) or ""balding grumpy old semi-naturalist"" (The Vast Cross-Generational Barrier: An Old Man's 'Final Frontier', by Jack Schultz).,
Note: Finally, an outline will help your conclusion, which is often the hardest part of a paper.,
Have a very strong thesis.",How to Ace College Writing," This will make your first real draft incredibly more organized and fluid, with more structure and body than a simple freely written first draft may be. An outline in some cases is even considered a first draft, so that is an added bonus. One should look at what kind of direction they want for their paper, considering every detail for the final product. What is the theme of their paper? What is the main idea? What parts do you want to get across most? Does some of your topic connect with modern issues? Can you speculate with any certainty about the future of your material? And of course: Who is your audience?;
, Also keep track of where that skeevy guy is when you glance up, you never know when the circles he’s walking in may come within feet of you.

, Radio was the first passive medium to really reach out to people.‿(“Satire in the News‿, by Jack Schultz) It does a great job because the last sentence of the first paragraph refers to the dawn of electronics and the technological revolution, and the first one in the second paragraph refers to the radio, one of the first widely available communicative electronic mediums.

, One doesn't even need to find the perfect wording the first time around, but referencing the image will help keep your writing from being too journalistic.

, It is a place for you to look at all your research and make whatever inferences you feel are relevant, where your voice will shine most. The conclusion often makes or breaks a paper. One can speculate on the future of the subject at hand, or some possibilities for resolution, or even giving an emotional reaction. Providing some emotional or passionate perspective often makes it more interesting and gives some personality to what might be an otherwise unemotional piece of writing. ""To hell with the cracks in the sidewalk. The Colbert Report is on."" (The Vast Cross-Generational Barrier: An Old Man's 'Final Frontier', by Jack Schultz).

, The thesis is what will receive the heaviest consideration from your teacher, and can mean the difference between a passing paper, and a great paper.

Conduct an internet search.,
Ask a trusted source.,
Check with the Better Business Bureau.,
Check if the company is listed in any non-profit directories.,
Look up incorporation records.",How to Avoid Scholarship Scams2," Sites like https://www.surveypolice.com, http://www.ripoffreport.com/ and http://www.scamdetector.info offer ratings and listings for a number of companies specifically for the purpose of scam investigation. You can read what other users have to say about the company as well as read aggregate ratings of those organizations. Although this isn’t the most comprehensive way to go about searching for a possible scam, it is one of the easiest. Start here.

, If you're on the fence about a particular scholarship and you can't find much information about it online, talk your school guidance counselor or your college advisor. While they might not be familiar with the specific scholarship, they're probably pretty attuned to noticing red flags and recognizing problematic offers.

, The Better Business Bureau (BBB) is an organization that collects complaints and reviews about businesses for the purposes of maintaining consumer confidence. The BBB also rates member businesses according to their standards for best practices. The BBB is nonprofit organization funded by member businesses themselves. Search BBB reviews of the organization in question at https://www.bbb.org/search/. Stay away from companies with a lot of negative reviews.

, If you suspect an organization which is claiming to be a foundation or a scholarship itself is a scam, the best place to verify it is with the IRS or another foundation directory. The IRS keeps a listing of charitable and tax-exempt organization like foundations.You can find the listing in IRS Publication 78, located at https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/search-for-charities.
Another place to look up foundations and grant making organizations is at the Foundation Directory Online. You can check it out at https://fconline.foundationcenter.org/. Unfortunately, the Foundation Directory is a paid service. Foundations.org is an alternative free directory, but isn’t as comprehensive. It is located at http://www.foundations.org/page2.html, Most state-level secretaries of state maintain online databases of companies incorporated in their respective states. If you’re trying to do a really deep dive to check into a company’s history, then ask the company where they are incorporated, then check to see if they are actually incorporated with the secretary of state’s office in that state. In addition, most states maintain listings of registered LLCs (another type of business form) as well.You can find a listing of secretary of state websites at the National Association of Secretaries of State’s website, located at https://www.nass.org.
A company that claims to be incorporated or a registered LLC but isn’t listed is most definitely a scam.
These same directories often will have listings of violations or complaints by that company as well, although this will vary from state to state.

Talk with the National Fraud Information Center.,
Reach out to the FTC.,
Contact the Department of Education.,
Contact your state attorney general’s office.",How to Avoid Scholarship Scams3," The National Fraud Information Center is a project of the Consumer’s League. While it is not a law-enforcement of governmental organization, it does collect information about scams on behalf of and shares information with governmental organizations about common scams.It is also another good place to find information about common scams of all types, so it’s also a good place to investigate a suspicious organization.
File a complaint at https://secure.nclforms.org/nficweb/nfic.htm


, Although the FTC doesn't act as a law enforcement agency, it is a governmental agency. The FTC collects complaints of fraud from consumers and distributes them to the appropriate law enforcement agencies. Report a scam at https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/GettingStarted#crnt.All you’ll need is your personal information, some details about the scam, and as much information about the company as you can get, including email, web URL, and telephone number and physical address if possible.

, The Department of Education’s Office of the Inspector General is yet another agency at which you can report a suspected or confirmed scholarship scam. Inspector General’s offices straddle the line between law enforcement and complaint clearinghouses. An Inspector General is an independent office that has the power to conduct wide-ranging investigations, can subpoena documents and witnesses, and issue reports and recommendations to attorneys general.Inspector General’s offices are particularly well-equipped to take complaints from and protect whistleblowers. If you want to report unethical or criminal activity at a place where you work, contact an Inspector General.
Report suspected of confirmed fraud at https://secure.nclforms.org/nficweb/nfic.htm.

, Each state also has a consumer protection agency, which is run from the office of each state's attorney general. If you'd like to file a complaint with the state office of consumer protection, simply perform an internet search for ""consumer complaints to attorney general"" or go to http://www.naag.org/current-attorneys-general.php and find the listing for the attorney general in your state.Although each state is going to have different rules and procedures, you’re going to want to have the same kind of information for a state consumer protection agency as you would want to have for the FTC. In addition, it’s best to try and make sure you know how much money you lost on the scam, if any. If applicable, add in the money you would have made while you were being swindled .
The biggest advantage of making a complaint to an attorney general’s office is this: and attorney general is an office of law enforcement—the most powerful prosecutor in a state or federal jurisdiction. They can take vigorous action where other organizations cannot.

Keep partying.,
Spend time talking with friends and listening to them attentively.,
Become a mocktail master.",How to Avoid Alcohol While at College2," Not drinking doesn't mean you're not able to have fun. Binge and excessive drinking is never healthy, whatever your age, but partying is good for your soul. The objective of a party is ultimately to socialize and you can do that with a glass of Virgin Mojito or Soda in your hand.



Enjoy the dance floor. Keep your water intake up and you can rock the floor all night long.
Hold a champagne glass or similar with non-alcoholic cider in it, or a tumbler with dark soda in it. This can help you fend off unwanted offers and saves unnecessary explanations to people you hardly know.

, Most people love it when someone else pays them good attention! Although alcohol might help you unwind if you're the shy type, a clear mind allows you to make a great conversation and stay focused on whatever is the subject.

, If you have a house party with your friends, you can hit the kitchen counter and introduce them to the art of making great alcohol-free drinks that look just as cool as an ordinary cocktail. There is an infinite number you can learn to make: try your hand at a Basil Lemon Mojito Mocktail, a Ginger and Fred, a Safe Sex on the Beach, a Virgin Flirtini or a Roy Rodgers.

Have a night in with your friends.,
Go to a restaurant.,
Go to a coffee shop.,
Go to the movies.,
Attend student-oriented events at your college.",How to Avoid Alcohol While at College3," Being the host gives you an edge on what direction the night can take: you can cook delicious food for them, watch a movie together, play games and organize a lot of activities that don’t involve drinking.


Some might look for a beer in your fridge, but if it’s not there, they won’t make a drama out of it. They’ll understand this is not the kind of night you had in mind and respect your choice.

, Although most restaurants do serve alcohol, it’s not common to booze while munching an enchilada or sipping a miso soup. Your friends might still opt for a margarita, but it will be much easier for you to get away with a glass of water or soda.


If you still get asked why you’re not drinking and you don’t feel like giving an explanation, cut it short by saying that you usually don’t drink while eating.

, Coffee shops are great places to socialize, spend some quiet time together and have a chat. They're especially popular among college students as a laid-back environment where to study or even just meet friends to talk rather than party hard. Most importantly, they usually don’t serve any alcoholic drinks and no one you’ll be with will expect to find one.


Pick a coffee shop with a cool vibe. Coffee shops vary widely in terms of style and customers’ target, and some of them can even be themed. Your friends will appreciate finding out about a new place that is every bit as funky as their favorite bar or club.
If you’re planning to go to a coffee shop after dinner, make sure it's open late. Some of them might close down much earlier than bars or clubs!

, Everyone enjoys a good movie, and there’s no better way to watch it than with friends. There’ll be plenty of popcorn, candies, snack bars, and soda. Though many independent theatres (and some larger ones) serve beer and wine, drinking is not the primary focus of going to the movies, so you shouldn't feel obligated to have a drink.


Many movie theatres also offer special discounts for students; be sure to take your student ID card.
Some colleges have an independent movie theatre on campus. They're usually considerably cheaper than the local multiplex, and sometimes they might even have free screenings for students!

, Schools and dorms organize special events for their students on a regular basis to encourage new friendships and socialization. It will be less likely to find alcohol there, especially if these are designed for students below drinking age.

Know the type of class you are going to.,
Be aware of the size of the class beforehand.,
Use technology in class wisely.,
Go to class every day.,
Take detailed notes.",How to Adjust to College Classes2," In college there are different types of classes depending on your school and your major. Before you get to class, look at your schedule to see what type of class you are going to so you are not surprised.


Lectures are large classes held in lecture halls that seat hundreds of students. During lectures, the professor talks while students take notes.
Discussion or section classes are small groups from your lecture class. You meet in a smaller and more intimate setting with an assistant instructor and discuss the material.
Seminar classes are small classes where you meet with the professor. They are usually advanced, focused, and specialized.
Lab classes are usually a part of a science lecture. You meet with a smaller group of students to complete assignments and experiments.
Studio classes are to practice what you are learning hands-on. These are usually for art, theater, music, design, or photography classes., At large schools, beginning level classes can be filled with hundreds of students. At small schools you will be more likely to have smaller classes, but not necessarily. You can check the size of your class on your schedule before the class starts. It might be overwhelming to expect to be going to a class of 30 students and walk in to find 200 faces staring at you.


Don’t be scared if you get to class and don’t know anyone. You can sit next to a stranger and maybe you will make a new friend., In college, professors often allow students to use laptops in class to take notes. This can be great because you can take notes faster and keep your notes very organized. However, sometimes technology can be a distraction. You might be more interested in online shopping than what the professor is saying if you have your laptop out. Practice self-control and only use your laptop in class to take notes.Allowing laptops in class depends on the professor’s rules and the school you go to. At some colleges this is much more common than at others.
If the person in front of you is scrolling through Facebook or doing something else distracting on their laptop, try to ignore it.

, There are some professors that take attendance, but most do not. You have a lot more freedom about whether you go to class or not in college. Your mom is not going to be there to wake you up in the morning and make you go anymore. Force yourself to go. The easiest thing you can do to pass a class is to show up., In high school, you may have been able to get away with not taking notes, but that is not likely in college. Take detailed notes of slideshows, diagrams, and of what the professor is saying. This will help you pay attention during class, help you learn the material, and make studying easier.


Be prepared to figure out what you should write down yourself and for professors to skip to the next slide without waiting for everyone to write everything down."
"
Be ready to do more homework and spend less time in class.,
Read the syllabus and keep it on hand.,
Make study groups.,
Read the textbook.,
Do the assignments.,
Study every day.,
Manage your time well.",How to Adjust to College Classes3," Even though you are in class for much less than in high school, the work load is much greater. Be ready to be doing homework and studying for classes every day. In college, you learn more of the material outside of class than you do in class.Create a daily schedule for yourself with time to study every day.
Go to the library between classes instead of going home.

, Professors are not going to remind you to do homework or about approaching due dates the way teachers did in high school. On the first day of class you will receive a syllabus with an outlined guide of tests, assignments, and essays and when they are all due. Keep this on hand and refer to it often so you are prepared.


Use a planner to copy due dates and important information off of your classes syllabuses.

, You don’t have to drown in work alone. Make a study group to help you study. If you have a commitment and other people relying on you, it forces you to actually study. Having a study group will help large classes feel smaller, will help you retain the material better, and hopefully help you get a good grade.


Study groups are also a great way to make new friends. Just ask people who sit near you if they want to study with you., College classes go more in depth than in high school. Professors often teach in a way where they assume you have done the reading outside of class. Tests are often not just on information from the lectures, but also on details from the textbook. Force yourself to keep up with the readings. You don’t want to be a hundred pages behind with a midterm the next day.Annotate while you read to help retain more information.

, Some professors in college might have no assignments the whole term and have your grade entirely based on tests and essays. In other classes you might have assignments due every other day. Keep up with the assignments and actually do them, whether they are optional or not., In high school, you might have been able to get away with barely studying for tests, but not in college. Plan a chunk out of your day to study the material from your classes. Start making flashcards and review sheets early and you will be very thankful when the first midterm comes around., Now that you are in college, you have more freedom with everything from your social life to your assignments. Nobody is around to remind you to study instead of going to a party or to turn off the TV show and pick up your textbook. The trick to being successful in college is to manage your time well. Force yourself to take a chunk of time each day to take care of your responsibilities and to study.


Create a schedule with designated times to study and designated times for free time to help manage your time."
"
Get to know your professors.,
Show your professors respect.,
Go to your professors’ office hours.,
Use assistant instructors as a resource.,
Understand the professors’ expectations.",How to Adjust to College Classes4," In high school, your teachers at least knew your name, face, and how you were doing in the class. In large classes especially, your professor is likely to not know who you are. They might not even be the ones who grade your work and might not even know you are in their class. However, most likely your professors want to get to know you. Go out of your way to talk to them.Introduce yourself to your professors. You could start off with a simple: “Hi Professor Stark! I’m Susan. I just wanted to introduce myself,” and then ask whether you can talk to them more during office hours.
Having strong relationships with your professor can help you in your future with networking, recommendations, and opportunities.
Don’t be afraid to ask your professor questions during breaks or after class.

, Whenever you are talking to your professor, in person or over email, always be professional and polite. Address them by their proper title stated on the syllabus (Dr. Smith, Professor Green, etc.), unless they request to be called by their first name.Make sure to thoroughly proofread any emails you send your professors.

, It can be intimidating or a hassle to walk all the way to some remote building to find your professor’s office to ask them a question, but you should do it anyway. Even if you don’t actually have any questions, think of something insightful about the recent lecture or assignment that you can ask them.


Office hours are a great way to help your professors get to know you, to impress them, and to build a relationship with them., You will most likely have assistant instructors or teaching assistants in your classes. These instructors are usually graduate students, teaching fellows, or other undergraduate students who are juniors or seniors. Assistance instructors are likely the ones who will do the grading and they sometimes teach smaller discussion classes that you will have to attend.


Get to know your assistant instructors the same way you should with your professors. They are helpful resources and building connections with them can help you in the long run., In college, you are held to a higher standard than you are in high school. Your professors are going to expect you to know when assignments are due and when tests are approaching. If you miss an exam, they don’t have to give you another chance to take it. Your professors are likely going to expect a lot from you and are not going to hold your hand through it."
"
Review the school catalog.,
Look at the class schedule for the first term.,
Read the rules about overloading first, or ask for advice, before choosing the classes you'll take.,
Understand how units correlate to hours per week that you will spend.,
Ask school staff or returning students what a reasonable course load is.,
Find out if any of your chosen classes are difficult to get into.",How to Choose a Rigorous College Schedule for Your First Year1," This should list the requirements to graduate in your chosen major, and it is important that you understand what requirements you must fulfill. It will also give a brief description of the contents of the courses, which in turn will help you gauge how difficult each course will be and whether it will interest you.;
, Begin making a list of classes you wish to take. Try to include alternatives both for times and for course titles, since certain popular classes may be crowded at first.


Do any of the additional classes you want to take clash? Is it going to be possible to work around clashes or is this going to make one or more of the classes too difficult to complete? Cross off those that really won't work out.

, Some of the things to bear in mind include:


In some cases, your institution may not permit taking an extensive overload. If you need approval for an overload (many colleges require this), this is often an additional step from normal enrollment, so be sure to get the correct papers and approvals in advance.
Do you know what penalties or flexibilities are in place for dropping, changing or failing additional courses taken? It's a very good idea to know how many weeks into the term you have to withdraw from a subject without recording a fail, in case you realize you need to lighten the load and pick up the dropped subject later on.

, Often one unit corresponds to one hour in class, but the proportion may be different for certain things such as lab or review sessions. Remember that the number of units you take will also determine how much homework you will have. Plan to spend an average of two hours of study outside of class each week for each hour in class - though this, too, varies from class to class.

, Many schools have a certain minimum number of units you must take per term to be considered a full time student. This minimum number of units may not take up all of your time, and it may not get you through your curriculum in a reasonable number of terms. On the other end of the spectrum, you don't want to overload yourself with classes, especially not before you know how many units you can reasonably handle during a given term.

, Here again, try to get the advice of someone who has attended your school in your department. Aim to be at least on the waiting list for classes that are difficult to get into, as soon as you have all the prerequisites.

"
Show up on time and prepared to learn.,
Ask questions, even if they may seem obvious or dumb.,
Contribute to the class discussion.,
Take detailed notes on the professor’s lectures.,
Do not use your cellphone in class or be distracting in any way.",How to Ace a College Class1," A big part of making a good impression on your professor, and acing your class, is showing up for every class, on time. Being present in class will ensure you do not miss any critical discussions and that you can take notes on the course materials as needed.Showing up prepared to learn means bringing your textbooks and other assigned reading materials to class as well as paper and pens. If you bring in your computer to class, make sure you have the professor’s permission to do so as some professors do not allow computers in class. Try to sit near the front so you can hear exactly what the professor is saying and be visible to the professor.
You should also review the key concepts and ideas for the class before the class begins. This could be a quick review of the class syllabus and the class readings the night before or a review of the class materials a few hours before class. This will help you better understand the professor’s lecture and be more proactive in class.;
, Though you may be hesitant to ask a question that seems obvious or dumb in class, it’s often better to take the risk and ask. This is especially important if the professor is discussing a complicated topic or a complex idea. Other students in the room may have the same questions as you but are too afraid to verbalize them. Speaking up and asking questions will show the professor you are paying attention and engaged in the subject matter. This will likely impress the professor and make you stand out among the other students.Try to ask open ended questions and don’t be afraid to ask questions that are half formed. The professor will likely be happy enough that you are showing an interest in the material and are willing to try to work through your understanding of the material.
For example, if the professor is talking about the role of philosophy in American politics, you may say, “I’m not sure if I understand what you mean. Can you give me an example of this?” Or you may say, “Can you expand on what you mean? I don’t think I quite understand.”

, Many college classes have points set aside for class participation. To maximize your points and earn high participation marks, you should push yourself to ask questions and contribute to the class discussion.You may ask open ended questions to get the discussion going in class or respond to a question posed by the professor. You may also challenge another student on their position or state a position that is contrary to the ideas of the rest of the class. Doing this will help to fuel the discussion and engage other students in the class.

, To make the most of your time in class, you should take detailed notes on the professor’s lectures so you can refer back to them in prep for any exams or to use for any assignments for the class. This will help you do well on any assignments or exams and also show the professor that you are paying attention in class.You should have all the necessary note taking materials with you in class, including, paper, pens, highlighters, and/or sticky notes. You should also focus on key words and concepts when you are taking notes to ensure you capture the most relevant information from the professor’s lecture. You can use shorthand to capture the most information and to make it easier to read through your notes later.

, Avoid disrupting class and distracting others as well as yourself. Put your cellphone away and do not refer to it during class. If you use your computer to take notes in class, do not surf the Internet or do online shopping in class. Turn off your wifi connection and only use programs for taking notes.


You should also try not to be distracting in class in other ways, such as clicking and tapping your pen on your desk or fidgeting with your notebook or textbook loudly. You should also refrain from distracting others by talking during class or while the professor is giving her lecture.

You must pay attention to the examples given in class and write them down. Not everything will be written down on the board so you need to listen to your professor to get all of the important information.Get to class on time so you don’t miss any important announcements at the beginning of class.

 If your professor emphasizes a concept multiple times, it is probably very important and likely to show up on a quiz, test, or exam. 
;
, If the professor writes something down on the board, it is probably very important. All examples should be written down, so you don’t forget them. Everyone takes notes differently, but as long as you have the important information written down, you can refer back to them later while studying.If you find it difficult to listen and take notes, consider recording the class with a tape recorder and listening to the lecture later to take more detailed notes. 

 Be sure to review your notes after class (within two days of class) to make sure you understand everything. Note the concepts that you found challenging or don’t understand and study them later. 


, Math has a vocabulary all its own and you need to know it in order to be successful in any math class. You may think you know the definition of a word only to find out that it means something different in the context of math. Put in the effort to learn the vocabulary and you will find your class to be much less difficult.Make flashcards for words that you come across and don’t know. Review these flashcards often to strengthen your knowledge of these words. 


, If you don’t understand something, ask your professor about it! If you miss something small in the beginning, it could affect your comprehension much further down the course. You are probably not the only one with the question and everyone learns when you ask something.Listen when others ask questions as well. You’ll probably learn something. 


, You will not be able to succeed in your math class by cramming the night before your exam. Review your notes, read through examples in your textbook, or work practice problems every day to check your understanding and keep everything current. Read through your homework the night it is assigned and try to do some of the problems.It is much easier to do your homework when you have just learned something instead of trying to remember it a few days or weeks later. 


, The more problems you work, the better you will be at solving them. When doing any practice problem, try to first solve it without using your textbook or your notes. If you get to a point where you are stuck, you can look at your notes. Do problems beyond what is assigned in your homework.Use the student solutions manual to check your answers and see a potential place where you went wrong. 

 Use pencil and have an extra eraser around to easily and cleanly erase mistakes.


, It is not enough to simply memorize a formula. You must also understand why that formula works and when to use it. If you don’t understand the formula itself, it is hard to use it or know when it is appropriate to use it.The memorized formula is useless if you don’t have a working knowledge of what the variables stand for. 

 For example: The Pythagorean Theorem is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, but you have to know that a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the sides of a triangle while c{\displaystyle c} is the hypotenuse in order to use it properly. 


, Because every concept builds upon something else you have learned, you can’t just ignore the first few weeks of material and expect to get an “A”. Not only do you need to pay attention in your actual class, but you need to have mastered material from previous courses as well.A college calculus class is going to be much more difficult without a strong foundation in algebra and trigonometry. 


, Carefully read the problem and make sure you understand exactly what it is asking. Reading through it a second time will help clarify anything you might not have understood during the first read-through. While you are reading, try to determine what exactly the problem is asking., As you read through the problem, write down all of the important information. Before you begin solving, make sure that you have written everything down correctly. This will save you time later when you are checking your answer. Unless you know the information isn’t necessary to solve the problem, write it down.If a diagram will help, draw that as well. 


, Once you have determined what the question is asking and what you know, you can identify any formulas that you will need to solve. Put together a solve plan using these variables and formulas. Oftentimes, there will be multiple steps necessary to get to the final answer. Try to figure out what these steps are before solving.If you get stuck, find an example problem that is similar to the one that you are trying to solve. Adapt the process used to solve the example problem and solve your own problem. 


, Apply the formulas you have decided to use and solve the problem. Check one more time that you have written everything down properly to avoid common mistakes. If you are using a calculator, take care to type in all of the correct numbers and mathematical functions. Show all of your work so that you can get partial credit if you do make a mistake.Showing your work allows your professor to see that you understood and helps you find possible mistakes more easily. 


, There are a few ways to double-check your answer. The first is the common sense check. Does the answer you came up with, make logical sense? If you can plug your answer back into the original problem this is another great way to check. The final way to double-check is to go back through your calculation and make sure there are no errors.If you were calculating the area of something and you came up with a negative number, you did something wrong because this doesn’t make sense. 

 Re-do the math in your calculator and make sure you get the same answer. 


, Don’t throw away any assignments during the course. Look through them when you get them back and try to correct your mistakes. Understanding what you did wrong will help you from making that mistake again. It will also make it easier to study when it comes time for a big test or exam.Go through all of your homework and quizzes and rework these problems until you get them all correct. 


, Your class will likely have a review session before the exam where they will discuss what will be on the exam. You will probably also go through some example problems that will help you study for the test.If you have a conflict with the review session, make sure to get notes from a friend who was able to go. 


, If you are given a study guide, this is a fantastic tool to help you prepare for an exam. Make sure you have mastered all of the topics listed on the study guide. Do any problems suggested on the guide and find even more problems that are similar to these. Focus on the concepts that you have the most trouble with.Keep doing practice problems until you are confident that you can solve any math problem of that type. 

 Avoid moving on to a new topic until you have completely mastered the one before it. 


, Attending office hours or getting a tutor are great ways to get extra help. Office hours are time allotted by your professors and teaching assistants to help you with any pertinent questions. Take advantage of this time and ask any questions that you have on the material or the study guide.Your campus probably has a tutor center where you can also get extra one-on-one help.

 If you have a conflict with office hours, see if you can schedule a separate session to get all of your questions answered. 


, Get together with two or three other students and make a study group. You can work problems together and help each other when you get stuck. It is likely that people in your study group will have mastered concepts that you may still need work on and vice versa. Teaching others what you know also helps you learn.Try to meet at least once a week to go over homework and study for quizzes or tests.


, For any test or exam you are likely going to be constrained to a time limit. Know how much time you have and how best to use that time before you get to the test. Go through the whole exam answering the easy questions first. After you have done these, go back and answer the more difficult questions that will take more time to answer.If you know you have 40 minutes to answer a 10 question exam, you have about 4 minutes to focus on each question.


, If you finish your exam early, it is essential to double-check your work. It’s really easy to accidentally write down a number wrong, so make sure you haven’t done this on any of your problems. Go back to questions you may have had a particularly hard time on and see if you have thought of a better way to solve it while taking the rest of the test.

 If you only have a few minutes, skim through your answers. Check for minor copy errors and to see if they make sense.

Take responsibility for the grade.,
Put the situation into perspective.,
Speak to a trusted confidante.,
Give yourself a break.,
Remind yourself that grades do not determine your self-worth.,
Meditate.,
Calm down during panic attacks using relaxation techniques.,
Avoid drugs and alcohol.",How to Be Zen About Getting Bad Grades in College1," While it can be a blow to your pride, you should understand that you are responsible for the grade you have received. Conflicts with professors can happen, and external factors can affect your grade, but in most situations, you have to realize that if you want to improve, you have to act., Realize that bad things unfortunately happen in life. While getting a bad grade may put you in full panic mode, you have to put the situation into perspective in order to get to that Zen place. Do you have your health? Do you have a family who loves you and friends who rally around you? Count your blessings. Remember that while grades are important, they aren’t the only thing that should matter in your life.

, When you are upset, it is all right to discuss it with a friend or family member. Do not feel as though you have to keep it to yourself. It is understandable if you are concerned about disappointing your parents, ruining your GPA, or making a bad impression on your professors. Know that you can pull through this and that you can find support.


You can even book an appointment with your college's mental health counselors (often known as the Campus and Psychological Services or CAPS). These are trusted professionals who are trained to help stressed out and upset college students.
Do not go on the internet and write your complaints online. These can be seen by other students, college officials, or possibly your professors. There can be many consequences from this. Talk in private to a friend or counselor.

, While you may be stressed out, now is not the time to neglect your well-being. Get ice cream with a friend, watch a movie, or take a bubble bath. Do an activity that relaxes you. The goal is not to run away from the bad grade but to put yourself in a mental state where you can deal with it. Once you are relaxed, look back over your grade.

, You are more than your grades. Good grades can give you great validation, but you should not let bad grades make you feel worthless. A bad grade does not mean you are stupid or that you are incapable of graduating college. Everybody has other great talents, qualities, and characteristics that can't be measured by a grade in school., When alone in your room, take a few minutes to close your eyes. Breathe in and out deeply, making sure to focus on your breath. Allow your thoughts to drift away. Think about nothing, and whenever your grade anxieties surface, push them away. You can try using soft music to help calm you. Try meditating for fifteen to thirty minutes.


Yoga is another great way to keep calm and achieve zen. Many campuses offer yoga classes. Check with your campus gym to see if you can sign up for a class.

, Sometimes you don't have time to meditate when you feel anxious or panicked. You can use short relaxation techniques to soothe your mood. Stop what you are doing. Close your eyes, and count to ten. Visualize a calm and happy place, such as the ocean or a babbling brook. These techniques will help your body relax, and they will release any anxiety you have.You can tense your muscles and slowly release them during your count. Or you can squeeze a stress ball and slowly relax your grip.While visualizing your happy place, try to invoke all of your senses. If you are on the ocean, imagine the wind, the salty taste of the air, and the sand between your toes. This will make visualization more effective.
Remember to breathe deeply. Breathe in and out for every count up to ten.

, Some people are so distressed about their grades that they start partying harder to forget about it, starting a vicious cycle. When you are stressed out about a bad grade, try to avoid drinking until you have calmed down."

Consider a slightly lighter load for your first term.,
Start any classes that are prerequisites for other classes you will need early on.,
Try to find out whether any classes you will need in your first year are only offered during certain terms.,
Consider the types of homework you will have as you choose your schedule.",How to Choose a Rigorous College Schedule for Your First Year2," This doesn't mean slacking off. Rather, it means taking into account that you will be new to the school and settling in. It takes a little time to get used to the rigors of your chosen major, and possibly also to living on your own. Doing a little less in the first term can give you the space you need to set up efficiently and to be prepared for the future overload terms.

, For example, if you need calculus before you can take physics, try to take calculus right away.

, Feed these into your schedule first, so that the other classes can be worked in around these classes.

, A class about literature or history may have a lot of reading and writing, including term papers. A class like chemistry or physics will have problem sets for homework and perhaps labs and lab reports. These different kinds of homework require you to use different skills and study methods and possibly require different amounts of time. That's not a bad thing, just something to keep in mind as you choose your schedule.

"
"
Begin putting all these factors together with the class schedule.,
Look after yourself.",How to Choose a Rigorous College Schedule for Your First Year3," Aim for a challenging but doable curriculum that gets you through the basics of what you will need to continue with your major.

, Find your own balance between the challenge of your curriculum and getting enough sleep to remember what you learned afterward, as well as time for a job or anything else you are participating in. You may need to experiment a little to learn how much you can reasonably handle at a time.


Eat healthily and keep up regular exercise. Taking good care of your body will ensure that you can cope with the extra coursework and the additional study required.
Be prepared to manage stress. Overloading can be stressful. Use ways to minimize this stress, including being well organized, ensuring that you have adequate breaks from study and planning well for deadlines so that there are no last-minute rush jobs.

Create a study schedule.,
Try the capture, control, plan, and evolve method.,
Avoid all-nighters by breaking up your studying into chunks.,
Review class material one to two hours before bed.,
Study with a friend or peer who tends to get straight A’s.",How to Ace a College Class2," A study schedule can help you better organize your time and your priorities for the class. You can do this by looking at the course syllabus and blocking off time each week for each assignment, reading, and prep for any exams. Do this for the entire term so you can look ahead and know exactly how much time have allotted to prepare for the class and study.Be detailed in your study schedule and avoid vague planning. For example, rather than note on your study schedule, “two hours for assignments”, you should note, “two hours for the census assignment due 11/13”. This will ensure you know exactly what assignment you will be working on and the due date for the assignment, allowing you to better manage your time.
You should also prioritize important assignments and get them done first. If you know the census assignment is due the following week it is assigned, for example, make sure you have time set in your study schedule to do it the week before or the weekend before it is due. You should consider any assignments due for your other classes and factor them in based on priority. This may mean doing an assignment for another class first, based on the earliest due date. Once the assignment is completed, you can move on to the next assignment that is due, even if it is for another class.

, This method can be used to help you get straight A’s in a class. It can also be used to get good grades in other classes and improve your overall GPA.Start by capturing all your obligations as a college student. This includes academic obligations, such as test dates and assignment due dates, as well as administrative obligations, such as application deadlines and expectations from extracurricular activities. Make a list of these obligations, making sure you cover all of them. This will allow you to have a foundation from which to then control, plan, and execute.
Control your schedule by blocking out every hour of the day. You should note which hours will be dedicated to work and what exactly you will be working on during these hours. Stick to the schedule and make sure all of your school work is accounted for in the schedule.
Plan out your studying by focusing on specific assignments. Note specific actions you are going to take, such as “work on the book review due 11/5” or “prep for the mid-term exam on 11/21”.
Evolve your study tactics by embracing any shifts or changes you need to make to your study habits. Re-evaluate and tweak your study habits as necessary, keeping only tactics that work for you and your brain. If something is not working, try a new tactic. Ask yourself, “What worked when I studied for that exam and did well? What could I do better to get a better grade on the next exam?”

, All-night studying is often a bad tactic as it can lead to feeling burned out and exhausted on the day of an exam or in class. Studies have shown that you retain more information by studying in shorter chunks of time than you do pulling an all-nighter. Cramming for an exam may be a study habit you need to break in order to ace the exam and ace the class.Having a well planned out study schedule can help you avoid all-nighters. Make sure your study schedule allows you to prepare for an upcoming exam in chunks, focusing on one to two chapters of the assigned textbook at a time or one to two key concepts from the class at a time. You may go back and review the material you studied during the previous study session to ensure it is fresh in your brain before you move on to other chapters or concepts.

, Research shows that if you review material one to two hours before bed you have a higher likelihood of retaining it. Set aside time in your schedule to review your class notes or read several chapters of the assigned text. You may want to highlight or underline key concepts and ideas so you can return to them later in your study schedule., The company you keep can also help you ace a class. Surround yourself with study pals who tend to do well in their classes and get straight A’s. You can then learn study tactics from them and improve your existing study habits.You may want to consider setting up a study group with one to three peers who do well in their classes. You can then schedule weekly meet ups with the study group to go over specific chapters and/or concepts. It may also be useful to try to set up study meet ups closer to an upcoming exam so you can all prepare for the exam together.
Another option is to hire a tutor, especially if you are struggling with the course material. You should ask friends or peers in your study group for recommendations on a tutor for the class. Start with bi weekly tutoring sessions and then increase or decrease the tutoring sessions as your grades improve.

Communicate with your professor about her expectations.,
Hand in assignments on time and according to the specified requirements.,
Set up a one on one meeting with your professor at least once in the semester.",How to Ace a College Class3," Maintaining a good relationship with your professor can be a key way to ace the class, as most professors appreciate students who try to build a healthy student-teacher relationship throughout the semester or term. Communicating with your professor about her expectations will also show the professor you are engaged in the class and determined to do well. Often, the professor will remember you as an eager, motivated student and possibly factor this in when giving you grades on assignments.You may get better sense of the professor’s expectations by taking a moment to talk to her after class on the first day. Ask her what she looks for in an A+ student and how you can do well in the class. Let her know that you are determined to do well in the class and participate in class discussions. This will ensure she remembers your name in a sea of other students and recognizes you as a potentially high performing student.

, Another way to show the professor that you are engaged in the class and on top of your studies is to hand in assignments by the due date and according to her requirements.This means checking the class syllabus for her rules and requirements around formatting assignments and completing them. Follow all noted requirements for the assignments, from the type of font specified, to font size to margin size and spacing. If the professor would like a title page for the assignment, make sure you create a title page. You should also always check that you have included your name on every page of the assignment and page numbers, as most professors will appreciate these details.
You may also want to email the professor if you are unclear about any of the required formatting for any of the assignments, as it is better to ask than to hand in the assignment in an incorrect format that will lead to docked points or marks.

, To foster a strong, healthy relationship with your professor, you should try to set up at least one in person meeting with the professor during the semester. This will show the professor that you are engaged and motivated.

Set up the meeting during the professor’s office hours, if she has them. Email her in advance and note what you would like to discuss in the email. Show up on time for your appointment with the professor and prepared to discuss any issues you may be having in the course.
If possible, try to have one in person meeting at the beginning of the semester and one in person meeting at the end of the semester. This will ensure you have check ins with the professor during crucial times in the term.
If you are struggling in the class, do not hesitate to set up an in person meeting with the professor, as most professors will appreciate students who want to work on their poor grade. The professor may show leniency towards you or allow you to do bonus assignments to make up any marks you lost out on in the class. This will bring you one step closer to acing the class.

Calculate how much you studied.,
Consider what materials you studied.,
Factor in your class attendance.,
Identify outside influences.,
Consider how much you socialize.,
Meet with your professors.",How to Be Zen About Getting Bad Grades in College2," Before you go into full panic mode, reflect on what you think led to poor grade(s). Did you study and put in your full effort? Did you slack off and skip tests? Understanding your study habits can help you understand where you need to improve. Perhaps you gave it your all. While there may be nothing more frustrating than studying your brains out only to receive a bad grade, you have to remember that you did everything in your power to be successful.
Perhaps you slacked off and didn’t try. What you may have learned is that the days of ""winging it"" on talent alone are well and truly over. Learn from it, and do better next time through practice and hard work.

, Look back over your notes, readings, and exercises. What sections or assignments did you not understand? What did the syllabus say about certain tests or units? Try to see if there was a misunderstanding in what you were supposed to know or do.


Perhaps you only studied things that interested you. If anything was too hard or uninteresting, you might have turned back to the more interesting parts of the homework and ignored the harder or dull parts. Try to power through these parts next time.
Perhaps you only read the bare minimum for the class. Try adding extra readings to your homework. If you don’t understand a reading, go to the library, ask a tutor, or search on the internet for an explanation.

, Some professors take off points for missing too many classes. Other times, missing class could have made you miss key information. Look over your attendance record. Try to add up how many classes you missed.


Were these excused absences? Did you have a doctor’s note when you were sick? If family member died, did you get a letter from the Dean’s Office? Answering no to any of these questions might be the reason why even justified absences were not excused.

, If you are unwell or unable to afford basic necessities, you may struggle in college. In this case, talk to your doctor and guidance counselor to see what you need to do to tackle these issues successfully, including whether you need to take a break to improve your personal situation first. Unless it's too close to the end of semester, dropping one or more classes to make it more manageable may be a good decision. Common external factors include:


A death in the family
Working a part-time or full-time job
Raising young children
Mental health problems
Some colleges may let you negotiate the grade to an Incomplete if you have mitigating life circumstances, or you may be able to retake the class.

, When major life events become all-consuming, sometimes you can't keep up. Perhaps you have a new boyfriend or girlfriend who takes up all of your time. Maybe you are part of a sorority or fraternity that hosts frequent parties. It’s important to have a healthy social life, but if you're spending too much time partying and not enough time hitting the books, you could be ruining your GPA. Commit to buckling down and working or socializing less; use social events as treats at the end of study rounds rather than a nightly activity.

, Even in college, showing that you care can go a long way with college professors. They may realize you had certain difficulties, and they will appreciate your commitment to improve. Reaching out to your teachers may help you develop a deeper understanding about the class, how you understood the material, and how you could improve your performance in the future.Visit them during their office hours, or write them an email to set up an appointment. It is almost always better to discuss this in person.
Although it can be hard, you can approach the subject in a calm, sincere way. You can say, “I was really disappointed with my grade on this last assignment. I was wondering what I could have done to do better. In the future, how should I approach an assignment like this?”
If you wait until the end of the semester to talk to your professor, it may be too late to change or improve your grade.

Evaluate the total impact.,
Identify areas of improvement.,
Create new goals.,
Realize that you can improve.",How to Be Zen About Getting Bad Grades in College3," In order to reach a sense of peace about your grades, determine how big of an impact the bad grade will have overall on your college career. In some cases, a bad quiz grade won't do much to destroy your average. If you failed one or more classes, you may have dropped your GPA. Instead of getting upset, take a few deep breaths and look at the big picture, making concrete plans to fix what you can.If you’re in your first year of college, you may be able to recover easily from a bad semester.You can calculate what grades you will need from this point on to achieve your ideal GPA. This can give you a sense of what can be done in the future.

, Perhaps you’ve determined that you have poor study skills. Maybe you realize that your notes are disorganized or that you keep forgetting due dates. Once you have identified these issues, you can take steps to fix them. Make a commitment to change.


If you are forgetful, you can buy a calendar, mark down important dates, and set reminders on your phones.
If you have time management problems, you can make a schedule and reward yourself with treats when you finish tasks.

, Identify where you want to be when you graduate? Is there a career you want? Do you want to be making a certain amount of money? Do you want to apply to graduate school? Create a list of manageable goals. After you decide on a few, list some practical steps towards attaining those goals.


For example, if you want to apply to medical school, you should keep a list of what courses you need to take, what GPA you need when you graduate, and what extracurriculars look good on a medical school application. Your list of practical steps should also include things like “Study for the MCAT” or “Research good medical schools.”

, Part of the process is understanding that while you can’t change the past, you can change the future. Reassure yourself that you can fix your problems. Once you know what you have done wrong, you can start taking steps to improving.

Make an appointment with your guidance counselor.,
Develop a plan to improve your performance.,
Examine your entire schedule.,
Stay on top of your studies.,
Study smarter, not harder.",How to Be Zen About Getting Bad Grades in College4," If you're concerned about how the grade(s) will impact your college future, consult with your guidance counselor to create a plan. Perhaps you took courses that were too difficult, or maybe you should explore other majors. With the assistance of your counselor (and perhaps your parents, guardians, or other mentors), create a plan that will get you back on track.

, Formulate a specific, step-by-step plan that will help you do better next time. Feeling as if you have power over the situation will help you find peace and give you goals to work toward for next time.This plan should include how many hours a week you will study, what grades you want in each of your classes, how you will manage any medical conditions, and how many hours a week you will socialize, work, etc.

, If you packed last semester’s schedule with high-level, difficult courses you may have the answer to why your grades tanked. Even the most highly intelligent individual should give him or herself a break. Try mixing difficult courses with some of your easier or lighter courses for a balanced schedule.

, The key to staying zen is to now keep up with your studies at a pace that matches what you need to be learning. Staying organized, committed, and persistent will help you to stay zen in your college studies. However, if the studies are not improving after you've made changes, then it's probable that you need to seriously consider changes to the career path you've mapped out for yourself. Spending energy on something that isn't working out for you will only worsen your situation.

, You do not want to spend sixteen hours a day studying if you are not learning anything. You will only burn yourself out. Find study methods that work for you in the future. There are a few tactics you can do to help improve memory and comprehension:


Rewrite your notes every night after class. This will help you recall details. It will also help keep your notes legible.
Do ten flash cards a day. Memorize these ten before adding another ten the next day. Memorizing in small batches will help you remember.
Take notes as you read. After you’re done reading a passage, write down a summary of what you just read. This will help you understand what you read better.
When taking notes by hand, use block letters rather than cursive writing. The results are more likely to be legible and it becomes a habit fast. Half of the benefit of note taking is that writing it down tells your brain to put it in long term memory.
Test yourself after each passage. Do math exercises that test the principles you just learned. Quiz yourself on historical dates. These recall exercises will prepare you for the real test."

The earlier you apply in the application cycle, the more—and the better—aid you will get.The FAFSA application opens on October 1 of the year before the next school year. If you’ll be attending school in the 2018/2019 school year, you can apply for the FAFSA beginning on October 1, 2017.
By applying as close to October 1 as possible, you can ensure that you won’t miss any state-specific or school-specific deadlines.;
, You can submit the FAFSA until June 30 of the summer after the school year. If you attend school in the 2018/2019 school year, you can apply for the FAFSA up until June 30, 2019. However, this deadline is meaningless. Every state, and every school, has its own deadlines for applying for the FAFSA. You need to meet those deadlines if you want to receive financial aid., Every state has its own deadlines for when you must complete the FAFSA if you want to qualify for state aid. Use the tool at https://fafsa.ed.gov/deadlines.htm to find the deadline for the state where you’ll be applying to school.If you’re applying to schools in more than one state, check the deadlines for each state and make sure you get the FAFSA in by the earliest deadline.
Remember, you’ll be in the best shape if you apply as close to October 1 date as possible.

, Contact the financial aid offices of each school you’re applying to get their FAFSA deadlines. Many schools have their own deadlines for when you must complete the FAFSA. Two schools within the same state may have different deadlines, so it’s important to check with each school you’ll be applying to.There is no tool on the FAFSA website to check individual schools’ deadlines.
School-specific deadlines are often earlier than state-specific deadlines.

, Go online to https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out/dependency#dependency-questions and look through the list of questions there. If you can answer “yes” to any of the questions, you are an independent. This matters for one reason: you’ll probably get more aid if you’re an independent. As an independent the FAFSA will only ask for your own financial information when calculating your aid; as a dependent you’ll have to provide your parents’ financial information as well, and this will usually bring down your overall aid package.You’ll be asked questions to determine your dependency status on the FAFSA. However, it’s good to know it ahead of time so you know what documents you’ll need to complete the FAFSA. If you’re a dependent, you’ll need your parents financial information as well as your own.

, If you’re a US citizen, you’ll need your social security number to enter into the FAFSA application. If you’re not a US citizen, the FAFSA will ask for your alienage registration number., You’ll need your Federal Tax Return as well as copies of any W2s.Depending on when you apply for the FAFSA, you can use the prior year’s tax returns or the prior-prior year’s tax returns. For example, if you apply on October 1, 2017, you can use your 2016 tax return. If you wait to apply until May 1, 2018, you can either use your 2016 tax return or your 2017 tax return.
Request copies of your W2s if you don’t have them on hand.

, The FAFSA will ask you how much money you have in your bank account and the value of any investments you have. For purposes of the FAFSA, “investments” means stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and retirement plans., If you’re a dependent, you’ll need your parents’ Federal Tax Return, W2s, bank account statements, and investment information.Tell you parents why you need the information. For example, you might say, “I want to go to college and I’ll probably need financial aid. The FAFSA asks for parental financial information and I can’t get any financial aid without it.”
If your parents are hesitant to hand over copies of their financial information, tell them that they can enter the information themselves on the FAFSA website.

, This is the only website you should use when applying for the FAFSA. Other sites may be scams trying to get your personal information., Look at the top of the fafsa.gov page for the lock icon that says “FSA ID” underneath it. Click on the lock. On the new page, scroll down to the button reading “Create an FSA ID Now.” Click the button. On the new page, fill in your personal information and click “Finish” to generate your FSA ID.Write your FSA ID somewhere that you remember. Ideally, this should be somewhere on your computer so you can simply search for “FSA ID” and it will show up. You’ll be using this same ID every year you apply for the FAFSA and it’s a hassle trying to get a new one if you lose it.

, Go back to https://fafsa.gov/ and click on “Start a New FAFSA.” Click on “Enter your (the student’s) FSA ID,” and enter your FSA ID and password., The application will ask for basic information like your name and address, as well as financial information. Use the tax forms, bank statements, and investment documents that you gathered earlier to fill out the financial information., There will be a screen that asks what schools you’re apply to. You’ll see a dropdown menu that lists each state. Select the state where the school you’ll be applying to is located. You’ll see another dropdown menu appear that lists all of the schools in that state. Select you school.If you’re applying to more than one school, click on “Add Another School,” and repeat the process.
If you decide to apply to more schools later on, you can log back in to your application and add these schools.

, If your parents provided you with the necessary documents, you can fill out this section by yourself. Otherwise, you’ll have to have your parents log-in to your application to enter the information.Tell your parents to go to https://fafsa.ed.gov/ and click on “Login.” They won’t be able to use your pin to log-in. Instead, tell them to click on the button labeled “Enter the student’s information.” They’ll need to enter your full name, social security number, and date of birth. Then they can enter their financial information into the application.

, Once you have everything filled correctly, click “Submit.”


Double-check that everything on your application is correct before submitting.

, After you submit the FAFSA, your financial information will be analyzed to determine how much aid you qualify for. A SAR report will be sent to you for review. It usually takes about 3-5 days to arrive.Review the SAR carefully to check for any errors you or the government may have made on the form.

, The EFC will appear on the front page of your SAR. It tells you how much your family is expected to contribute to your educational expenses. Your aid will be reduced by the amount of your EFC.Note: this only applies if you are a dependent. If you’re an independent, you will likely have no EFC unless you are independently wealthy.
If you think your EFC it too high, contact the financial aid office at one of the schools you are applying to. They can help you determine if there has been an error or if an unexpected circumstance, such as a sudden drop in your family’s income, might change your EFC., The FAFSA should automatically be sent to every school you put in the application. However, you should double check that this happened by calling each school’s financial aid department. You don’t want to miss out on any first-come, first serve aid.

, Each school that you are accepted to will send you a financial aid package that tells you what financial aid your qualify for. You should only accept as much financial aid as you need to pay for school. You may be offered more than you need.There are three types of aid you may be offered: 1) Grants/scholarships; 2) Loans; 3) Work Study. Grants and scholarships do not need to be repaid. Loans do need to be repaid. Different types of loans will be offered to you depending on your financial circumstance. Work Study aid requires you to work for the school in some capacity, and you will be paid for this work so it does not be to be repaid., You need to resubmit the FAFSA every year. If your personal and financial circumstances haven’t changed, this will just be a matter of scrolling through the application and clicking “Submit.” If something has changed, however, you’ll need to amend your application before you submit."

Find out who the professor is for your creative writing class, and find out what creative works he or she has had published recently.,
Pay particular attention to your professor's preferred style.,
As you read through the chapters, notice how the plot develops.,
Find as many people as you can who have taken a class from this professor.,
Listen closely in the first few class periods.,
Think of a theme before you create your story.,
Choose an interesting setting.,
Create interesting characters.,
Create a story with a beginning, middle and end.,
Accept constructive criticism.,
Revise your story into a final draft.,
Turn your story in on time.

,
Keep trying.",How to Ace College Creative Writing," Check them out and read them. If you can, find out your professor's favorite authors, especially those that have influenced your professor's writing.;
, Is the tone serious and subdued? Rough and harsh? Dramatic and elegant? See if you can emulate the style in a few sentences of your own.

, Does a lot of action take place in a short time, or is much of the writing given over to detailed description? Most writers emphasize either action, description or dialogue. You'll want to know which you should favor in your writing for this class.

, They can be your most helpful resource. Ask them what the professor is looking for and they'll give you a good blunt answer. Two students of a screenwriting professor at a state university helped several other students succeed in his class with one simple tip: The professor liked scripts with a good dose of profanity in them; although he didn't realize it, this was what he meant when he said he wanted the dialogue to be ""natural."" A simple sprinkling of rudeness and rough language moved one student up from a C to an A.

, Your professor will mention some of his or her pet peeves about writing style. The most common pet peeves are writing in the passive voice and using adverbs. (Although all good writers use these sometimes, you are a mere undergraduate and haven't earned your license to do so.) Learn what these are and avoid them at all times. A good resource is a tiny, easy-to-read guide called The Elements of Style (see below).

, Again, choose something similar to what your professor favors. If he or she writes about oppressed characters mired in futile struggles, don't make your story about a golden hero who clears every hurdle with brilliant ease. It will annoy your instructor and your writing will be judged as ""unrealistic."" Conversely, if your instructor loves stories about spiritual hope, don't let your dark, brooding side come out too much in your writing.

, A foreign country is always good.

, It's okay to dramatize their personalities a little. No one wants to read a story full of characters that are no more interesting than their own friends and family.

, In the beginning, you might make one of your characters want something that's out of reach. In the middle, you'll create a conflict that prevents the character from getting what he wants, and in the end, you will resolve the conflict (either with success or failure).

, Most creative writing classes involve some kind of peer critique process. Most of your classmates will either deliver vague criticism of everything you write no matter how good it is, or vague praise of everything you write no matter how bad it is. This is because most aspiring young creative writers don't like to read amateur fiction nearly as much as they like to write it. They may not have taken more than a minute or two to read your story. Don't take it personally, and be the better person who gives specific helpful comments.

, Make sure it's free of spelling, grammar and usage errors. Here is where the peer critiques can be useful, provided that your classmates have reference materials and will double-check whether their corrections were correct.

,, If you didn't get an A, find out who did. Take careful note of the professor's feedback, and try again.

Determine whether you can file as an independent or as part of your family unit.,
Make sure that all relevant information is documented and in order.,
Double-check all deadlines and make sure to have the information together well before the form's due date.

,
Narrow down potential colleges by researching their typical aid packages and what would be feasible with or without financial assistance.

,
Begin filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as soon as possible after January 1st of the year the aid is to be deployed.,
Answer all questions on the FAFSA.,
List the colleges that should receive these results.,
Sign the FAFSA with a personal PIN if filing online.,
Wait for the SAR (Student Aid Report) to come in the mail.,
Complete the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE if any of your chosen colleges requires it in addition to the FAFSA.,
Research scholarships that are specific to the schools you are applying to or to your student profile.,
When the aid package has been determined, speak with the bursar at each school.",How to Apply for Financial Aid for College,"


Decide carefully. Independent students often receive more advantageous aid packages, but are expected to handle all fees by themselves and must reside alone.
If you are a dependent and your parents are separated or divorced, use the parent who provides the primary residence and support; the other parent's information is not relevant.;
,

You will need documentation of things like your parents' household income, education level and profession, house value and any investments, along with personal income and assets. If possible, have all income taxes completed by the time application season rolls around; this will provide a much more accurate and up-to-date aid evaluation.

,,, Log in to http://www.fafsa.gov to get the process started. If you are unable to complete the FAFSA online, it is available as a paper form you can mail or as a PDF you can submit by email in both English and Spanish.
Completing the FAFSA online requires a PIN, or personal identification number. This number takes a few days to be deployed, so don't put off applying until the last minute. , Be as accurate and honest as possible with regard to the facts and figures, as these will be checked before payment is disbursed.

, Up to 10 colleges can be included in the initial FAFSA application, and more can be added for a small fee. , If filing a paper version, sign and mail in the signature page.

, This document, in addition to the individual colleges' responses, will provide a comprehensive overview of the financial aid situation to be had at each. ,


Note that while the CSS PROFILE can be completed early, in the fall prior to the year for which aid is being requested, it requires a submission fee of between $5 and $18 per school.
The CSS PROFILE evaluates students for non-federal financial aid, so it can be very useful for discovering scholarship programs if your parents are over the income brackets where federal programs offer need-based aid. ,


Possible things that can convey scholarship eligibility are athletic endeavors, public service or charitable activities, racial or ethnic background, aptitude for a specific subject, or personal hobbies.
Make sure applications and essays for these scholarships are submitted well in advance of the due date, as the competition can be fierce.

,


Colleges will often be flexible with students on a case by case basis, particularly individuals that have a sincere desire to attend the institution but can't quite meet tuition.

Know the maximum.",How to Apply for a Pell Grant," The first step in filling out the FAFSA is creating an ID. The FSA ID works much like other websites, in that you'll use a username and password to log into the FAFSA website. To set it up, you go to the FAFSA website and click on ""Start a New FAFSA."" On the next page, click ""Enter your (the student's) FSA ID."" Under that option, it will give you a link to click to create a FSA ID.You'll need to first enter your email, a username, and a password, as well as state that you are over 13-years-old.
Next, you'll provide some biographical information, including your address, phone number, and date of birth. You'll also need to enter your Social Security number.
Finally, you submit the information. Once you've submitted, you'll need to verify your email address by clicking on a link they send to your email.
The FAFSA ID has replaced the use of a pin number on the website.;
, Once you've got a FSA ID, you can start a new application by logging in and clicking on ""Start a New FAFSA."" If you've filled out the FAFSA before and you have a return log-in, you'll have the option of just updating your information from the previous year., You must list the schools you want your financial information sent to. You will need to look up the school code for each school, though the FAFSA will help you find this information. You can list 10 schools at the time you fill out the form, though you can add more later if you need to do so.In some cases, you'll need to list your schools in a specific order. For instance, you often must list the state schools first to be eligible for certain kinds of aid.
You can look up your state on https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out/school-list#order to find out how you must list your schools.

, To officially determine your dependency status, you will need to go through the FAFSA's questions about dependency. It will ask you basic questions such as your age, whether you have children, and whether you are married. Just answer ""Yes"" or ""No"" to each one., If you haven't already, you'll need to fill in or update your biographical information. You'll also need to provide the information you've gathered on your parents, including their Social Security numbers and their driver's license numbers., The FAFSA will ask you about your finances and your parents' finances. It will also ask you about any assets you have. You need to fill this information in to the best of your ability. The FAFSA will also prompt you to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to bring in information from the IRS. You don't have to use it, but it can make the process simpler.The IRS Data Retrieval Tool can keep you from making mistakes, but it means you will have needed to file your taxes already for the year.
The FAFSA will also ask you about what's in your savings and checking accounts.
Don't forget you will need this information for your parents as well, if you're classified as a dependent.

, When submitting, make sure to use your FSA ID to do it so it will go faster. Click ""Submit,"" and wait for the confirmation page on screen, which will also be sent to your email. However, you should still print the confirmation page you see, as it has extra information on it., When you fill out the FAFSA, you can file as a dependent, where you must also use your parents' income to determine aid, or an independent, where only your income is determined. However, you don't get to choose which you file as. Rather, the FAFSA will ask you a series of questions to determine if you are a dependent or independent student.To file independently, you must be over 24-years-old or working on a postgraduate degree, with a few exceptions.
You can also file as an independent if you have children yourself, you're married, you're an orphan, or you are active duty military. You may also be considered independent if you are an emancipated minor.
Other reasons for filling independently are considered on a case-by-case basis, but it is fairly difficult to gain independent status.

, You need some very specific information and documents when filling out the FAFSA. It's better to have them all together before you begin, so you're not constantly leaping up to go get something else.As stated, you'll need your Social Security number, but you'll also need your parents' Social Security numbers, as well, if you're filing a dependent. In addition, you need your driver's license and your parents' driver's licenses, if you have driver's licenses. If you are not a citizen, you'll need your Alien Registration number.
You'll need your tax information, including your 1040 forms, as well as information on non-taxed income. However, the FAFSA will also allow you to pull in your tax return from the IRS using a the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. If you're not a citizen, you'll need tax forms from your home country. If you're filing as a dependent, you'll also need this information for your parents.
You'll need any information on other assets owned by you or your family, including business assets, farming assets, and stocks and bonds, but not including your house.

, You can file your FAFSA as soon as you have your tax information. It's important to do it early. Some financial aid runs out, and whoever files first gets the aid. Therefore, it's important to file as soon as you possibly can., When you get stuck, look for the ""Help and Hints"" on each page. They can help you get moving again when you don't know how to answer a question. You can also get live help by finding the ""Help"" section of the website and finding the ""Chat With Us"" option, only available during business hours. Sometimes your school's financial aid office can also help., As you fill out your FAFSA, you may need to save your work and come back later. The FAFSA has a save key so you can do just that. You can also save the application so other people, such as your parents, can open it elsewhere., Pell grants are only available for undergraduates. Therefore, you won't receive a Pell grant if you are completing a postgraduate degree, such as a master's or a doctorate. You can be at a traditional 4-year school or a vocational or trade school to receive Pell grant.You also aren't eligible if you've already earned a bachelor's degree. You must be working on your first bachelor's degree.

, To receive financial aid from the government in general, you must be enrolled at an eligible university. In other words, you must be in school to receive financial aid, as financial aid is for the purpose of finishing a degree.However, you will fill out your FAFSA before you start school. You must fill out the FAFSA the January or February in advance of the fall you plan to go to school.
Most universities and community colleges are eligible, as long as they are properly accredited.

, To receive federal aid, you need to be a citizen of the United States. The exception to this rule is that you can have a green card and still be considered an eligible non-citizen. Both of these statuses qualify you to receive general financial aid., The amount you receive, if you receive any Pell grant, will be based partially on you or your family's financial need. However, it will also be based on how much your school is, as well as whether you plan to go full or part time.Your financial need is determined by a formula that the government uses to figure out your family's estimated contribution. The formula starts with a percentage of your family's net income with expenses taking out for living and taxes, as well as a part of your family's net assets (the formula only uses a part of your assets, leaving some as a ""protection allowance"").
The formula takes into account your family size and the number of kids in the family going to college at the time.

, At most, you will receive $5,775 per year as a Pell grant, at least in the 2015-2016 year, and most people will not be awarded the full amount. Pell grants will likely not cover all of your schooling, with the possible exception of a community college or vocational school."

Enter the highest level of education that your parents completed.,
Pay your bills before applying.,
Manage investments.",How to Get Financial Aid for College1," Filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, is the first task to complete to see about getting free money for school. The FAFSA application is available online from October 1st each year. Be sure to fill it out as early as you can. Applying early will ensure that you can get the maximum amount of aid. FAFSA forms cover federal aid and state-specific aid, so there are several deadlines you need to keep in mind:Make your school deadline. Check with your schools of choice and ask when they need your FAFSA form. This information will probably be available on their Office of Financial Aid website. If it isn't, you can call.
Find out your state deadline. Apply early enough to make your state's cut off in order to receive state-specific grants. This can be found here: https://fafsa.gov/deadlines.htm

The federal deadline isn't until the school year starts, around June 30th, so it shouldn't affect you.
You can apply for your FAFSA before you are admitted by a college. However, you won't actually be awarded the money until after you are accepted.;
, The application will ask for information about your education, your plans for college, and your and your parents’ finances. Filing your FAFSA will determine your eligibility for a number of grants, scholarships, or loans.


Go here to complete this application: http://www.fafsa.ed.gov

Fill this out with the help of your parent or guardian if possible.

, If your parents or guardians are helping you pay for college, you'll need their information as well as your own. Ask them for help if they are available to help you. You'll need:Your social Security number
Your alien registration number (if you are not a citizen)
Your parent's social security numbers (if they are helping you pay for college)
Your driver's license (if you have one)
Federal tax information or tax returns including IRS W-2 information, for you (and your spouse, if you are married), and for your parents if they are helping you pay for college. Forms might include:

IRS 1040, 1040A, 1040EZ
Foreign tax return and/or tax returns for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or Palau



, Make a username and password combination so you can sign in and out of your FAFSA application. Make sure to record your username and password once you have made them. You can create your ID here: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out/fsaid

, List all the schools to which you are applying. For federal aid, the order doesn't matter. However, some states require you to list schools in a particular order so you can receive state aid. Find your state here: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out/school-list#order


Many states require you to list a state school first in order to be considered for state aid.
Some states recommend that you list your top choice college first. However, if your preference changes you can update your application to reflect this.

, Questions 24 and 25 on the FAFSA ask about your parents’ level of education. Be sure that, if your parents only completed some college, you select “High School” as the highest level of education completed. Some states award extra aid to children whose parents did not complete college., The FAFSA will ask you how much money you and your parents have at the moment you are applying. The amount of free aid you receive is based on those numbers. If you have unpaid credit card bills, car payments, or any other expenses that you know you’ll be paying off soon, pay them before you apply. This can help increase the amount of aid you receive., If you or your parents have investments, this may lower the amount of federal funding you receive. Know what to exclude from your declared ""Investments,"" and consider moving money around if you have the option.

Do not include assets paid into a home or retirement account. Money that you have in retirement accounts or that is invested in a home does not need to be listed as “investments” on your FAFSA.
If you or your parents have money in a non-retirement account, consider putting it into a Roth IRA account or making a payment toward your mortgage. That way, the money can legally be excluded from your FAFSA, which can make you eligible for more free aid.

Reconsider your choice of school.,
Ask for help from friends and family.,
Apply for every scholarship under the sun.,
Get a part time job.,
Work full time for tuition reimbursement.,
Live at home and stay local, or commute a short distance.,
Take a year off to save up the cash.,
Plan early and take High School Seriously.",How to Fund College Without a College Savings Fund," Before committing to a school, be sure to investigate how much you and your family will be expected to contribute to your education, including loans. Depending upon your academic performance and choice of school, costs can vary widely.


Private and ivy league schools offer prestigious diplomas, but they also can mean you will graduate with a pile of student loans and credit card debt. However, this is not always the case. Because of their large endowments, top private schools may be able to offer better aid packages than less expensive schools, and some (e.g., Princeton) have committed to a ""no-loans"" aid policy.Investigate local and State universities. The tuition is usually considerably less. Many offer special scholarships or financial aid opportunities to residents.
Some people save tens of thousands of dollars by attending a community college for the first two years and taking classes that they know will transfer, since what really matters to employers is where you graduate from, not where you started. When you get a degree from a certain school, it means you've met their academic standards, whether you started there or not.
If your grades weren't that great in high school, attending a community college can be a good opportunity to work hard and establish relationships (i.e. references) that you can parlay into scholarships when you transfer.
Research suggests that how much money you'll eventually make is not about how elite the school is that you go to; it's how ambitious you are. People who apply to but get rejected from elite schools make just as much money as those who get accepted and attend!;
, They might be able to give you a low interest or zero interest loan. There is also a type of social investing market lead by Freshman Fund, which ties the child’s Freshman Fund account to existing 529 college savings plans, and then shares the student’s profile with family and friends. Contributions are collected and deposited directly into the 529 plan behind the scenes (no need to share account numbers, etc. with extended family).

, Consider it your part time job to apply for as many scholarships as possible. Enter writing competitions, join various associations, and basically spend every free moment researching scholarship opportunities. Even if you applied for 1,000 scholarships and 990 of them turned you down, there is a chance those remaining 10 could finance a year of school (or at least offset some of the costs of that first year). One student earned almost $90,000 from merit scholarships!And don't assume scholarships are only for geniuses and athletes. If you dig deep enough, you can find peculiar scholarships, like a nearly full scholarship for having enough spirit to be mascot, or $5,000 to the couple who goes to prom with the best outfit or accessories made out of a particular brand duct tape, or full-tuition four-year scholarships to Catholics with the last name of ""Zolp"" on their birth and confirmation certificates., This one is a little controversial because some argue that part time work detracts from the college experience, or leads to lower grades. Most people who've done it will admit it was a drain, but also confirm that they appreciated things far more than if their parents paid for everything. Plus, balancing a job with school allows a student to develop discipline, learn how to budget their money, and build time management skills.Look into becoming a resident adviser; you may be able to get free room and board or a break on tuition.
Don't push yourself so hard that you fail courses and have to retake them, in which case college is costing you more because you'll have to stay there longer.

, Many companies offer tuition reimbursement plans to their employees. Start by researching companies in the field you are ultimately interested in studying. Most company websites offer a list of perks included in their benefits package, and if you have questions about tuition reimbursement eligibility, contact the company’s human resources office (or recruiter) usually listed on the job search page.

, Room and board can add significant costs to already inflated tuition costs. If you are short on cash you might be able to pull off tuition-only and stay and stay on the “Mom and Dad” meal plan. As a compromise, at least consider living at home your first year or two and then look for a reasonable off-campus option for the final years at school.

, Again, not a popular option for most high school seniors eager to get started on college life. But families need to be realistic; if the money isn’t there it just isn’t there. And with many people being laid off, or at least fearing they may be laid off, most parents are reluctant to try to cash flow tuition at an expensive school. It might make sense to take a year off, work full time while living at home, and save every single dime you earn towards the next year’s tuition. In addition, this is a good time to find yourself and think about what career you would like to pursue. Flipping burgers for a year can create an unrivaled motivation for doing well in school and making sure you'll never have to flip burgers again!
The only case in which you really shouldn't do this is if you're offered scholarships. Those scholarships are probably not available to transfer students.
You may also be able to defer your enrollment for a year, and in this case you may be able to keep your scholarships; make sure to ask.

, Every A you get in a hard class in High School qualifies you for Merit Based Scholarships. It is a great way to pay for college and to prepare yourself for the rigors of college classes.

Scholarships can be awarded based on academic merit, athletics, financial need, or on a first-come, first-served basis.
Depending on what school you attend, you may need to apply for federal aid first.

, Places like the American Broadcasters Association give scholarships to students looking for a career in broadcasting.

, There are many different types of grants, including state, institutional, and federal. They tend to be on a first-come, first-served basis. Because of this, it is best to apply for them as early as you can. You will be more likely to get more money from the grant this way as well. You can apply for a number of federal, state, and private grants and scholarships.


If you live in the United States and make less than $40,000 a year, you may be eligible for some sort of grant.

, Most states offer their own free money programs. States may base their grants on financial need; although, some state programs encourage specific areas of study. Some states take information from the FAFSA, others will require you to complete a separate application.

, Organizations give this grant money to students when federal and state aid isn't enough to cover tuition or to reduce tuition for desirable candidates. These grant monies come from the college itself.

, If you live in the United States, you can apply for the FAFSA grant. You might even be eligible for a Pell grant, which is the largest grant program available. Pell grants begin at a few hundred dollars and may be as much as several thousand dollars. It also allows you to considered for all other types of federal grants, work programs and federal student loans.


FAFSA forms must be filled out online before January 1st of each year.

, Unlike grants and scholarships, loans must be paid back. Loans will generally have different interest rates, which will go into effect after you graduate from college.


Federal loans, such as FAFSA, can be both subsidized and unsubsidized. Sometimes, the amount you get and the interest rate, are based off of your income.
Private loans usually have a higher interest rate than federal loans. They are great for those students who have already used up their federal loan limit.

, Some schools will make a low offer of financial aid initially. When students ask for better packages, sometimes the school will provide more assistance. Also, some schools may have offered scholarships to students who decided not to enroll and they may have extra funds to re-distribute.

Consider getting several part-time or one full-time job during the summer. You may not have a lot of time to have fun and relax with your friends, but you will gain more money to pay for your studies.
If you plan on going to school while working, consider getting a part-time job with flexible working hours instead. This will allow you to focus on your studies while making money.
When you do get a job, ask your employer if the company has any tuition assistance programs that you could benefit from.

, It may seem like a flashback to your elementary school days, but most people won't mind donating money for a good cause — especially if they get a yummy treat in return.

, Not everyone is going to share your talents, and some people may be willing to spend a lot of money on a handcrafted item or getting their computer fixed. For example:


If you are good at arts and crafts, consider making a bunch of items to sell online or at craft fairs. People will often spend a lot of money on handmade bags, scarves, arm warmers, and pottery.
If you are good with children or pets, offering baby or pet sitting services. Community centers, libraries, and cafes are great places to post fliers.
If you are skilled at fixing things, such as electronics, post fliers in community centers, libraries, and cafes offering your services.

When friends and family ask you what you want to get for your birthday, Christmas, or any other holiday, consider requesting gift money instead of expensive gadgets, jewelry, clothing, and so forth.

, Some contests offer money, but others may offer other freebies, such as free classes or textbooks.

Pass on the newest phone, car, and computer model.,
Choose good gas mileage over aesthetics when buying a car.,
Search around for cheaper options before buying your textbooks.,
Distribute your earnings between multiple savings accounts.,
Consider earning college credits early while still in high school.,
Consider community college for general education courses.,
Consider living at home or with relatives.,
See if you can get financial aid from your parents or relatives.,
Save money on transportation.",How to Get Money for College4," New phones, cars, laptops, and other electronic devices can be very expensive. While having the latest model might be nice, it is not necessary, especially if your current model is still functional. Unless your phone, car, or laptop is completely falling apart, try to keep your money in your savings account instead.

, Gas can get expensive, especially if you are driving your car to and from school. A fancy car that uses a lot of gas may look nice, but your bank account won't look so nice after a few months. Instead, opt for a smaller car that uses less gas or a car that is known to be very fuel-efficient, and one that will get you to and from school safely.

, Student bookstores don't always have the best prices when it comes to textbooks. Instead of buying a brand new textbook, consider buying a used one; the price is often half of a new textbook. You may also be able to find cheaper editions online.


Some colleges have bookstores close to them that sell textbooks. They are not part of the school or student bookstore, and their prices are often much lower.
Buy used textbooks with caution. Some professors require the latest edition, and the used textbook you are buying may or may not be the right edition.
To earn back some of your money, consider selling your textbooks at the end of the semester. Keep in mind, however, that if a new edition comes out in the meantime, you may not get very much money back.
You can also rent textbooks as well. This is often the cheapest option, and you do not have to worry about the sell-back value plummeting at the end of the semester.

, When you get money, plan on distributing it between three accounts: your regular account, an account for college fees, and an account for emergencies. When you deposit your paycheck, transfer a small portion of it to your ""college fees"" and ""emergencies"" accounts. Whatever you have left over will go into your regular account, and will have to last you until your next paycheck.

, Some high schools offer classes (such as AP and Cambridge) that will give you credit for college.

, Save the special major courses for your college, and take the regular, general education courses at your local community college. Community colleges are often much cheaper, and you can finish your entire college education sooner.

, College is often associated with freedom, but this does not mean that you have to move out and live on your own. Rent is expensive, and the cost of living in an apartment or a dorm room can really add up after a year. If you have parents or relatives who live close to your school, consider living with them. You will also end up saving on other things, such as: internet, heating/water/electrical bills, and food.

, Even if they cannot pay for your tuition, they might be willing to chip in a little bit when it comes to buying other necessities, such as textbooks and school supplies. They may request that you pay the money back, but unlike with a loan, they are unlikely to tack on interest.

, Cars can be a quick and convenient way to get to school, but they can also get expensive, especially if your school requires you to buy monthly parking passes. Instead, see if you can walk, bike, or skateboard to school.


If there is public transportation near your school, try to take advantage of that. Many schools offer student-priced public transit passes to their students. One advantage to taking the bus to school is being able to do your homework while you ride.
If you absolutely must take a car to school, consider carpooling instead and have everyone chip in for the parking and gas costs.

Speak to your potential college’s financial aid counselor.,
Appeal for more need-based aid.,
Ask for merit-based aid.,
Look into work study.",How to Get Financial Aid for College2," Many colleges offer scholarships and grants to their students. To find out the types of aid that are available to you and how to apply, schedule a phone call or an appointment with the financial aid counselor of the colleges you are considering. Be sure to ask about deadlines for applications as well!


Some colleges and universities may require you to fill out the Financial Aid PROFILE. This is an application for non-federal financial aid, which is used by almost 400 schools. The PROFILE application can be filed here: https://student.collegeboard.org/css-financial-aid-profile.

, If your preferred school has not offered you sufficient aid, you can ask for more. To do this, write a personalized letter in which you ask for a ""professional judgment review."" Explain that the school is your first choice, but that you need more aid in order to be able to afford it. Gather evidence so you can make a strong appeal:If your FAFSA makes it look like you or your parents have more money than they do, provide documents that show this. For instance, you might document serious medical bills or a recent job loss.
Don't be frightened of sharing potentially private information. If you have a parent with an addiction (to drugs, gambling, etc) this can present costs that will not be reflected on your FAFSA. Financial aid advisors have seen it all, and won't be shocked.

, Some schools will offer you more money if you have been given a better aid package at a rival school. If you have better-paying options, document them and include this in your letter.Send your appeal before you confirm attendance at the school. Schools will be more eager to meet your requests if they are afraid of losing you.
Ask for ""second chance aid."" Some schools will raise your merit-based aid if you bring your grades up in the last few months of high school, for instance. Others will improve your aid for the following year if you do well your freshman year.

, Some schools receive federal or state funding to offer jobs to students in exchange for tuition remission. Ask the Office of Financial Aid if your school offers work study funding. This is determined by your FAFSA, and does not require a separate application.To qualify for work study, turn in your FAFSA as soon as you can.

Take advantage of the Perkins loan if it is offered.,
Make use of federal Stafford loans.,
Apply for PLUS Loans and Grad PLUS loans.,
Consider taking out private loans.,
Manage your student loans.",How to Get Financial Aid for College3," If you turn in your FAFSA in a timely manner, you may qualify for a low-interest loan called the Perkins Loans, which have a set interest rate of 5%. To qualify, you must demonstrate high financial need. Funds for these programs are given on a first come, first served basis., After filing your FAFSA, you may be offered federal student loans in place of or in addition to grant money. Student loans consist of money that you must pay back with interest in the future. Stafford loans are the most common type, and they can be either subsidized or unsubsidized. If the loans are subsidized, then the government will pay your interest while you are in school. If the loans are unsubsidized, you are responsible for paying all the interest that accrues., PLUS loans are loans given to the parents of undergraduate students, and Grad PLUS Loans are given to graduate or professional students. After filing your FAFSA, many schools require that you fill out the supplemental application for PLUS Loans, here: https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/launchPLUS.action.

, Private loans may come from a bank or another private lending organization, such as Sallie Mae or College Ave. In most cases, it is best to use federal loans instead of private loans, as they have lower interest rates and various options for loan forgiveness. However, if you need to take out private loans, there are some important things to keep in mind:


Compare interest rates. Look for a loan with a low interest rate that is fixed, which means it will stay the same over time. Loans with variable interest rates may increase or decrease as economic conditions change.Look for loans with options to defer payment or make a flexible repayment plan in case there are times when you can’t afford your payments.
Ask about any fees that will be required in addition to your interest payment.
Determine whether or not the loan requires a co-signer, and if you have someone who can co-sign for you.

, It is important that you don’t neglect paying back your student loans, as doing so can negatively affect your credit. Consider consolidating your loans to simplify the repayment process. If you are unable to afford your payments, speak to your lender about changing your payment due date each month or changing your payment plan altogether. No matter what you do, don’t neglect making the payments. This will hurt your credit score and can lead you into a life of debt."

Search for scholarships online.,
Search for grants that are specific to your state.,
Leverage your skills.,
Search for scholarships based on your community service.,
Look for scholarships through identity-based organizations.,
Contact local businesses, religious organizations, and professional organizations in your area of study.,
Seek out scholarships for non-traditional students.",How to Get Financial Aid for College4," Begin by searching on the U.S. Department of Labor’s free scholarship search tool, found here: https://www.careeronestop.org/toolkit/training/find-scholarships.aspx. Try different filters, such as the level of study or the place where you plan to study. Some other scholarship-specific search engines you can use are Fastweb, Scholarships.com and The College Board website.Be creative in the search terms that you use to search for scholarships. Keep in mind that there are thousands of scholarships available for specific circumstances, such as having a certain disability, being part of a minority group, or having a parent in the military., In addition to grants from the federal government, many states offer grants of their own. You can search for grants specific to the state where you’ll be attending college here: https://www.nasfaa.org/State_Financial_Aid_Programs.You can also call or email various education departments in your state directly to ask what type of financial aid they offer. You can search for the contact information for your state here: https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/state/index.html.

, Many scholarships are available to those who have a special skill, such as being a fantastic basketball player or golfer, or having amazing grades in a specific subject. Enter specific keywords related to your skill or talent on one of the scholarship-specific search engines to see what scholarships are available.


While some sports scholarships are intended for serious athletes, there are also a few available for those who play recreationally. Don’t give up searching just because you’re not the star of the team! Try entering keywords such as “recreational” or “club” when searching for sports-related scholarships.

, If you have done community service or volunteer projects, you may be eligible for scholarship money. Type in the words ""community service"" or ""volunteer"" when searching for scholarships to see the options available to you.

, Various organizations offer scholarships to students of certain ethnicities. To see if you are eligible for any scholarships based on your ethnicity, go to the US Department of Labor’s website here: https://www.careeronestop.org/toolkit/training/find-scholarships.aspx. Then, in the left sidebar, scroll down to ""Affiliation Required"" and click on ""Ethnic Group Membership.""

, Some organizations are eager to help members of their community attend college, so they will offer scholarships to students from their area. You can do a quick search online to find the contact information for businesses and organizations in your area, and then reach out to them to see if they offer any opportunities that you may be eligible for.


If you are a member of a particular religious organization, that is a great place to start looking for a scholarship.
When you reach out to a local organization, do not expect that they will offer scholarship money. Be polite, appreciative, and if they do offer a scholarship opportunity, be sure to write down all the details about how you can apply.

, If you are an adult, a single parent, a displaced worker, a returning veteran, or anyone other than a recent high-school graduate, you are considered a non-traditional student. After filling out your FAFSA, search online for scholarships specific to your age, gender, intended career path, and parental status. You can also search online for general scholarships for non-traditional students."

Register for your classes as early as possible.,
Find out what books you’ll need for your classes.,
Write down the following information for each book:


the name and volume/edition of the book
the name of the author
the book’s International Standard Book Number (ISBN), found on or near the barcode on the back of book
the price.

,
Try to find the books in the library.,
Check your library reserve.,
Search for books on the Internet.,
Consider renting.,
Buy bundles.,
Check out local bookstores.,
Consider used books.,
Compare textbook prices online.,
Inquire about earlier editions.,
Share.,
Scour your campus.,
Resell your books.",How to Buy Cheap College Textbooks," Start researching courses as soon as you can, and solidify your schedule early. If you have to change classes at the last minute, it’ll be hard to escape high textbook prices.;
, Go to the bookstore just to browse. Leave the wallet at home, but bring a pen and paper. Look for your classes and the new semester's required books. Ask the bookstore employees to assist you if needed. If your classes' book requirements are not in yet, inquire as to when they will be and come back on that date. You may also be able to get this information off the bookstore’s website or your classes’ web pages.

,, Check the catalogs of your school library and the local public library. If you can’t find a book there, try to obtain the book via inter-library loan. Depending on the library’s borrowing policies, you may be able to check out books for the whole semester or at least for as long as you’ll need them. You’ll want to get on this early, though, because supplies will be limited. If they do not have the current edition, it is likely that they may have previous editions, with most of the same information (see below on previous editions).

, If a book is on reserve, the professor has provided the library with one or a few copies of the book for students to borrow for several hours at a time provided they do not leave the library. Be careful before class, tests, or major homework assignments, because reserve copies are often checked out at critical times; however, with proper planning you will have no problem. Alternatively, buy or borrow a previous edition for the chapter content, and use the reserve copy only for the homework problems. If the text isn't available on reserve, e-mail the professor and ask if she'd be willing to put a copy on reserve.
, If you can’t get a book at the library, or if you’ll need to be able to keep a book or write in it, look for better prices online. Usually all you’ll need is the book’s ISBN. In the search box of your favorite search engine, enter only the ISBN number, without the dashes that separate the digits. You should come up with several exact matches; in the unlikely event that you don’t, try searching by title. Verify you have the correct book using the other information you wrote down. Many online booksellers now sell books shipping-free, which can increase the attractiveness of an online buy.


Shop around online. Most likely just about any price you find online will be cheaper than the bookstore, but check as many sites as possible to find the cheapest possible book.
Check out online auction marketplaces. While you won’t be able to find as many books at auctions, you may be able to find screaming deals.
Keep checking into the early semester––some people change courses and can't wait to sell the books so that they can buy different ones. You might grab a bargain this way, especially where the student is dropping college altogether.

, Some sites will rent you textbooks for a fraction of the cost of purchasing them. Shipping is often free for either the receive or return, depending on the service you use.
, Bundled books save you money by allowing you to buy your books in one shrink-wrapped package, often at a discount.

, You may be able to find a good deal locally, especially once you factor in shipping charges. Even if you can’t quite match an online price locally, you’ll be able to see the book before you purchase and you’ll get the satisfaction of helping local merchants.

, Used books are almost always cheaper than new ones, and if you can, find a used version online in good condition it may be a good bet. You may also be able to get used books at your campus bookstore, especially if you shop early or pre-order. Compare prices to find the best deal. Also used books may have the previous students notes in them which is a plus because you won't have to make them.


Check for highlighting or ask about it where it's sold online. A book that has been heavily highlighted can be very difficult to read, especially as it distracts you from finding the important points for yourself.

, There are many book price comparison sites, such as textbookspyder.com, bigwords.com, and campusbooks.com that allow you to compare prices at multiple bookstores with a single search.

, If the current edition's used price is still too much, use the book name to find an earlier edition: enter the book title in the search box and remove any references to what edition it is. You'll find that the cheapest used version of the newest edition generally sells for three to five times the price of a previous edition. Before buying, be aware that page numbers, chapter order, and homework problems will almost certainly be different, and content may vary as well. However, often there are only minor differences between the two, and the homework problems are the only thing that may give you trouble (see above about library reserve, or below about sharing). Other than that, you will rarely have a problem, particularly for core texts on basic subjects. If in doubt, however, ask the professor or TA about using an earlier edition before you buy; you don't want to have to pay for a book twice.

, Particularly for your core courses, try to take the same classes as your roommates or friends, and share a book. You'll learn better if you study together anyway. Alternatively, get an old edition (see above) and borrow from a friend only minimally to access the homework problems.


With sharing, another approach to allow individual study is to roster the days you have the books in question. That way there is no doubt as to when you'll have access to it.

, Some colleges have student groups that sell used textbooks for older students or that otherwise facilitate buying and selling of books. Ask your friends, look at flyers around campus, and watch the student paper for deals.

, If you don’t foresee that you’ll need a book after the semester ends, try to resell it as soon as possible. Find out what your campus bookstore and local booksellers will pay, and consider putting up flyers around campus and/or selling it online. If your book is in high demand, you may be able to sell a book online within a day, and at a much higher price than you’ll get at the bookstore.

Ask your high school guidance counselor for a list of local scholarships. Many high schools assemble a list of scholarship opportunities for their graduating seniors to make use of.
Search online. Once you know what type of private scholarship to look for, look for scholarship opportunities at the local, state, national, and international levels.;
, Academic merit is determined by grade point average, but it may also be affected by SAT or ACT scores.


Institutional academic scholarships are often divided into multiple levels. For instance, a college may offer a $3000 scholarship to incoming freshmen with a 3.7 GPA or higher or a $2000 scholarship for incoming freshmen with a GPA between 3.2 and 3.6. Even if you do not qualify for the highest level academic scholarship, you may still qualify for one at a lower level.
The GPA requirements for private academic scholarships vary depending on the organization.
The Burger King Scholars Program is open to graduating high school seniors with a cumulative GPA of 2.5 or higher and students may win a $1000 award. The James W. McLamore WHOPPER Scholarship is open to high school seniors or recent graduates with a minimum GPA of 3.3, and students may win a $50,000 award.

The award amount is $300.The Coca-Cola All-State Community College Academic Team Program has an award range of $1000 to $2000 and is open to students enrolled at a community college with a 3.5 or higher. The Coca-Cola Scholars program is open to high school seniors with a GPA of 3.0 or higher who plan to attend an accredited post-secondary institution.
The Elks Most Valuable Student Scholarship is open to any student, but its winners are determined, in large part, by which applicants have the most impressive academic history. First place receives a four-year award of $60,000. The lowest award amount is a four-year scholarship of $4000., Institutions that are known for their sports programs are the most likely to give away an athletic scholarship, but there are several private athletic scholarships, as well.


The BigSun Scholarship is open to all student athletes, regardless of the sport they play, but students must submit a short essay. Winners receive a $500 award.The Cappex Student Athlete of the Year Scholarship is also open to student athletes from all sports, but they must also demonstrate leadership qualities. The award amount is $1000., Need-based scholarships are some of the most competitive. Applicants may or may not be required to submit proof that they live in low-income families.


Federal grants are the most commonly accessed form of need-based financial aid. Students must prove their financial need. The maximum Federal Pell Grant award is $5730. Winners of Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants can be awarded between $100 and $4000.The Edison Scholars Program is open to high school seniors entering the fields of math, physics, chemistry, engineering, materials science, computer science, or information systems. Preference is given to first-generation college students who have overcome notable obstacles, and up to 30 awards of $10000 are granted.

, These opportunities are almost always made available by private organizations. Some only require students to be active in their community, while others look for students who provide service to a particular cause.


Stephen J. Brady STOP Hunger Scholarships are open to students in accredited institutions who have demonstrated a commitment to their community through volunteer services that impact hunger. Preference is given to students fighting against childhood hunger. The award amount is 500.AXA Achievement Scholarships are $10,000 awards given to students are active in their communities and who lead projects that benefit others., These scholarships are only available to children of certain employees, union members, or university boosters.

The Boeing National Merit Scholarship is open to children of Boeing employees.
The Walmart Associate Scholarship is open to Walmart employees and the Walmart Dependent Scholarship is open to the children of Walmart employees.
UFCW International Scholarships are open to children whose parents are members of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union., While there are similarities between the vast majority of scholarship applications, each scholarship has its own unique set of requirements, as well. You should make sure that you meet these requirements to avoid unnecessarily wasting time on any applications.


Verify that you meet the qualifications. Most scholarships require you to meet certain academic, athletic, financial, or character-based criteria in order to apply. Some scholarships are also limited to certain fields of study, demographic groups, or geographic regions. Before you begin your application, you should review these requirements to make sure you qualify.
Understand all the steps involved in the process. The majority of scholarships require you to fill out the application form, write an essay, and submit letters of recommendation. Many scholarships also require you to send a grade report, financial statement, college acceptance letter, or other records.
Mind your deadlines. There are plenty of other students applying for the scholarship, so the scholarship board will not put things on hold for your application. In other words, you must send your application by its due date for it to even be considered.

, Make sure that the form is complete and that the information you write down is as accurate as possible. At minimum, most scholarship applications will ask you to write down your full name, contact information, and a summary of your academic and extracurricular activities.

, Not every scholarship requires its applicants to write an essay, but many do. Some of the questions might be specific to the organization providing the scholarship, but most questions tend to follow along similar themes or topics.


""How would winning this scholarship help you improve your community/state/country/etc.?"" Scholarship sponsors who ask this question are interested in applicants who are mindful of society's needs and service-oriented. Briefly summarize how the scholarship will allow you to meet your academic goals while elaborating on how you plan to use your education to make a difference in the society specified by the question.
""What are your short-term and long-term goals?"" The point here is to demonstrate how motivated you are. Write the truth, rather than the answer you think the sponsor wants to read. For short-term goals, touch on your desire to go to college, learn about your field, and get internship experience. For long-term goals, explain what you envision yourself doing with your degree ten years into the future.
""Explain why you believe that your field of study is important to today's society."" Give a passionate answer. Sponsors who ask this want to see applicants who are passionate about their field of study since someone with passion is more likely to persevere through the hardships of education than someone who is indifferent.
""What do you believe is the most important issue facing your community/state/country/world today?"" This is another question aimed at determining how involved students are with the world around them. Make sure to choose an issue that affects the specified level of society. Writing about affairs that are specific to your state is not a thorough answer if the question asks for an issue that affects the entire country.
""How have you demonstrated leadership ability in and out of school?"" Obviously, if you are the leader of any clubs or a major participant in a community program, you would write about that here. If you aren't, write about more subtle demonstrations of leadership, like classroom behavior or examples of initiative from your daily life.
""How do you plan to finance your education?"" For this question, you should try to strike a balance between demonstrating your responsibility and your need. An ""I don't know"" would be a bad answer to give. Spell out a clear plan, but make it clear that you require scholarship money to make your plan come to fruition.
""Who do you draw inspiration from?"" The question will usually indicate if you should choose someone from your personal life or if you should choose a well-known figure. Explain the positive qualities of the person you choose and write about how you hope to adopt those qualities as your own some day.
Avoid overly-sentimental answers. Your mom might be your hero, but if your only reason why is because she always encouraged you to “do your best” and “reach for the stars,” you may not be taken seriously. Be creative and sincere, but maintain a serious, academic tone as you write.
Avoid answers that “kiss up” to the sponsor. If the sponsor is a well-known store chain, resist the urge to tailor all your answers to the store. Your hero should not be the company's CEO or founder, and your goals should not include “to someday work for a company as great as this one.” A little bit of brown-nosing can be okay, but too much will seem too obvious.
Avoid blatantly unrealistic answers. Do not give beauty-pageant responses to far-reaching questions. If asked to explain what you wish to accomplish with your education, “world peace” is not an acceptable response.

, Some scholarships will only ask that you indicate what your grades are. Scholarships that are strictly based on academic merit may also ask for a high school transcript showing your GPA as well as a copy of your score report from the ACT or SAT.

, Scholarships will often ask for both academic and character references.


Academic references should come from teachers and school administrators.
Character references can come from employers, pastors, or unrelated adults who you interact with regularly, especially if they are connected to a service-type activity you perform.
Avoid relatives and friends. Sponsors naturally assume that these sources are biased toward you and may not take them seriously as a result.

, If the scholarship sponsor asks for any financial statements, athletic records, college acceptance letters, or other similar documents, make sure to include them in the envelop with the rest of your application.

, Every scholarship has its own waiting period. Smaller scholarships may reach a decision after a few weeks, but larger scholarships may take a few months, especially if there were multiple essays on the application.

, If you are selected as a scholarship winner, the scholarship sponsor will contact you to let you know. If you aren't selected, you will either get a form response or no response at all.


Calling before the results will not improve your odds of swaying the sponsor, but if there are circumstances that cause you to worry about the sponsor's ability to contact you, such as a change in phone number or address, you can call the sponsor to find out if there is a way to update your contact information.

, Plans can change, and scholarship sponsors recognize that a student who planned on going to college may have changed those plans by the time the scholarship offer is made. As a result, most scholarships will ask that you write a letter of acceptance once they make the offer. The scholarship money may not be awarded without acceptance or acknowledgment.

, Some scholarships will make certain demands of its winners, but these demands will have been spelled out during the application process. For instance, you might be expected to enroll early or provide proof of admission after you have been selected but before the scholarship is officially awarded.

Think about your art.",How to Apply to Art College," You may be pessimistic about your chances at a career in art, but there are actually many jobs employing people with those degrees.The drawback is, however, that you won’t get hired as Leonardo Da Vinci after graduating. Instead, you should look at the careers available to artists. While traditional college (or liberal arts college) may offer similar degrees, a BFA is fine.


Some careers enjoyed by people with arts degrees are graphic design, advertising, studio management, education, art therapy, communications, cinematography, and computer graphics – just to name a few!;
, Tell him or her that you want to apply to an art college. Your teacher was in your place not so long ago, and will have some advice and insight for you. Tell him or her that you want to prepare your portfolio, and let them help you craft an application.

, Admissions offices at arts colleges will want to know who has influenced you. On the one hand, you shouldn’t trick them into thinking something influenced you by learning some famous names and pieces of art. On the other hand, however, telling them movements and artists who have given you general inspiration is a mature way to prepare.

, You should have decided on a few potential career options. Picking a school that specializes in those areas is the best way to decide which to apply to. However, college is a time when you discover who you are and how you want your career to take shape. Applying to art colleges with a general curriculum is fine as well., Some fairs may be called ‘national portfolio days’ – meaning that you will bring your portfolio to show it to potential schools. This is a good way of showing interest to your dream school. While many movies glorify the reclusive artist who never darkens the door of a classroom except to unveil their masterpiece upon the world, this just isn’t real life. A little networking and flattery will go a long way in showing a school you want to be a serious student.

, In the United Kingdom, this is sometimes called the ‘foundation year.’In the United States you can elect to do a summer program in the arts to get advice on improving your craft. Not only will this help you become a better artist, but it will also look good on your resume. Again, a little preparatory work for your resume, in addition to your artwork, will go a long way toward getting you that accepted letter.

, While you are working on your resume, don’t forget about your artwork.At the end of the day, the schools will care most about the quality of your work. It is something you have to practice at, no matter how much talent you think you have. Besides, any art portfolio needs more than one presentable piece of art. Show the schools you can produce more than one nice-looking piece of art by spending time every day creating something beautiful.

, Part of a good application is knowing something about the schools you’re applying to. When you write the application, indicating that you are aware of the school’s philosophies and goals is important. Ask the schools what they expect from applicants, and they will be more than happy to tell you.

, This is a classic example of ‘easier said than done.’ However, don’t let pop culture convince you that grades don’t matter for artists applying to college. If you are up against someone with a similar portfolio to you, your GPA can be what sets you apart. If you are in your last year of high school, make an effort to get the best grades possible so you can show an upward trajectory.

, This is the most important part of your application. You art is what the admissions committee will be looking at. Pick pieces that are representative of every stage of your creative process: planning, sketches, final products, etc. There are a few things to think about when putting together your portfolio:


Display your best work.
Make the layout itself a representation of your artistic talent. Be creative with the portfolio!
Add unique flair to it. With art as opposed to other academic fields, you can be a little more visually abstract with how you present your work.
Update your work regularly. You want your portfolio to be a representation of your best as well as your current work. Showing what you are creating right now is important., Show them your cover letter, portfolio, and any other pieces of the application besides your grades. They will be able to help you craft your materials for the specific school you are applying to. Furthermore, they will offer you guidance on which pieces of art you should and shouldn’t include in your application.

, You will need between 1 and 3 recommendation writers for art schools. You will want to ask your art teacher(s) to write these. If you have multiple, that is great. If you only have 1 art teacher, find recommendation writers who can speak about your performance as a student. The best way to do this is to think about classes you have gotten especially high grades in, with a teacher who likes you.


When you ask them to write you a recommendation, phrase it like this: ""Would you be able to write me a good recommendation?"" Sometimes, teachers and mentors aren't straightforward enough to tell someone that they wouldn't write a good recommendation. A negative recommendation letter will hurt your application, so make sure they have indicated that they will write good things about you.

, Make note of the deadline for the schools you want to apply to months in advance. Start working on the application immediately and ask your recommendation writers as soon as possible. This will give all of you time to write and edit any application materials. A good application will allow your art and grades to speak for themselves - but only if you submit it!

, While you are finalizing your application(s), reflect on your art. The finishing touches to your application materials may benefit greatly from your ability to connect your art to bigger ideas. This may involve talking about other artists, or more general thoughts about your work.

Interview with your local recruiting board.",How to Apply For Army OCS1," You must be between the ages of 19 and 32. You also need to have a college degree and be a U.S. Citizen. You must hold a 4 year degree from an accredited college.Applicants between the ages of 32 and 34 will need a special waiver to gain entrance into OCS.You must also be eligible for “secret security clearance” upon completing a background check. These background checks vet a candidate’s honesty, sexual history, drug and alcohol use, and ties to foreign entities.;
, Complete the application and SF-86 (national security questionnaire). You will need your past employment, school and address history, 3 personal references, police, medical and financial records, as well as information on immediate family members. You will also need to gather your vital records including your birth certificate, driver's license, school transcripts, and social security card for yourself and your dependents. You will need marital, custody or divorce documents documents as well.As a civilian, your application will be named “DA Form 61”., You will review your medical information, be tested for alcohol and narcotics, undergo hearing and vision tests, perform tests to determine joint function and receive a general physical.In addition to your physical, you will also be required to complete the Armed Forces Vocational Aptitude Battery (AFVPB). This exam has replaced the specialized “officer test”., You will have to take the Army Physical Fitness Test, which consists of a 2 mile (3.2 km) run, and the number of pushups and sit-ups you can do in 2 minutes. Medical waivers have currently been suspended, so you will need to be prepared for this test., Proceed with an interview with the local recruiting battalion board regarding such inquiries as to why you want to be an officer and how you qualify. Write out your reasons in advance so you will be ready to answer the questions.If recommended by the local board, then your application will be reviewed by a national board for acceptance into OCS. If you are not selected the first time, then you can resubmit your application for the next national board."

Apply through your unit.,
Clear the background check.,
Pass the APFT.,
Pass the Advanced Individual Training (AIT) class.,
Undergo a board review.",How to Apply For Army OCS2," Again, you have to fall within the age range of 19 to 32. You also should hold a 4-year degree from an accredited university or college. U.S. citizenship is a prerequisite, even if you are already serving the country as an active, enlisted soldier. If you are already serving in the military, the OCS review board can waive the requirement for a four year degree, as long as you pass the ACT or SAT with minimum scores of 19 and 800 respectively.You can receive a special waiver up to the age of 39.You must also be eligible for “secret security clearance” upon completing a background check. These background checks vet a candidate’s honesty, sexual history, drug and alcohol use, and ties to foreign entities.You can’t apply for OCS if you have more than 6 years of active federal service (AFS) upon entering OCS., If you are already in the military or the Army Reserves, then your unit will forward your application and supplemental materials to the OCS selection panel. Your commanding officer will need to put in a recommendation on your behalf and the OCS selection panel will consider testimonies from the men and women in your unit.


You need to check with your chain-of-command about applying to OCS. Applicants who do not have the support of their commanding officers will not be considered for OCS.

, Active service members are also subject to background checks that investigate their criminal history, alcohol and drug use, personal character, etc. The OCS review panel will not count minor traffic offenses, but every other run-in with the law or the court systems will be considered.

, The APFT (Army Physical Fitness Test) vets the active military member’s physical capabilities. You need a score of at least 60 in each area of the test to apply to OCS. This test is comprised of push-ups, sit-ups and a timed two-mile run., After completing your basic training in the military, you are required to gain further instruction on the job you hold in the military. The U.S. Army requires active service members to complete the AIT before applying to OCS., At least three commissioned officers will review your application and candidacy for OCS. These officers take all aspects of a candidate’s background, training, education, and existing service records into account. Prior to this board review, candidates must complete a 2-page, handwritten essay addressing why they want to become officers. You will have one hour to complete this essay.Candidates will be rejected if they have previously entered OCS, but failed to complete the course.
Candidates will likely be rejected if they have received censures or demerits from their commanding officers during their period of service.

"
"
Select a branch.,
Complete the basic training.,
Attend OCS.,
Know the components of OCS.,
Understand the environment.",How to Apply For Army OCS3," As an applicant to OCS, you will be asked to select which branch of the army you would like to serve as an officer in. Most active combat branches are eligible for selection, but “special service” branches require candidates to directly contact the head of that branch.


Your branch choice will be considered, but you will ultimately be placed in a branch that the army selects, based on its need for officers.

, OCS basic training is different for candidates inside and outside of the military. For those coming from the private sector to OCS, they will be enrolled in a nine week course designed to give them the basic military training they need. Candidates who are already active service members will have completed this step and will not need to complete basic training again., OCS for individuals coming from outside the military is a standard, twelve week course held in Fort Benning, GA. For active service members stationed overseas, the OCS program will not bring you home until you have completed your service. , OCS training is broken down into 2 phases. Phase 1 consists of leadership training, designed to bolster and test your physical and mental toughness in theoretical leadership situations. Phase 2 consists of an evaluation of leadership skills in actual field environment tests. This phase is designed to assess how you react to stress in actual battle environments., During OCS, you will be staying in 2 to 3 person rooms with other candidates and will share facilities, like showers, toilets, and public areas, with other candidates.


Candidates applying for OCS in the infantry branch may be able to get the army to pay to relocate their families to Fort Benning. However, most branches of the army will not cover family relocation costs.
While not in practice at this time, OCS may require all OCS candidates, coming from both inside and outside the military, to complete a Basic Officer Leadership Course in the future.

Start with school or professional letterhead.,
Skip a line and add the date.,
Add the recipient's address.,
Use a name in the salutation.,
Write the body of the letter.",How to Address College Recommendation Letters1," If your current position is relevant to the recommendation, use official letterhead if possible. That is, if you work for a school, use the school letterhead. If you supervise the student at volunteer position, use the nonprofit's letterhead. Doing so creates a sense of authority and makes the letter look more polished.If you don't have letterhead with your address, your address goes at the top. You can use the school's address. You don't need to include your name, as that's included at the end of the letter. Just place the school name on one line, the street address on the next line, and the city, state, and zip code on the last line.If you are submitting electronically, it's best to start with letterhead.It should look like the following address:
Muddy River High School
492 West Lane
Big City, Arkansas 73234;
, Leave a line between your address and the date. Write the month out in full, followed by the day of the month, a comma, and the year. In some countries, such as the UK, the day of the month will come before the month.The date will look this way: January 28, 2017
In the UK and other countries, you should write it this way: 28 January 2017

, Leave a line blank underneath the date. On the next line, place the person's name if you have it. Use ""Dr."" and other professional titles over ""Mr."" or ""Ms.,"" but ""Mr."" or ""Ms."" is fine if you don't have a title for the person. You can also use ""Mrs."" and ""Miss"" if the person shows a preference for one of them, but default to ""Ms."" if you don't know what they prefer. Add the person's last name next.The student should supply you with a list of addresses. If they don't, reach out to them to get addresses. Also, it's up to you whether you want to put the recipient's address on the letter when submitting electronically. If you don't, you'll just have the letterhead, the date, and the salutation.Under the person's name, place the school's name and then the street address. Below that, add the city, state, and zip code.
If you don't know the name, you can use ""Admission's Office"" and the name of the school underneath it.
The address should look like this example:
Dr. Jordan Jones
College of the Pines
2948 Northlake Boulevard
Big Buck City, Oregon 42343

, If at all possible, it's best to use a name in the salutation.Address him or her professionally by writing ""Dear,"" followed by ""Mr.,"" ""Ms.,"" or ""Dr."" and the person's last name. Add a colon after the person's last name.If you don't know the person's gender, you can either use a title (such as Dean) or the person's full name in place of ""Mr."" or ""Ms.""
The salutation should look like the following example: Dear Ms. Jones: or Dear Dr. Jones:
Alternatively, you could write one of the following: Dear Jordan Jones: or Dear Dean Jones:
Use ""To Whom It May Concern"" followed by a colon if you don't have a name.

, After addressing the college recommendation letter, write the letter in support of the individual applying to college. Keep all text justified to the left, and use a line break between paragraphs.

Know yourself.,
Write the introduction and thesis statement.,
The body of the paper.,
Conclusion.",How to Write a Statement of Purpose1," With a well-crafted Statement of Purpose you can persuade an admissions committee to accept you. In order to convince them, you must be convinced yourself. You must be sure of what you want, why you want it, and why that particular program can help you.


Why should the school select you over someone else? You must be able to answer that question for yourself. Know your strengths and weaknesses.
Before beginning to write, think. Review your intellectual and personal development over your academic career. When you can clearly articulate the history that led you to decide to apply to a particular program, you are ready to begin writing.;
, Before writing an essay like this, you must have a thesis statement. This is the one sentence that introduces the central idea of the paper. It must be specific. This statement should sum up the basic meaning of the essay, and signal to the reader what to expect.


The first sentence is the most important one because it gets the reader's attention. Create a strong opening paragraph of five sentences or less. Briefly explain who you are, where you're from, why you have chosen the particular field to which you're applying, and why the university is among your first choices.
Make it count. The first paragraph is very important. It is your introduction, and should hook the reader from the start. You want to make him or her want to continue reading.

, Each paragraph should deal with a single central idea. This idea should be introduced early in a topic sentence, telling the reader what to expect in the paragraph.


Several ideas in a single paragraph will only confuse the reader. If the central idea has several supporting points, break it into several paragraphs rather than having one very long paragraph.
Support your ideas, don't just spit them out without backing—it's like writing a cheque without money in the bank. By giving support to your ideas, you convince readers of their truth and accuracy. If you successfully prove your statements, the reader should agree with your conclusion.
Structure the sequence of ideas carefully and logically. Remember, you are mapping a course, leading the reader through the points that support your thesis. You do not want to confuse them, or make them take the long way around. Transition smoothly from paragraph to paragraph to link them together logically. Use connecting sentences to keep the paper flowing smoothly.

, Restate your thesis and the main points supporting it. In the conclusion, add some new ideas or information to challenge the reader to think further.

"
"
Use a letterhead envelope.,
Add the recipient's address.,
Seal the envelope.,
Mail the letter on time.",How to Address College Recommendation Letters2," Just like with the letter, it's best to use professional letterhead if you have it. A pre-printed envelope looks more polished and authoritative than just a handwritten or even a typed envelope.If you don't have a letterhead envelope, place your address in the upper left-hand corner, starting with your name on the first line, followed by the rest of the address on the next lines:
Ms. Rebecca Johnson
Muddy River High School
492 West Lane
Big City, Arkansas 73234

, The recipient's address should go over to the right on the envelope, centered from top to bottom. Start with the recipient's name. If you don't know the person's name, start with the office, such as the Office of Admissions, followed by the school's name and the rest of the address on the next lines.The address should look like the following example: Dr. Jordan Jones
Office of Admissions
College of the Pines
2948 Northlake Boulevard
Big Buck City, Oregon 42343

, Often, a school will require you to seal and sign the envelope to verify that you wrote it. That just means that you sign it over the sealed edge of the envelope before sending it or giving it to the student to send., Know the deadline for the letter, and make sure you send it in on time or give it to the student. Missing the deadline could mean the student will be rejected for that school.Some schools will allow you to fax or email the letter. Check with the student to see if that's appropriate."

",How to Write a Statement of Purpose2," If you've written a thorough and thoughtful outline, this will just be a process of refining what you've already written. Let's review and expand on the steps here:

, The first sentence is the most important one. You want to grab the reader's attention, and not let it go until you are finished.

, Flesh out the details of who you are and what you've accomplished.

, Show that you are academically prepared for your chosen program. Include the following:


Where and what you've studied
Past research or diploma projects you've participated in.
If applying to a program in a different field of study, explain how the skills you learned in earning your degree can be applied to the new field.

,


Why you find your particular field of study interesting. What influenced you to choose that field?
Include any related experience or research you've had or been involved in to date.
Describe your future plans after receiving your degree. Will you be continuing in your education, or will you be working in your field?

, Describe what and why have you chosen to study in graduate school.


Where your specific interests lie in your field.
Why this program is needed for your professional development, and how great is the need.
Describe what led you to your choice of university—courses, faculty, research projects, facilities, etc.

, Sum up the main points, and describe what you can contribute to the program.

,, Chances are they are reviewing hundreds of applications along with yours.

"
Go back and revise, edit and rewrite.,
Print your letter, sign it, and include it as the first item of your application portfolio.",How to Write a Statement of Purpose3," Remember to include everything above while aiming for 2-3 pages maximum. This is where being very concise and to the point is important.


If possible, let the letter sit for a few days after you've finished writing it. Come back with a fresh pair of eyes and start revising.
Perhaps ask someone else edit your letter. Ask for honest and constructive criticism, and be prepared to accept it gracefully.
Cut the chaff. Is there anything in your letter that is not absolutely necessary, or doesn't tie well to the other parts? If you can't revise it so that it fits, cut it. Remember that whoever reads your letter has a lot of SoPs to get through, and only has time for the information that matters.

, Be aware that some schools may ask you to submit your letter electronically. If that's the case, convert your letter to a PDF before sending.

,How to Write a Statement of Purpose4,
"
Tailor a custom cover letter.,
Sell yourself with your CV.,
Get great references.,
Assemble the other requested materials.,
Fill out the application.,
Proofread everything before you send it out.",How to Apply to Graduate School1," Whether it’s called a cover letter, letter of interest, letter of intent, personal statement, or something else, nearly every graduate school is going to request some sort of written expression of your interest in and suitability for the program. Cover letters tend to follow general formulas and formats, but that’s no excuse to send in a generic letter as part of your application. Shape it into a specific letter for that specific program.


If you’re applying to multiple graduate schools, you don’t have to necessarily write letters for each from scratch. However, make sure to individualize them so that each letter speaks to the specific attributes of its target graduate program.
If a graduate program requests a personal statement that addresses specific questions (like “What are your career goals?”), make sure you do exactly that in your letter.Write a Letter of Interest for Grad School is an excellent resource for planning, formatting, writing, and tailoring your letter(s).;
, If you’re not familiar with the term “CV” (or “curriculum vitae”), don’t worry — it’s just academia’s version of a resumé. And, just like potential employers, graduate school admissions personnel will scan through this document to evaluate if you have the experience, skills, and drive to succeed. So make it count.


Like a resumé, a CV is structured around key components such as education, experience, accomplishments, activities, special skills, memberships, and references. However, you have a bit more flexibility in both document length and the ordering of materials in a CV. Feel free to go beyond two pages in length (without going overboard) and try to prioritize your strongest areas (your wealth of relevant research experience, for instance) by placing them early in the document.Be precise, direct, active (not passive), confident, and truthful in what you include and the language you use.
Check out Write a CV (Curriculum Vitae) for more detailed advice.

, Most if not all graduate schools will expect to receive multiple (often three, but maybe two or up to five) letters of recommendation from individuals who can vouch for your qualifications. If you are applying while completing your undergraduate degree, your best options for references will probably be your major advisor and faculty members who are very familiar with you and your work. If you have been in the workforce for a few years, you may also want to mix in supervisors and colleagues.Reference letters should be current — written or thoroughly updated during the application period — and individualized — not full of generic language and vague recommendations. You, of course, can’t control what your reference decides to write; so it is vitally important that you choose the right people, who you know will craft a thorough and positive letter.
Don’t wait to the last minute to ask for references, and never assume that someone will write one for you. Request a reference letter one or even two months in advance by asking respectfully by email (or in person) and providing all the necessary details. Follow up as the deadline nears to ensure the letter has been sent, and express your gratitude upon its completion.

, Especially if you are applying to several graduate programs at the same time, it can be a frustrating fact of life that each of them will likely have different application requirements. Some may want writing samples, statements of research interests or teaching philosophy, and any number of other inclusions. Make sure you keep track of what you need to send in with each application, and make sure each document has been crafted and proofread with care.


Each application will likely require an official transcript from your undergraduate institution(s). Determine the process for ordering transcripts from your school(s) and don’t delay in making the request. Grade reports or unofficial transcripts are rarely acceptable.
You may be expected to take a graduate entrance exam and report your scores (or have them reported by the testing agency). In the U.S., for example, many graduate programs use your score on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) as part of their evaluation. It is your responsibility to find out which exams you need to take, schedule and take the exams, and make sure the scores are sent as part of your application. Don’t delay in starting this process.

Plan for Graduate School has helpful material on scheduling, taking, and reporting graduate entrance exams.

, While many graduate programs now use online applications, some may still require a paper application. Regardless, the application form will generally require basic personal information, details on your academic record and other experiences, a listing of your references, and may perhaps include a handful of short-answer questions.Take your time, and fill out the application completely and accurately. If you are completing it by hand, write legibly. Much of the material will be repeated from your CV, but never write “see CV” or truncate your responses. Be thorough.
Most applications come with a fee, which often range around $100 in the U.S. If you cannot afford to pay, contact the graduate program to inquire about possible fee reductions or waivers.
Make sure you submit your application and all other materials well before the deadline, especially if sending them by mail. For peace of mind, pay extra if necessary for delivery confirmation.

, And while you’re at it, let someone else take a look too. Spelling mistakes, grammar errors, inaccurate/inconsistent information, and poor writing all combine to form one of the “kisses of death” for grad school applications.Make sure your application doesn’t end up on the “reject” pile just because of some silly mistakes made in haste.


It’s always a good idea to put another set of eyes on your work. You can read over the same obvious “your” instead of “you’re” typo several times without noticing it, while another person might pick up on it right away.

"
"
Create a schedule and a calendar.,
Give yourself and others time.,
Create adaptable templates.,
Get ready to wait.",How to Apply to Graduate School2," As with most everything else in life, organization is the key to the planning process of graduate school applications. You will need a comprehensive list of all the schools you want to apply to. Depending upon your technology preferences, create a computer file or dedicate a notebook to the process. Create a separate page/entry for each potential graduate school. Conspicuously place the deadline where you can’t help but notice it (and also put it on/in your preferred calendar) and provide information such as:


Application deadline
Additional forms/transcripts/documents that must be submitted with the application
Number of required letters of recommendation, and whom these letters must come from
Application fee
Required statement of purpose/portfolio etc. and how long/how detailed it must be

, There are a lot of different moving parts involved in completing a successful grad school application. You have a lot of work to complete yourself, and you also need to make sure that your references, transcript providers, testing agencies, etc. have time to complete their work. Don’t wait to get started.


Allow one or even two months for references and transcripts. Also make sure you know when any required entrance exams are offered — some occur year-round, while others are only given at specific times of year — and how long it will take for the scores to be sent to the school.
In the best-case scenario, if you are planning to attend graduate school in the fall after you complete your undergraduate degree, you should start planning in May prior to the start of your senior year. Completed applications will often be due in December of that same year., No two graduate schools will want the exact same application materials, and every application packet you create should be individualized for that specific program and institution. With that said, you can save yourself a bit of time and repetition by creating templates of common application materials like your CV, cover letter, research statement, and so on.


While it may be tempting to create a template cover letter (for instance) in which you can simply “find and replace” the name of one program, contact person, etc. with another, a blandly generic statement such as this is unlikely to make a positive impact. Demonstrate your sincere interest by providing specific information about the program and your suitability for it.
Likewise, even if the basic information remains the same, slightly revise and reorganize your CV to suit each distinct program. One program, for instance, may seem more likely to appreciate your volunteer experience at a museum than another, so emphasize that point when appropriate.

, After the stress, rush, and excitement of getting your applications together and sent out, what follows is … waiting. It’s hard to pin down exactly how long you’ll have to wait for a decision, as that depends upon numerous variables ranging from the number of applications to unexpected faculty member illnesses. Generally speaking, though, plan on waiting for at least four to six weeks (and perhaps even a few months) before receiving notice on a decision.Try to manage your stress while you wait. There is no sense in fretting over your acceptance (hopefully), as your notification will come in due time. Try your best to focus on other things while you wait — do some exercise, focus on a hobby, finish off your current schoolwork with full energy, and be ready for that letter — because you will receive a response.

Determine if graduate school is right for you.,
Continue straight through from undergrad, or get some real-world experience first.,
Choose where to apply and where to accept.,
Figure out the financial and practical concerns.",How to Apply to Graduate School3," Before you even begin the application process, take some time to analyze your readiness to take on the commitment required for graduate education. Completing a graduate degree will take multiple (and perhaps many) years, can cost significant amounts of money (even with grants, fellowships, assistantships, etc.), and will either delay or interrupt your time in the workforce.Don’t just say to yourself “Well, I’m not sure what I want to do after undergrad, and I like history, so I guess I’ll try going to graduate school for that.” Take time to seriously consider the time and monetary commitments, the potential benefits (or even drawbacks) vis-a-vis your career prospects, the impacts upon your personal life, and so on.
Graduate school isn’t just about “really liking” a subject. It’s about dedicating yourself to rigorous study and advanced mastery of some element of that subject. It’s hard work, and it isn’t always fun, but it can be very rewarding — financially, personally, and otherwise.
Talk to professors or people you know who have gone to graduate school. Look into the job prospects and the “return on investment” of a graduate degree in your field.

, There is no one-size-fits-all answer to when it is right to go to graduate school. For many people, it makes more sense to continue straight through and complete a graduate degree before starting (or re-starting) their careers. For others, financial, personal, or other reasons make a delay more practical and advisable.


If you have an established career plan in mind, and don’t have any impediments in your way, it’s probably best to continue straight through from undergrad.
Don’t feel as though you’re at a significant disadvantage if you’ve been in the workforce for several years, however. Many graduate programs will appreciate the real-world experience you have to offer, especially if you craft your application materials to emphasize this as a strength. Also, many business- or technology-oriented graduate programs in particular are constructed with workers seeking to advance their careers in mind., No one has the time or mental stamina to apply to every potentially suitable graduate program. You have to be choosy, and use the factors — from finances to proximity to specific faculty members — that are most relevant to you. The same is true when it comes to deciding between multiple offers for admission.


When choosing where to apply, take time to write down your goals (career and personal), your career, financial, and individual circumstances, and your current strengths and weaknesses. Talk to people you trust, and to people at the schools you’re considering. Visit if possible. Gather as much information as you can.If multiple approvals arrive, visit the schools you were accepted to and get a real feel of what the campus is like. Talk to current students, walk around the area, ask questions, and trust your instincts. If more than one school looks good to you, it's time for more lists. Once again, give each school a separate page and create detailed comparisons of pros and cons.

Plan for Graduate School provides a lot of good information on choosing where to apply and where to accept.

, Ideally, you’ll automatically be given funding support upon your approval to a program. Even if this is the case (and especially if it isn’t), look into external fellowships, grants, and loans to help ease your financial burden. The program can probably provide you with some helpful information, but do your own homework as well. Pay for Graduate School might be a good place for you to start.


You might also be moving, so things like finding and furnishing an apartment may need to be part of your preparations.
Don’t spend the couple of months between graduation and the start of graduate school just sitting on the couch. Contact your new professors, see if there are any reading lists you can get started with, make sure you have filled out all necessary paperwork, learn your way around campus, find the best places to study (and unwind), and so on.
If you weren’t accepted to any of your chosen programs, take some time to consider whether you should try again next year or choose a different track. If you were accepted only at a school you were “on the fence” about, decide whether you should accept there or wait and try again at your preferred choice(s).

Get denied!,
New or transfer students: If you apply to UMD as an engineering major and you meet the requirements for new or transfer students to get into UMD but you don’t meet the requirements for the Engineering LEP, you’ll get a nice acceptance letter.,
Current UMD students: After you become a Maryland student you can only apply to the Engineering LEP one (more) time.,
Apply: Submit an online application to the Clark School.,
Appeal!,
Consider the following tactics for putting your appeal together:

,
Write a simple, clear letter in business format (to be emailed).,
If you have any related work experience, draft a current resume with the Clark School of Engineering in mind.

,
Schedule an appointment at the UMD Writing Center and have someone there proofread your letter and resume.

,
Gather two or three letters of recommendation from professors, employers, or graduate students.,
Compile your documents and submit them exactly as instructed by the denial email you received.,
Be persistent: If enough effort is made on your behalf by other students and faculty to persuade the Associate Dean to let you in, they just might get fed up and give you a shot.",How to Appeal an Admission Decision to the Engineering Limited Enrollment Program at University of Maryland," Before appealing the Engineering LEP decision, you have to get them to make a decision. The decision of whether or not to admit a student into the Engineering LEP is based on a few simple criteria. If you fall on the borderline of meeting the requirements you will be very likely denied on your first try, so go ahead and get started on Step 2. If you are already a student at UMD, skip to step 3.;
, Before you get excited and tell all your friends, check what major your nice acceptance letter says you have. If it says “LTSC Undecided,” then you didn’t meet the requirements for the Engineering LEP, but you still got into the University. Follow the instructions from the LTSC advising department, and sign up for as many classes as you can that will be useful towards the engineering major you so desperately want. After your first semester at UMD, go to step 3.

, The soonest you can apply is after one semester at Maryland, and you may not hear back before the next semester starts. Before you apply to the Clark School (again), try to predict whether or not your only remaining application will be denied. The Engineering LEP’s Transfer Coordinator should be able to help you guess what your final admission decision will be. The Transfer Coordinator is especially helpful if you have repeated any classes, which can cause you to be denied in certain cases. The Coordinator cannot, however, compute your official GPA. Your official GPA from any courses outside Maryland is computed by the Office Undergraduate Admissions. The Office of the Registrar then combines that with any courses you take at Maryland for your overall GPA. After checking your official GPA, if it looks you’re going to be denied because of your classes or grades at another school, you might want to check that they’re correct (see the Tips section).

, The deadlines are given here for Spring and Fall. Be sure to take the opportunity to practice your professional writing skills by including a resume and personal statement with your application. Your written statements will probably not carry as much weight as your grades, but take your time and use every opportunity to demonstrate your abilities. Now, sit back and hope for denial so you can begin the magical appeal process!

, Find out exactly why you were denied: You should receive an email within two weeks of the application deadline. The email will give detailed reasons for your denial and a link to the online appeal form. You must follow any instructions in this email exactly.

,, Argue why you should be allowed to enter the Engineering LEP. Carefully address each reason that was listed in the email you received.

,,, The letters should be from people you have known for at least two years. Proofread the letters of recommendation to make sure no-one is playing a nasty trick on you.

, Print everything out, take it to the Post Office, and send it Certified Mail to the Associate Dean of the engineering department as a backup.

, Students in the past have reported actual success with this somewhat underhanded tactic of constant badgering (see Figure 1).

The more recognized and accomplished the program, the more likely it is for you to get the best possible education and for your degree to impress potential employers in the future.


You’ll want to start this process several months before you plan on applying so that you can make the most informed decision about where to apply and have sufficient time to put together your application(s).
U.S. News & World Report produces an annual ranking of the top MHA programs that is worth consulting. Each school’s score (out of 5) is determined by surveying faculty at peer institutions, so the rankings reflect the perspective of industry insiders.There is also a nonprofit organization MHADegree.org that has compiled a comprehensive set of free online resources for students who are interested in pursuing MHA degrees, including a current list of the top programs and a search tool that can help you find MHA programs in your area.;
, Once you see which programs are the strongest, pay a visit to each of their websites by either following the links available on the rankings sites or doing an online search for the degree and school. This will give you a chance to familiarize yourself with each school and the basic differences (such as locations, format, timing, and cost) among their MHA programs.


If you can’t find what you’re looking for online, contact the program administrator for more information.

, Schools that offer MHA grad programs are located all over the map. Think about which options offer the most attractive and/or convenient places to pursue your graduate education.If you are not willing to move, you will need to select an MHA program that is either located in your immediate area or conducted remotely. If you are ready to move, pick a school in a place where you would like to live.

, MHA programs are available in either on-campus or online formats. While choosing from among the best degree programs is always a good idea, you also want to make sure that the program you select fits with your lifestyle and learning style.If you desire in-person interactions with your teachers and fellow students and/or thrive in settings that offer hands-on learning experiences, go for an on-campus MHA program. If you would rather not have a set schedule of classes or would prefer to study at your own pace from your own home office, you should opt for an online degree program.

Online degree programs are increasingly popular due to their accessibility, flexibility, and lower tuition costs. Even though online degree programs have been seen as less rigorous or reputable in the past, today, you’ll find plenty of online programs among the top-ranked MHA degrees.

, Once you’ve narrowed down your options, consider the start date and duration of each program. Ask yourself when you’d like to start, how quickly you would like to complete the degree, and if you are able to commit yourself full-time to studying or not.


Most MHA programs will have a few yearly options for when you can begin. Usually, you can choose between starting in the Fall, Spring, or Summer terms.
The typical MHA program lasts for about two years if you’re a full-time student. If you would like to complete your degree more quickly, apply to an accelerated program, but keep in mind that the demands on you as a student will be more intensive. If you would like to keep working while you earn your degree, find a program that offers a part-time enrollment option. Keep in mind that going part-time will double your time to degree.

, Now that you’ve figured out which programs you would ideally like to attend, figure out how much you’d have to pay to do so. The amount will vary from school to school. Be sure that you pick programs that fit into your budget.


Ideally, you want to get the most bang for your buck. If you’re deciding between two programs both fit your needs, pick the one that’s more affordable since it’s a better value.
Most students cannot pay for their degrees out-of-pocket. Find out which types of student loans you are eligible for, and decide if you are comfortable with the repayment terms and amount of debt that you’ll be assuming for each program.See if there are scholarships or grants available to cover tuition in each program. If a particular school offers scholarships or grants, it may be worth applying there for the sake of reducing the cost of your education.

, Use all the above criteria to decide which programs you’ll apply to. Since admissions are competitive, it’s always a good idea to apply to more than one program.


If you’re on a budget, narrow down the number of schools you’re applying to according to what you can afford to pay in application fees. Keep in mind that you will also have to pay for transcripts and any required standardized testing.
It’s also advisable to include a range of programs, in terms of their competitiveness, on your list. For instance, you may want to apply to at least one “safety” school on your list (that is, a program that you feel confident that you’ll be admitted to) and one pie-in-the-sky school (that is, a dream program to which you are less likely to be admitted). Doing this will increase your chances of having a successful and satisfying outcome to your application process, since you’re almost guaranteed to get in somewhere but still have the chance of getting into your top choice.

, Each MHA program will have a distinct set of requirements for applicants. Be sure to you fulfill all of them before start your application.


While prerequisites will vary from school to school, most will require you to have a bachelor’s degree from an accredited university and minimum grade point average from your undergraduate studies (usually a 3.0).
Most programs require that this minimum grade point average be in your overall undergraduate career; however, some only require the GPA to be within your major area of study or within your final years of study. If you’re concerned, check to see which policy applies in the case of your program.
Some schools may also require or prefer previous academic or professional experience in a healthcare-related field like Health Science, Health Administration, or Health Information Technology. If there is a requirement for work experience in the healthcare industry, check with the graduate administrator to see if your job history qualifies.

, Keep track of the due date for each program’s application, and give yourself enough to time to submit all applications materials before then. Once you’ve fulfilled all the prerequisites, give yourself at least three months to assemble all the elements of your application.

, Many programs require you to submit your scores from the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), which tests verbal, written, and quantitative skills. If you’ve already taken it, your score is generally admissible for five years.The GRE is a computer-based test that you must register to take in advance at a designated testing center. When you register, pick a date that will leave you enough time to study in preparation for the test using the resources that the testing organization provides, keeping in mind that it takes 10-15 days for your scores to sent to schools.
It’s best to decide where you’re applying in advance of the test since you will be able to choose where to send your scores upon completing it.
If you are not a native speaker, your program may also require you to take a test, like TOEFL or IELTS, to prove your proficiency in the language of instruction.

, Most programs require two to three letters of recommendation for your application. You should ask people who have a good first-hand knowledge of your work and are likely to strongly recommend you as an excellent candidate for graduate study. At least one of your recommendations should be from a past professor or someone similarly able to speak directly to your academic aptitude, and at least one letter should be from a supervisor or someone able to offer personal insight into your work in relation to the healthcare industry.


You should ask for recommendations at least a month before the application due date to give your referee adequate time to plan on completing it.
If someone agrees to write a recommendation for you, be sure to send them information immediately about when and how to submit their references to each program. It’s also a good idea to send them your resume so that they have access to your general work and academic history to supplement their personal knowledge of your work.
Send a friendly reminder to your referees via email at least a week before your applications are due to ensure they remember to submit their letters. It can be as simple as: “Dear Dr. Williams, I’m just sending a quick reminder that my application for the MHA program is due on September 15. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about submitting your recommendation by then. Thank you!”

, All programs will require you to submit official transcripts from any institution from which you have earned a degree.


Ask your university’s registrar how long it generally takes to process a transcript request. Most schools now offer electronic and paper versions of official transcripts. If you order paper transcripts, be sure to allow enough time to send them through the mail. Electronic versions generally have a quick turnaround time of only a week or two but can only be sent directly to the program to which you’re applying.

, This is one of the most important elements of your application. It’s your chance to make a convincing case for why you should be admitted to their program. The statement should cover why you want to earn a Masters in Health Administration and how the degree will help you fulfill your career objectives.


Your statement will be more likely to stand out if you insert some of your own personality into it. Try including a personal anecdote that illustrates why you’re so committed to furthering your studies in healthcare management. For instance, if you or one of your loved ones was saved by well-managed medical care, you may want to mention how that influenced your career aspirations. Or, if you are currently a nurse, you can explain how your work experiences have inspired you to explore the administrative side of healthcare.
Have more than one person proofread your statement before you submit it. Admissions officers will favor students who have flawless written communication skills.

, If you’re applying to more than one program, be sure that you create a unique statement for each school. The core of your letter can be the same, but take some time to ensure that each version matches the requirements and speaks to the value of the specific program to which it’s addressed.


The minimum and maximum lengths for your personal statement may vary by school. Be sure to check on each program’s application requirements and adjust your statement accordingly.
For each school-specific personal statement, briefly explain why you’re especially interested in their particular program. You may, for instance, want to mention members of the faculty who you’d love to learn from or elements of the curriculum that particularly excite you. This will show that you’ve done your homework and understand the strengths of their degree program.

, You will need to include a current resume in your application that provides an overview of your education and work experience.


Since you’re applying to grad school, put your education first.
Make sure that your work experience shows that you’re a good candidate for an MHA program. Highlight jobs and skills that relate to healthcare and/or business administration. For example, if you’re a nurse, you can mention your familiarity with healthcare policy or management of a team in the description. If you’re a human resources director, you could include your knowledge of benefits programs alongside your management experience.
Don’t forget to include anything else that distinguishes you as an excellent candidate, such as professional or academic honors, awards, memberships, and affiliations. If you have an impressive record of volunteer work, be sure to add a “Service” section to your resume.

, When you’ve completed your personal statement and resume, make sure you have the other materials in place to finalize your application. The requirements will vary from school to school, but you’ll generally need to submit scores from any required standardized test, letters of recommendation, and official transcripts from any previous postsecondary degree programs along with your resume and personal statement.

, Most schools have an online application system that requires you to create an account. Once you have an account, log in to upload each part of your application. The online system will inform you once your application is complete and allow you to press send.


Programs will inform you via email when they have received your completed application and when they have made a decision on your admission, so be sure you enter the correct address.

You can technically apply to HBS with any major, from english to math, but if you want the background that will earn you a spot, business and technology majors have a proven track record of success.
It's true that a large percentage of students entering HBS come from the more prestigious Ivy League colleges like Yale and Penn, but a significant portion of students (up to 70% of the entering class) come from a variety of state schools. Wherever you go for your undergrad, you've got a chance of getting in, but only if you excel at a high level.;
, While there is technically no minimum GPA included as part of the HBS application, the average GPA is usually quite high. Average GPAs for entrants hover between 3.6 and 3.75. It's important to do well across all your courses and keep your GPA very high during your undergraduate education.

, Developing a close personal and working relationship with members of the faculty is an important part of academic success. Faculty members will be willing to go the extra mile for students who get to know them, which can be challenging in bigger lectures with hundreds of students. Make the extra effort.


Single out faculty that attended HBS, if you want insider information and tips. A recommendation letter from alumni goes a long way on the application. Recommendation letters are a critical part of the application process, and can help you to stand out from the rest of the pack.

, In general, it's important for students coming into the HBS to have extensive experience outside of the classroom as well. Completing an internship in your field of interest is a great way of gaining real-world experience and connections that will make you stand out.


Look especially for internships related to e-commerce, technology, cloud computing, and anything based in Latin America, a growing marketplace.
To get into Harvard Business School, you need to have creative ideas about leadership, business, and innovation. While you'll get that in the classroom, it's important to go the extra mile. An internship can open up opportunities for you to make that happen.

, The GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) is a graduate-level evaluation of your business and management skills. The GRE (Graduate Record Examination) measures your verbal and quantitative-reasoning skills, critical thinking, and analytical-writing skills. The school uses these scores to measure your ability to succeed at HBS.


Average GMAT scores typically range between 550-800, with the most number of students spring between 700-750. Again, there is no minimum score required, but a high score will help your application stand out.
International students with non-English speaking degrees also need to take the TOEFL, which measures English proficiency. You must pass this test to be admitted into HBS.

, If there's one thing all HBS students have in common, it's that they're dynamic and innovative future leaders. HBS looks for applicants with the potential for leadership an the skills to back it up. An engineering or technology graduate degree looks great on the application, along with your excellent leadership skills.


One in nine HBS students pursue a degree with another Harvard graduate college. Consider getting an advanced degree in a different field before applying to HBS.

, You can express your interest and intent to apply to HBS by entering your basic contact information and demographic data here: inq.applyyourself.com//?id=hbs&pid=6. This is a great way to stay organized and receive helpful updates during the application season.


This form signifies to the school your intent to apply. The school will then send you information about the application process and about events in your area.

, Always check in to the HBS website to make sure that you get your application materials in on time. There are typically three rounds of applications, starting in the Fall during your senior year, for admission the following school year. Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible.Round 1: Application due in early September, notified by early December
Round 2: Application due in early January, notified by late March
Round 3: Application due in early April, notified by mid-May

, Typically, you'll need to provide two contacts who are willing to fill out letters of recommendation for you. These are people familiar with your work abilities, talents, and academic skills. It's good to make sure your recommenders are familiar with the due dates, online portal for entering the letters, and questions they'll have to answer. There will be a variety of questions, including the following:


How do the candidate's performance, potential, background, or personal qualities compare to those of other well-qualified individuals in similar roles? Please provide specific examples. (300 words)Please describe the most important piece of constructive feedback you have given the applicant. Please detail the circumstances and the applicant's response. (250 words)

, It's important to write specifically and vividly about what you want to do beyond the scope of a degree at HBS, and how HBS will help you achieve those goals. There is only one required application essay, which is extremely short (500 characters), which encourages you to describe your career goals briefly.


It's a good idea to complete the optional essay as well to give the panel a sense of who you are as a person, which has no length-requirement and basically just encourages you to write about yourself: ""Tell us anything else you'd like us to know regarding your candidacy.""Make yourself multi-dimensional. Take the essay as an opportunity to give yourself layers. What's your story? What does your story say about you? Why does your story make you an ideal candidate for HBS?
Pick a central theme and stick to it. You don't have to tell your whole life story. A good application essay, though there's no limit, should be no longer than 2-3 pages.
Don't include stuff that's on your resume. A list of your achievements is what a resume is for. Use the essay to tell your story. Use clear and vivid details., There's a brief and basic application to fill out online, which will prompt you to upload the various scores and documents necessary for consideration. The online portal can be accessed here. When you complete the application, you'll also have to sign and complete:


The Harvard Business School Community Values Statement
A signed and completed Statement of Application Integrity
$250 nonrefundable application fee ($100 for college seniors)

, Self-reported transcripts from all undergraduate and graduate academic institutions you attended will be included in the online application, but you'll need to send in official copies as well. Contact your prior institutions to have your transcripts sent.


Your GMAT, GRE, and TOEFL scores will also need to be sent directly to HBS. You can request to have the scores sent to the schools you're applying to when you take the test.

, If the admissions board is interested, they will set up an interview with you. The content of these interviews is typically private, but it's usually an attempt to get to know more about your personality and ability to succeed in the high-paced and dynamic environment of HBS.


Interviews are usually conducted by a combination of alumni and admissions officers. They're typically done in person at Harvard, but can also be done online or over the phone.
After the interview, applicants are typically requested to fill out a brief written reflection on the application process. Further instructions and direction will be given during the interview itself.

, HBS rewards students who are already achieving at a high level, assured and confident in their abilities to change the world in industry and technology. Students at HBS have a track record of success, strong leadership skills, and the technical know-how to get things done.If you're not sure what you want to be doing in 10 years, HBS probably isn't the place for you.

, As much as 20% of first-year students have founded or co-founded a business before being admitted to HBS.The ingenuity and innovative skills gained from starting a business are highly valued among the admissions board when evaluating a student's ability to succeed.


If you don't start a business, try working for or interning with a start-up before applying. Typically, technology companies encourage you to define the nature of your own job, growing and expanding your responsibilities on your own. This is a big part of what you'll be learning at HBS.

, Most students entering HBS have worked in the business or technology industry for a few years before applying. Many students come to HBS from tech start-ups or jobs on Wall Street.


Financial consultants make up a big percentage of new HBS students. The better a job you can get at a well-known firm like McKinsey, Bain, or BCG, the better a chance you'll have at getting in.

, Harvard Business School is on the cutting edge, and isn't typically a place where non-traditional graduate students end up. Most students entering HBS are 24-26 years old and have only been out of school for a few years. As soon as you get some experience under your belt, start thinking about applying to graduate schools.

, HBS wants students people that will be leaders and are already well on their way, achieving at a high level, not creative types who may go somewhere with the right push. It's a very competitive atmosphere that requires students to have a strong sense of self and a willingness to speak their mind.


Most coursework in HBS is debate-driven and vocal, meaning that you'll be standing up in a large lecture hall and arguing over a particular topic with a professor and other students. It's intense, not typically a place for introverts."

Look at the charter school's academic record and curriculum.,
Visit the charter school before applying.,
Apply for admission.",How to Apply at a Charter School," In the United States, 39 of the 50 states have charter schools. Choosing a school near you will require that you determine if the distance is feasible for a daily commute.;
, Check The National Charter School Directory, which has a list of all charter schools in the United States. The schools and their curriculum and requirements are listed by state, and individual schools are required to report academic performance.

, Plan a meeting with the principal of the charter school to evaluate the school.


Observe the academic atmosphere of the school. Ask about the school's mission statement and philosophy, its academic progress, the types of strategies, resources and technology employed, and student progress and discipline.
Ask for information regarding the charter holder. Inquire about who started the charter and when, how the holder(s) maintain the facilities, what the main focus of the school is, how the teachers are chosen, and what credentials the teachers must hold.

, Charter school admission policies vary by state and school. Inquire about the enrollment process at the school. Some charter schools work on a lottery, while others have waiting lists. The lottery system will require that you request the charter school as your top choice. Some lotteries are available a few times a year. The lottery will then be drawn at random. Waiting lists usually operate on a first-come, first-served basis upon the availability of positions within the school.


Ask for a general application form. This form typically will include general information about the child, such as name, gender, race, address and parent information. Most charter schools will not require fees for an application.
Inquire about other forms necessary for application. Many charter schools will require additional application forms based on their focus of education. For example, a charter school for gifted children may require a test application, letters of reference or nomination forms.

Figure out what your primary interest is early so you can find a few different schools that offer what you want. Choosing just one school to apply to is a mistake -- you need to have a few schools so that you can feel certain you will get in to one. If you plan on applying to the most selective schools, choose some that are less selective as well to ensure you get in somewhere. , Although financial aid is available at most film schools, getting an undergraduate degree in film takes at least four years and typically costs tens of thousands of dollars. Some people involved in the film industry went to film school, but many did not. Having a film degree is no guarantee of a job in the entertainment industry. , For some, having classmates with whom to work and ready-made mentors in the form of faculty is too good an opportunity to miss. For others, the freedom to realize their vision on a personal project with their choice of pace and personnel outweighs the benefits of film school.

, If the time and cost are too much, but college is still appealing, think about a minor in film and engaging in extracurriculars involving movies. Keep in mind that you could always return after you complete your college degree, this time as a graduate student and get a Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) in film. If film school and college are both unappealing, look for ways to get involved in the television and film community where you live. Explore the possibilities of public access television, experimental film fests/contests, or creating online video content. "

Typically, AP courses are offered during 11th and 12th grade, are somewhat more advanced, and will end with a standardized AP test, in addition to a final. Typically, the AP test itself is optional, but you'll want to take it and do well if you want to get into elite universities like Duke.
If you take AP courses and tests, you'll also typically need to arrange to have these sent to the Universities to which you hope to apply. The sooner you know you want to go to Duke, the sooner you can arrange to have your AP scores sent.

, To get into Duke, you need to display that you've received a well-rounded education and were fully engaged in a diversity of activities at your school. Get involved in a school sport, band, club, or other organization to make your application really stand out.


The Duke Office of Admissions cautions students from involving themselves with too many activities. Duke officials stress that it is the quality of the participation that counts, not the number of activities. Pick one or two that you really care about, instead of joining up with the Xbox club just to have something to put on your app.

, Your grade point average is a demonstration of your consistency and ability to achieve at all levels in high school. Trying to maintain a consistently high GPA is a good way to stand out among your peers and demonstrate that you're a consistent and serious student and potential Duke grad.


Pay attention to your class rank, as well. If you're somewhere near the top 25 or even top 10 of your class, this is important to keep in mind when you're applying to Duke. While the GPA is the most important thing, it looks nice and tidy if you can also let them know you were one of the best students at your school.
Your GPA is another good reason to take AP courses, which are typically offered on a 5 point, as opposed to 4 point, scale. That means an A in an AP course is typically worth more GPA points than an A in a regular course, so you can skew your GPA higher as a bonus.

, Duke University requires that students submit test scores from either the American College Test (ACT) or Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), so it's a good idea to sign up for one or both as soon as possible to give yourself enough chances to get a high score. While Duke does not have a specific minimum score requirement for admission, accepted students typically fall into the upper 50th percentile.


Typically, for admission, students score above 29 on the ACT as a potential Arts & Sciences student, and above 32 as a potential engineering student.
On the SAT, students typically score at least 680 on the verbal section, 690 on the math section and 660 on the writing section.
On average, students accepted into Duke received scores slightly higher than the minimum requirement, between 700 and 800 on both sections of the SAT and roughly 31-35 on the ACT. All students accepted into Duke are in the top 50th percentile.

, Coordinate with your school's guidance counselor to send official grade reports and a high school transcript to Duke University as soon as possible upon your graduation, and talk about acquiring unofficial transcripts to complete your application., While you're still in high school, it's important to cultivate good relationships with at least two teachers who will be willing to write you glowing recommendations. Duke University requires recommendations be from teachers who have instructed you within the last two years.


If possible, find out whether or not any of your teachers have attended Duke in the past. Letters from Alumni typically stand out more than recommendations from other teachers.
Be sure to ask for a letter as early as possible in the application season, preferably early in the Fall semester, if you want a good letter. Teachers will quickly get swamped with requests, and you want to be early in the line.

, The Common Application is a standardized college and university application used by numerous institutions in the United States, including Duke University. The application itself is fairly straightforward, requiring you to fill in information concerning your contact information, schools attended and other questions. All materials are due by November 1st for Early Decision and January 15th for regular decision.


Early Decision requires a first-quarter grade report and commits students to enrolling if they are accepted for admission, in exchange for an earlier notification of your acceptance.

, This form is part of the basic Duke application package, and it involves questions specifically related to Duke University, such as whether you have relatives who graduated from Duke University or are employed at Duke University. The form also includes optional questions about why Duke University is a good fit for you.


Good answers to this section will involve familiarity with the program to which you're applying, your ability to name specific instructors or cite the reputation of the program, and the way Duke will help you achieve what you hope to achieve during college.

, When you take the ACT or SAT, you need to request that the scores be sent to the school's admissions office by the application due date. Duke University's SAT code is 5156, and the ACT code is 3088.


Duke requires that your entire test history be sent to the admissions office when you apply. So, if you're not happy with the first score you receive on one of the tests, it's important to know that, even if you retake it to hope for a higher score, you'll still have to report your initial score.

, Each application will require that you respond to one of five long essay prompts, which will need to be about 750 words long, as well as a shorter essay of about 150 words, in which you address why Duke is right for you. One of the most important and useful ways of standing out on your application is in completing the essays and making them as polished, unique, and articulate as possible. The prompts will change somewhat, but are usually some variation of the following:


Some students have a background or story that is so central to their identity that they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.
Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what lessons did you learn?
Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea. What prompted you to act? Would you make the same decision again?
Describe a place or environment where you are perfectly content. What do you do or experience there, and why is it meaningful to you?
Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family., If you're applying as a liberal arts student, you're encouraged to include samples of your work. Students gifted in the arts should include a portfolio of samples in any of the following categories:


Dance
Video/Media arts
Photography
Music
Theater
Visual Art, Part of Duke Continuing Studies, the Duke Youth Programs provide summertime academic enrichment for academically gifted students. If you hope to go to Duke eventually, participating in this type of program during a summer off from school will make your application stand out, and it can be a fun experience. You may participate in a Duke Youth Program any time between 4th and 12th grade, in any of the following programs:


Duke Young Writers' Camp
Duke Action Science Camp for Young Women
Duke Expressions! Fine Arts Camp
Duke Creative Writers' Workshop
Constructing Your College Experience
Duke Drama Workshop

, TIP is a summer-time program available to 5th-12th graders who are interested in hard sciences, local history, and architecture. The program is designed to challenge gifted students by exposing them to rich and engaging hands-on studies that will respect their intelligence and ability. The specific programs vary, depending upon your age group, but you can apply and enroll on the Duke TIP website, found here. Programs are typically available in:


Mathematics
Neuroscience
Criminal Trial Advocacy
Appalachian Voices
Robotics
Astronomy, Physics, and Astrobiology

, The more you know about the department you want to end up in, the more your application will stand out. Try to familiarize yourself with the faculty, their specialties, and the reputation of the program you're applying to. This is a good way to show your seriousness as a candidate, and that you're serious about Duke being the correct place for your education.

, The essays are possibly the most important single part of the application, more so than your GPA or your transcript. You want to show your personality, your unique character, and your memorability as a potential Duke student. Most of the essays will be clichéd and forgettable, so if you write one that sticks out of the pack, you'll be much more likely to be accepted.


Avoid clichéd essay topics. Literally thousands of admissions essays have been written about the time your sports team lost, then practiced hard, then won again, and the mission trip that made you aware of how poor some parts of the world are. Avoid these topics.
Find a specific, quirky, or unique thing about yourself and connect it to your strengths. You're obsessed with butterflies? You've got the state's biggest collection of geodes? Pick something memorable to tell people about yourself.
The essay isn't for highlighting things on your transcript. You don't need to include your GPA or your school successes in the text.

, While campus visits aren't tracked or considered along with your application, getting some face-time admissions officials and seeing the campus for yourself is an excellent way to learn more about the school before you apply, as well as get some insider tips on getting in. And you never know whether or not the person you meet with will remember your name and your friendly face when going through applications.

, If you know someone who has gone to Duke, they can be an invaluable resource in getting you insider information and tips on the application process. Alumni might be in contact with former professors, likewise, who will be able to offer you guidance and might be able to put in a good word for you at the admissions office. You never know."

Visit the programs to meet students and faculty.,
Decide the size and location of the film school you want to attend.,
Research the strengths of each film program.,
Explore the internship and placement opportunities the school offers.",How to Get Into Film School2," They can give you the best sense of what the program is like and whether or not it is what you want. Even if you cannot visit, the admissions office will be able to set you up to communicate with students and faculty about their experiences. Talk to as many people as you can to get the fullest picture of what it would be like to attend this school. It is a big decision and you want to get it right. , Think about whether you want a large number of people in your film program, or a more intimate group. Figure out where you want to be geographically. Los Angeles and New York might be right for some people, but there are film programs all over. , Not every school gives you the same background. If your interest is documentary films, you need to be at a place with a strong documentary track. If you believe you will end up in television, you should find a place that allows you to get experience in that area. Looking at the courses offered and the faculty specialties will give you a good sense of the strengths of each particular program. , Make sure they are the kinds of experiences you want to have. Ask about what alumni have done and if there is an active alumni network that might help in finding opportunities after graduation. "

Create a strong application.,
Take the SAT or ACT exams.,
Choose appropriate teachers or mentors to write letters of recommendation.,
Write an excellent personal essay.,
Select the creative elements (portfolio) of your application carefully.,
Keep track of deadlines for applications and financial aid.,
Be realistic about your chances.",How to Get Into Film School3," For a traditional college or university with a film program, this will mean both academic record and creative portfolio. For a film school attached to an art school, there will be less focus on your academics and more on your creative output. For any application, however, you should begin early and write and create multiple drafts of your application. , Most schools require these for admission. Take these tests for the first time in your junior year of high school (if you plan on going immediately to film school after high school) so you will have plenty of time to retake them if your scores are not high enough for the schools you want to attend. Most schools post their test averages so that you have a good sense of whether you can fall within that range. , Be sure to ask someone who really knows you, your work, and your love of film. Schools take letters of recommendation very seriously and so should you. , For a traditional college or university with a film school, most will require some kind of written statement about you and your goals. Start working on this months in advance. Ask your guidance or college counselor to read your essay. They are often able to give you the most specific help and advice since they have experience and insight on the college process. , This will often be an extra part of the application, and each school has different requirements. Check carefully for each school to which you are applying -- you might have to do a different portfolio for each one. Think about how you want to present yourself to the admissions committee. If you have done a broad range of film projects, make sure your submission reflects this. You could submit a short film or excerpts from different works. If you are less experienced, you might want to explain how recent your interest in filmmaking is and any projects you have in process. , Get applications in early so that you are certain the schools received them. Most students will be applying for some kind of financial assistance. The form for government grants and loans -- the FAFSA -- is mandatory for many schools. The school to which you are applying may also have a separate financial aid form. Read each school’s policy about financial aid carefully to make sure you don’t miss any paperwork or deadlines. , Most schools post the ranges of grades and test scores they accept from their applicants. If yours are significantly lower than that range it's unlikely you'll be accepted. Also keep in mind that many of the most prestigious film programs are highly competitive and accept a very small percentage of those who apply. Make sure you have a few backup schools in case your first choices don't accept you.

Choose the school that works best for your situation.,
Make a pro and con list to clarify your thinking.,
Contact students and faculty to help make up your mind.,
Make your decision and let the school know.",How to Get Into Film School4," Looking at the schools to which you were accepted, look at the college's offer on a larger context. Did they provide enough financial aid that it wouldn't be a hardship to attend? Think not just about tuition but room and board and travel money, particularly if you have to fly there. , Look at the creative possibilities, the academics, and the school itself. Debate locations and financial aid offers. Think about where you can thrive and achieve long-term goals. , If you're still not sure where you'd like to go, reach out to the students and faculty you have talked to and ask for their advice. Many of the students have probably been in the same situation and often have good insight into the final decision.

, Most places require you to let them know by May 1, so keep that date in mind as you're working on your decision. Let the other schools know that you will not be attending as soon as you can -- they might be able to offer your spot to another student on a waiting list. "

Look at graduate school programs for Ivy league schools.",How to Get Into an Ivy League School," Seek out the most demanding and rigorous opportunities at your school, especially in the academic arena. It's often preferable to do well in a challenging program than to be exceptional in an average one. If your school offers advanced courses, especially those for which college credit is offered, an Ivy League school will expect you to have taken them.


Schools can't factor difficult teachers into their decision. They can only go off your transcript. Look for classes that will be recognized as difficult, but preferably without overly difficult grading.
It's most helpful to take difficult classes and work hard in subjects you expect to continue with in college, because they'll also make good grades there easier.;
, Aim to be a well-rounded achiever. A slacker who decides to start making good grades late in high school probably won't be admitted. You should have a consistent history of high scholastic achievement.


There are sometimes exceptions as colleges also love to see improvement. If your problems were due to circumstances beyond your control, you could attach a supplement to your application about what they were and how you succeeded in spite of them.

, Having a GPA in the top 10% of your class is essential, and being ranked among the top few students dramatically betters your chances. Keep in mind you're applying to institutions where many of the other applicants are valedictorians at their school.

, This is a critical part of your overall application because it's the one area where you're on equal footing with everyone else. Aim for attaining at least a 700 (out of a possible 800) points on each section of the SAT (and on individual SAT II tests), or a composite of 30 on the ACT for a reasonable chance of being admitted. Bringing these scores up to 750+ on each SAT section (meaning at least 2250 out of 2400 points in total), or a 33+ composite ACT, will give you solid scores that need not be improved.


Do not repeat the test more than three times. According to Chuck Hughes, a former senior admissions officer at Harvard, the admission panel will notice this and your repeated attempts to get a high score may come off as too focused on scores.Get good before you take it.
Take a test-preparation class or get a few books and practice. Speed and accuracy on these tests is a unique skill which needs to be learned. Start preparing early and keep at it diligently until you can solve the problems without much thinking.

, Ivy Leagues want to see a well-rounded applicant who didn't lock themselves away for four years to get good grades. Join a sports team (even if it's just an intramural team), join a club or two and get involved with the theater department.

, Think on a national or international scale; don't just limit yourself to the opportunities in your hometown. Spending a summer helping raise funds to build a school in Peru will mean more to them than raising funds for your local church.

, Look for opportunities to take on additional recognition and responsibility as a leader. This can range from becoming class president to cheerleading captain, or even an officer for a club you participate in. Take your job as a leader seriously because the lessons you learn in this role can be the experiences that set you apart from the crowd when you write your essay or get interviewed.

, Not all Ivy League schools offer the same experience. Find out whether the research opportunities, location, social life, students, professors, climate dormitories and food services are things you would enjoy for four years.

, Talk with professors and current students. Get a sense of what your life there would be like. Also, try to see if you can spend a weekend there. Several colleges offer that option.

, Ivy League schools are notoriously expensive and they do not offer any athletic, merit or regional scholarships. You must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to receive aid.

, Seek out teachers who know you well, have a favorable opinion of you (hopefully they all do!) and seem willing to write a great recommendation on your behalf. Some will appreciate if you can make their job easier with a discussion or a few notes for starting points on what to say about you.

, What many applicants do not realize is that high grades and test scores will not guarantee admission. They merely ""get you through"" the first round of rejections. After that, the college will examine what kind of person you are. This is done through one or more essays, teacher and counselor recommendations, an interview and sometimes a peer recommendation.


Begin the application process early so that you will have sufficient time to revise anything if needed. Ask adults familiar with prestigious universities' culture (your school counselor, for example) for advice on what kinds of things from your experience to write about and how to best present them to the school. This can help with interviews too.

, Interviews can be with someone from the admissions office of the university or an alumni, and range from relatively nonchalant to interrogative ordeals. Dress respectfully, be expectant of questions your interviewer may ask, but above all just be yourself - or a subtly more mature version!


Find someone to give you practice interviews. Even if they aren't familiar with the process, they will help you stay relaxed and articulate. If your interview does not go well, do not worry. Interviews are rarely indicative of whether you will be accepted or not.

, Most Ivy League decisions arrive in early April, or can be checked online the first of the month. A few schools will send out ""likely letters"" to their more desirable prospects 1-2 months earlier to informally notify them of their acceptance.

, Students can be dropped by schools for drastically declining grades. Any sort of arrest during this period will often result in an acceptance being taken away as well.

, If you have been wait-listed, your chances of being accepted off the wait list are quite slim. Move on to your next choice.

, If you do outstanding work at a second tier school, you can try transferring to an Ivy after a year or two. You might not receive credit toward graduation for the work done at the other school. You will probably be able to skip repeating introductory courses, but you might still have to take four years of courses, which means padding things out with more advanced courses or with courses you're interested in outside your major. Your degree is from the school where you finish, not where you begin.


Some state colleges guarantee transfer admission to community-college students meeting grade requirements there. This can save you a bundle and even let you get in to a prestigious state college - not quite the Ivies, but close - which might refuse to admit you directly.

, By doing outstanding work at an undergraduate program and performing very well on the appropriate admissions exam (e.g., GRE, LSAT) you may be able to be admitted to an Ivy League graduate program. In addition to providing excellent opportunities for scholarship, many of these programs offer opportunities for offsetting tuition and other expenses via teaching or research assistant positions.


A prestigious graduate school can do much more to increase income in a highly-paid profession than a prestigious undergraduate program. For grad schools that focus heavily on grades, a slightly less-prestigious undergraduate program with generous grading might actually improve your chances of admission over more amorphous prestige and the good grades you'll have to claw for with tougher competition.

First, determine whether you'll be applying as a Fulbright ""student"" to the U.S. Fulbright Student Programor as a Fulbright ""scholar"" to the range of programs administered by the Council for International Exchange of Scholars.You can then review program options to determine which fellowship matches your goals and interests.;
, This collection of programs is intended for college seniors, recent bachelor's degree graduates, master's and doctoral students, and young professionals with five or fewer years of experience.The U.S. Fulbright Student Program includes the following collection of fellowship opportunities:


The Fulbright Study/Research Grant is the most typical student opportunity. Candidates design a research proposal for a specific country.
The Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Program places grantees in schools overseas to supplement local English instruction and share their expertise as native speakers.
The J. William Fulbright-Hillary Rodham Clinton Fellowship selects fellows to serve in professional public-policy related roles in foreign government ministries or institutions. Grantees also undertake an academic research project.
The Fulbright mtvU Awards are granted for research into an aspect of international musical culture, focusing especially upon contemporary or popular music as a form of cultural expression.
The Fulbright-National Geographic Digital Storytelling Fellowship guides grantees in using new media platforms to build ties across cultures and enhance mutual understanding. Grantees work with National Geographic Society mentors.
Fulbright Business Grants are available for study in Finland, Mexico, and Spain.
Fulbright-Fogarty Fellowships are intended to promote the expansion of research in public health and clinical research in resource-limited environments.
Fulbright Graduate Degree Grants are available for study in specific fields in Australia, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.
Fulbright Journalism and Communication Grants are available for study in Germany, Ireland, Spain, and Taiwan.
Fulbright Grants in Science and Public Health are available for study in countries including Canada, Indonesia, and the Netherlands., The Fulbright Scholar Programs administered by the Council for International Exchange of Scholars tend to be more specifically targeted than those of the U.S. Student Program, so conducting a search on the institution's Web site is the best way to find programs geared specifically toward your expertise and interests. Broadly speaking, these programs fall into several categories:


U.S. Scholars can apply to Core Fulbright U.S. Scholar Programs, the NEXUS Regional Scholar Program, Distinguished Chair Awards, Specialist Programs, the International Education Administrators Program, the Fulbright-Fogarty Postdoctoral Awards Program, the Fulbright Arctic Initiative, Postdoctoral Scholar Awards, and the Global Flex Award.
International scholars seeking to visit the U.S. can apply for the NEXUS Regional Scholar Program, the Core Fulbright Visiting Scholar Program, the Outreach Lecturing Fund, Visiting Scholar Enrichment Programs, and the Fulbright Arctic Initiative.
The stable of Fulbright programs also includes a collection of programs geared toward institutions rather than individuals. These include the Outreach Lecturing Fund, the Fulbright Scholar-in-Residence Program, and Junior Faculty Development Programs for Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, and Tunisia., You're most likely to be successful in your application if you're genuinely thrilled about the project you'll be undertaking.


Which region(s) of the world do you find especially engaging or inspiring?
What moves you?
How do your educational background and research interests intersect with the previous two questions?
Picture yourself in-country. What would you like to be spending your time doing?Careful consideration of this question will help you determine what type of fellowship is right for you.

, Research statistics from previous years to get an idea of how competitive various programs might be. Don't let pragmatism overrule your passion, but if you're seriously considering three countries, for example, you might evaluate how much competition you'll be facing in each country. You could then narrow your focus to the country where you'll suspect you'll have the strongest chance of winning an award., U.S. Student Program applicants, for example, must be U.S. citizens at the time of their application. They must also have completed a bachelor's degree or equivalent by the time their grant begins.Eligibility requirements differ for other awards. Carefully review the eligibility requirements for your chosen program before proceeding.

, Successful Fulbright candidates come from a wide variety of sociocultural and educational backgrounds. You need not attend an elite institution -- in fact, one of the many goals of the Fulbright program is to ensure candidates come from a wide array of institutions and geographic regions.Demonstrating your dedication as a scholar, however, is vital.


If you are a student, take challenging classes in the field you intend to pursue.
If you are a professional, maintain active involvement in your field of research interest.
If you anticipate applying as a teaching fellow, ensure your record demonstrates your enthusiasm for cross-cultural education.

, Language proficiency is vital to a successful Fulbright application. Critical Language Enhancement Awards are available to U.S. students pursuing fellowships in a few host countries,but in most cases your Fulbright application will require you to demonstrate you have the necessary language skills to successfully complete the project you're proposing., Pay special attention to coursework or research that will help you deepen your understanding of the subject you hope to research. Undergraduates should consider taking at least one course during spring semester of their junior year or fall semester of their senior year that specifically relates to their project interests.If you hope to research maternal health policy in India, for example, you might consider taking a sociology course focused upon South Asia, a development economics class, or an Indian history course -- or possibly, all three.

, The online application period for most U.S. Student Program awards begins in mid-spring and ends in mid-fall, although the mtvU Awards schedule runs a little later. The National Screening Committee meets in November and December, and candidates are notified by the end of January whether they've been recommended for final consideration. Notification of awards begins in March and continues through the spring. Actual grant dates typically conform to the academic calendar of the country you will be visiting.Application deadlines vary for other Fulbright Program awards, so be sure to consult the specific timeline for the grant you're pursuing.

, Most Fulbright applications involve extensive essay-writing and subsequent editing. Plan to spend about as much time on your application as you would on a standard college course.


The Fulbright Study/Research Grants that form the core of the U.S. Student Program require you to find an in-country mentor with whom you'll work. This can be a lengthy process, so plan to start your search as soon as you've determined your geographic area and your general research topic.

, Application requirements differ depending upon your specific program. Be sure you understand what the Fulbright Program is looking for in terms of length, content, and components. To apply for the U.S. Student Program's Study/Research Grants, for example, you'll need to submit the following information via the Embark Fulbright Online Application:


Biographical data and a project title.
A Statement of Purpose outlining the who, what, when, where, why, and how of your grant proposal. Familiarize yourself with your chosen country's program summary to ensure your proposal is relevant. Length requirements for this statement are quite specific: two pages, single-spaced, in Times New Roman font, with one-inch margins. You can access samples of winning statements from Brown University.An affiliation letter from the institution or individual in the host country with whom you plan to work. This letter should be written in (or translated to) English, on official letterhead, and signed by the author. Emailed correspondence is not acceptable.
A Personal Statement introducing yourself to the selection committee and explaining how your background has led you to this point in your academic journey. Again, length requirements are specific: one page, single-spaced, in Times New Roman font, with one-inch margins.
Foreign language forms -- if a language is among the requirements for an application to your chosen country. If needed, you'll submit a Language Self Evaluation and a Foreign Language Evaluation Form. The latter is completed by a professional language instructor.
Three reference letters. These letters should be professional rather than simply character references. Provide your referees with a copy of your Statement of Purpose so they are prepared to speak to your fitness to undertake this specific project. If not originally composed in English, a translation must be provided. Reference letters are uploaded directly by the referees so they remain confidential. This means you will not personally be able to provide any needed translations.
Transcripts from all institutions of higher education that you have attended., The Statement of Purpose does exactly what its name suggests: it tells the committee what your purpose is in pursuing a Fulbright scholarship. A solid SoP has four sections:The thesis paragraph. This paragraph explains where and what you wish to study, along with your methodology (how) and your objectives (why). Think of this as a ""preview"" for your larger project: what do readers need to know to get a clear, general sense of your goal?
Background and contextual information. This is similar to a literature review in a research essay, but much shorter. You need to give the sense that you know how your project fits into the larger field in which you wish to study. You should also present a compelling case for why your project is important and deserves study -- consider it the answer to the ""So what?"" question.
Methodology. This provides the specific nitty-gritty on how you will conduct your project. What will you do? How will you measure it? What is your timeline? How will you know whether you have succeeded in your aims? What will you take away from this project, and why will it be valuable? Even if you are applying as a creative student or scholar, you should have a clear idea of the ""takeaway.""
Defense. This is where you can address potential trouble sources or questions your reviewers might have. What issues might arise during your study? Will you be able to access the resources you need? What will you do if you run into problems? How flexible is your approach? This is where you target your weak spots and provide a sense of how you will address them.

, Remember that your audience is a group of intelligent, well-read non-specialists who will be reading hundreds, if not thousands, of statements. Your Personal Statement should be a biography that tells reviewers who you are and why you're a good candidate for a Fulbright. Set yourself apart by doing the following:Use concrete examples rather than generalities. Do not say ""I enjoy interacting with people from other cultures."" Instead, say ""I actively seek out cultural experiences different from my own, such as going to Diwali celebrations with my friend Kavya and learning how to make authentic Chinese dumplings from my friend Shao."" If you have study abroad or travel experience, talk about it. However, be wary of discussing high school mission trips, which have an unfortunate reputation as ""charity tourism"" among many reviewers.
Do not focus on religious experiences or themes. While these may or may not be important to you, the Fulbright Commission is a government agency and thus cannot use religious information in their decision-making process.
Illustrate leadership experience. Emphasize qualities and experiences that show you are self-motivated, flexible, and capable of leadership.
Explain how this experience will prepare you for graduate school and your future career.

, Don't bog down your writing with SAT words to sound smart or use unexplained jargon. Most Fulbright review panels have reviewers from a variety of fields, so you can't count on having only scientists read your science proposal, or only musicians read your music proposal. Make sure that you communicate clearly enough that a well-read non-specialist understands your goals.Avoid overly complicated sentence structures. Use the free Hemingway app if you know you have a tendency toward verbosity.
Be declarative and assertive. Do not say things like ""I will attempt to examine..."" or ""I hope to find...."" Instead, say ""I will study..."" or ""I expect to find...""
Avoid the cliche. Don't use statements such as ""I have known since I was 6 that I wanted to be a scientist."" Many applicants will use such statements, and they will not distinguish you. If you have the space, use a meaningful example or anecdote to explain your passion instead.

, Don't become discouraged by the application-writing process; it will take time for your application to evolve into its final form. Make a list of the experiences you've had that might relate to the grant you're applying for. Be sure to address why you need to go where you're proposing to go.If you are a student, attend any fellowship-writing workshops your college might offer. Paying a visit to your college scholarship office is also a good idea.Don't be shy about asking for help. Consult colleagues, professors, and friends for editing feedback and guidance on refining your project proposal.Outside readers are especially helpful in letting you know whether you have clearly explained your project and its aims.
Many universities post examples of successful Fulbright fellowship essays for student reference. Perform a quick Web search and spend some time reading essays written by successful candidates. Pay special attention to projects or geographic regions that are relevant to your own project proposal.

, A successful proposal will clearly demonstrate how you'll advance the program's aim of ""promoting mutual understanding among nations through engagement in the host community.""Highlight how your work will contribute to this goal.

For instance, there are many scholarships designed for high school seniors. The best place to begin in the US is the U.S. Department of Labor's scholarship search, here, which searches over 7,000 scholarship opportunities by category and other keywords.


If you are currently enrolled in college, there should be some resources through your school's website that will help you find scholarships. You should also search for scholarships within your institution that are designed for continuing students.
There are scholarship-specific search engines that you can use to find potential scholarships. Some of these include Fastweb, Scholarships.com and College Board.
You can find a list of state grant agencies here.;
, Career counselors or college counselors know a lot about the types of scholarships that are available. They may be able to direct you to scholarship options you haven’t yet considered.If you're from a disadvantaged background, you may also be eligible to participate in TRIO, a US government program designed to help low-income families, first-generation college students, and people with disabilities get into college. TRIO offers guidance counseling and scholarship opportunities., Many scholarships give money to students with particular ethnic or racial backgrounds. There are even a variety of scholarships for students in military families or for students with parents in volunteer or fraternal societies. There are also a lot of scholarships designed for students who are returning to school late in life or beginning at a non-traditional age. Think about your background and search for unique scholarships that you are eligible for.Check the Federal Student Aid website, here, for information on scholarships for students from military families.
If you're a current or former foster care child, you may be eligible to participate in the Educational and Training Vouchers program through the federal government. Find more information here.
Consider also checking websites from your church or religious organization, community organizations, and local businesses. Many offer scholarships for local students.

, Deadlines for scholarship applications are firm. This means that you can’t send in your application late and expect you will get the scholarship. Keep track of deadlines by using a spreadsheet or your personal calendar. Then you won’t miss an important deadline.Make a note of whether the scholarship deadline is when your paperwork needs to be received or if it is a postmarked deadline. If the deadline is when your paperwork needs to be received, you should send in your application at least a week before it is due. This will assure that it's received on time.

, While there are thousands of legitimate scholarship opportunities out there, there are also plenty of people who would be willing to take your money or steal your personal information. Use the following tips to keep your search smart:Don’t pay for scholarship information. Most of the time, the information that financial aid “services” provide is already available for free elsewhere. Furthermore, these services may promise to “guarantee” financial aid or lock in a scholarship if you just give them a credit card number. This is a scam.Be careful of application fees. In most cases, “scholarships” that require an application or processing fee are fraudulent. Reputable scholarships are there to help you out, not milk your money.Don’t pay someone else to file a FAFSA. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid is used in the US to help the government determine your eligibility for aid. It’s free to file and is very easy. Save your money and don’t hire someone else to pay to file it for you. These companies are never associated with the US government.
Be wary of “winning” contests. You may receive notification that you’ve “won” a contest or been “selected” for a scholarship that you never applied for. If it sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Usually, you will have to pay money in order to claim this “scholarship,” which kind of defeats the point., Many scholarship applications will ask for academic records, financial information, and other details about you.Try to gather these materials well in advance, as documents such as transcripts and test scores can take a few weeks to arrive.


In general, plan to have these documents on hand when applying for scholarships: transcripts from every high school and college you’ve attended, test scores (SAT, ACT, etc.), financial aid forms, financial information (tax returns, etc.), and proof of eligibility (birth certificate, passport, etc.).

, Make a list of every activity that you’ve participated in during high school and college. This will include school activities, community and volunteer activities, and work experience.


Type up your resume on the computer. Many universities and colleges now use online applications, so you will probably need an electronic copy of your resume.
Be specific with details on this resume. Include the name of the organization that you worked with, the dates that you worked or volunteered there, the position you held, and the tasks that you completed.
Include scholarships and honors that you’ve received. If you have any special skills, such bilingualism or computer coding knowledge, list those too.
If you have a lot of activities or experience, consider making a long version and a short (one-page) version of this resume. Different scholarship organizations may have different preferences.
Check out this sample applicant resume from the University of Texas Honors Program.

, You want to make sure your information fits on the application form, so fill out a copy before you fill out the official version. If the application form is not online, make a photocopy of the form.

, Typing your information into the form is best, as it will be more legible than handwriting. Many scholarship forms are available online in PDFs, so typing your information into these forms is simple. Some forms may be available only in hard copy.


Handwriting the form is fine if you don’t have access to a typewriter. Be sure to write in blue or black ink and write neatly. If your handwriting is messy, ask someone else to fill out the form for you.

, Each scholarship organization has particular goals. This can influence how it wants to spend its scholarship money. Do a little research on the organization so that you understand who is giving out the money. A good place to start is by looking at the mission statement of the college, university, or institution. Every higher education institution should have a mission statement and it should lay out the priorities of the school. Most philanthropic organizations will have mission statements too. Be sure to address its mission statement directly in your essay.

, If the essay directions ask for answers to particular questions, make sure you answer them. If the essay instructions call for 500 words, don’t write 700. If it asks for double-spaced paragraphs, make sure to format your paper like this.


Double check the instructions after you’ve finished writing. This will help make sure you’ve covered what you need to cover in the essay.

, College scholarship essays are sometimes boring because writers often use cookie-cutter answers to the assigned topics. Make sure your essay has passion and personal voice. This will help your essay stand out to the scholarship committee.For example, tell a story to start out your essay. If you are writing about an influential person in your life, start out by telling the story of when you first met this person. If you are writing about an influential book, talk about the first time you read it. Describe how you couldn’t put the book down, or how you stumbled through it, looking up every second word.Keep things personal. The scholarship committee is interested in getting to know you, not “modern society” or “humanity.”

, Avoid vague statements that don’t say much. Go for vivid imagery to paint a picture for your reader. Incorporate specific examples of your volunteer work, detailing how you helped a certain person, for example. Use descriptive phrases that paint a picture of your contribution.For example, instead of writing, “I helped a homeless single mother by gathering donated school supplies for her children,” you could write, “Sharon, a single mother of two, teared up when I presented her with a backpack full of notebooks and pencils for her children.”
Avoid fluff language that doesn’t say anything. “I’m a people person” or “I’m devoted to learning” are not specific or personal. They communicate nothing about you.
Consider how much more descriptive these are: “Since I can remember, I have never met a stranger. Whether it’s at my job bagging groceries or serving as class president, I can easily strike up a conversation with anyone.” or “Finishing high school with a chronic illness wasn’t easy, but I took distance learning courses and studied on my own because I value learning and am devoted to pursuing it.”

, Once you’ve finished your essay, ask someone else to read it and give you feedback. Getting someone else’s eyes on your work will help you figure out whether your points are clear, what you need to improve, and what works well., Most scholarship applications will ask for at least one letter of recommendation. The letter can come from a teacher, employer, or other person familiar with your work. The letter should focus on your work, grades, community service, talents, and so on. Don’t choose a relative for this role. Friends usually won’t work either. However, a volunteer coordinator, your pastor, or another figure in your community who knows you could work.

, Don’t assume that your teacher or other referee will write you a letter. You must ask to make sure that he or she is familiar with your work and has the time to write a letter for you.


Meet in person to ask about a letter. This is a more personalized approach than an email and it will reflect positively on you. Bring a copy of your resume or the work you did in his or her class to help this person remember your accomplishments. This is especially important if you have not worked with this person in a while.
If the person says no, try not to take it personally. It’s better to have someone who can write you a good letter than someone who writes a vague, impersonal letter.

, You want to make the letter-writing process as easy as possible for your referees. Give them any forms they need to fill out as early as possible. Provide them with a copy of your personal statement or essay as well, if the application calls for one. This will help them draft a letter that supports the statements you made in your application.


Be sure to give your referees a self-addressed stamped envelope. Many scholarships ask that your referees mail their letters to the organization rather than giving them to you. It’s impolite to expect your referees to pay to send their letters.

, As you get closer to the application deadline, send a reminder to your referee about writing a letter. Don’t remind them every day, but a reminder at least a week ahead of the deadline is a good idea.

, Regardless of whether you win the scholarship or not, send a handwritten thank you note to each of your referees. They deserve thanks for the time they took to write on your behalf and thanking them for that time will make it more likely that they will do it for you again.

, Go through each page of your application and carefully proofread it. If it’s an online application, it helps to print out the entire application and read through it. Ask someone else to read through it too., Put all the pages of your application in the order that the scholarship application asks for them. For example, place the cover page first, then your scholarship essay, then your resume, and so on. Each application will have its own specific instructions, so be sure to follow them closely.


Make sure you have all the parts to your application. Missing one part might make you ineligible for the scholarship.

, It’s a good idea to have a record of the information that you send in for your application. Some scholarship organizations might need an interview. It will be helpful to remember what you’ve already turned in as you talk to the organization., Don’t wait until the deadline to turn in your materials. If you assemble all your materials ahead of time, you will have time to proofread your application. Don't forget to send a reminder to those writing your letters of recommendation.

Wait for responses.",How to Apply for a PhD in the US," Take some time to reflect on your past academic work and to consider your current research interests. What type of PhD would you like to pursue? What would you like to research in your pursuit of a PhD?


Keep in mind that it is not necessary for you to have a dissertation topic already chosen or even to have an extremely specific research focus. At this stage, you should just have a general idea of what you want to study and why. For example, if you are considering a PhD in English, then you should at least have an idea of the literary period that you wish to focus on.;
, Before you start applying to programs, you should take time to research schools thoroughly and find programs that will support your research interests. Look for schools with programs that will allow you to do the type of research that you want to do.


For example, if you are planning to pursue a PhD in Chemistry, then you should find out more about the lab facilities at the university that you are considering.
Try to identify as many potential schools as you can. Graduate school is competitive and you will have a better chance of getting accepted if you submit multiple applications.

, Some schools require or at least expect you to identify professors with whom you’d like to work. You may already have an idea of some professors who can help you with your research based on the research you completed during your BA or MA program.


Keep in mind that you may be working closely with the professor(s) you identify, so it is important to select professors who you really admire and whose research genuinely interests you., Graduate school is expensive, especially for international students. Therefore, it is important to seek out as many potential funding opportunities as you can. Most schools offer teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and other types of funding opportunities that will waive your tuition as well as provide you with a small stipend.


Keep in mind that funding opportunities are competitive. Putting forth a strong application may increase your chances of getting funding, but there are no guarantees.

, While much less important that the program features and funding available, you should also take some time to consider practical aspects of the schools you are considering. Some additional factors to consider include:


Location. If you plan to return to your home country during breaks, then some schools may make the trip home less time consuming than others. For example, if you will be flying back to India at the end of each school year, then choosing a school closer to one of the US coasts will make traveling easier than flying out of the Midwest. Keep in mind that it is not a good idea to select a school based solely on location. This will severely limit your choices.Cost of living. Some US college towns can be quite expensive, which can make it hard to get by on your student stipend. Look into the average cost of housing, food, and other expenses in the university areas where you plan to apply.
Extracurricular opportunities. Clubs can other types of groups can make the transition to a US university a bit easier. Many schools have clubs for people from certain countries, who speak certain languages, or who share other interests. Check out the extracurricular opportunities that are available at the universities you are considering.

, A bachelor’s degree is required for all PhD program applications and a master’s degree may be required for some PhD programs.

, GRE (Graduate Record Examination) scores are required for admittance into PhD programs in the US, so you will need to take the GRE before you can apply.It takes a couple of months to get your scores back, so make sure that you take the GRE well in advance of beginning the application process.


Taking the GRE three to six months in advance is a good idea. You may even want to take it about year before you plan to apply, just in case you do not get a good score and you need to retake it.

, If you are from a country where English is not the official language, then you will have to take the TOEFL (Test of English as Foreign Language or IELTS (International English Language Testing System). These tests assess your English language skills and help schools determine whether or not you are equipped to attend graduate school at an English language university. Like the GRE, you should take one of these tests well in advance of starting the applications.Score requirements vary by university, so check with each university to learn the score requirements before you apply. For TOEFL, you need to have above a 600 on the paper based test OR above a 95 to 100 on the internet based test. For IELTS, you need to have above a 7.0 to 7.5.

, Fees for international student PhD applications can be quite high, such as around $100 US dollars per application.Since you will likely need to apply to several schools in order to have a chance at a job, make sure that you can afford the fees before you start the process.


For example, if you plan to apply to 20 different programs, then you will need to ensure that you have about $2,000 for the application fees.
Keep in mind that the fees may vary drastically among schools. More prestigious schools may charge higher application fees than less prestigious schools.

, Each school will have its own application process and some schools also have special requirements. For the best chance of getting an acceptance letter, make sure that you carefully read the application instructions for each school that you plan to apply to. Identify any special requirements that you will have to fulfill before you apply.


For example, some programs require applicants to answer a specific question or set of questions in the statement of purpose.

, Having a few glowing letters of recommendation from professors and/or higher education administrators will improve your chances of getting accepted to a PhD program as well. Ask professors who know you well and who can evaluate your ability to do doctoral work.For example, it would be better to ask a professor in your discipline than someone who taught an elective class that you enjoyed.
Having one letter of recommendation from an administrator or employer can be helpful to show a different perspective of your academic goals. For example, you might ask your department’s chairperson, one of the university’s deans, or a current or former boss. As with the professors you ask, the administrator who recommends you should be someone who will give you a glowing recommendation.

, Transcripts are required for your application, so make sure that you know the procedure for requesting them from your university and put in your requests as soon as possible. Since your applications will be traveling via international mail, it is important to allow plenty of time for them to arrive.


Keep in mind that most schools require official transcripts.Sending transcripts may or may not require you to pay fees, depending on your university’s policies.

, Some types of programs require applicants to submit a writing sample as part of the application. This sample should be something that reflects your research interests and demonstrates your writing and research abilities. Choose something that you are proud of.


If you have a piece that has been published, then this is an especially great choice for the writing sample, but unpublished pieces are fine as well., Some universities have special questions or ways of formatting your statement of purpose (SOP) that you will need to observe. Make sure that you check the SOP requirements for each university to which you are applying before you begin writing.


You may want to write one “basic” SOP and then alter or add to it as needed based on the special requirements of each university.

, The first part of the statement of purpose is usually an intro paragraph where you talk a bit about yourself and your interests. This paragraph should offer some insight into your academic background rather than hobbies that you have, such as cooking or collecting rocks.For example, you might say something like, “Since I was a child, I had a passion for the natural world and this passion led me to my desire to become a biologist.”

, The next thing you should mention in your SOP is your preparation for doctoral studies. In this section, you should describe your coursework thus far, special projects you completed as an undergraduate and masters student, as well as any conferences you have presented at or articles you have published.


For example, you might say something like, “As an undergrad, I participated in on-campus research expos and even attended a local conference. Then, during my MA program, I had an article accepted to Biology Quarterly and presented at a national conference.”You can also talk about specific courses you took, professors who have supervised your work, and research that you conducted during your BA and MA programs.

, After you have talked about what you have done so far, you will need to explain what you hope to do in the future. What are your goals? What do you hope to contribute to your discipline?For example, you might say something like, “I hope to develop a new process for growing corn.”

, It is also important to mention professors with whom you would like to work. Some of these professors may even have a say in whether or not you will be admitted to the program, so it is important to familiarize yourself with these professors’ research.


Try reading each professor’s biography on the university website. You may also consider reading one of these professors’ publications, such as an article or book.
Try saying something like, “I hope to work with Professor Jones because she and I share a similar interest in botany.”

, For each section in your SOP, it is important to back up what you have to say. For example, do not just say, “I am dedicated to this discipline,” show it by providing examples of your participation in the discipline over the years. Or, if you talk about a professor who you admire, be specific about why. Draw a quote from one of his or her articles or point to a specific accomplishment that you admire.Make sure that you include examples throughout your entire SOP.

, Most universities require you to submit some basic details using an online application. These details may include things like your name, address, schools attended, etc. Complete this part of your application before you do anything else.


Some schools also require letters of recommendation to be submitted via an online system. You may need to submit your recommenders email addresses so that they can access this system.

, Your applications will also likely include some paper items, such as your statement of purpose, official transcripts, writing samples, or other required materials. Collect these items and seal them in a large envelope. Make sure that you give yourself plenty of time to send your packets so that they will arrive before the deadline.


Address the packets. Make sure that you double check the addresses for each of your packets to ensure that they will be delivered to the correct location.
Pay for postage. International postage can be quite expensive, so make sure that you reserve some money to pay for this cost. Pay the postage for each of your packets and send them out.

, Waiting to hear back from schools may be the most difficult part of the process. It can take weeks or even months for PhD application committees to make their selections. Many schools alert applicants of an acceptance or rejection via email as well as with a paper letter, so keep an eye on both of your inboxes.

Understand that there is a college for every student who wants to go.,
Move to finish any requirements needed to apply to certain colleges while in your junior year(s).,
Complete high school or an academic equivalent (such as a GED).,
Take the SAT or ACT test because about 85% of colleges require one or the other for first-year students.Nearly all schools will take either one, but a few schools will only accept one or the other, so check the school website to see if they are picky or not.

Once you have been accepted, apply for financial aid (optional).",How to Apply to College," The USA has thousands of degree-granting institutions. Almost all of them accept the majority of applicants, only a small number of elite schools accept less than half the people who apply. Hundreds of colleges accept almost everyone who applies. So, you are definitely getting into college if you want to go.


On the other hand, top schools like Harvard, Stanford, Duke, University of Chicago, etc., receive thousands of applications from top students for their freshman classes. It is important to have a realistic view of what your credentials are and what those schools require. Try to match your own grades and special abilities with the standards for the school you want to attend.;
, Some colleges will want you to complete calculus and statistics before you apply; others will stress a broad range of humanities classes. Be sure that you have an idea of the colleges you might want to apply to, and start meeting their class requirements, if necessary.


One of the first thing that colleges look at is your past school record. This helps determine how you do in an academic setting. Receiving high grades in school can only heighten your chances of being accepted by a university. Also, colleges look at your participation at school outside of the classroom. They want to know what the student does with the rest of their time while outside of the class. The more involved you are on your campus, the more likely you are to be involved on a school campus. This includes sports.






Add the extra-curriculars you engage in outside of school. Perhaps a community club or sports team could be added to your application. Any positive activity that you partake in can help make your application for desirable.







, People who move on to higher education have many different educational backgrounds. Among community college students in the United States, 43% are age 21 or younger, 42% are ages 22-39 and 16% are 40 or older.Your age should not be a negative factor in applying to college.

,, Look at colleges that have features that interest you, such as ideal major, class size, location, and the like. Check out their websites, since many of them have application information. It is also worth checking out books about scholarships at your public and school libraries.


When it comes to finding the right college for you, consider what you want to major in and your desired career path. Maybe you’re aiming to play a particular sport and certain universities would thus be a better fit. It is important to pick a college in your range. Check out websites such as collegeboard.com to find out the students’ average GPA and test scores, and compare them to yours. Many factors such as school size, location, and cost must be considered in finding the right college to apply to. Create a list and apply to several; don’t limit your options to just one university.






Many companies nowadays will compile lists of colleges that you can browse through or buy. They break down how hard it is to get into, what kind of SAT/ACT score you need, what campus life and academics are like, and what kind of job prospects alumni have upon graduation.

, If you contact the schools that you are interested in by signing in on their admissions website, they will probably send you a pile of information about the school. Most schools now have information online. You should do this as early as possible if you are still in high school, because some colleges have unusual apply-by dates or a list of required high school classes. They will send out reminders of important due-dates and information.

, By the time you are a Junior in high school, you should be narrowing down the list of schools you want to apply to. It would be a good idea to visit some schools during your Junior year. Decide what college(s) you want to apply to based on the information they sent you, the information you received from other people, and your own reconnaissance.


By October of your Senior year you should know who you are applying to and what they want in terms of references, test scores, etc. Do not leave this decision until several days before the due date for forms and paperwork. A lot of information may need to be obtained, including references for some colleges.
It is also important to be certain about your choice and not just apply ""for the heck of it"" or because everyone else is going to that college. It needs to suit you and what you want.

, Each school is different — some are huge with 30,000 or more students, and some have only a few hundred students. Do you want a city campus or a country campus? North or South? A particular religious group? Go there and look. If you have a friend, or another kid from your high school who goes there, get them to show you around.


Try to talk to students in various grade levels and ask them for their perspective of the school. Listen to what they have to say, but form your own opinion on what you like and dislike.
Sit in on a class. Try to imagine what it would be like to be a student there. Can you imagine yourself being happy and living fruitfully there?
Oftentimes, a college will give a visiting student a fee waiver. These can save you $50 or more, plus visiting beforehand can help you decide whether or not you even want to bother applying.

, This sounds simple, but it is an important consideration. Your choice will affect you for many years down the road. If you feel like a square peg pushing yourself into a round hole, you must evaluate the importance of doing this against the possibility of going to somewhere else that may not be so prestigious or handy but offers you exactly what you want.


As redundant as it may seem, you actually have to fill out an application! Many colleges and university use the Common Application, which asks a series of questions about personal information and school history. Be as thorough as you possibly can be. If you have any questions, don’t guess, call the school and ask.






Also consider issues related to residency, expenses, quality of final qualifications, scholarship/bursary availability and your own eligibility etc.

, Middle to top tier schools usually require you to write essays. They expect these essays to be impeccable, thoughtful and creative. Be sure you are unique in expressing yourself, but avoid a level of eccentricity that would be detrimental. There is a lot of advice online about how to write these, so look around and see what other students have done.


While the essay is the most dreaded part of the application, it can also be the most fun. Fitting yourself on a piece of paper is difficult but forces you to think about what your most admirable and important traits are. Try to pick an interesting topic; the readers do not spend a lot of time on each essay. The more intriguing the hook at the beginning, the more likely your essay will be read in its entirety. Also, the grammar must be impeccable. Have an English teacher or a good friend, or both, proofread your essay.

, Give them plenty of time to write the letters and keep track of whether they have actually sent them out. You should be thinking well in advance about which teachers you want to write recommendations. And, it isn't a bad idea to do a little extra schmoozing with those teachers to be sure they know you and have something nice to say about you.


Most colleges and universities require teacher recommendations in order to complete the application process. This is where the importance of doing well in high school also comes into play. If there are particular teachers that you believe you have made a good impression on, ask them. Be sure to ask them well in advance. Since many teachers have several students, write them a list of your credentials and activities so that they can be sure to include everything.

, Before finalizing your application, reread through everything and check for any mistakes. Submitting the application as early as possible will demonstrate your ability to complete assignments promptly and manage your time well.


Admission officers at the school will only spend a brief amount of time on any given application, depending on how well your credentials and essay stand out to them. Test scores, GPA and length of extra-curriculars are points that easily stand out to the reader will help your application stay in the hands of the reader for a longer period of time.







,


Early action is non-binding. If you feel that you have the credentials to gain admission after your junior year and do not feel it is necessary to wait for first semester senior year grades, then go for it. Early action only means if you meet a certain deadline, you are guaranteed to receive a decision by a certain date; usually admit, defer, or deny. It may be slightly easier to get in because you will be competing for more open seats. The terms of early action differ from school to school. Some schools will restrict you to applying only to one school early action, so be sure to note each individual school's terms.
Early decision is binding. If you do apply early decision, you will have a slightly higher chance of getting in. School use early decision to gauge who really wants to go to their school. However, being admitted early decision means that if you get accepted, you have no flexibility. You have to go to that school, even if you got a scholarship to a different school, or your best friend was attending a different school. Be sure you are comfortable with the school if you decide to apply early decision.

, Most of the more respected schools require applications to be completed by January of your Senior year. By around April 1st they will tell you whether you are admitted, then you will have to decide by May 1st if you will go there.


For many middle level schools or less selective schools, you can apply at any time and they will tell you in a few weeks whether you are accepted.
There are also schools (but not famous ones) which have empty seats in their Freshman class right up to the start of school in September. So, if you don't get accepted in April, then you can still work on applications and find a school that will take you right up to the start of the Fall term.

, You may have been asked to submit letters of recommendation along with your application. Never forget to thank the people who were willing to write those for you! Without their contribution, your application might not have been accepted.

, Go directly through the school itself, or apply for FAFSA, a governmental body. Many top tier schools will waive the price of admission if your family's income falls below a certain mark. Talk with your high school guidance counselor if you believe this to be the case.

Ace your classes.,
Take weighted courses.,
Get college credit.,
Pile on the extra-curricular activities.,
Cultivate relationships with your teachers.,
Put your best self on Facebook.,
Get involved in your community.",How to Get Into MIT1," You must show your ability to do well in classes. While this may not require a 4.0 GPA in high school, getting lots of B's won't help.


Tell your teachers about your aspirations. They'll want to see you succeed. Ask for outside help whenever you feel it's necessary.;
, At some high schools, certain courses affect your GPA more than others. This is because they're just plain harder. In fact, with weighted courses, you can end up with more than a 4.0 (on a 4.0 scale)!


Skip study hall and opt for that AP course. It shows drive and initiative. MIT requires students who take every opportunity to learn and better themselves.
This does not mean cutting classes like band or choir out of your schedule. MIT also wants cultivated, interesting students--not just mathbots. If you're good at something, stick with it. It'll pay off.

, Many schools offer opportunities for seniors to take classes at their local university or community college. Showing you can handle college courses as a high school student is impressive.


If your school doesn't have a program like this, ask. Better yet, create one. They won't turn down your opportunity for a better education.
MIT is a very math and science oriented school. Taking any college course looks great--but loading up on calculus (and loving it) looks even better.

, This is where the genius-IQ students get turned away. You can have absolutely outstanding test scores and grades and still get turned down. About 60% of all applicants are fully qualified. So ditch those video games and sign up for the debate team.


MIT has what's called ""holistic admissions."" This means that not only are grades and test scores considered, but they also take into account the whole person.
Try to focus in on a few core activities and show your talents. If you're on the rowing super! You're talented and athletic. But if you're on those teams and in show choir, you're talented, athletic, and artistic. Show them that you care about a certain few activities.
Show initiative. Do you feel passionate about something your high school doesn't have? Don't be limited by the size or success of your high school. Start that environmental club (you could be the President!). Form an after-school Spanish study group. Think outside the box.
Compete in many competitions - MIT demographics show that 10 to 12% of their approved petitions are from people that have some sort of achievement (ISEF, AIME, USPHO, IBO, etc.).

, To get into MIT, you'll need two evaluation letters. With that stellar GPA of yours, it shouldn't be hard.


You'll need two letters from teachers of opposing subjects. One from the math or science department and one from the humanities or languages.
Why stop at 2 when you can do 3? It's best to have a back up in case a teacher gets sick or is running behind your deadline.

, Having an internet profile that shows your best side is ideal in today's techno-driven world. So, go ahead, post away those photos of your rewards! You earned it.


Allowing colleges and employers to look at information about you turns you into a real person. You are no longer just a name on one of a thousand pages. Open your profile and invite them to look. Any 18-year-old with an impressive internet profile is a diamond in the rough.
As an alternative, close your profile to the public. But make sure it's secure--the folks at MIT know what they're doing.

, A high-schooler who is truly world-thinking and driven doesn't just stop within the grounds of their educational establishment.


Volunteer at your local hospital, animal shelter, or nursing home. MIT seeks to serve humanity and builds their student base off this criterion.

Master the standardized test.",How to Get Into MIT2," There are many topics you can choose from; however, choose something that appeals to you. What do you like to talk about? What would you want to read about? Here are some options:


Evaluate a significant experience you've had and its impact on you. This could be an ethical dilemma, a risk you have taken, or simply an achievement. Avoid the ""Look how great I am!"" and opt for self-evaluation.
Discuss an issue of concern and its importance to you. This could be on any level: local, national, or global. But don't turn it into a righteous lecture.
Describe an experience that is telling of what you would bring to MIT's college community. The admissions board is looking for students who will actively contribute., As all universities, MIT has several deadlines that must be met in order to be considered. In addition, there is a $75 application fee for processing.


For early action, the interview scheduling deadline is October 20th. November 1st is the ultimate deadline for reference letters, essays, and the application itself.
For regular action, the deadline to schedule an interview is December 10th. January 1st is the ultimate deadline for reference letters, essays, and the application itself.
The SAT and ACT tests dates should be in November and January, respectively.

, Some schools accept one or the other; however, to get into MIT, you should take the ACT and the SAT.


For the SAT, MIT released their 2012 admissions datain the 25th/75th percentile form. The first number represents the score of a student in the 25th percentile (25% of students got this score or lower). The second number represents the score of a student in the 75th percentile (75% of students got this score or lower). The higher the percentile, the more students below you.

SAT Critical Reading: 670/770
SAT Math: 740/800
SAT Writing: 680/780


For the ACT, MIT follows the same guidelines.

ACT Composite: 32/35
ACT English: 31/35
ACT Math: 34/36
ACT Writing: 8/10


MIT has incredibly high average test scores. It's in your best interest to sign up for a prep course and/or take the test multiple times. These are considered good practices, not second chances.

Show passion.,
Show balance.,
Show you fit.",How to Get Into MIT3," You are about to join a community dedicated to applying science and technology to solutions that will improve the world. Make it clear that you are ready and eager to be a part of that.


Have you rewired the electricity in your bedroom? Made your own locks on your doors? Don't be hesitant to include these things in your interview. You will stand out in your creativity and uniqueness.
MIT is, ultimately, a network. Let them know how you work on a team and how you make that team better.
MIT wants something unusual, even weird, even freakish. If you have, let's say, a fascination with a certain fish, you should develop that interest. Learn about that fish. Own that fish. Do something to help that fish. You want to have something that everyone else doesn't. Stand out.

, Things that happen in an a cappella group or at bible camp are relevant to things that happen in the classroom and science lab. Leave neither hide nor hair unturned.


MIT is looking for incredibly dynamic students. Making it clear that you're involved in every aspect of your community--as a volunteer, student, artist, athlete, employee, caregiver, initiator--to show just how valuable you are. Most of their applicants will be great at 1 or 2 things; very few will be great at many.

, There are tons of good schools out there--why do you want to go to MIT? Do your research and prove you belong.


Log onto their website and take a look at their stats. Do you like the size of their student body? The set up of their campus? Their location? Their mission statement? Familiarize yourself (like you would a friend) to figure out if you are truly compatible.
Take a tour. Many universities have high freshman dropout rates because they're just not at the right place at the right time. Be certain this is what you want and fully commit.
Don't worry about financial aid. MIT is one of the few institutions in America that is need-blind. That is, students who can pay full tuition have no advantage over those who cannot.

The TOEFL as well as 2 SAT subject tests: one in math and one in science.

The second is recommended for students with lower English-speaking skills. MIT offers no ESL courses; therefore, a TOEFL score of 600+ and 100+ is recommended for the Paper Based Test and the Internet Based Test, respectively. For students residing in countries that do not offer the SAT or ACT, you will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will not be penalized.

It's highly recommended to take calculus and physics classes before applying. Core graduation requirements for all majors at MIT are two semesters of college calculus and calculus-based physics, and one semester each of chemistry and biology. , Unlike high school students, you've had one or two years in the adult world to take charge. The extra-curricular activities don't stop with high school.


Make your job something to brag about. Seek out specialized duties or a managerial position to make up for the time (and money) you don't have to spend organizing bake sales for away football games.
Don't lose your passions. Were you great at an instrument in high school? A star track runner? Keep it up. MIT is about contributing to the global community--not just about good grades.

Go to a low-key city.,
Choose a place where you will feel refreshed.,
Make the journey to your vacation relaxing.,
Have a staycation.",How to Maximize Relaxation and Mental Recovery on Vacation1," If you want to go on a city vacation, consider choosing a city that isn’t overwhelming. Going to a city like New York or Tokyo can be stressful because it’s so packed and there is so much to do. Instead of relaxing, you may end up running around and feeling stressed.Instead, consider a city that isn’t as busy, but still has a lot to see. For example, you may try Vancouver, Madrid, San Francisco, Seattle, or Washington, D.C.;
, Everyone has a different definition of relaxation and serenity. When you are deciding where to go on your vacation, pick a location that will be relaxing for you. Think about what kind of environment will make you relaxed and feel rejuvenated.For example, some people find the most relaxation at the beach, while others like mountains and lakes. Some people prefer green spaces or a coffee shop in large cities.
Try thinking about times when you have felt relaxed before. How can you recreate this effect?
Only you can decide what is truly relaxing for you.

, Start your vacation with a relaxing tone by making the travel as relaxing as possible. Plan plenty of time to pack the car or get to the airport, and leave with enough time so that you aren’t rushing around to get to your destination.Make relaxing or happy playlists to listen to while you drive or fly.
If you’re on a flight, consider blocking out the noise with headphones and watching a movie to get you relaxed.
Consider indulging in a treat during the travel, like your favorite candy bar or a glass of wine on the flight.
See if there are things you can do at work in advance to make life easier for you while you are on vacation. Being preparing for your absence well ahead of your vacation so you are not frantically trying to do this right before you leave.

, If going away will be stressful instead of relaxing, consider having a staycation. Staycations are vacations where you stay at home and let go of your normal responsibilities for the duration. This can be a great way to relax and rejuvenate.For example, you may spend your days catching up on movies and television, sitting on park benches reading, or sitting on the deck enjoying some sunshine. See if there are any attractions in your city that you have never checked out before, and check them out as if you are a tourist.
During staycations, avoid doing housework or projects. Ignore the pile of laundry and don’t worry about cleaning the garage. Focus on relaxation.

"
"
Splurge on a spa treatment.,
Add in time to relax.,
Do what you enjoy doing.,
Save a special activity for the last day.,
Find ways to avoid stress with traveling companions.",How to Maximize Relaxation and Mental Recovery on Vacation2," You can emphasize your relaxation on your vacation by scheduling a spa treatment for yourself. You may choose to get a massage, manicure and pedicure, facial, or wrap. This can get you relaxed for the rest of your trip, especially if you do this at the beginning of the vacation.Make your appointment ahead of time to reduce the stress of getting an appointment when you arrive. Try finding a spa near your hotel.
If getting a spa treatment during your trip is not an option, then you can also try starting your vacation a day early and getting a spa treatment to help you relax before you leave.

, If your goal is relaxation on your vacation, you should plan for it. This means not planning every minute with an activity. Instead, allow yourself free time to enjoy yourself and rest. You don’t have to stay at the hotel, but you shouldn’t be running around trying to pack in every tourist attraction either.For example, you can spend an afternoon at the pool or beach. Go to a local cafe, coffee shop, or park and read or people watch. Take a leisurely walk through the city or countryside.
Find ways to stop, rest, and relax while enjoying your surroundings.

, Instead of doing what you feel you should do on your vacation, do what you want to do. If you want to sit by the beach and read for a few days, do that. If you don’t care about seeing every museum or tourist attraction, skip them. Do what you want to do.Trying to do what you think you should do can cause stress.
If you are traveling with others who want to do something you don’t want to, stay behind and do what you find relaxing instead.

, Though you may want to do a lot on the first days and relax at the end, maximize your memories and relaxation by doing something fun at the end of your vacation.Saving something exciting for the last day helps you remember the experience in a more positive way and think about the entire vacation as a happier, more relaxing experience.
Try to include a buffer day as well to help you ease back into your normal routine. For example, you can come back a day before you have to start work again to give yourself a chance to rest and mentally prepare to return to work.

, Unless you go on a vacation alone, you will probably have other people with you. Traveling with others can lead to stress and arguing, so you should come up with ways to get along. This may include letting everyone do their own activities and relax in their own way.


For example, many people argue about what and where to eat. You can set up a system where each person chooses a meal or restaurant once during the trip to avoid arguing. If no one can come to a decision, everyone can agree to eat at different places and not get upset.
The key is to accept that a relaxing vacation is different for everyone. This means that though you are all vacationing together, you may not do everything together, and that is okay. Don’t try to force a compromise. Everyone should be allowed to do what they want to do while on vacation.

"
Disconnect yourself.,
Avoid updating your status every moment.,
Choose appropriate travel companions.,
Make arrangements for someone to check on your home.,
Try meditation and deep breathing exercises.,
Avoid overscheduling.,
Complete all work before you go.",How to Maximize Relaxation and Mental Recovery on Vacation3," One way to maximize relaxation is to get away from social media and your smartphone. This includes emails and even texts. Completely disconnect yourself and be completely focused on your vacation without outside distraction.Getting distracted by looking at social media, reading the latest news, or answering work emails won’t help you relax. Being glued to your screen also won’t help you rejuvenate. Those are things you can do when you are back at home.
If you must stay connected to work during your vacation, then designate a small amount of time each day to handle emails, texts, calls, etc. and then disconnect for the rest of the day.

, Many people want to share their awesome experiences on social media with pictures and updates. Try to limit this behavior. Not only does it help you disconnect, but posting about your vacation can take away the relaxation and excitement.Updating constantly can make you feel disconnected from the vacation instead of present in the moment. You may start caring more about what people say in response to your posts than the actual experience, which can lessen the relaxation.
Updating social media while you are not home can also be risky. This can let people know you are not home, which may put your home at risk.

, Your level of relaxation may depend on who you travel with. If you travel with family members who you know are going to stress you out and argue, then perhaps you should consider taking a vacation without them. Remember, if relaxation is your goal, choose people to travel with who will make you feel relaxed.


If you can go on vacation alone or with a partner or good friend, try that. If you have a group of friends you can relax and have fun with, consider going with them.
If you have children, see if they can stay with trusted family members for a few days. You may not be able to take a long vacation, but you may get a few relaxing days to yourself.
Don't feel bad if you choose to go on vacation alone or without someone who stresses you out. Put yourself first.

, To reduce stress about things while you are away, try asking a trustworthy friend or family member to drop by and care for your pets, plants, and any other necessary things while you are away. This will help to give you peace of mind during your vacation.

, While you’re on vacation, try to destress. You can do this by trying short five to ten minute meditations or short breathing exercises. This can help relax both your mind and body, leaving your feeling rejuvenated.Find a guided meditation online. Put in earphones and start each morning with a relaxing mediation.
Focus on your breaths. Breathe in slowly, hold for a count of four, then exhale. Do this five or ten times. Whenever you feel stressed, do some breathing exercises.

, One way to add stress to your vacation is to schedule too much. Trying to fit too much into a day can make you feel anxious or stressed, especially if you find you don’t have enough time to do everything. Instead, allow some time to just take things slow and enjoy your surroundings.Instead of packing each day with tons of stuff to do, schedule one activity each day. The rest of the day, relax or see where the day takes you.

, One reason people can’t relax on vacations is because they think about work. Try to complete all work before you leave for vacations so you don’t feel like you left things behind that you should have done.For example, you may want to work a little harder the week before your vacation to get everything ready for your time off. Make sure to complete any tasks that would cause you stress while on vacation.

Spend your points or miles wisely.,
Avoid the busy season.",How to Maximize Miles and Points for Travel," Every card and program will be different, but knowing the kind of travel you wish to redeem your points or miles for will help you decide on a point earning strategy. An international flight will require a different strategy than one that's domestic.


It helps to be specific when thinking about this. You'll want to at least know the class you'd like to fly in, preferred airlines, and whether your flight will be domestic or international.
It may help to write out exactly the kind of trip you want to spend your points on. This way you have a clear idea of what you want to get from your points or miles.;
, Most programs award you points or miles based on how much you spend. Cards that pay back a percentage of what you spend will allow you to earn points less expensively.


When signing up for a card like this, be sure to check that you'll also be earning points or miles. Some cards may only offer a percentage of cash back on your purchases., Cards that allow you to spend points or miles many different places will give you more freedom when it comes time to redeem those points or miles. Additionally, these kinds of cards frequently allow you to transfer points to loyalty programs or other airline programs.Some cards like this offer point or mile bonuses for using your card more frequently. Check the terms and conditions of your credit card to determine if this is the case for you.

, When selecting your card, think about your daily and weekly expenses. If you choose a point card that offers bonuses for things you buy frequently, like groceries or gas, you can earn points very quickly.

, Just because a bank representative or creditor has informed you that you can earn points or miles with a card does not mean you've been signed up for a point or mile program. Be sure to inquire with the agent handling your credit card application, saying something to the effect of:""I just want to verify that I'm signed up for the point or mile rewards program. Is there anything else I should know about the card and these points or miles?""

, Dining programs that allow you to earn points or miles are very common among hotels and airlines. These often require you to enroll in the program and register the credit cards you use. After that, you'll earn points or miles for using your card when dining.


These programs frequently include tax and tip when awarding points. Company dinners or expensive meals can be very profitable for your point or mile earning., Your credit card or an airline may have a special shopping portal that awards you points or miles for any purchase you make through the portal. Especially if you already shop frequently online, you should look into whether or not these online shopping points are available to you.


Some portals or sites may offer more points than others. This will be different for each site and card, so you'll have to do some investigation to find the best one for you., Many creditors partner with certain hotels and offer points or miles for money you spend on purchases from them. But you can also boost your point or mile earnings by using online shopping portals to gain even more points on top of what you would from a partner purchase.


Many hotels offer extra points for several nights' stay. This is usually on an ascending scale, with the point value for each night increasing for each night spent at the hotel up to a certain limit., You may have to pay initially for business travel and expenses with the understanding that you'll be reimbursed by your company later. Build your points with a suitable credit card while traveling, then use the reimbursement to pay off those expenses.


This is also a useful way of improving your credit. If your credit score is low or not where you want it to be, paying off these short term credits should slightly improve your score.
Even if your company has paid for your flight ahead of time, points or miles generally revert to the flyer. Be sure to have your frequent flyer information to snag extra points or miles., Many companies offer special promotions or social media campaigns. These are often offered through mainstream platforms, like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. In many cases, simply by watching a video and providing your point or mile account information, you can earn points.


These kinds of promotions are also a great way to stay abreast on deals, new routes, and other point or mile programs., Generally, you can expect your points to stay good for 18 months, though some programs' points may expire sooner or later.To prevent forgetting about a point or mile expiration date, you may want to set a reminder in your cell phone or mark your calendar.

, Account inactivity is one of the most frequent ways that points go bad. Even small purchases on your point or mile earning credit card, like buying a song on iTunes or Amazon, will keep the account active and your points safe., In most cases, redeeming points will also count as account activity. This means that you can use a small number of points on something, like a magazine or clock, to keep your account active and your points usable.Some programs may also allow you to donate your points to charity. This should also register as account activity and keep your points from expiring., If you've lost track of time and your points or miles have expired, you may still be able to get them back. Often, this involves paying a fee, which can be quite expensive depending on how many miles you have.


Reinstate your points or miles as soon as possible if you intend to do so. Most companies only allow your account to be reinstated for a period of time following expiration., International flights often offer excellent deals for point or mile redemption. However, don't let the possibility of a freebie cloud your judgement. Flight upgrades are sometimes worth even more than a free flight.


Though not always the case, domestic flights under $300 often cost as many points or miles as a significantly better upgrade or longer distance flight., Many point or mile programs restrict the redemption of points or miles during peak travel season. But even if yours does not, flights during these times often cost more points or miles than usual, which will devalue what you have earned.


You should also attempt to book flights paid with points or miles well in advance. This will help prevent getting stuck with a multiple layover flight."
"
Put your travel into perspective.,
Get excited about your trip.,
Dress appropriately.",How to Make Traveling Long Distance Easier1," What one person considers a long distance might not be so long to others. As a rough guide, you might consider travel to be ""long"" if it's more than 8 hours by air, more than 6 hours by train, or more than 4 hours by car. However, what feels ""long"" depends on regional attitudes. In the USA, an 8 hour flight might seem long.


To Australians, who frequently fly direct to Europe or the USA, 18-24 hours is long but commonplace. An English person may feel a 1-hour drive is ""long"", while another traveller may complete a longest single car drive from Brisbane to Sydney totalling 15 hours. A trip is ""long"" when you make special preparations for it because you feel it is necessary due to the length of time you will be travelling.;
, Okay, the travel itself might be a drag, but your mindset will make all the difference. If you're excited about where you're going and what you're doing, the trip can be well worth it! Try to reframe your perception of the distance to avoid being overwhelmed by it; if you can't do that, at least focus on the end goal being worth it!

, Generally, dress for where you're going to, not where you're coming from. An Arran sweater is a trap in a Singapore summer. Be comfortable. Use layers so that you can adjust to varying levels of air conditioning in airports, planes, stations, trains, cars, and so on.


Wear something with front pockets or have a bumbag or fanny pack so things are easier to reach (e.g. sweets, lozenges, headache pills, ear plugs, napkin).
Wear a suit if you have immediate business commitments, but try to hang it up, if in first or business class, or carry it on board in a half-length suit bag that will fit without crushing in an overhead locker.
Consider wearing an angler's jacket. These waistcoats have multiple forward pockets perfect for holding, and easily reaching, all your nick-nacks. When a meal or beverage comes, your paperback slips in a pocket. Your passport is handy. You can slip off the jacket at customs without having to unpack it.

, You'll be taken back to the first pop-up window. Finish adding information about your party, then, when you're finished, click the blue ""Create"" button.

, As soon as you create your event, you'll be taking to its specific event page. Here, you have a variety of options for customizing your event page as well as the specifics of the event itself. Below are a few options you should consider:


Add a photo. Your event page will be more visually appealing to your guests if you add a photo for the event. Simply click the large ""Add Event Photo"" button at the top of the page, then choose to either upload a photo from your computer's hard drive or pick one of your photos on Facebook.
Edit the event's info. Click the gray ""edit"" button marked with a pencil to change your event's name, description, time, or location. Here, you can also assign other hosts to the event. Hosts can edit the event's info, invite people to the event, and add other hosts, just like you.
Invite more friends. If you remember someone else you want to invite, don't worry - just click the gray ""Invite Friends"" button near the top of the screen marked with an envelope. You'll be presented with a list of your friends again - simply check their names, as before.

, From the event page, click the small gray button marked with a gear. This will give you a list of more specific, advanced options you can use to take your event to the next level. These are:


Edit Hosts: Add or remove hosts for your event.
Message Guests: Send your guests Facebook messages. Useful for notifying everyone of a change of location, for instance.
Create Repeat Event. Automatically create a separate copy of your original event. New event retains invite list, description, title, etc. Useful if you plan to meet multiple times (e.g. book clubs, etc.)
Cancel Event. Delete the event page. This automatically sends a notification to your guests.
Turn Off Notifications. Disables notifications from this event - you won't see anything about it in your feed, etc.
Export Event. Send your event to your calendar or to an email address.
Promote Event. Review options for buying advertising space on Facebook.

RSVP immediately.Don't put off telling the host that you can't come to the party.,
Deliver the news in person.If the party is important to the host — for example, a birthday party, anniversary party, or baby or wedding shower — it would be rude to just text or email that you can't attend.,
Strike the right tone.,
Give a clear reason for missing the party.,
Don't over-explain yourself.,
Offer to help with the party beforehand.,
Promise to make it up to them.,
Put in a quick appearance.",How to Get out of a Party You Don't Want to Go To1," Let them know immediately that you can't come, so they don't build up an expectation of your attendance and feel more disappointed when you cancel at the last second.;
, Find some time to speak to them in person and explain why you can't attend.


If you can't speak in person — for example, if the friend lives in a different city, or if your schedules don't match up — make a phone call.

, People react to disappointing news in different ways, so there’s no single right answer about how to present your news. Depending on the personality of the person you’re breaking the news to, you’ll want to have a different attitude.


If you think the person will be offended or sad, be as apologetic as possible.
If you think the person will try to pressure or guilt you into attending, be firm.

, If you just tell the host that you don’t “feel” like it, you may hurt their feelings. Giving a specific reason is the best way to go, unless your specific reason is that you don’t like the host! Some examples why you don’t want to attend a specific party might include:


You have a previous engagement at that time
Someone you would like to avoid is attending the party
You have too much work or studying to catch up on

, When you talk too for too long about why you can't attend a party, you give the host more time to try to convince you that you should attend. Keep that part of the conversation short and sweet, then move on.


You might change the topic completely or show that you're still interested in the party by asking about the planning process.
Showing interest demonstrates that you wish you could attend, but that you really can't.

, Even if you can't attend the party yourself, you can still help make it a success by offering to lend a hand with the planning and preparation. This will demonstrate to the host that you value their friendship, and that you would attend the party if you possibly could.

, If you have to miss an event, make plans to catch up with the host when you have more time. Make it as close to the event as possible, so you can show an interest in what you missed. This will make the host feel like you appreciate their efforts in throwing the party, and that you value their friendship.

, The best honest way to get out of spending time at a party is to spend the least possible amount of time at the party. Make sure you say hello to the host, so they know you attended. Try to have a good time while you’re there, but let everyone know that you have to leave early. Even if you can’t stay, people will appreciate that you at least made the effort to drop by.


If you feel uncomfortable announcing that you have to leave, just slip out without saying goodbye. People will likely be having so much fun, they won't even notice you're gone.

Try not to over-commit yourself, but have enough variety that you can find something-- and a group of people-- that you really ""click"" with.


Get to know new people in the club(s). At each meeting, try to talk to someone you’ve never talked to before.;
, If school organizations aren’t your thing, find another hobby outside of school.


Check the local paper (or its website) for community events nearby.
Libraries or art studios often host events for teens.
Look for organizations that hold meetings for things that you are interested in, like outdoor activities, games, or artistic expression.

, This may be a cool coffee shop, a bookstore, a rock climbing gym, or even the mall. If you base your hangout spot around your interests, you're more likely to meet people that you have something in common with.

, Activities such as football games, dances, or large-scale fundraisers often draw a large number of students with different interests and personalities.

, Whenever you meet someone new, greet him/her warmly. Try to find something in common with him/her. Don’t be afraid to initiate a conversation. Even if you’re naturally shy, go up and talk to someone if you want to. You may want to find an “excuse” to talk to him/her (like giving him/her something he/she dropped or asking him/her what time it is).
If you recognize someone from school or a club or activity, or if you have a mutual friend, bring that up.
Ask new friends questions about themselves. People love to talk about themselves, and asking them questions rather than spending most of the time talking about yourself will leave a better first impression.
Avoid gossiping or talking badly about others. Though this can be tempting, it can leave a bad impression or you may offend your new friend unintentionally.

, Try to determine why you have the friends that you currently have and what things you have in common.


Reach out to friends that you would like to spend more time with. A simple call or text every now and then can help you maintain or recover old relationships.
If you have any friends who are possessive or controlling of your time—particularly if you start spending time with new people—you may want to distance yourself from them.

, Deepening friendships makes the friends more likely to invite you along to parties that they are going to attend. , The more friends you have, the more likely it is that someone will invite you to a party. Ask new friends to introduce you to their other friends. Try to maintain those friendships too.

, Some party invitations are organized online, and you need to be connected with others to get an invitation.

, If you hear someone talking about a party, find out some details and try to get an invitation for it.


Ask a friend that you know is going to the party to hang out one-on-one at the time of the party—she may tell you about the party and invite you to go with her.
If someone mentions the party, say ""wow, that sounds really fun"" and look her in the eye. She will likely invite you if she is able to.
Ask a friend who is attending a party directly if you can tag along.
Show up to the party if you know when and where it is. It is very unlikely that anyone will question you about who invited you.

, While this may not be as good as being invited, it may be a good place to start.If a friend is attending a party but she is not sure if she can invite you to another person’s party, ask her to introduce you to the host.
Start a conversation with the host of the next party, and then compliment her on her outfit or a recent accomplishment that you heard about (like being nominated to homecoming court).
Casually ask her if she minds if you drop by her party for a little while. Most people will be uncomfortable telling someone no to their face.

, Invite a lot of different people from different groups and tell them it’s okay to invite a few friends.


Be sure that everyone has a good time.
Try to spend a little time with everyone who attends.
Address everyone by name and thank them for coming. Even if it’s someone you don’t know well, she will feel special if you pay some personal attention to her. If you're not sure of someone's name, ask another party attendee who may know.
At the end of your party, jokingly ask, “okay, whose turn is it to throw the next one?”

, If you are genuinely friendly and nice to everyone, they will automatically like you. If you are also funny, then they will like you even more.


Tell jokes only if you’re good at it. Be sure your joke is appropriate for the audience and context (don’t offend anyone).
Laugh at other people’s jokes, even if they’re not that funny. If you laugh at people’s jokes, people will think that you have a good sense of humor.

, Not sure what is appropriate? Ask a friend who you think has great style what you should wear. Borrow clothes if you need to.

, Leave an impression on people by doing a silly dance in front of everyone, singing some awesome karaoke, or showing off a unique talent.


You want people to remember you, even if they have never met you before.

, There is a fine line between the life of the party and going too far. You may not know where the line is, so consider having a secret signal with a close friend who can tell you “back down a little.”


You don’t want people to remember you in a bad way.

, While having fun at a party is the perfect time to plan to attend the next party.


If you are having a good conversation with someone, ask if there is anything fun happening the next weekend.
If you know someone who is planning to host a party soon, be sure to spend some time chatting with her to give her the opportunity to invite you to her party.

Understand your industry.,
Find the perfect van.,
Set up your website with plenty of details.,
Quote competitive prices.,
Make sure the website is attractive and well-designed.,
Advertise your website.,
Get customer reviews.,
Introduce an online booking form.",How to Make Your Own Man & Van Service Website," Many people confuse the Man and Van service with courier work, which focuses on delivering parcels to business addresses. The Man and Van industry, however, is usually involved in removals and furniture jobs within domestic addresses. Occasionally deliveries are done as well, but this is also within the domestic arena. Understand the work your Man and Van service will be hired to do, and do a little research into the existing market to identify any holes in the market, in terms of location, price, or specific services offered, that you could take advantage of.;
, Your Van will define your business so choose wisely. Luton Box Vans are the most common models used for transporting items within the domestic industry. You can opt to either purchase one new or secondhand, but whatever the option you choose, it is better to buy it outright than go for a lease. Select the exact van type according to the clientele that you are targeting. Transit-style vans are more suited for courier work, whereas a normal van with or without a tail will work fine for domestic transportation.


Decorate your van with the name of your company, your website, and a phone number or email address so that it serves as a means of advertisement for your company.

, Your website should be a detailed advertisement of your business that affords customers the convenience of getting all the required information without having to go through the trouble of making telephone calls or email inquiries. Provide detailed information about your van and all the packages you can offer. Make sure your website clearly displays the costs, time, and hours of operation of each job as well.


Add pictures of your van, yourself, and any other employees to help your customers get to know your company.

, On your website, you should clearly describe services and packages, and include quotes for their prices. Always offer competitive rates. The prices in addition to being good value for money should be a notch less than those offered by the established brands in order to give your company a competitive edge in the market.

, Your website should stand out above the rest, just like your company does. There are several professional companies that can help you create the ideal website using whatever form of multimedia that you prefer. Take your time and look around for a good site creator and using their help, design an attractive home page. Pay attention to things like navigation: it should be easy to get around your website and find what you're looking for in just a few clicks.

, Once you have established the groundwork, it is time to go public. Get ample business cards and flyers printed, and begin distributing them in public. Supermarkets and furniture shops are excellent spots to get a Man and Van business noticed, so post flyers in such locations. You can also get listed on online man and van websites for a small annual fee.

, Once you have successfully carried out a few jobs, try asking your customers for a testimonial that you can put on your website. Testimonials carry a lot of weight these days, as people are far more confident reading the reviews of another customer than merely relying on the websites and marketing methods. Post positive reviews on your website, and learn from negative reviews, correcting the issues and behavior that your customers didn't like so that you can provide better services to future customers.

, In addition to catering largely to a customer's convenience, the online booking form will make sure that you check your emails regularly and that the website is always kept up to date. You can even add a schedule onto your site; this way, customers will know exactly when you are available to work for them.

Have fun on your trip!",How to Make Traveling with Kids Simple and Stress‐Free," This step may seem incredibly simple, but it's not. It isn't just about choosing the country, state, or province. Choose a town or city, preferably with inexpensive places to stay, kid friendly tourist attractions, and places to eat. Try searching on well-known travel sites for options that would fulfill your family's needs and preferences.;
, Not too long, or your kids will get bored, but a decent amount of time so that you can do and see lots of stuff. Between 5 and 10 days is often ideal, but it's really up to you.

, This is super important to do in advance to ensure that you get the best priced tickets, and a good airline that leaves at a reasonable hour as well as lets you take at least one checked item, one carry on, and one personal item. This will also prevent you from showing up at the airport with no idea of when your flight takes off, what gate it's at, and what the flight number is.

, This includes cars, buses, trains, trams, shuttles, etc. This also includes planning where exactly to park your car before you go to the airport. If your flight leaves at a strange hour and the airport's hours away, consider staying in a hotel the night before so you don't have to wake up super early, drive to the airport, then groggily figure out where your gate is. Another pro with staying in a hotel is that you can park your car at the hotel instead of leaving it at the long term airport parking.

, To prevent stress on your big day, make sure you have travel information and things you will need, such as:


Passports or any travel docs you may need
Flight times
Flight and gate numbers
Etc.
And make sure you have pictures of all of these on your phone, as well as hard copies in case something gets misplaced.

, Then cross out half. All they really need in their checked bag are clothes, a bathing suit, a few pairs of shoes, and a hat. Maybe a few books. Not much more. You can bring the sunscreen or lotion or shampoo with you, or just buy it there!

, Choose things that could be easily mixed and matched. Since kids are very messy, it's always good to bring extra clothes. The rule is to take the days your staying, multiply that by 1.5, and that's the number of tops you bring. If you stay for 6 days, for example, you would bring 9 tops. For pants, just bring 1 extra pair, because pants can be re-worn a couple times. Always bring a light sweater, long pants, and a bathing suit, no matter where you go.

, Check off items on your list as you go. Put socks and underwear into little plastic baggies and stuff those into shoes to save space, and keep the shape of your shoes. Roll clothes tightly to prevent wrinkles and save space. Also, make sure to pack one of your outfits in your kid's carry on in case your luggage gets lost.

, Some parents forget to pack their own clothes and things they need, because they're focused on their kids. Make sure you follow most of these steps as well to avoid over or under packing.

, Add a colorful piece of tape, a bright band, or some stickers. It's better to have an overly decorated bag then a plain one that someone else mistakenly takes. In case your bag gets lost or stolen, write your name, address, and phone number on a tag that you can then attach to your suitcase handle.

, This is an absolute lifesaver when your luggage gets lost and you don't want to buy brand new clothes before it gets found and returned. Also, if you're on the plane and your kid spills water all over his shirt, you always have that extra one in the backpack. Pack light clothes that take up little space.

, If it's a long time in the airport, car, or plane, you want to keep the kid occupied and quiet. Try downloading an audiobook that you know they would like (but don't forget headphones!), bringing some homemade play dough or clay, a couple of the child's favorite stuffies or dolls, a coloring or activity book, and maybe a comic, magazine, or book. You want to make sure that there's no way your kid could get bored. Also consider bringing along a few ""surprise"" items that you can give if they need something to do. A new toy is a sure way to entice them.

, Make sure you check on it and maybe add or take away a few things, like a toothbrush or hairbrush, but this is a sure way to reduce stress and teach the kid a little responsibility as well!

, If you know they're probably going to forget a toothbrush, don't bring extra! Just have them think of a way to solve the problem (aka you buying a new one) which will make them feel important and grown up, teach them some responsibility, and reduce stress because you won't have to be worried about every little thing the kids forget. And hey, maybe next trip the kid will remember to pack his/her own toothbrush!

, Make some ""snack packs"" (a container full of different snacks), such as apple slices, crackers and cheese, a granola bar, trail mix, some cookie cutter sandwiches (sandwiches cut into cool shapes with cookie cutters), and maybe a few homemade muffins. This is a great time to clear out the fridge. Just make sure if you bring liquids or pastes that it's under the ounce limit (3.4 fl oz. or 100 millimeters), and bring an empty water bottle to fill up at a water fountain past security so you're not stuck paying high prices for not the best food. Make sure you bring some gum, too, for takeoff and landing, especially if your kids are prone to ear infections, so they don't get earaches during takeoff and landing.

, It's better to be over prepared than have absolutely no idea where you're going. This is especially important for boarding and TSA.

, This is especially important if your flying around a holiday or in a major airport such as Newark, or if you have to go through Customs before your flight and you're not a citizen of that country. Newark or NYC both have CRAZY long Security and Customs lines, and so many people miss their flights because of it.

, In that crazy long security line, take the opportunity to get your documents ready such as passports and to take everything out of pockets that could make the metal detector go off. This will save time for you and everyone else.

, You'll be lugging bags, walking through terminals, taking off and putting on shoes, so make them comfortable and easy to get on and off.

, In this day and age, so many ""problems"" can be more easily solved by searching for an answer. Need to find the closest bathroom to clear up a pottying mishap? Lost an important travel document and need to find a printer? Looking for something to distract your kids when you desperately need them to be quiet for a minute so you can talk to a travel official? The phone can come in pretty handy!

, Know that not everything's going to go your way, and be glad. It makes the funniest stories to tell of travel mishaps or strange airport staff. Having the perfect time is boring. And no matter what you do, there will always be something that goes wrong. Accept it, and don't stress. That makes all the difference.

, Take the time to enjoy the moments with your family, embrace the good and the bad, and prioritize having a great family trip, over stressing about the details.

"
"
Plan for plenty of time between connecting flights.,
Try to make your reservations far enough in advance so you can get an aisle seat.,
Use easy-to-wheel, compact luggage.,
Place these essentials in your checked luggage: Rubber or plastic shower mat (so you don't slip in the shower); hot water bottle (so you can get warm quickly if the heat in your room in inadequate); tea bags, nuts, crackers; water heater (immersible ""water heater"") and cup; collapsible cane with reflective tape around it (use it if you need to cross streets without a signal; drivers will expect you to walk slowly if they see you have a cane ); pillowslip (to use if the hotel pillowslip smells so strongly of bleach or cigarette smoke that it irritates your eyes); flashlight (to put beside your bed to use if you wake up at night and to carry if you are going to be walking in unlit or poorly lit areas at night).

,
Check as much as possible to avoid having to carry items.,
Assume that you will get no edible food on the plane and that you will not have time to buy any food in a connecting city.,
Take a cotton handkerchief.,
Use luggage carts and elevators whenever possible.

,
Wear shoes that have a zipper or Velcro fastener so you can easily remove them at Security Checkpoints.,
Be wise to when to use the restroom on the plane.,
Plan ahead if you arrive after 10:00 p.m. in your destination city.,
Prepare the address for the taxi.,
Try to find a hotel that has an elevator and no steps up to the front desk.",How to Make Travel Bearable when You Are Older," If you have connecting flights, make sure you have at least one hour (preferably 90 minutes) between arrival and departure. You do not want to be panicked by having to find a new terminal and have to catch buses, climb stairs, or walk a long way on travelators etc. If you can't get flights that have a long connecting time, and if you walk slowly, request a wheelchair or ask for some other form of fast assistance.;
, Be aware, however, that on some flights the aisle seats have much less underseat room to stow your luggage than the other seats. This means that there may not be enough room for a laptop.

, Use one small wheeled bag (about 9"" x 13"" x 17"") plus another soft bag about the same size that can fit on top of the wheeled bag. Put a maximum of 20 pounds in each bag so that you won't strain your back getting your luggage off the carousel at baggage claim. Also, with two bags you may be able to carry your bags, one in each hand, up a few stairs. If you check one heavy bag, ask a porter or another passenger to lift the bag off the baggage carousel.

,, On some full flights, there may be no room in the overhead compartments by the time you board, and the flight attendant will take any luggage or laptop and check it. If this happens, be bold; speak up and make sure the flight attendant checks it to your final destination. Take either one small shoulder bag or (on very long trips) one small backpack and one small shoulder bag. Two bags are better than one large heavy bag because then you will be able to put at least one small bag under the seat in front of you. With a shoulder bag and a backpack you will have your hands free for navigating stairs.

, Take some carbohydrates and some protein--crackers, nuts, beef jerky, etc. If you want to take foods that should be kept cold (e.g., hard-boiled eggs, cheese, frozen cooked sliced chicken), put this food in an insulated cloth bag. Keep the bag in the freezer the night before you leave. If you're traveling more than eight hours, also take a small watertight container (Wits Keep-It Clear Dry Case) in which you can put ice (after you go through security) and put this ice-filled container in the insulated bag.

, On long flights, every hour wet the handkerchief with water and put it up to your face and breathe the moist air through it. Take a case for your glasses so you can sleep with your glasses off. Take something to keep yourself distracted--paperback mysteries or novels; knitting (circular or short needles); etc. Take at least three days supply of any prescription medicines.

,, If you carry metal items in your pockets, put them all in a clear bag before you get to security. Do not put your wallet in plain view--put it in a carry-on before you go through security.

, The best times (shortest lines) to use the restroom are just before the movie ends or after any food service ends. If you are on an international flight that boards 45 minutes or more before departure, use the plane restroom while you're still on the ground and the plane is still boarding. If you are on a small plane with one restroom, assume that you will not be able to use the restroom because it is too small.

, Call your hotel beforehand and ask if they have room service, or if they can keep sandwiches from the hotel kitchen cold for you and give them to you when you arrive, or if any local restaurants deliver food late at night.

, Before you get in the taxi, give the taxi driver a card on which you have printed the address of your destination, plus the name of the nearest cross street, if possible. Ask how much the ride from the airport to your hotel should cost. Have a city map with you in case your taxi driver gets lost. If you find a good taxi driver with a clean cab, ask if you can request him or her again. If you are staying in a downtown location, find out where the taxi ranks are--where taxis line up waiting for passengers. If you need a taxi from your hotel, ask the concierge to call for you. Taxi companies often give priority to calls from hotels.

, If the hotel does have stairs, ask for a room on the lowest level and find out if an employee will be available to help with luggage when you arrive. If the hotel has an elevator to the upper floor rooms, but has steps from the street to the main floor reception, ask if help will be available when you arrive. As a last resort, pay a taxi driver to bring your luggage up the steps to the main floor. When you get to your room and before you unpack, check to see that the toilet is flushing, there is hot water, and the heat or air conditioning is working. If there are any serious problems, request another room.

Pack an easily reached neck pillow.,
Consider others.,
Prepare for the air conditioning.,
If you need prescription medicine, pack one or two dosage bundles into a tiny jar or resealable sandwich bag.,
Pick your footwear with comfort and security in mind.,
Do your homework.,
Remember to drink water.,
Decide whether or not to drink alcohol.,
Take special care if travelling with infants.",How to Make Traveling Long Distance Easier2," These crescent-shaped inflatable pillows can make sleeping or resting much more comfortable. Long flights sometimes offer blankets. While these are often light, they deflect air conditioning and provide psychological comfort.


If you don't have a neck pillow at home, you can always pick one up at the airport itself. Most terminals have at least one shop selling inflatable, bead-filled, or memory foam pillows of this sort, and they're surprisingly inexpensive.

, Avoid wearing strong perfume or after-shave, it might provoke reactions, including allergic reactions, from other passengers. Sitting beside someone who detests your perfume may make a 6-8 hour journey seem a lot longer.

, Many planes and even trains keep their cabins cold and crisp. Bring layers, and consider minimising any makeup so that long travel doesn't make it cake and dry it on. However, consider a small travel tube of moisturiser, as skin dries in prolonged air conditioning.

, This is better than opening pill packets while travelling as the contents may spill or jump awkwardly, landing on the floor or disappearing. If you forget and have to unpack pills, go to the toilet, put a plug or cloth in the sink and use the available washstand space.

, Laces mean delays at security, especially for tall boots. Wearing tall boots is easier than packing them but, if so, clear security early. Slip-ons make life easier and some woman's flats can fold into hand luggage if bare feet make your journey more comfortable. Some shoe designs feature steel bars in the sole, avoid these where security checks will mean multiple security checks and delays.

, This is especially important if you'll be stuck on a long flight. Are meals offered? At a cost, or included in the price? Do you have special dietary needs and can you order before travelling?

, Hydration is important. Long trips are dehydrating. If you feel hunger it may actually indicate that you have been ignoring symptoms of thirst. For particularly long trips, pack effervescent Vitamin C&B tablets. Vitamin C helps ward off many common ailments and Vitamin B helps ease stress.

, If available and you want some, have a little to relax and take the edge off the day. Don't drink to excess because you have a captive audience with access to social media and complaint systems. Get drunk on the ground, where airborne antics won't get you barred from flying, or blacklisted. There is another reason to take care. Alcohol dissolves quicker into the bloodstream with carbonated drinks, e.g. champagne, or mixers and all alcohol dissolves faster into the bloodstream at altitude. Your ""safe limit"" may not apply.

, Consider other passengers and plan ahead. The most common problem is pressurization, which adults fix by yawning or blowing their nose, to ""pop"" their ears. Babies don't know to do this and the resulting ear pressure can be unbearable. Babies ""compensate with their lungs"" but to little effect. Sucking can help equalise pressure but a crying baby will spit a dummy. Try getting your child to suck on your finger, or feed the child. Your doctor or infant health centre may have other options.

Check you have maps in case your GPS fails. Do a little extra research to make sure there are no GPS flaws on your route (people have been directed into deserts), and plan out where you think you'll stop for bathroom breaks, food, and gas.

, Have a large water bottle in your drink holder with a 'bobble top' or flip top. Bring some extra water along, too, in case you run out or a passenger wants some. Stay hydrated, even if it means having to stop for bathroom breaks!

, Have music available but not so relaxing that it makes you drowsy. Consider books on tape as a way to stay awake and engaged while you drive.


If making your own compilation CD or playlist make every 5th song irritate you a little to keep you awake!

, If you're travelling far from your regular mechanic, you might want to have them check out the car before you go. Make sure your tires are properly inflated, your fluids (oil, water, coolant) levels are right, and keep the windscreen clean. A dusty or dirty screen diffuses light and creates glare.


Get professional advice if considering petrol additives. All these things affect peace of mind.

, These improve grip and make a steering wheel easier to hold on a hot day.

, Australia has a continuing national campaign called ""Drive, Revive, Survive"". The slogan gets to the heart of the matter: as a driver, you need regular breaks to stay safe, and to keep others around you safe. Don't ""power through"" any bouts of tiredness. Take a break, stretch, get a snack and drink some water, and only return to the road when you're ready to focus again.

, If you often drive the same route, break the trip in different places and make a whistle stop tour of something different.

, Have rain gear handy if needed. Pack a drop sheet or camping rug beside your emergency jack in case you need to get partway under the car. Make sure you have the basic mechanical equipment and know-how needed to change a tire or jump start your car if the battery goes flat at a rest stop. Sign up with your local auto club in case you experience car troubles out of your depth.

However, this method will quickly and easily invite all your friends without any mindless clicking on your part.

, The scroll bar may take some time to scroll all the way down. This is the most time-consuming part of this method - unfortunately, it's necessary, as your friends won't appear in the list until you scroll to their name. This method checks the boxes of every entry in the list, so if all your friends aren't displayed in the list, they won't all be invited.

, Highlight ""Web Developer,"" then select ""Scratchpad"" from the submenu. A popup window should open - in this menu, you're able to input javascript commands, which can be used to automate certain web processes. In this case, we'll input a command to automatically check the boxes next to all of our friends.


Don't navigate away from the popup invitation menu during this step - otherwise, you'll have to re-open it and scroll to the bottom again.

, Then, click ""Run."" Your browser may appear to freeze briefly as the script runs - this is normal. Within a few moments, your browser should unfreeze. Check your ""Invite Friends"" popup window. If done correctly, every friend in the popup window should be checked off!

, This completes the process. Enjoy your party or event!


If you want to invite most of your friends, but not all of your friends, this method is still useful - simply follow the method as normal, then, when all of your friends are highlighted, manually un-invite the friends that you don't want to receive an invitation. This is still more time-efficient than manually selecting your invites.

Don’t be too hard on yourself for lying.,
Keep your lie simple.Lie as little as possible, without elaboration.,
Blame your family.,
Say you already have plans.,
Pretend you’re not feeling well.,
Pretend you have too much work to do.,
Set up your lie ahead of time.If the party is two weeks away, and you know the whole time that you don’t want to attend the party, don’t wait until the last second to get out of it!,
Keep track of your lie.",How to Get out of a Party You Don't Want to Go To2," Studies show that lying is a regular part of daily life even for people we’d otherwise consider moral, upstanding individuals.When people lie to ease social tensions, rather than to serve their own purposes, a white lie might be a better option than the truth.

, An elaborate story about why you can’t attend a party will seem suspicious, and will also be more difficult to keep track of if someone asks you about it later.

, Everyone understands that familial obligations always trump parties. Tell your friends that you have to babysit a sibling, or that your parents are forcing you to have dinner at your uncle's house that night. An iron-clad excuse is that you're grounded; everyone will understand that there's no way you can come to a party.

, Only the most overbearing friend would try to guilt you into canceling plans you've already made with someone else to come to their party. But make sure that you don’t use a friend who’s attending the part as your alibi. Say you have plans with a friend from a different school, or even with an imaginary friend.

, On the day of the party, text your friend saying that you think you ate something bad, and that you have food poisoning. Nobody wants someone throwing up at their party. Plus, food poisoning passes very quickly, so nobody can be suspicious when you feel fine again the next day.

, Whether you're a student or an adult with a job, everyone knows and understands that sometimes we fall behind and have to catch up on our work.


If the host still tries to pressure you into coming, say that your parents or your boss are upset with you, and you have to make it up to them.

, Set up your lie ahead of time to deflect suspicion. Some things you might consider are:


Telling the host at the time of invitation that you have a previous engagement on that day.
Telling the host a day or two before the party that you think you’re coming down with an illness.

, This is the most thing about lying. Even if the lie is just a little white lie, you don’t want to hurt anyone’s feeling by getting caught. Keep track of exactly what you tell people, and of who you tell it to.


If you post the lie on social media to make it more believable, make sure nobody else catches you doing anything else on that night!
If you tell the host you’re feeling sick, don’t let anyone tag you in pictures from a different part that night.

Say something witty or funny.",How to Write a Birthday Invitation," There are five main elements to any invitation, and they are who, what, when, and where. The first element to include on an invitation is who, because people want to know who they’ll be celebrating when they attend the party.To open the invitation, name the person celebrating a birthday. You can say something as simple as, “It’s Karen’s birthday!”
Most of the time, the people invited to a birthday party will be close friends and family, so you don’t need more than a first name to introduce the guest of honor.
When the host of the party isn’t the guest of honor, you need to introduce the host as well. In case the host isn’t known to all the guests, you can include more information, such as a last name, or the host’s relationship to the guest of honor.
For example, you can say “Karen’s sister, Mary, would like you to join her in celebrating.”;
, After you tell guests who is celebrating, you must explain what kind of celebration they're invited to. In most cases, it will be a birthday party.


Don’t be afraid to include specifics, such as what age the guest of honor will be turning, especially if it’s a milestone birthday.
For example, you can say “Karen is turning 40!”

, This is an important element, so you must be specific and detailed. You can't just say Saturday, because then your guests won’t know which Saturday you mean! Include the time and specific date for the party.


If the party is only scheduled to go for a certain amount of hours, put that timeframe on the invitation.
For instance, you can say “The party is on Sunday, February 29, from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.”

, Regardless of whether the party is being held at someone’s house, at a restaurant, at a clubhouse, or elsewhere, you need to provide the name and address of the location. Never assume guests know where the host’s house is, or where a particular restaurant is located.


If the party is at Karen’s house, say “The party will be held at Karen’s, at 123 Pine Lane, Maintown”

, In case you need to know who will be coming and how many guests there will be, the final line of the invitation should be a call to action for guests, asking that they let the host know if they will be attending.


RSVPs were traditionally done by mail, but today, people often prefer responding by phone or email. Be sure to tell guests how you want them to RSVP.
A call to RSVP can be as simple as: “Please RSVP to Mary, 202-555-1111”

, For adult’s and children’s parties, there may be a theme or dress code for the party that you should mention to your guests. Most auxiliary and sensitive information can be included in the last line of the invitation before the RSVP. Dress codes might include:Black-tie if the party is happening at a fine dining restaurant or upscale club
A theme if the party is a costume party.
Casual if the party will be taking place at someone’s home.

, There are several types of parties that require guests to come prepared with certain things, and the invitation should indicate this. Examples include:


Pool parties, to which guests should bring swimming attire and towels.
Sleep-overs, to which guests may need to bring pillows and blankets.
Excursion parties, in which case guests may need tents, sleeping bags, food, and other gears.
Hobby parties, where guests may need old clothes, paint brushes, or other craft supplies.

, Some parties lend themselves to plus ones, whereas others simply don’t. For the types of parties where you don’t want guests bringing extras (such as friends, siblings, or significant others), be sure to note this on the invitation. You can say things like:


“No siblings, please!”
“Please note there is no room for plus ones”
“You're invited to an exclusive and intimate party,” which can be worked into the what portion of the invitation.

, This is especially important if guests are expected to bring something to the party, such as with a pot luck. Otherwise, you can mention if you plan to serve a meal, snacks, or just drinks, and that way guests will know if they should come hungry, peckish, or full.


You can also use this time to ask guests to inform you about any food allergies or dietary requirements that they have. Ask them to let you know when they RSVP.

, For kid’s birthdays, you may want other parents to stay, or you may prefer that they drop their children off and leave. In case you don’t want parents to stay, you can simply say “Please pick your child up at 5:00 p.m.,” or whatever time the party will end. If you'd rather parents stick around, you can say:


“Parents are welcome to stay”
“Separate adult snacks and refreshments to be served”

, This is an extremely important element to add to a birthday invitation if the guest of honor doesn’t know the party is happening. The last thing you want is for all your hard work and planning to be ruined because you forgot to tell guests that it was a surprise party! You can explain this by saying:


“Karen sure will be surprised!”
“Please note this is a surprise party”
“Please arrive on time: we don’t want to ruin the surprise!”

, Whether you want to be serious, formal, funny, or silly, including a quotation is always a great way to personalize a birthday invitation. Quotations, poems, and other creative customizations can go anywhere you like on the invitation, but they're a good way to open or close the invitation. Some famous quotations about age include:“Middle age is when your age starts to show around your middle!” — Bob Hope
“Age is strictly a case of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter!” — George Bernard Shaw
“Wrinkles should merely indicate where the smiles have been.” ― Mark Twain, Poems can be in any mood or tone you like (such as funny, or serious), they can help set the mood or theme for your party, and they can help you convey some of the important information you need to tell guests. Examples of poems include:


Funny: “A surprise is in store, Karen’s not so young anymore, come see for yourself on April third, but don’t forget: mum’s the word!”
Serious: “Another year has passed, it sure has been great, please join us at the mast, as we join to celebrate, we’ll have a merry time, be at the boat for nine.”
Cute: “I’m turning one, won’t it be fun, come see my cake, and the mess I will make!”, Everyone likes a good laugh, and this can be especially helpful with people who don’t particularly like birthdays. You can include a funny quotation, poem, joke, or just say something humorous. You can try out something like:


“Karen’s turning 39…again!”
“Age is not important unless you're a cheese.” — Helen HayesWhat goes up and never comes down? Your age!"
"
Write out dates.,
Write out guests' full names.,
Include the hosts.",How to Write a Formal Invitation1," Regardless of the type of event you’re inviting your guests to, you should use a formal writing style on a formal invitation. This means spelling out dates and other words that are usually abbreviated.For example, you should write “Saturday, the nineteenth of November” instead of “Saturday, November 19th.”
You should also write “253212 Boston Street” instead of “253212 Boston St.”;
, Don’t use the shortened versions of guests’ names. Write “Stephanie Smith” instead of “Steph Smith"" and always use last names.

, One of the most important parts of the formal invitation is the inclusion of the event's host(s). Listing the hosts tells your guests who is inviting them to the event. How you write the hosts' names and the order in which you should list them varies depending on who is hosting. These rules are particularly important if you are writing a formal wedding invitation.For example, you should start a dinner invitation by saying ""Sam and Ellen Smith invite you to a dinner celebrating the graduation of their daughter Leslie from graduate school.""

"
Send invitations of a party to people two to three weeks ahead of time.,
Write the name of the person at whose house the party will be held first, when more than one person is hosting a party.,
Reply to invitations when it is imminent that you will not be able to make it (with regrets only).

,
Extend telephone invitations for all but very formal dinners.

,
Respond to invitations as soon as you can.

",How to Respond to Invitations,";
, If one host is a lot older than the others, write his/her name first. Clearly state where the event is and where acceptances and requests are to be sent. Use RSVP (French for ""Respondez, s'il vous plait,"" or ""Respond if you please."")

Set the date and time that works best for you.,

Determine the place for the party.,

Figure out the details of your party and write them down.,

Double-check your list.",How to Make Spa Party Invitations1,"

Look carefully at a calendar and make stars on the dates you are, or think you are, available.
Ask yourself which day of the week you would like to have it. Weekends would probably work best for your guests, because they may be at school or work during the weekdays.
As for the time of day, ask yourself if you want to avoid dinner hour and start in the evening, or go ahead and have your party around lunchtime for a long day full of relaxation.
Write down the date and time you chose on a piece of paper. Make sure you stay organized!;
, You need to think about this. You have the option of having professionals run the event or, if you want to stick with creativity and let your guests feel homey, you can hold your spa party at your house.

A large basement works best for a home party, but if you don't have one and really want to set up your spa in a basement, ask a friend who does have one. Big basements allow guests lots of room to switch stations and enjoy themselves.

, Try to shorten them so that you can put some details on your invitation.

What activities are you planning to do?
What foods will be served?
Is there anything special that your guests need to do or bring?

, Do you have all details ready? Is the day you picked perfect? Make sure you have these things written on your list:

A date and time the spa party starts and ends.
The location of the spa party.
Details about the party.
Your phone number for the RSVP.
Any other additional details about your party.

"
Seek out the appropriate event for your booth.,
Sign up early.,
Keep track of all costs associated with the event, including booth rental, travel, hotel, giveaways, food, fees, etc.,

Make reservations.,
Gather or produce your supplies.,
Get help.,
Prep your help.,

Dress for success!",How to Organize and Run a Booth1," If you can attend a similar event as a member of the public, do so. Notice what other presenters are doing. Bring a notepad and paper, taking notes on what you appreciated in certain booths and what you thought other booths could have done better. As you do, keep your audience in mind. Activities, displays and giveaways for seniors are far different than those for boomers, x-ers and other groups.
, Find out well in advance what is required to run a booth at the event you wish to attend. Apply and pay any fees ahead of time, too.

Now is the time to contact event organizers with any special requests. If you need lighting or electricity in your booth, for instance, be sure to request it well in advance. If you need a sound system, refrigeration, vehicle access, or anything else besides your designated space, ask for it right now!
If you have a choice of booth locations, choose the one that will have the most traffic. Failing that, try to be near other booths or concessions that will attract the sort of traffic that you want.

, When the event is over you will want to compare its cost and results with other events to decide if you want to return., If you must travel to get to this event, reserve lodging, book flights, and secure a rental car. Large-scale events may completely fill the facilities near the venue, so secure these accommodations as soon as you're certain you will attend.
, Your supplies will depend on the exact nature of the event and what you are promoting, but consider the following:





 Show your identity clearly.

Displays and signs. At the very least, have at least one large banner stating clearly who or what you are promoting. Additional displays can help to inform your audience, too. Don't expect anybody to read large amounts of text while wandering by a booth. Instead, use large, eye-catching graphics and save the details for your flyers. A consistent look and feel between your different displays will help give your booth a unified, complete feel.





 Colorful stickers.

Freebies. A classic way to attract people to your booth is to give something away. Samples of something related to your message are ideal. Usable items (pens, t-shirts, bags) with your name and insignia printed on them can act as long-term reminders and even walking advertisements. Even a few dollars' worth of candy or a plate of munchies can get people to approach.

Literature. If you want people to contact you and remember you after the event, plan to hand out business cards, flyers, or brochures relating to your message. Bring more than you think you will need.
Demonstrations. If you can demonstrate something related to your organization (such as a product or service) or display the results of a successful project or activity, bring it for show and tell. Better yet, allow your visitors to participate in some way, perhaps by trying out what you are promoting.




 Your turn next.

Activities. Bring these to draw people to your booth. Holding a drawing for a larger prize can net you a bowl full of contact information. Even if the activity is a beanbag toss or a portable putting green, it can bring people in for long enough to talk to them and let them know why you're there.





 A space out of the rain.

A canopy. If your event is outdoors, a portable canopy, tent, or gazebo is indispensable for keeping the sun (or rain) off. It will also help you look more official and professional. If it can match your organization's colors or just be brightly colored, it will help make your presence that much more noticeable. Be sure that you learn in advance how much space the event will permit you to occupy.

A table and chairs. Again, the event organizers may provide these, or not. If you're not sure, ask.
Weather proofing. If the booth is outdoors, you may need weights to hold down papers, clips or clothespins to keep tablecloths and signs from blowing away, and so on. Of course, also dress for the weather you expect.




 Come prepared.

Tie downs and tools. If you know you will be assembling your own booth, table, or displays, make sure to bring the tools you'll need. Screwdrivers, pliers, and an adjustable wrench could come in handy. Scissors, packing tape, safety pins, and rope are good ideas, too. If you're not sure what you need to assemble your booth, do a dry run in advance at home or at the home office. Note: With current aviation restrictions, make sure that you pack assembly tools in your checked luggage, not your carry-on, to avoid hassles. Nothing worse than having any tools that will be useful at the show for assembly confiscated due to safety restrictions.





 The wheel was invented for a reason.

A cart or dolly. Especially if it is a large event, don't assume that you'll be able to park anywhere close to your booth. A handcart or dolly will help to bridge the gap.
Lights. If you think you will need lights, be sure you will have a source of electricity to power them.


Water. You'll be talking a lot, and it may be costly or inconvenient to visit the event concessions.




 Getting there.

A vehicle large enough to carry everything you will need. If you need to rent a van or truck, make arrangements in advance.


, If your booth is doing its job, you'll have lots of people to talk to over the course of the event. Don't try to make it a one-person show. Even one other person can help to keep you composed and your voice intact. If your booth is fairly popular, you'll want help just to make sure that everybody who is interested has somebody to talk to without waiting in line. If at all possible, arrange the schedule so that people work in shorter shifts. It's tiring to stand for long periods of time and say the same things over and over., Let them know what they're offering the public, whom they're approaching and how, where the various facilities nearby are, and when to arrive. They'll be speaking for your organization as experts, and they'll come across more professionally if they're informed, even if they are volunteers., Try to staff your booth with attractive people who are attired appropriately, yet draw attention. This will set your booth and organization apart from the maze of other booths and make you part of the show.
If your organization has a uniform or even a t-shirt, wear it, and encourage your colleagues to do the same. Customized t-shirts are relatively inexpensive to produce even in low volumes.
Dress alike. Even if you simply agree to wear jeans and a t-shirt in your organization's color, you'll look more like you are meant to be there.
Dress professionally. A business suit will show that you're serious and give your message that much more clout.
Wear costumes or dress thematically. If it's a festive atmosphere, or your group is theatrical, wearing clown costumes, ball gowns, or big, silly hats could attract a lot of attention.
Use professional spokes models if appropriate. Attractive people who know how to ""work"" a crowd can be a powerful force to draw attention to your booth and your organization. Make sure you use professional people who understand how to behave correctly.

List the hosts in the correct order.,
Write the host(s)' names correctly.,
Invite your guests to the wedding.,
Include the rest of the information.,
Include information about the reception.,
Tell your guests how they should respond.",How to Write a Formal Invitation2," Who is hosting the wedding – usually defined by who is paying for the wedding – will affect the order of names listed on the invitation. The bride's parents always go on the first line, followed by the groom's on the third line. ""And"" should get its own line in between The bride's name should always come before the groom's.


If you are writing an invitation for a same-sex wedding, you can list the parents’ names in whatever order makes sense to you. This might be alphabetical order or you might just want to flip a coin to see who goes first., There are a lot of rules regarding how you should write out the hosts' names, depending on who the hosts are. Generally, the hosts related to the bride go first, followed by the groom's relatives.


If the parents of the bride or groom are still married write “Mr. and Mrs."" followed by the bride's father's name. So Tiffany Smith's parents should be written as ""Mr. and Mrs. John Smith” or “Mr. and Mrs. James Carter” on the first line of the invitation. The groom's parents should be written the same way, on the third line (with ""and"" on its own on the second line).
If both families – including the bride and groom – are hosting, you should write “Together with their families,"" on the first line, then the name of the bride, ""and,"" and the name of the groom on the second, third, and fourth lines respectively.
If the bride’s parents are divorced and remarried but hosting together, you should write list the mother's new name first, followed by the father's name. So for example, you might write “Mr. and Mrs. Jill Willby and Mr. and Mrs. Greg Smith."" Again, each couple gets their own line with “and” on the second line.
If someone other than parents or stepparents are hosting, write the host(s) name(s) and their relationship to the bride or groom. So, for example, if the bride’s brother is hosting, you should write “Mr. Stanley Smith requests the honor of your presence of the marriage of his sister Stephanie Smith.”

, Once you’ve established the hosts of the event (in the right order), you need to actually invite the guest(s) to the wedding. Regardless of who hosts, the next line after the hosts’ names should be either “requests the honor of your presence” or “requests the pleasure of your company.” That should be followed by either “at the marriage of” if someone other than the bride(s) and/or groom(s) are hosting or “at their marriage” if the bride(s) and/or groom(s) are hosting as well.


For example, you might say “ request the pleasure of your company at the marriage of their daughter Tiffany Smith to Adam Jones” (if the bride’s parents are hosting) or “request the pleasure of your company at the marriage of Tiffany Smith to their son Adam Jones” (if the groom’s parents are hosting., Once you’ve established who’s hosting and invited your guest(s) to the event, include the rest of the information for the wedding. In order, you should list the date, time, and venue of the wedding, each on their own line.

, If the wedding ceremony will be followed by a reception that everyone is invited to, you can add that information to the invitation itself. If not everyone is invited, you can write the reception information on a separate card to be included with the invitation.


If you include the reception information on the invitation itself, it should come last on the invitation and include the time and place. So, for example, you could say “Reception to follow at 5 pm at The Country Club 3000 Country Club Lane Minneapolis, Minnesota.” “Reception to follow” and “at 5 pm” should get their own lines, as should the street address, venue name, and venue city.
If you include a separate reception card, write it as you would on the bottom of the invitation., If you want your guests to respond whether they’ll be coming or not (and most hosts do because venues will require a final guest count), include information on how they should do that. This usually means including an RSVP card that lists the response date, along with a pre-addressed and stamped envelope. Leave space for their name and how many guests they’re bringing.For example, a standard RSVP card will say “M.______________ __ will attend __ will not attend.” The “M.” at the beginning allows them to write “Ms.,” “Mr.,” “Mr. and Ms.,” or “Mr. and Mrs.” and lets you know how many people are attending.
If you are asking your guests to make a meal selection, this should be listed on the RSVP card as well. List their meal options and leave a space underneath each for the names of the guests requesting that particular meal.

Invite guests to a formal dinner.,
Invite guests to an anniversary celebration.,
Invite guests to a bridal or baby shower.,
Ask guests to RSVP.",How to Write a Formal Invitation3," When inviting guests to a formal dinner, be sure to word it so they are invited “at a dinner” or “to a dinner,” never “for dinner.” Your invitation should read “We request the pleasure of your company at a dinner” or “You are cordially invited to a dinner” before listing what the dinner is for.You may or may not have hosts to lists for a formal dinner, but if you do, their names should go at the top of the invitation.

, Writing an invitation to an anniversary celebration is similar to writing one for a wedding. You should include the hosts’ names, the date, and the venue, but you should also note that it is an anniversary celebration.For example, you could write “Dan and Carol Smith are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary. Their children invite you to join them for a reception at The Country Club.”
If you do not wish guests to bring gifts for the couple, you can simply note “No gifts please” at the bottom of the invitation.

, These types of invitations are usually less formal than wedding invitations. You may or may not list a host, but you should include the name of the bride and/or couple and the information regarding the shower. The spacing of a shower invitation should follow the spacing of a wedding invitation.For example, you could write “You are cordially invited to a bridal shower in honor of Tiffany Smith on November 5th at 6 pm. The Country Club Minneapolis, Minnesota.”

, The RSVP etiquette for events other than weddings varies widely. You should ask your guests to let you know if they're attending or not, but it's up to you how you'd like them to respond. Formal dinner invitations should include an RSVP card similar to the kind you would send for wedding, but anniversary parties and bridal or baby showers can simply ask guests to call the host with their response.

Address the invitation of a couple with one or more distinguished titles.,
Address invitations to adults 18 and over.,
Address invitations to whole families.",How to Write a Formal Invitation4," If you are inviting a married couple, tradition dictates that you write “Mr. and Mrs.” followed by the husband’s name. However, if the couple does not have the same last name, you should include both of their names. If you are addressing an invitation to a married same-sex couple, you should include both of their names as well.For example, you could write “Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Smith,” “Mr. Stanley Smith and Mrs. Emma Stone,” or “Mrs. Julia Gould and Mrs. Elizabeth Gould.”

, If any of your guests have distinguished titles - like “Dr."" - you should be sure to use them. If one member of a couple has a distinguished title, use that title and then ""Mr."" or ""Mrs."" or ""Ms."" for the other member of the couple.For example, you could write “Dr. Stephanie and Mr. James Smith” if they have the same last name, “Dr. Stephanie Jones and Mr. James Smith” if they have different last names or “Dr. Stephanie Jones and Dr. James Smith” if they have different last names but both have distinguished titles.

, Unless they live with their parents, any adult over the age of 18 should receive their own invitation. You can use “Ms.” or “Mr.” in the addresses if they are single., If you wish to invite an entire family to your event, whether the children are over 18 or not, you can simply write “The Smith Family” and include their address. This lets the recipient know that everyone in the household is invited."

Being fully set up as soon as the doors open means that you will not waste event time fumbling with displays or boxes instead of communicating your message., Once you've set up, walk outside and see your booth from the point of view of your visitors. Are your signs clearly visible from the different directions where people will approach? Is your booth inviting? Do you have any distracting loose ends showing?, Do you want to be behind a table with your audience in front, or do you want the table at the back of your booth so that you can approach people and invite them in?
, Talk to your customers. When they walk up to your booth, give them a few seconds, then say, ""Hello."" They will most likely say hello also. Then smile, and tell them about your booth. Sometimes if you start to talk about something else, like how nice the day is, or how cute the child they have along with them will distract them from your crafts. When you are ringing everything up, you can talk about these things. Remember to smile and say ""Thank you, come again!"" Also hand them a business card if you have one and inform them of where you'll be next., However you draw people in, make sure that they leave your booth with some basic understanding of why you are there., It involves them in the conversation and it tells you which direction to go with your pitch, be it informational, commercial, or somewhere in between., These items will remind people of your organization, your contact information, and your message after the excitement and activity of an event has ended.
, Tell interested visitors how they can follow up and how you will follow up. Then, be sure that somebody in your organization does follow up promptly. Keep track of the source of leads so that you can compare the relative effectiveness of one event with another., Put yourself in the shoes of the staff for a large-scale event or venue. Then, dismantle your own booth at the end of the event and make sure any leftover litter or debris makes it into the trash. It's good manners and it will help to keep the event organizers and venue staff on your side for next time.
, If you will ever have a booth again, make some notes about your experiences this time. Write down what you brought, what you should bring next time, what you could have done without. Write down what was effective and what was not, and anything else you learned from this event. Next time, you can use your notes to help run things more smoothly. If somebody else runs the next booth, you can easily advise them on what you have learned."

Tidy up the bathroom cabinet and remove anything old or yucky.",How to Prepare the Bathroom for Dinner Guests," Put additional rolls into a container such as a wicker basket or on a toilet paper roll holder. Do not make any assumptions that one roll is adequate. And for some funny reason, people are reassured by seeing extra toilet rolls, even if they are not ever needed! Extra rolls in sight will help stop any rummaging through cupboards to find more - a benefit for you.;
, A small pile of two or more is handy because it allows guests to make their own mind up about whether or not to use a fresh hand towel, depending on how damp or dirty the older one appears.

, Don't force guests to use your everyday bar of soap; it is much nicer and more hygienic to use liquid soap. Choose one with a great scent.

, They can hang up in your bedroom for the evening. It is neater, you know nobody wiped their hands on these towels and it helps avoid confusion for guests.

, Guests will feel uncomfortable treading on bathmats meant for bare feet; don't leave them lying around.

, Not only will some people peek but they might be looking for something legitimate, such as Band-Aids™ or headache capsules. Put things like these in an obvious, upfront place in the cabinet.

So what's your ideal outcome? What do you want to get done?


Once you figure out what you're doing (celebrating, fundraising, educating, selling, proposing, etc.), think about why you're doing it. Knowing your motivations can help give you focus and drive.
Having a few objectives can also help align you in the direction you need to be going. You can't keep trying to reach a goal that hasn't been set! When you have $4,000 and you're aiming for $5,000, that goal can push you through to the finish line.;
, This is one of the most important factors in your event planning. Pick a date and time no one can make and it doesn't even matter how great an event you have planned. And pick a date and time that's too far into the future -- or coming up too soon -- and your guests will either forget about it or already have plans. The Goldilocks syndrome of event managing!


Ideally, you want to let your guests know about two weeks out. That gives them a good amount of time to not yet have plans and a good timeline for inviting them and reminding them once or twice before the time actually comes. So have your event be a few weeks into the future minimum, if you can swing it.

, Now that you have an idea of what you're doing and when you're doing it, you can start thinking about venues and approaching potential ones with a date and things you'll need. What kind of building do you want to host in and how will the space be managed? Are the guests to be sitting on chairs in rows, on benches or at tables, or on picnic rugs in the open? Will the weather pose a problem? Will there need to be room for dancing, speakers podium or a stage? If so, plan to ensure the event space is large enough.


It is always best to visit the site in advance and draw yourself a map of the area. This map can be used as a ""battle plan"" and allows you to sketch and allocate table space, service routes for food service, disabled access if required and exit routes, as well as how you will get the equipment into place. You should also mark where the power generator (if required), external equipment such a refrigerator, ice maker, barbecue or stoves (etc.) will be, as well as where power points and cables will be (which may be covered discreetly with a rug) and other safety hazards to address.
Are legal and local government approvals required? In most instances approvals are required for a bar, but also for excessive noise, vehicle access and parking, building large enclosures such as a pavilion and other needs.

, How many people can your budget and venue handle? Some events are strictly ticket entry or invitation only, so it is easier to plan, but many events will have latecomers, or extras such as children, partners or friends. And keep in mind that the more guests you have, the more crew you need, too.


As it can be the biggest logistical problem it's always wise to ensure there adequate room for all people to move around at the site.
In older establishments, they usually call the quantity of guests ""pax,"" so if working in a function centre and you see ""Pax 150"" it means 150 guests are expected.

, Hopefully you have a few people you can lean on to gauge together how much money you'll need for this event. Are you paying any staff? Renting equipment and your venue? Supplying food and drinks? Publishing pamphlets or postcards? Settle on a number that seems doable and cater your plan to it. You don't want to wind up paying out of your own pockets for this if you don't have to.


You may be in a situation where you can get sponsorships or donations, but most of us aren't so lucky. If you don't foresee any more funds coming in, it's imperative that you cut corners when need be. Instead of having a catering team, form a BYO or a ""bring-a-plate"" function (catering is minimal, but you will need to provide a food table, bain maries and refrigerators). Instead of hiring a photographer, go around and take photos yourself. Get creative where need be!

, Organize your service team (even if they are friends and relatives or other volunteers) to handle different, relevant sections, even if you're not professionally running an event, but running a small family event. Good event management in a big scale is about organizing people to be in charge of individual areas of the event and making sure everyone knows what the plan is.


Your crew needs just as much advanced noticed as the teams you're hiring and your guests. Assign them duties as soon as possible, giving them preference if you can. And try to have a few people on standby -- there are always a few flakes in every bunch.

, No more planning can happen until know just what's going to happen at your event. When are the speakers speaking? Are there games, activities, or presentations that should be scheduled? How much time will the guests need to eat? Work out a fairly detailed timeline for the day's activities.


Always leave a little wiggle room; no event will be exactly as you planned, down to the minute. People run late, speeches take longer than expected, the line for the buffet doesn't shuffle along, you name it. So while you need a good idea of what's happening, understand that it's for organizational purposes and nothing is written in stone.

, Because how else will people know to come?! You gotta send them invites! And this isn't something you should scrimp on, either. Your invitation is the face of your event. The first impression people get of what to expect and if they should even come. It's gotta be good.


Consider your typical invitations -- postcards, flyers, etc. But also go paperless: email, newsletters, Facebook, Twitter, and sites like Eventbrite that serve as invitations, guest trackers, and a calendar.

Correction: if you're trying to get as many people to come as possible, definitely use Facebook and Twitter. If you're trying to keep it to VIPs only, avoid these platforms. That's just asking for trouble.



, You'll need a headcount to know just how much and what you all need, so keep track! It probably won't be the number that actually show up, but it should give you a general idea. Websites designed for event managing can help you do this -- but so can Facebook and an Excel spreadsheet.

, Will you need to find, hire, book or delegate photographers, builders, designers and decorators, guest speakers, sponsors, entertainers or bands, officiates or clergy, dancing partners or demonstrations? It is wise to include them in catering and seating calculations so that a meal and a table place is provided for them if appropriate or required, too.


Are food and beverages provided? If so, know who will be on the team to look after the cooking, serving and cleaning. What type of food do you need to serve? Are there likely to be guests with allergies, vegetarian or vegan needs, diabetics, religious needs such as halal or kosher, gluten-free, (etc)? And will there be infants, young children or the aged or injured who cannot eat solid foods?
Are entertainment and logistics organised? This part might be delivery of music equipment, pavilions or tents and decorative effects or stage management you will need, such as a microphone and amplifiers, lighting, power outlets, projectors and screens for slideshows, smoke machines or other stage magic effects such as mirrors, banners and corporate signage, etc.

If you subcontract a company to be entertainers, consult with them to ensure they are able to supply and set-up their own equipment as well as where the stage and service sections will be on the site and what the schedule will be. This way you can find out what you may need to do to assist them.


Caterers, florists, entertainers and other important people appreciate as much time as possible to plan, as it is typically more expensive to obtain goods and staff for high urgency requests. The other advantage is should they not be able to keep your appointment, you have some time still to find an alternative.

, The MC doesn't always organise the event entirely, but they do host the event. It is usually a member of the party, who will organise speeches, announce events such as the meal courses, dancing, notable guests or entertainment. Liaise with this person often and keep them up-to-date. If they're any good, they'll be very helpful.


Sometimes you may have to be the MC, in which case the job becomes much harder as you will need to keep working until it's all over. It then becomes important to set up your service team with their own group leaders so you can delegate most of the normal duties to them.

, When you hire a team, check and double-check that they're bringing the gear they need. In some cases, they may just be providing you bodies or goods and leaving it at that; you may need to source the equipment separately. It can be rented, bought, or even borrowed from your extensive social network. Go through your checklist from napkins to PA systems to extension cords.


Decorations are a huge part of any event. Table linens, flowers, gifts, candles, balloons, banners or backdrops for photography, red carpets, (etc) should always be sourced well in advance.

, One thing many rookies forget are the finer points of the facilities. Are there enough? Examples are toilets and bathrooms, car parking spaces, wheelchair access ramps, changing rooms, storage rooms and kitchen space, waste disposal bins, wine coolers, power access, etc. These are obstacles that are only workable if you foresee them well in advance.


Also think outside of your event: will transport and accommodation be required for international or out-of-town guests or delegates at hotels, as well as bookings and space made for their transport to get them to and from the event?

, Understanding the social hierarchy of your event -- if it's not truly yours -- is integral to knowing how to handle any situation. As it is essential that the client has confidence in you, you will need to find out:


Who the key guests are––this is usually straightforward when it is a celebration event––such as the bride and groom. The client is not always the key guest/s but may be part of their group, or not present at all.
Who the host guests are––these people often act as hosts at their own tables and tend to be good socializes and motivators of guests. These people are useful to keep a convivial atmosphere and strike up a conversation if things turn quiet, encourage people to dance or to introduce people to other guests to make new friendships. These people should be reliable but are generally useful to know as they will keep you informed, may step in and be a guest speaker or MC for you in an emergency and these are the people overall who make the event flow the smoothest at the front line.
Who the peacemakers are. You should be aware at all times who these key people are as you need to advise them of issues and involve them in the handling of issues and disputes where appropriate. This will generally be the head of the family, a caretaker, or head honchos or hired security.
Who the decision maker is. For most cases it is yourself as manager, but when you must consult guests and it is not appropriate to involve the key guests (as they typically will be occupied being good hosts), find out who you should consult in an emergency. Ultimately it would be the person who pays the bill if you're charging for your services, or whomever you may deem as ""the client"" as the person having the final say on the matter.

, Well before the event, it's a good idea to scope out your venue and figure out how everything will be set up. You may need to make additional arrangements to accommodate the floor plan -- extension cords, lighting, etc. And if it's hard to find for you, it'll probably be hard to find for your guests, so be sure to take that into account, too!


If it's up to you, map out where everything will go and when. If there isn't room for it, it needs to go. Talk to the venue's manager about what help they're willing and able to pitch in and if there are any city codes you need to abide by, especially in the case of emergency.

, Your crews are going to be working hard. In order to show them your appreciation and to keep them on top of their game, make them a kit to give at the top of the event. Bottles of water, granola bars, chocolates, little tokens of appreciation, whatever you see fit. It'll up morale from the get-go, too.


Consider getting them badges or a little party favor to make them feel part of the event and to remember it by. And make sure they stay fed and watered! Always think of your team as resources you want to be able to use in the future.

, Before the event, it's important to have all your ducks in a row. Be sure to provide clear instructions to your crew on how to get to the site and give them your number or preferably a business card with contacts to call if they need directions. Does anybody have any questions? No? And break!


Make sure everyone is comfortable with their duties. Some people may not be willing to vocalize this, so read them if at all possible. Do they seem sure and confident? If not, reassure them, go over their duties, and ask them a few basic questions. When in doubt, pair them with a more able partner.

, Your own personal organization is just as important as the event's organization. If you're organized and things go haywire, all can still be fine. But if you're not, hell can break loose. Here's a few ways to prepare yourself:


Make a contact sheet with phone numbers and addresses. The baker thought you were picking up the cake? No problem. Call Ashley who lives nearby -- she can swing by the bakery on her way to the event.
Make a checklist. As teams file in, you'll know what goods, what equipment, and what bodies are missing.
Prepare invoices and billing as necessary. The more on top of your game you are now, the fewer problems you'll have later.

, Is it likely there will be frequent artistic changes? Weddings are infamous for clients making last minute design changes so it is wise to recommend to your clients a cut-off date for changes. Usually 1 week before the event is leaving it very close, but it gives the client some flexibility and avoids last minute changes coming too late to be practical or cost effective to implement.


If it is simple, subtle or basic changes using already sourced decorations, then it is not unreasonable to accede to change requests. Be as accommodating as possible in what is usually a very emotionally anticipated event.

, Be the first to arrive at the site to oversee the preparations. Make sure everyone files in accordingly and start making phone calls if not. Assist those who need assisting, direct those who need directed, and get out of the way when you need to. No injuries until after the event, please.


You'll feel a little calmer if you make a checklist. Have a portion for your crew, a portion for hired out crews, a portion for decorations and basic set-up, and a portion for equipment. When all is checked off, that's when you have time to breathe.

, Do not be afraid to delegate. The main stressor when it comes to an event is time. To save it, all hands need to be on deck -- or different decks. If someone isn't being as useful as they could be, give them something better to do. It's your job. It's not you being bossy or overstepping your boundaries; it's you doing what you're supposed to do.


When you delegate, be firm but polite. Say, ""Juan, I need you over here right now to help out with the caterers. Thank you."" Your crew needs to jive together as much as the event does. Keep everything moving swimmingly by being the leader that you need to be.

, This means making sure that things are kept to schedule and assisting or having backup plans if it falls behind -- and being okay with it. If you start stressing out, you'll lose your head. Nothing good will come of that. So when that speech runs ten minutes over and the speaker is ignoring your blatant distress signals or your attempt at feigning a stroke to create a diversion, relax. You'll just adjust the appetizer and no one will notice. Event intact.


Things happen. They do. They have a bad habit of happening. There's no way you can predict everything, and the sooner you accept this the better. A calm, collected event manager can do wonders for any event; a strung-out, tense one cannot. So relax and go with the flow -- it'll all be over soon!

, Check that guest numbers and needs are still correct on the day of the event and advise the service team of any changes at the earliest possible opportunity You should be the first set of eyes that notices if anything goes wrong.


Consult with your clients to see how they are feeling; they may be excited, nervous, worried, bored or mentally drained or have some issue on their plate that in some cases you may soothe with understanding, some kind words and practical assistance. It is wise to use this time to rejuvenate the enthusiasm in guests and the team where appropriate.

, Trust and respect your service team to look after themselves -- if you've given them a good base, they should be fine. Offer assistance if needed, but they should be experienced enough not to need any help at all. Here are a few things to keep in mind:


Act as a concierge or receptionist at the beginning, meeting and greeting each guest (if appropriate) as they come. Hand over the reins to the MC when the event starts. The management role will be more active problem solving and ensuring all the back of housework such as food preparation and service runs to plan.
Keep an eye on the guests and keep contact with the MC often and discreetly in case they want (or need) to change plans.
Keep a respectful distance from the key guests - after all, the event is all about them - but be easily accessible by checking at appropriate moments how they feel the event is going, as well as any problems, requests or suggestions they may have.

, You want all your guests to remember how awesome of a time they had. Actually, you probably want more than that. A visit to a website, future donations, word of mouth buzz, whatever. To ensure that your event is the legend it deserves to be, give a takeaway. Whether it's a picture, a flyer, or a pen, having something to remind your guests of the event is a good way to make sure you stay in their minds.

, Most events tend to run themselves when they start, but all the hard work is the preparation that no-one sees. So pat yourself on the back because you deserve it! Okay, back to tearing it down. The job's not over yet!


After the event, arrange a time to meet and thank your client. It is always recommended to offer an appropriate and thoughtful gift to remember their time with you, as it is these small touches that make the experience richer and may make them recommend your services in future. If you gave a gift during the event, such as in a gift registry with the other guests, then a thoughtful after present such as flowers, a framed photograph of your favourite moment at their event (such as cutting the ribbon, or the climax of the show, or the award ceremony, or the wedding kiss, or blowing out the candles on a cake, etc), or some other gift may be appropriate.

, Just like mom said, ""Leave it in the same condition you found it in,"" the same goes for your venue. Everything needs to be just like it was before you got there -- this is one business where you don't want to burn any bridges. So let your crews know it's time to tear down and don't let them leave until all is taken care of. And you need to pitch in too!


This is nice, sure, but it also prevents you from being billed any more than you should be. Many places will tack on extra cleaning fees if they find any opportunity to do so. So make it as spic and span as possible to avoid the hidden costs.

, You may need to arrange returning hired or borrowed equipment and later on consulting with the client about their experience. Even if unpaid after the event, thank them for the opportunity to have such a great experience to run an event with them. Can you get a business card of theirs?


Thank your crew, too! Make sure all parties are paid (and all parties have paid up), file receipts, and get everyone taken care of. You should be one of the last ones out the door -- and make sure it's locked behind you.

, This one is a common issue, so it is best to be prepared. By and large, delays are understandably hard to avoid (such as unforeseen traffic issues) and are forgiven by guests who came on time. That being said, here are a few things you can do to do your best to keep it from happening:


Ensure that invitations are clear as to the time of the event and if requesting an RSVP, ensure that the time is confirmed. Communicate with (via your contact sheet) the MC, relevant guests (often the leaders of the party members), entertainers and kitchen staff as soon as you're aware of an issue you cannot resolve easily. Should the delayed guests be the focus (such as the bride and groom), the usual methods are:
Contact the delayed guest/s directly to check for an estimation. Advise the kitchen immediately of all developments so they can slow down or speed up to keep time.
Refrain from making it known publicly that the event is being delayed because of certain guests (because the party will work that out on their own), but advise key hosts or members of the party that you have been made aware of the fact. Let them know what you intend to do, but allow the hosts to make a suggestion as they know the members of their party and what would be appropriate in the context.
Maintain careful watch on the time in relation to speeches. If key guests are late, serve an additional appetizer (first course) and/or beverage early as this will prevent guests who came on time from becoming bored and will keep them occupied.
For guests that are going to be delayed for more than is reasonable or possible (such as when serving food that simply cannot wait, such as souffles), start the event as planned and when the delayed guests arrive, start them at the next course of a meal (even if this is dessert).
Organise an additional dance, game, speech or other form of entertainment (especially music), and ensure extra distractions, such as group or party photographs are done until they arrive and this back-up strategy should be considered the day in advance.
For guests deliberately arriving late, it should be seen as that guest's choice, not your fault as manager, so your duty is first to the guests that are already present and to ensure they're looked after. In a nutshell, act as if there is no problem and carry on regardless.


, This one is rare if you have planned things carefully, however accidents do happen (such as a guest or young child making a mess of a food table, or an accident in the kitchen). Early on you should be aware of the type of guests so you can take into account when and where food is displayed (such as for a buffet) and where such guests are seated.


Any spillage for safety reasons must be cleaned up immediately, even if it means removing a red carpet or desired décor and furniture to be able to do so. If it is impossible to hide a stain without affecting the appearance or the integrity of the item (such as an antique), then removal is wise. If you have a spare, then use that; if not, move the existing furniture or décor subtly so it does not feel missing.
A soft rope barrier, curtain or screen is recommended whenever you need to hide the food area (such as a buffet with chafing dishes, or when organising a ""reveal"" of the next course), as certain guests may feel that if food is in the dining area, it is free-for-all, when they want -- which is not always the case.
Shuffle the menu. If part of a dish is not possible to include (such as a side dish that was burnt), either exclude it altogether, find an alternative, reduce the portion sizes to stretch foods, but increase portions of other foods to balance. Advise table hosts as required.
Unexpected vegetarians, teetotallers, those with food allergies, religious or special diets –– no surprise should ever occur with proper planning –– but guests occasionally do bring along additional family members, partners or close friends without advising you, especially if it's not a strict invitation-only event. This is usually easily resolved. Keep a headcount as guests arrive and when they arrive at the door, ask if there are any food requirements and advise the kitchen and service staff immediately.
For large unexpected groups that are not gatecrashers, send a team member to the kitchen to take stock and, if necessary, drive out to collect more supplies. Kitchens typically over-cater to cover for accidents and more often there are more cancellations than unexpected guests. Limited portions can be stretched when you provide additional fillers, such as bread rolls, salad or vegetable portions, ingredients for which can be quickly sourced from local supermarkets.

, It's wise to remember that many managers have made serious errors in underestimating the intelligence or forgetting the needs and desires of children at events, as they have the same needs and wants as adults - to have a good time and not be bored. Remember that their parents are also often offended if the event does not cater for their children. In practice, it is best to request an RSVP for every child that may come.


Young children (under 10) are best given food or snacks early as many dinner events have the meals start as late as 8pm, which is far later than most children are used to. Food provided should be fun and healthy but as special as the adult menu as parents appreciate special touches for their children - it makes their job easier so they can have fun as guests in their own right.
Over 10's usually are fine to be served adult food and portions, even if they don't eat all of it, but offer the children's menu to them (with their parent's permission) if they don't seem keen on the options. It has also been known for young adults 13-18 to often request the same food as youngsters, such as a hamburger and fries as opposed to more formal restaurant food and it has been a frequently used trick to re-brand the children's menu as an ""Alternative Menu"" for this age group of guests. It is very wise to play safe and discuss with key guests about your plans to keep the young and old engaged, well in advance of the date.
A discrete area should be provided for mothers with young children for their needs such as toilet/bathroom breaks, breastfeeding (etc.), and a place for very young children to sleep in if they are tired.

, Ideally this would never happen, but it does –– family or corporate events both. Politics and drama often come out at events that, as an outsider, you would not be always aware of. Prepare yourself.


Ask the client or key guests before the event of the likelihood of such issues, or with selected hosting guests if it is not appropriate to discuss these issues with the key guests, so that way you can ensure that people are seated in places that will not cause issue. Enlist service staff or key-guests to act as unofficial monitors, to keep an eye out for issues and to step in when required. Strictly speaking, your duty is to ensure the event is smoothly run, but only where it is appropriate, and to stay out of issues that are a private concern. Therefore, you should be aware of who within the party are the ""peacemakers"" of the group.
As it can be a difficult job to refuse alcohol to an inebriated guest, or to deal with an inebriated guest that inclines towards anger or violence, it is wise to enlist a peacemaker guest and only involve law enforcement when necessary after consulting with the key guests. Even in small events or backyard events when alcohol is often stored in an ice box for guests to serve themselves, it is equally important to be aware.
Gatecrashers are difficult. Should it happen, unobtrusively evict them if appropriate - consult your key guests to verify that they're unwelcome. For large scale and rowdy or abusive gatecrashers, your duty is to protect the existing guests where appropriate and to call security or the police if they do not leave after being politely asked to do so by yourself and/or the key guests.
Guests often shuffle name cards about at the beginning where they are sitting, so that they end up sitting next to people they want, or at a table they want. It is wise to check with the key guests how far this is permissible according to them. Typically you should have organised table plans in advance and have received approval from the key guests. Should it be that people must be at certain tables, then it is wise to keep people out of the dining room altogether until time. Often the lobby, foyer or bar area serves this purpose and if it is very important due to family issues, it is wise to group people together and move them en masse to the separate tables by each host-guest and service personnel to seat them in their proper order.

, Sudden, unexpected rain or snow can be common in parts of the world; likewise, a heatwave or a cold front can also can pose a problem. While weather events are not usually an issue if you're indoors, being outside makes things difficult. If bad weather is expected, then consider moving the event location. If the event cannot be relocated or rescheduled, hire a large tent or pavilion (admittedly this can be pricey on short notice). Keeping an eye on weather developments as you go is important; very little can be done to salvage an event affected by weather, so make the best of what you have.


Many parts of the world now have insurance policies in the event of severe weather or other problems. If you are in an area which is known for unexpectedly changeable weather, it is recommended to source a quote if there may be a chance the event will have to be re-scheduled as it will at least cover the client the cost of extending hire of equipment, site and service personnel.

Relax.",How to Prepare for a Dinner Party Without Fuss," Planning will reduce a large amount of the stress. Use lists to detail what is needed and work in shopping visits, travel times, preparation times, storage areas for food prepared in advance and a detailed list of ""what to do on the night"". It is a also a very good idea to keep a record of your dinner parties so that former ones inform your next plans and make it easier to know what to do, as well as what to avoid.;
, Asking too many people is asking for trouble; you won't have time to talk to them all and you will find it hard to prepare for a large group of people on your own.

, It is unpleasant for you and awkward for a guest who tells you at the last minute that they're allergic to your main course or that they're vegetarian and you've prepared nothing they can eat. Find out in advance and save yourself the worry. If their diet is so unusual for you that you're unsure what to do, consider asking them to bring along something that you can prepare along with everything else, or to provide you with the ingredients or a recipe in advance. People would prefer being asked than being left out.

, See Use Candles for Entertaining, Arrange a Place Setting for a Formal Dinner, for some ideas. Avoid making this aspect so challenging that you're fiddling with it at the last minute while also trying to deal with the food preparation. Set the table well in advance and add all arrangements early in the piece to remove this element of possible stress.

, Avoid making a menu that requires everything to be prepared and served immediately, or you will never leave the kitchen. This might be fine for restaurants with hordes of helpers but you (and possibly your partner) are it when holding a dinner party at home, so keep in mind that dishes which can be prepared in advance are a blessing. Desserts that can be made the day ahead are ideal (for example, ice cream, dessert pies, flans, mousse, etc.), as are elements of the main course that can be prepared hours earlier and simply reheated. In recipe books, look for the notation ""can be prepared 'X hours' in advance"".

, Instead of going over the top with food, go over the top with the presentation. Place a simple stewed fruit dessert into a glorious container, such as a pretty china teacup. The teacup will do all the hard work for you and the dessert will be enjoyed just as an elegant dessert because it's ""dressed up"".

, There is nothing harder than preparing a dinner party in a small space where everything and everyone is underfoot. Here are some things to consider:


Get pets out of the way. A meandering cat or over-enthusiastic dog can be a real pest when working fast in a kitchen!
Ask children to keep kitchen visits to a minimum. It's a good idea to have meals for children prepared in advance and heated quickly if they're not actually participating in the dinner party. Have them eat off trays in the TV room or outdoors to keep the dining area tidy and clean.
Clear out the fridge in advance. This will ensure that you have plenty of space to put food in that has been made or purchased specifically for the dinner party.
Clean out the oven. Do this well in advance and ensure that all the oven shelves are placed at the right level before heating it for food cooking.
Clear away anything extrinsic to preparation on benches, kitchen table, etc.
As you work on each part of the meal, put away the ingredients and wash used bowls, utensils, etc. so that space isn't taken up and you have items for using for the next stage of cooking.

, Setting a timer will provide a good reminder to remove things from cooking and chilling, as well as helping to provide you with a sense of rhythm as you work.

, Provided you greet everyone happily, and the place looks ready and buzzing with anticipation when your guests arrive, they'll fail to notice little mistakes during the rest of the night. Remember that most people are very supportive and very forgiving.

, If you do the preparation work, everything will run smoothly and you can enjoy the rest of the event with peace of mind. If you are concerned about forgetting to do things during the occasion, write a list and pin it somewhere obvious. This can be your source of guidance if you forget what needs doing next. Cross off items already done if wished.

Think about color scheme.,
Decide on your text.,
Decide on size.",How to Make Invitations2," The colors you choose for your invitations are often determined by the occasion itself. For example, a birthday party invitation may be done in the honoree's favorite colors or be related to the theme of the event (bright colors for a ""Mexican Fiesta"" theme, red and blue for a Spiderman theme or black and white for a formal wedding.) If you're sending invitations on behalf of someone else, be sure to consult with them about color preferences.


The number of colors you use may impact the final cost of your invites. Purchasing paper in multiple colors or designs or printing in colored ink vs. black can add a bit to your cost, so keep that in mind.

, You need to include basic information on your invitations so that everyone arrives at the right time, on the right day at the right place. Be sure you've confirmed all your arrangements regarding time, date and place before you sit down to make your invitations.


Think about additional information you may need to include such as a contact or RSVP phone number, instructions about attire or gifts, directions and/or a map and a web address (if you've created one for the occasion.
Some events, such as weddings, often include multiple events--rehearsal dinner, post-wedding day brunch and the like. Be sure all the information about auxiliary events has been decided and confirmed.

, The two biggest considerations when it comes to size are finding envelopes and postage costs. Make a visit to your local stationary or art supply store to look at options and contact or visit the website of the delivery service in your area.


Envelopes. The most common style of envelopes are A-style (also called A-line) They have side seams and square, sometimes deep flaps. They come in a range of sizes and their numeric designation corresponds to set dimensions. For example, A1 envelopes are 5.125' x 3.625' while the larger A-8 are 8.125' x 5.5'.

You can do some research online about envelope sizes. Be sure to make note of the size of the invite that will fit into the envelope you choose.


Mailing costs. Mailing regulations vary from country to country, so you want to check with the service you'll use about the specific regulations that govern cost. For example, the United States Postal Service (USPS) requires that letters not exceed 11 1/2"" long x 6 1/8"" high or be more than 1/4"" thick.Envelopes that are square or another unusual shapes incur an additional mailing cost because their size makes it difficult for them to be processed on mail sorting machines. Before you decide to get clever with addressing your invites, know, too, that envelopes on which the address is written parallel to the shorter edge cost more to mail."

Choose your backing(s).,
Print out your invitation text.,
Cut your paper.,
Glue the layers in place.,
Add decorative elements.",How to Make Invitations3," The backing layer(s) will be the piece onto which you will mount the actual text of your invitation. Using multiple layers gives your invitation depth, interest and can emphasize the color scheme or theme of your event.


Pick a medium- to heavy-weight piece of Cardstock for the first layer of your invitation. This will give some weight and firmness to your invitation. This kind of paper is most readily available in solid colors.
Chose one or more coordinating papers to glue to your first backing sheet. Pick papers in different patterns, related colors or different textures to add interest.
Layered invitations are not folded before being inserted into the envelope, so don't worry about creasing the slightly heavier stock or multiple layers.

, To end up with the correct size insert, it makes sense to first print out the text for your invitation. Once you see how much length and width you need for a text box, you can work back from there to arrive at the finished sizes of your backing paper(s).

, How much of your backing paper shows depends on what size you cut each layer. You can standardize your cuts so that, for example, a 1/2"" border of each backing paper shows, or you can create different size borders and allow varying amounts of different papers to show along the edges of your invite.


Measure your paper carefully and cut it using a paper trimmer or scissors. A paper trimmer will help ensure straight, even cuts, but as long as you take your time and are careful, you can do as good a job with a pair of scissors.

You can purchase scissors that have a decorative blade so that when you cut, your paper will have an interesting edge.



, Use a glue stick to glue your layers to one another. Lay your back layer down on the table and glue the next layer on top of it. Some people can simply ""eyeball"" the paper and know where to glue in order to create even edges. Other people need to measure and create small pencil dots so that they can line up the paper exactly when creating their bordered look.


Press the paper down firmly and allow it to dry completely before gluing the next layer in place to ensure layer number one doesn't move when you apply pressure to adhere the next layer.
The invitation text should be the last the layer glued into place.
If any of your layering paper is particularly delicate, use double-stick tape rather than glue to avoid the chance any bleed through.

, Once all your layers are glued in place and completely dry, you can add some decorative elements if you'd like. If you've used more than three layers (remember, your invitation text counts as a layer) or bold paper designs, you may not want to add anything else at this point. However, if you think an additional element may complete the invitation, go ahead and put one in place.


Punch two holes at the top of the invite, thread a pretty piece of ribbon through and tie in a bow.
Glue three buttons, stickers or punched-paper shapes in one corner of your invitation.
Get out your sewing machine and zig-zag stitch around your layers for a custom look.
Rubber stamp a large image on the back of your invitation as a bit of a fun surprise for anyone who turns the card over after reading the invite.

Assemble your invitation.,
Fold and tie.",How to Make Invitations4," Place the piece of paper stock (80lb to 100lb paper recommended)that will serve as your folder horizontally on the table in front of you. With a ruler, begin at the bottom left-hand corner of the paper and draw a horizontal box that measures 1 1/2"" high by 7"" long.

, Use a pair of scissors or an Xacto knife to cut out the horizontal box you just measured. Discard this piece of paper.


The longer ""flap"" of paper that's left on the right-hand side will fold up to become your pocket.

, With your paper back in place in front of you and the cut-out space in the bottom left-hand corner, you'll work from left to right to make your folds. Measure in 2"" from the left and create a vertical fold. Measure 5"" from that fold (7"" from the left-hand edge of the paper) and create a second fold.


Use a paper scorer or folding bone to create sharp folds in your paper.

, Measure up an 1 1/2"" from the bottom edge of the long ""flap"" of paper on the right-hand side and fold to create your pocket. Glue the pocket into place.

, Use your computer and home printer to print out the text of your invitation. The final, cut size of your text should be 4 3/4"" wide x 6 3/8"" tall.


If you find it easier, you can print ""corner guides"" around your text box to give you the proper dimensions and help you cut your paper to the proper size.
Use a glue stick to glue the invitation text to the middle panel of your pocketfold.

, Print out the text for the inserts that will sit in the pocket of your invitation and cut them to size. A simple guideline is to make the inserts just a little smaller than the pocket. In this case, make them just under 4"" wide and a little less than 6 1/2"" tall.


Inserts could include directions and/or a map; if this is a wedding invitation, they could also be a reception card, information about local accommodations or an RSVP card and envelope.
Plan to stagger the height of your inserts. You can go with what looks good to your eye or standardize the height of your inserts, perhaps making each one 1 1/2"" shorter the one behind it in the pocket.

Whatever you decide about the height of your inserts, be sure to give each one a title that'll show when the invitation is open. Place the copy for each insert so that it falls below the edge of the insert that gets layer on top of it. In that way, the overall look of the invitation won't be cluttered, and readers can simply pull each insert out of the pocket in order to read the information.



, Place the inserts in the pocket; the tallest goes in first and each progressively shorter insert is placed in until the pocket is full.

, Fold the right-hand pocket side of your invitation closed and then fold the left-hand flap over. Tie a piece of decorative ribbon around the invite to hold it closed.

Prepare sushi rice in advance.,
Purchase nori sheets.,
Prepare the ingredients and fillings.,
Arrange the setting.,
Serve your guests sake or tea.,
Allow everyone to create their own sushi.",How to Throw a Sushi Dinner Party," You may want to cook this at the last minute so it will be still warm when your guests arrive. Avoid refrigerating the rice at all costs, as the rice will dry up and have a different texture, even when microwaved. Depending on the amount of people planning to arrive, you might want to reserve a pot of rice for every four or five guests (about a cup of rice per person). Provide bowls of water on the side for rice scoopers.;
, The more fresh the sheets are, the more crispier they will be. When preparing nori on platters, be sure that the glossy side is faced down so that the guests can lay on the rice on the ""rough"" side of the sheet.

, Peel any skin off and cut into long thin strips. When making maki sushi, you'll want the ingredients to extend from one side to another, as well as the advantage of successfully rolling the sushi without having it budge out. Be sure to use at least two or three plates with medium sized piles with tongs on the side for accessibility.


Choose your fish and meat. These can be prepared the night before and heated, if needed, before the guests arrive. Popular ideas can be thinly chicken strips, imitation crab, and shrimp.
Choose your vegetables. The most common vegetables used for sushi are typically cucumbers, carrots, and avocados. If you have easy access to Japanese or Asian ingredients, try incorporating takuwan (pickled daikon radish).
Choose your condiments. Ginger and wasabi are excellent condiments to any Japanese dish; just be sure to advise your guests to add a dab of the item, as too much can make it very spicy.

, Add cushions on the floor around a long short table for the most authentic Japanese eatery environment. To avoid messes, it's advisable to wrap sushi mats with plastic wrap or wax paper. When doing this method, people sharing mats won't be stuck with another person's rice or nori leftovers. Make sure that each person has their own small bowl of water or rice vinegar specifically to dip their fingers in, as rice can be sticky to handle.

, Typically drinks are the very first items to arrive at a table, so allow this to be a great ""icebreaker"" item before eating.

, Continue to serve drinks and have fun making food.

If you’re planning an evening for the people on your block, make sure you remember to invite everyone. If you’re simply aiming for a cozy evening with friends, try to pick folks who know each other or will mesh well.


Consider the size of the homes you expect to host the party. Most houses can’t seat more than twelve comfortably, and many apartments are even smaller than that. Plan accordingly.
If you want to throw a big party (maybe for the neighborhood or a large club), consider splitting the guests into teams of a manageable size (six to twelve). Then, pick hosts and plan parallel dinners for each team.;
, Most progressive dinners consist of three to four courses, with a host for each. When selecting your hosts, you may want to ask yourself different questions about them, including…


...are their homes of similar sizes? Will they all be able to accommodate your guests?
...are they reliable? You want hosts who will remember the party and put effort into their part.
...are they in walking distance of one another? Alternately, do they have enough parking spaces around their homes that guests could drive or carpool?...are their houses ADA-accessible? If you have guests with mobility restrictions, it’s best to make sure they can get into the houses they visit.
...are they good at cooking anything in particular? If you have a friend who can bake homemade bread, or make famous spaghetti, this is their moment to shine!

, Themes can make figuring out the menu, music, and decorations much easier.Consider holiday themes (Friendsgiving or Talk Like a Pirate Day), international themes (Italian or Indian), or even historical or fictional themes (Game of Thrones or Valley of the Dolls).

, You don’t need to set it in stone at this point, but you should have an idea of things that work well together. Otherwise, you might end up with a cheese plate for an appetizer, pizza as a main course, and milkshakes for dessert instead of something more cohesive.

, This is extremely important! A good estimate is one hour for each course, plus fifteen minutes travel time.This may be different if homes are very far apart, or if your friends are very talkative.

, You can instruct guests to bring their own if you're working on a budget. Alternately, if the hosts are up to it, they can offer a few bottles of wine each or something similar. Really, though, a progressive dinner is all about the food and the company--you don't have to get too intense with the booze.

, You’re all going to be working together to make this party a success, so it’s vital that everyone is on the same page and feeling comfortable! Meet in person if you can and discuss details.

, These can be paper invitations, a plain text email, or a link to an event-planning website like Event Brite or SignUpGenius--just make sure all the information is there in writing, so your guests have something to refer back to! Include the times and addresses for each host's house, request an RSVP, and inquire about dietary limitations.

, You want every guest to be full and happy at the end of the party, so make sure everyone has something to eat! If anyone has a physical or religious restriction, there are plenty of resources to help you work around it.

, You want an accurate count of guests, especially for the host who's handling the main course. You also want to make sure guests know what they’re in for in terms of traveling and timing.


A simple phone call or text works best for this. Say something like ""Hi, this is Sarah, the progressive dinner its happening on Sunday at 7 and I would really love to see you there! Let me know if you can come.""

, Get in touch with any guests who have a long way to travel or mobility restrictions and help them choose a vehicle and designated driver.

, Once you’ve got a headcount on the guests, be sure each host knows the final number and is still prepared to host their part of the meal. It’s super-important to make the hosts feel included and appreciated. They are your collaborators, and they deserve support.


Confirm that each home has appropriate seating for the number of guests attending. Having a few folding chairs on hand is a good idea.
Ask hosts if they need help with nonperishable items, like dishes, ice, decorations, and playlists.Consider making a collaborative playlist on Spotify, Google Music, or Apple Music. You can make this for the hosts only, or open it up for guests to edit as well. After the party, it can be really nice to revisit this playlist as a reminder of good times.

, At the approximate time of day when the party is set to start, practice walking or driving in between the hosts’ homes. Be aware of traffic, lighting, and other safety issues, so you’re set to advise your guests if there’s sidewalk repair happening on a dark block.

, Ask if they’re still up to hosting, and make sure they’re all set! It’s not a bad idea to budget time for a grocery run or other errands.

, If any guests get lost or confused, you’re probably going to be the person they reach out to, so be ready! Double-check to make sure you have all of your hosts’s numbers at the ready, too.

, Make sure you’re prepared to shuffle your guests along so they’re on time for each stop. Check in with the hosts one more time, and get ready to enjoy the party!


If you can find sneaky ways to clean up along the way, like clearing the dishes, go ahead. Don’t go too far out of your way, though--you’re there to enjoy yourself.
It might go without saying, but don’t get so drunk you can’t direct people if need be!

, Help them clean up, and consider getting each a small present (like flowers or wine) to say thank you. If you’re all feeling up to it, you can hang out and snack on leftover cheese.

Add any additional plates and utensils that you may need.",How to Set a Table2," Put a placemat in front of each of the chairs you've set up for your guests.


For a true formal dinner setting, you should have enough matching placemats for all of the guests, and the placemats should also match the tablecloth.

, Fold the napkin in halves or fourths, depending on the napkin. The napkin should be ideally made of cloth.









You can also fold your napkin to the left of the forks after you put them down.

, It should cover just the right side of the napkin. If you want to have a fancy setting, use ceramic plates.








, The dinner fork should be very close to the plate without touching it, and the salad fork should be just a centimeter or so to the left of the dinner fork. The tines of the forks should be pointing away from the diner.









If you forget where each fork should go, just think of the order in which you would eat your meals. You would have your salad before your dinner, and you should eat from the outside in, using the utensils from left to right, so the salad fork would go to the left of the dinner fork.
Remember that you should be eating with the utensils from the outside in, starting with the ones on the outside of the plate and working your way closer to the plate until the end of the meal.

, The knife should be pointing away from the diner and the cutting edge should be facing the plate.









If you mix up where the forks and knife should go, just think of how a right-handed person would use a fork and knife to cut something. If you sit down and mimic the gesture, you'll see that you would pick up the fork with your left hand and the knife with your right, so that's where each utensil should go.

, The teaspoon will be used for stirring coffee or tea at the end of the meal.








, Do this if the first course will be soup, so that this will be the first utensil you pick up when you have your soup.









Note that in some traditional settings, the soup spoon is actually larger than the teaspoon.

, To place an additional glass for water, just position it above and to the left of the drinking glass. The tip of the knife should be pointing to the water glass.








, If your meal includes more courses or items, you may need to add the following additional plates and utensils:


A bread and butter plate and knife. Place this small round plate about five inches above the forks. Place a small knife horizontally over the plate, with the blade facing to the left.
A dessert fork and spoon. Place the small dessert fork and spoon horizontally a few inches above the plate, with the spoon on top of the fork facing left, and the fork facing right.
A coffee cup. Place the coffee cup over a small saucer a few inches above the outermost utensil on the left and a few inches to the left of it.
A red and white wine glass. If you have two different glasses, then the white wine glass will be the one closer to the guest, and the red wine glass will be slightly above and to the left of the white wine glass. You can remember this because guests should move from white to red wine.

, You can fold a cloth or a paper napkin in halves or fourths.








, The plate doesn't have to be ornate or elaborate. Just try to use matching plates for all of the settings.








, You'll only need to use one fork for a casual meal.








, The blade of the knife should face the plate, just as it would in a formal setting.








, If no soup will be served with the meal, then eliminate this utensil.








, The dessert spoon should be substantially smaller and less concave than the soup spoon.








, The dessert fork should be substantially smaller than the dinner fork. It should be directly below the dessert spoon without touching it.








, For a more casual setting, the wine glass can be stemless.








, It should be placed further back than the wine glass, and to the left of the wine glass. The water glass should be slightly larger than the regular glass.

Aim for symmetry.,
Group items by type.,
Go for a particular color scheme.,
Opt for a less is more approach.",How to Style a Buffet1," To help your buffet table appear well-organized, your decorations should be relatively symmetrical on either side. This will give your table a great, balanced look. Try to imagine a line splitting the buffet table in half and try to create a mirror image on either side of the line.For example, if you have a candlestick about six inches tall on one end of the buffet, try to place an item about as tall on the other end. You could have a candlestick on one end and a plant on the other.
You could try having a pattern in regards to the height and shape of objects. Towards the middle of the buffet, place shorter objects. Have the objects get bigger as you move outward.;
, This can give your buffet an organized feel. You don't necessarily have to group the exact same objects together. However, you can group objects of similar colors and shapes together.For example, try grouping together items of a similar color and height. A crimson book can be paired next to a short red figurine, for example.
Pair items by shape. You can, for example, have a tall, slender plant paired next to two long candlesticks.
You can also pair the same types of items. One section of your buffet can contain candles and candle holders while the other can contain antique books you're using as decoration.

, You should not have all the items on your buffet match perfectly in terms of color. This can be a bit much and may be overwhelming to look at. However, a general color scheme, especially one that goes with the room, can really help your buffet look well organized.For example, for a room with a warmer color scheme, go for a warm color palate. Stock your buffet with oranges, reds, yellows, and other similar colors.
You can also look to other decorations for ideas about color. Maybe you have a painting that uses a lot of gold and yellow colors hung on the wall just to the right of your buffet. Think about using yellow colors to decorate your buffet.

, You don't need your buffet to contain every decorative item in your home. In fact, this can easily be overwhelming. Opt for a less is more approach when it comes to decorating your buffet. Challenge yourself to choose only the best items and those that work with your decoration scheme.


For example, you may have accrued a lot of figurines over the years. However, you can't put them all on the buffet. Think about which figurines are the nicest and would work best with other decorations.
You may, say, be doing a green color scheme. Choose figurines that have some green in them and select the ones you like best. Think about other aspects, like height and shape, to keep the buffet symmetrical as you select the right items.

Plan for your desserts and coffee.",How to Set a Dinner Table1," Placemats protect the surface of your table from food and brighten up your dining experience. Make sure the edge of the placemat is about an inch away from the edge of the table.Choose a placemat that matches your plates and looks nice on your tabletop as well.


When in doubt, choose a simple white placemat.;
, A casual dining experience can include a soup or salad as an appetizer, an entrée, and a dessert. First, place the large main entrée plate on the bottom center of the placemat. Next, place your salad plate or soup bowl on top of the main entrée plate.The napkin can be placed between the entrée plate and the appetizer plate or rolled up on top of the appetizer plate.


If you’re serving dinner rolls, place a small appetizer plate to the left of the placemat.
The dessert plates should be brought in with the dessert for casual dining experiences.

, The forks will be placed on the left side of the plate and the knife and spoon on the right. Place the salad fork (if needed) to the left of the dinner fork and place the spoon to the right of the knife. If you want to set out dessert utensils, place them above the plate.The sharp side of the knife should be turned towards the plate.
Only set the table with silverware that you will use during the meal.

, Place the water glass above the knife on the placemat.If you’re planning on serving wine, place the wine glass to the left of the water glass and off the placemat. If you’d like to offer more than one wine, add other wine glasses behind the first in a triangle formation.


Most casual dining experiences only offer one kind of wine. If you have more than one kind of wine to serve, consider hosting a formal dinner instead.

, Set aside your dessert plates in advance. Once you’re ready to serve dessert, clear the dirty plates and distribute the dessert plates. If you’re serving coffee, you can either bring out the coffee cups and saucers with the dessert or place them to the right of the water glass at the beginning of the meal.The dessert silverware can be brought in with the dessert plates or placed above the table setting at the beginning of the meal.

Pass all dishes from the left.,
Keep the courses rolling.,
Amaze guests with your knowledge.,
Clear only two plates at a time, from the right.,
Clean plates out of sight.,
Remove main course dishes before bringing out dessert.,
Serve cream, dessert toppings and sugar from the left.,
As the cook, or host, always serve yourself last.,
Don't be afraid to ask for help.",How to Serve at a Dinner Party," Steamed or roasted vegetables, rice, salad, potatoes, and condiments are some of the things you can usually leave in the middle of the table for guests to help themselves to. This isn't strictly necessary, though. If you prefer to keep things simple, you don't have to leave anything more than salt and pepper on the table.;
, This is known as ""plating-up."" Don't expect guests to help themselves to food that requires assembly or is difficult to manage. The only way they'll get to see your creativity is if you put it out on the plate for them before you even get to the dinner table. Keep the rim of the plate clear of sauces, spills, anything; it frames the food.

, Traditionally it was customary to serve women first (eldest to youngest), then the men (same order). You can do this if you want to keep with tradition and the occasion is quite formal. Otherwise, choose one end of the table and move around it in a clockwise fashion, regardless of the genders of your guests.

, Guests and servers should pass dishes from left. The logic behind this is that most people are right-handed and this allows them them to serve themselves from the dish while it is being held by the passer. Nowadays it is less likely that the passer will continue to hold the dish, but will expect you to take it, so if you are left-handed, it won't be a problem. Place the dish down on your side plate to serve from it.

, It isn't a good idea to make guests wait too long between courses. They'll get fidgety, anxious and gossipy about what you're doing.

, Don't hesitate to tell them some interesting and brief details about the time-old recipe you've used and why the wine complements the meal so well. On the other hand, do not ever go into details about how the flesh portion of the meal was hunted/killed. This is bad taste and makes some guests very queasy. Leave it for discussion around the fireplace with a like-minded friend after dinner.

, The host or hired help should clear no more than two plates at a time to avoid bumping guests and interfering with their eating. There is nothing more annoying than the server's elbows in your face when you're just about to take the next bite.

, The place for scraping off the leftovers is the kitchen, not the dining table. Preferably the noises should not reach the guests but this is unrealistic for most homes. Just do it as quietly as possible and try not to clank, crack, break or drop the dishes. The last thing you need on top of anything else is a dropped plate to clean up.

, This means all the dishes on the table, the condiments and the side plates. If you haven't already set out the dessert spoons, this is the time to do so.

, Chocolates will have their own method of getting around the table; it has been suspected they have legs...

, This is polite and also sensible, since you'll probably be busy anyway with host's duties.

, Except for the most formal occasions, it's not unheard of to ask a close friend at the party to help you serve. Don't take advantage of the situation because that guest is there to enjoy himself too but don't hesitate to ask for a quick hand with a simple task that won't risk spills on their clothes.

Heat some oil in a frying pan.,
Add your kernels.,
Reduce the heat.,
Stir the kernels constantly.",How to Pop Sorghum1," Use a steel pot or a pan with steep sides. The exact amount of oil you need depends on the volume of sorghum you’ll be popping. Typically, you’ll need two tablespoons of cooking oil for every ¼ cup (32 grams) sorghum kernels. Heat the oil on high until it appears shiny.Coconut oil is the most common type of oil for popping sorghum. It adds a buttery flavor and is very healthy.;
, The amount of kernels you’ll need to add to the oil depends on how much oil you’ve put in the pan. If you’ve used only two tablespoons of oil, you’ll only be able to pop about ¼ cup (32 grams) sorghum kernels.¼ cup (32 grams) sorghum kernels makes about two cups of popped sorghum., When you add the kernels, the range should be set to high heat. After adding the kernels, reduce the heat to medium-high. Do not cover the pan as you would when making popcorn., Use a wooden spoon to move the kernels around the pan. Continue stirring until the time between pops is about 10 seconds. Do not leave your sorghum alone while popping on the range. Failing to stir the kernels – and failing to stop stirring when most kernels have popped – will result in burning."

Add plants.,
Try framed photos.,
Set up a minibar on your table.,
Place candles in decorative holders.,
Place decorative knick-knacks on your buffet.",How to Style a Buffet2," Plants can be a great addition to a buffet table. If you're unsure how to decorate your buffet, try throwing in a few plants or flowers. This can make the room feel fresher as well, and may add a nice fragrance.If your buffet is near a window, it can be very easy to use a plant or flower to decorate. The plants will be close to a source of natural sunlight.
If the buffet or the room smells a little musty, a fragrant flower can freshen things up.
If you have pets, like cats, that may eat plants or flowers, you can also try plastic flowers or plants.

, Many people like to use their buffet to show off photos of friends, family members, and loved ones. If you're unsure how to decorate your buffet, stop by a local print shop and print out some of your favorite photographs. Then, buy some attractive frames to set on your buffet.You can place photos based on things like their height, shape, and type. For example, try keeping things symmetrical by placing frames and photos of similar height and shape on corresponding ends of the buffet. You could also think about grouping photos by type. One area could have family photos, the other could have friends photos, and so on.
If you have young children, be careful about breakable objects on your buffet. You may want to remove the glass from photo frames to prevent injury in case children knock them over.

, If your buffet is in a room where you frequently have guests, consider a minibar. Bottles of expensive liquor or wine can be assembled near nice glasses and tumblers. If you entertain frequently, refreshments can double as decoration for a striking, attractive buffet.Showcase your nicest bottles and glasses if you use your buffet as a bar. Even if you rarely use the crystal tumblers you got as a wedding gift, they may look nice displayed next to a few attractive bottles of wine.
You can also invest in a nice serving tray and placemat. Try placing the tray on the placemat and arranging nice bottles and glasses on the tray.
This can be a particularly great option if your buffet has storage below. You can keep spare bottles beneath the buffet and replace them as needed.

, You can purchase decorative candle holders at antique shops, craft fairs, and other places. Attractive candles and candle holders can really brighten up a buffet.Candles can be great if you're striving for symmetry, as you can use candles and holders of varying heights to mirror another object. A large plant, for example, can be mirrored with a tall, thin candle and holder.
Many people love seasonal candle holders. You can try swapping out candles and candle holders by season. You can, for example, have snowflake decorated candle holders for winter and replace them with pastel colored holders for the spring.

, If you have a lot of knick-knacks hanging around, your buffet can be a great place for some of them. Many people receive small decorative items for holidays and birthdays. If you have something like a fancy paperweight or tiny sculpture in storage, try placing on your buffet as decoration.Use discretion when selecting your knick-knacks. You certainly should not put every knick-knack you own on your buffet, as this can make it look crowded. Instead, opt to include your nicest knick-knacks that best match the scheme you're going for.
For example, say you're going for a pastel color scheme. You should not display a miniature sculpture painted in bright, primary colors. However, a decorative woodblock painted in a soft shade of purple can be a nice touch.

Hang up art on the wall behind the buffet.,
Hang a mirror behind the buffet.,
Use the space behind the buffet for photographs.",How to Style a Buffet3," If you have art work that does not have a place, hang it up behind your buffet. If you stocked your buffet with a lot of shorter objects, the wall behind it may need filling. Try hanging up some artwork just behind your buffet.Hang the artwork so it's a little above any items on the buffet. You don't want the artwork to be hidden. Strive to hang a painting at least a few inches above any items on the buffet.
Choose art work that matches the color scheme of your room and your buffet. If you're going for a bright primary color scheme, a pastel impressionist painting may not work. However, an abstract painting that uses pastels will match great with your buffet table.

, A mirror can be an attractive addition to the wall behind the buffet. It can also help if you want to double the buffet as a vanity area in your home. You can stand before the buffet to do your hair and makeup.As with hanging paintings, try to hang the mirror at least a few inches above any decorations on the buffet.
If you want to use the buffet as a vanity, the mirror may look best in the center of the buffet table. This way, things like makeup and hair brushes can be placed on either side of the mirror for your use.

, If you don't want to put photos directly on the buffet, you can hang them up on the wall behind it. This can work if you have children or animals that may knock breakable frames off of the buffet table.As you decide where to hang the photos on the wall, strive for balance just like you would with items on the buffet table. Imagine a line going down the wall in the middle of the buffet. Now imagine a mirror image pattern on either side of the line with photographs and pictures, selecting similar sizes and shapes for frames and photos on either side of the wall. The photos don't need to form a perfectly symmetrical pattern, though; balancing sizes and shapes is more important.
Make sure any photos you hang up are a few inches above any decorations on the buffet.

Start with plates and end with napkins and utensils.,
Place food in the right order.,
Separate the food and drinks, if possible.,
Provide the right utensils for serving.,
Space items out appropriately.",How to Style a Buffet4," When people begin filling their plates, they should only be holding their plates. This will keep them from dropping items or spilling things. Once their plates are filled, they can then grab things like forks, knives, and napkins. Start the buffet with a stack of plates and end it with napkins and utensils for the ease of your guests., Think about how your food will be eaten by setting up your buffet table. As guests move through the buffet, they should be able to arrange their food logically. If something is a topping, for example, it should come after the food it tops.For example, say you're doing a Thanksgiving buffet table. It makes sense to have things like gravy and cranberry sauce come after the turkey, stuffing, and mashed potatoes.

, Guests tend to linger by the drinks, especially if alcohol is being served. People may, for example, congregate around a bottle of wine and talk. This can cause issues with crowding if there's also food near the drinks. Try to keep the two separate.Ideally, you should have separate table for drinks and a separate table for food. This way, people can spend a few minutes filling their plates with food and then congregate around the drink table to socialize.
If you don't have a separate buffet table, keep things separate on the table you have. Have drinks on one end, near the napkins and utensils, while keeping food near the other end.

, Nothing can make a buffet more stressful than serving utensils that are difficult to maneuver. Make sure you provide serving utensils with ease of use in mind to keep things running smoothly as guests serve themselves.Choose sturdy serving utensils. A large metal spoon for serving potatoes works better than a flimsy plastic one, for example.
Tongs work great for items like meats and salads.
If you have an item that needs to be poured, like gravy, use a bowl with a tip that allows for pouring.

, Think about which items require the most time to serve. There should be slightly more space between these items and other items on the table. Items that are easy to grab quickly can be clustered without a lot of space in between.For example, guests may take awhile selecting meats from a large turkey. They also may need to slice turkey. Provide some space between a turkey and other items.
Smaller items that you just grab require less time to serve. Desserts, for example, can usually be easily picked up off the table. Different types of cookies can be close together, as guests are unlikely to take long setting a cookie on their plate.

Lay the tablecloth and placemat.,
Set down a charger plate and napkin.,
Arrange your plates on the charger plate.,
Set all other plates on the table.,
Arrange the silverware.,
Set the drinking glasses on the table.",How to Set a Dinner Table2," If you’re hosting a very formal dinner, spread a floor-length tablecloth over the entire table. Lay a placemat at each seat, keeping the edge of the placemat one inch from the edge of the table. Choose tablecloth and placemat colors that complement the plates and dining room.


When in doubt, use a white tablecloth and simple white place settings.

, A charger plate is a decorative plate for the other plates to rest on. Place the charger plate on the bottom center of the placemat. The napkin should be folded neatly and placed on the charger plate or rolled into a napkin ring and set to the left of the placemat.These plates are decorative and therefore optional. However, many people believe that a table looks empty between courses if a charger plate isn’t used.Never serve food directly on the charger plate.

, Always arrange the plates in order of use. For example, if you were serving a soup, salad, and entrée, you would first place the main entrée plate on the charger. Next, you lay down a salad plate, followed by a soup bowl.Each piece of plates will be cleared away after use.


If you’re serving more than three courses, have each plate brought out and then cleared away after the course to save space.
Wait to clear the charger plate until it’s time to clear the entrée plate.

, If you’re serving dinner rolls, set an appetizer plate over the forks and place a butter knife on top. If you’re serving coffee after dinner, you can either bring the cup and saucer out with dessert or set to the right of the spoons at the beginning of the meal. Similarly, the dessert plate can be brought out with dessert or placed above the plate on the tablecloth., The forks go to the left of the plate and the spoons and knives go to the right. Arrange the silverware outside-in, with the utensils you’ll use first on the outside and the ones you’ll use last next to the plate. The dessert fork should be at the top of the plate with the tines pointed to the right and the dessert spoon directly above it pointing left.


Each course should have at least one utensil. For example, a salad should have its own fork and a soup its own spoon.
The relevant utensils are cleared with each course.

, The water glass is placed closest to the plate. It should be followed from left to right by the wine glasses in order they’ll be used. For example, most people serve soups and salads with white wine and red wine with entrées. Therefore, you would place the water glass first, then the white wine glass, and lastly the red wine glass.Glasses used for a particular course should be removed at the end of the course with the relevant plates and silverware.
If you don’t have room on the table to line up the glasses, arrange them in a triangle.

Roll your napkin in a napkin ring.,
Fold the napkin flat.,
Create a napkin fan.",How to Set a Dinner Table3," Napkin rings can be found at home supply stores and boutique shops. You can also buy customized napkin rings online or make your own at home. Simply fold the napkin in half lengthwise, roll it up, and slide it through the napkin ring. The ring will keep the napkin rolled and beautiful.


While eating, place the napkin ring on the top-left side of your table setting.The rolled napkin can be set on the plate or to the left of the placemat.

, This technique is especially beautiful if your napkins complement your plates. Fold the napkin into thirds lengthwise to create a long flat napkin shape. Then, place the folded napkin on top of the charger and under the plates. The colors of the napkin will contrast pleasantly against the colors of the plates.


If the napkin is too long, fold the long flat shape in half to shorten it.

, Napkin fans add elegance and interest to any table setting. First, fold the napkin in half lengthwise. Next, fold the napkin into small sections like an accordion. Leave about three inches of unfolded napkin at the end. Fold everything in half with the unfolded section in the middle. Tuck the unfolded section into the back of the napkin and unfurl the fan.If you have trouble creating a napkin fan, watch instructional online videos. Some people learn the folding technique more quickly if they can watch it done.
Place the folded napkin on top of the table setting.

Bag your sorghum kernels.,
Place your bag in the microwave.,
Remove the sorghum from the microwave.",How to Pop Sorghum2," Place ¼ cup (32 grams) sorghum kernels in a small paper bag. Roll the open end of the bag up tightly and fold it so it stays closed. Do not use a plastic bag, as it will melt.If you wish to encourage popping, toss the kernels in a small bowl with a bit of melted butter or oil. Place the bag on a plate if you do this so you don’t end up with a greasy mess in your microwave.

, With your bag of sorghum closed, place the closed fold face-down in the microwave. Set the heat for two minutes. Check the sorghum after the timer expires. If a significant amount of sorghum remains unpopped, microwave it for another minute., As your sorghum pops, it will make an audible sound. When the sound of popping sorghum falls to a frequency of less than once every few seconds, take your sorghum out and pour it into a bowl.Your sorghum should not need more than three minutes to pop. If it does, consider increasing the strength setting on your microwave.

"
Choose the right popper.,
Let the hot air popper run for two minutes.,
Add your sorghum kernels.",How to Pop Sorghum3," Because sorghum is lighter than popcorn, hot air poppers will generally not work for popping sorghum. Some hot air poppers, however, are acceptable. If your hot air popper blows air up and out of the machine, do not attempt to pop sorghum with it. If your hot air popper blows hot air in a circular pattern within the machine, use it to pop sorghum.Check your hot air popper’s user manual to determine if popping sorghum is possible.
Alternately, you could cover your hot air popper with a mesh net of the sort used when steaming vegetables. This will prevent your sorghum kernels from escaping the hot air popper, even if it is of the variety that blows hot air up and out from the center., This will give the hot air popper time to warm up. If you add sorghum kernels to the hot air popper before it’s warm, the kernels will dry out and be unable to pop properly., Turn your hot air popper off and sorghum kernels in a volume that is appropriate for your hot air popper. Turn the hot air popper on and listen for the sorghum to start popping. When popping slows to once every five seconds or so, turn the machine off and dump the popped sorghum into a bowl.Different hot air poppers have different limits. Check your user manual for information regarding what an appropriate weight or volume of sorghum kernels might be in your device.
You may see a bit of smoke even when your sorghum is popping within the prescribed times. Monitor the sorghum and remove it from the hot air popper after popping slows.

Make a cheesy mix.,
Make a cinnamon-sugar treat.",How to Pop Sorghum4," Sea salt is a common topping for popped sorghum. Transfer popped sorghum to a large mixing bowl and add about one teaspoon sea salt per four cups (32 grams) of popped sorghum.Sea salt has the same basic nutritional profile as regular salt, but it is less heavily processed., Nutritional yeast is a yellow powder with a nutty flavor. It contains vitamin B12 and other B-complex vitamins. Don’t apply nutritional yeast too liberally, though, since unlike salt and most other sorghum toppings, it adds calories., You could sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over your popped sorghum to give it a bit of the cheesy, nutty taste that Parmesan possesses. Alternately, you could choose another grated cheese like cheddar., After your sorghum is popped, dump it in a bowl and drizzle with canola oil. Sprinkle one teaspoon white sugar and ¼ teaspoon cinnamon over the popped sorghum. Toss or stir with a spoon to coat evenly."

To dress like Asuna, wear long, light blue hair, fake elf ears and a white outfit. To resemble Mirajane Strauss, wear a long, whitish blonde wig with a side part, and blue contacts. For an Akame costume, wear a black wig that is long in the back and short in the front. Wear red contacts., Find anime songs online. Make some playlists that will last about as long as you think the party might run. Set up speakers or plan to stream the music from a Smart TV with an internet connection.


Play regular and/or anime music. If you're looking for music to play, try J-Pop, theme songs to animes, or Vocaloid music, such as songs from Hatsune Miku.

, You can play it with the sound low or off if you don’t want it to compete with the music. If you have a projector you can use with a DVD player or computer, you can project anime onto the wall. You may want to watch some classic anime shows like Yu Yu Hakusho, Pokémon or Dragon Ball Z.

, For a Japanese-American vibe, put party favors in takeout containers. Tie pieces of ribbon around them that match the color theme of your party. Tie chopsticks into the knot or bow in the ribbon at the top of each box.Items you can include in the boxes are anime keychains, candy, erasers, temporary tattoos, or whatever you like! There are many different kinds of anime merchandise available online.

, If you’re planning to have a large party, it might be easier to order food than make it. Find Japanese restaurants in local directories online or in the yellow pages.


Ideas for main dishes include teriyaki meat or salmon, and stir fry with chicken or beef, noodles, vegetables, and toasted sesame seed sauce.Some examples of appetizers or side dishes are sushi, fried rice, soup, clams steamed in butter and sake, and fried shrimp with dipping sauces., There are various Japanese-themed drinks you can serve at your party. If it’s a kid’s party, you’ll of course want to stick to non-alcoholic options. If it’s an adult party, you may want to include both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage choices.Some examples of non-alcoholic beverages you can serve are green tea, cherry blossom tea, soy milk, and Japanese sodas from a local Asian grocer.
Alcoholic options include sake, Japanese beer, and wine.

, Use cake decorating supplies to draw anime faces or characters on mocha, cookies, donuts or cake pops. Make or order a manga-themed cake. Design candy treats to look like sushi.


Cut Rice Krispie treats into circles. Attach chewy fruit snacks and Swedish fish to them with Laffy Taffy. Wrap a Fruit Roll-Up around each circle., Draw anime faces on balloons. Alternately, you can call local party supply stores to see if they have any relevant balloons. A third option is to purchase anime balloons online. You can have the balloons filled with helium, or blow them up yourself and place them around.Try asking, “Do you have any anime or manga balloons, like Pokémon, Dragon Ball or Naruto?” These are well-recognized series and will help give the party store employee a better idea of what you’re looking for.

, Go to a craft store or dollar store and purchase a dozen or so photo frames. If you have photo frames around the house, you can use those instead and put the original photos back in them after the party. Print out some great anime screenshots or images that will fit in the frames. Place them around the party area.

, Print out anime characters on regular paper. Cut rectangles out of card stock and fold them in half so they stand up like tents. Glue an anime character to each one, and below that write the name of one of the food dishes at your party. You can also write or print the Japanese translation to go on the place card. Put each placecard in front of the respective food dish it describes.


Instead of using the place cards to label the party food, you could put the English version of some cool quotes from animated series.

, Buy paper lanterns, in the color of your party theme, at a party supply store or online. You can also make paper lanterns using tissue paper and bendable metal wire.

, Make sure the invitations instruct attendees to dress in costumes. Give out anime-related prizes for winners in different categories. For example, most original costume, most elaborate costume and most authentic costume.

, Maybe you want to play anime video games or trivia. You could also do a twist on Pictionary by playing an anime-based version. Another idea is to play card games, such as Beyblade or Yu-Gi-Oh! card games.

, Plan crafts that fit in with either a kids’ party or an adult party, depending on which you’re having. If the crowd will be a mixture of ages, you can plan for both types of crafts.


Examples of kids’ crafts you can have are anime printouts to color with markers or crayons, decorating magnets, painting rocks with anime themes, and making fake sushi out of felt.
Adult crafts you can plan are origami, photo magnets with anime pictures, or making figures from polymer clay (provide the supplies). You can also draw anime faces or designs on mugs, or on clay vases for holding succulents or other plants.

Brew a cup of coffee.,
Mix in the eggnog.,
Sprinkle with ground cinnamon.",How to Use Leftover Eggnog1," Use your favorite type of coffee to make a 20 ounce (591 ml) cup. You can use a traditional coffee machine, a single-serve coffee machine, a French press, or even an instant type that you simply mix with hot water. It’s best to use unflavored coffee to allow the eggnog flavor stand out, though.If you want to use a flavored coffee, be sure that it’s a flavor that will complement the eggnog. French vanilla, gingerbread, or cinnamon are good options.;
, Once you’ve brewed your cup of coffee, pour approximately 3 ounces (89 ml) of eggnog in. Stir the mixture well to ensure that the eggnog is fully combined.You can add as much or as little of the eggnog as you’d like. You’re using it as you would milk or creamer so you use the amount of those mix-ins that you prefer as a guide.

, After you’ve mixed the eggnog into the coffee, add a pinch of ground cinnamon to the top of the cup as a garnish. The cinnamon will complement the flavor in the eggnog for an even more delicious cup of coffee.If you usually take sugar in your coffee, you can mix in some in too. However, keep in mind that the eggnog is sweetened so you may not need to add as much sugar as you normally would.

Add more eggnog to thin the icing.,
Frost your favorite baked good with the icing.",How to Use Leftover Eggnog2," Add 1 cup (125 g) of powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of eggnog, and ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) vanilla extract to a large bowl. Stir the ingredients together with a whisk until a thick paste forms.You can substitute almond extract for the vanilla if you prefer.

, You want the frosting to have a spreadable consistency, so if it’s too thick, mix in more eggnog. Add up to 4 more tablespoons (60 ml) to get the consistency that you prefer.It’s best to add the eggnog a tablespoon (15 ml) at a time and stir after each addition. That way, you won’t accidentally make the frosting too thin.
If you add an extra 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of the eggnog or more, the frosting will be thin enough to have a glaze-like consistency.

, When you’re happy with the consistency of the frosting, use a knife or offset spatula to spread it on the baked goods of your choice. It’s an ideal topping for scones, cookies, cupcakes, muffins, and cakes.Store any unused frosting in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep for up to a week. Let the frosting warm up to room temperature before using it, though.

, Add 1 ½ cups (355 ml) of eggnog, 5 large eggs, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of ground nutmeg, and ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of vanilla extract to a large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re fully combined.You can substitute rum extract for the vanilla if you prefer.

, After you’ve mixed the batter, transfer it to a shallow dish or bowl so you can easily coat the bread. A 11-inch by 7-inch (28-cm by 18-cm) baking dish works well., Take 12 slices of bread, and dip them two at a time into the batter. Make sure to flip the slices over so both sides are fully coated with the batter.Shake the bread off over the bowl to remove any excess batter.

, Once the bread is coated with the batter, place it on the griddle. Allow it to cook for approximately 3 to 5 minutes or until the bottom is a golden brown color.Make sure to keep an eye on the French toast as it’s cooking. It can burn easily.

, When the bottom of the bread is golden brown, use a spatula to flip it over.

Next, lightly grease two 9-inch (23-cm) loaf pans with butter and dust with flour to prevent the cakes from sticking.You can use nonstick cooking spray to grease the pans if you prefer.
To flour the pan, sprinkle a couple of pinches of flour into the bottom of the pan. Shake and tap the pan to distribute the flour evenly across the entire interior surface of the pan. If all of the sides aren’t covered, add a little more flour and repeat the process. Dump out any excess flour before pouring the batter in.
You can use one bundt pan in place of the two loaf pans if you prefer.

, Add 3 cups (375 g) of all purpose flour, 2 teaspoons (10 g) of baking powder, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of salt, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of nutmeg to a large bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon to thoroughly combine the ingredients, and set the bowl aside for the moment., Add 1 cup (225 g) of softened butter and 2 cups (450 g) of sugar to a large bowl. Use an electric hand mixer to blend the two together on low. Raise the speed to medium, and cream the mixture until it is light and creamy.You can use a stand mixer to make the batter if you prefer.

, Once the butter and sugar are combined, add 4 eggs one at a time to the batter with the mixer on low. Next, stir in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla and mix until the ingredients are fully combined.You can substitute almond or rum extract for the vanilla if you prefer.

, When the eggs and vanilla are fully incorporated, alternate adding flour mixture and eggnog. Start with a small amount of the flour mixture and follow with a small amount of the eggnog until you’ve added all of both and the batter is smooth.Keep the hand mixer on low or medium low so you don’t make a mess as you’re mixing.
Make sure to mix the batter after each addition before adding more of the ingredients.

, Once the batter is fully mixed, carefully transfer it to the prepared pans. Use a spatula to smooth the batter into each pan in an even layer., Place the filled pans in the preheated oven. Allow them to bake for 50 to 55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.If you don’t have any toothpicks, you can use a fork to test the cakes for doneness.

, When the cakes are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Allow them to rest in the pans for 20 minutes, and then carefully turn them out onto a wire rack to cool completely, which should take another 20 to 30 minutes.If you like, you can add a glaze or icing to the cooled cake. The eggnog frosting recipe from above would work well with the pound cake.

Make your meats ahead of time.,
Bake quick breads ahead of time.,
Skip individual items.,
Try a quick-cooking dish.",How to Plan a Christmas Brunch Menu1," One way to cut down on stress when you're crunched for time is to use dishes you can make ahead, either in part or the whole dish. For instance, mix up a breakfast casserole the night before, and all you need to do is stick it in the oven that morning., Keeping with the theme, try to think of other dishes you could make ahead. For instance, if you want to do a ham, heat it up the day before, and then just reheat it the day off. You could also do something like a quiche the day before.

, You can also cook up bacon and sausage ahead of time. Once they're drained, stack them on layers of parchment paper in the refrigerator.If you don't want to do them ahead of time, try baking them in the oven instead of frying pieces individually., One way to save time at a Christmas brunch is to make your quick breads the night before. Let them cool, then wrap them tightly for the next morning. You can even make these breads up to a month ahead of time. Just wrap them well, and stick them in the freezer. They'll defrost in no time on the counter.Biscuits and scones can also be made ahead. However, it's best to shape them and freeze them on a tray unbaked., That is, making foods like omelettes or waffles will leave you standing in the kitchen all morning. Instead, try items that feed everyone with one dish, such as a breakfast casserole, frittata, or even baked eggs served alongside a homemade quick bread., If you don't want to make your meal ahead of time, stick to things that cook more quickly. That way, you won't have to get up extra early to start the dish. Frittatas come together relatively quickly, for instance, and if you pair it with a breakfast meat and quick bread, you'll have an ample breakfast."

Don't forget different tastes.,
Remember the drinks.,
Plan ahead for a more extravagant meal.",How to Plan a Christmas Brunch Menu2," Generally, you'll want something hearty as a main, such as a quiche, bacon and baked eggs, or some other breakfast protein. A fresh-baked side, such as biscuits (that you made and froze unbaked), scones, or quick breads, make a nice addition. It also can be nice to have something fresh, such as a fruit salad or a light green salad, if you're going on the lunch end of things., If you bake a casserole such as a sausage, egg, and potato casserole for the main, you can keep the sides relatively simple, such as some fresh-cut melon or a small bunch of grapes for each person., If you want an egg dish to take center stage, such as baked eggs in spinach, you can round it off with ham, bacon, or sausage. Similarly, if you have a sweet main dish like baked French toast, all you may need is a side of meat to finish the meal off., Make sure to have something everyone on your guest list can eat.

You’ll probably have the most success mixing with your hands.Be sure to wash and dry your hands well before and after you combine the ingredients. Remember that the refrigerated meat can still harbor some bacteria even if it’s already cooked.

, You can use a large scoop to help you portion out evenly sized balls. Use your hands to flatten them into 1/2 inch, or just over a centimeter, thick patties. Arrange the patties on the broiling pan or sheet, keeping about an inch between each patty.If you use a scoop to make the same sized portions and flatten them to a uniform thickness, they’ll heat more evenly.

, They should be about 4 or 5 inches (10 or 13 cm) away from the broiler. If the ground turkey or ham is already cooked, they’ll only need a few minutes to heat and brown. Try to keep an eye on them through the oven window.Alternatively, you can use raw ground meat instead of leftovers. If you use raw meat, broil for about 10 minutes.

, If you’re not a fan of broiling or don’t have a reliable broiling option, you can use a nonstick pan on the stovetop. Heat the pan over medium heat, and spray it down with cooking spray or use a couple tablespoons of olive oil. Add as many sausage patties that you can fit into the skillet without them touching.Saute for about 3 minutes per side if you’re using leftovers. Increase the time to about 5 minutes per side if you’re using raw meat.

, Take the patties out of the oven or use a spatula to remove them from the pan, depending on your method of choice. Place them on a platter, and garnish with some sage leaves if desired. Serve with fresh toast and eggs to order as your guests prefer, like scrambled, sunny side up, or over easy."

Let it get nice and hot so it melts and covers the pan’s entire surface., If you’re not using leftover meat, you can use a few pieces of chopped bacon. If you go with bacon, add that to your melted butter or fat first. If you’re using leftover Christmas dinner meat, add the onion and garlic first, and cook them for a couple minutes until they turn golden.When the aromatics, or the onion and garlic, are translucent and golden, add the leftover meat.
If you’re going with bacon, let it brown a bit then add the onion and garlic.

, Next, add your leftover veggies, like Brussels sprouts or cabbage. Let the mixture cook and color for a bit. Give it 5 or 6 minutes to sizzle, stirring only every minute or two so it will brown.If you’re using leftover pasta, add it in at this point.

, Add the potatoes or eggs to the pan once the mixture has gotten some color.  If you’re using eggs, crack them into a separate medium bowl and give them a whisk until the yolks and whites are well combined. Add a splash of milk if desired.  

Stir the ingredients in the pan well so they’re thoroughly incorporated.

, Let the mixture saute so it “bubbles and squeaks.” After a few minutes, the potatoes will brown or the eggs will start to set, depending on which you’ve used. At this point, lower the heat to low-medium and stir in the shredded cheese.


Let the cheese melt but take the pan off heat once it’s melted and golden. Try not to let the cheese brown or burn.

, Remove from heat and garnish with chopped parsley or cilantro. If you find that you could use a bit more texture, you can also garnish with toasted breadcrumbs or even crumbled fried sage leaves. Scoop, serve, and enjoy your improvised leftover bubble and squeak!

Taking a headcount will allow you to stock up on supplies to that you can prepare enough food for everyone. It will also give you a chance to arrange for seating and make sure you have ample space for your guests to mingle before and after the meal.Follow up with the people on your invite list to confirm whether they’ll be able to attend.
Only invite as many guests as you have room and provisions for.;
, Give some thought to what you'd like to serve and how much time and preparation it will require. Your menu could consist of contemporary recipes using inventive combinations of different ingredients, or traditional favorites that you've enjoyed since childhood. Try to structure a diverse menu with the enjoyment of yourself and your guests in mind.When making food for a crowd of people, it's generally best to work with dishes and ingredients that you know well in order to avoid unexpected complications.
Adjust the measurements of your recipes to reflect the number of people you’ll be serving.

, Once you have an accurate count of how many you’ll be cooking for, put together a master list of the ingredients you’ll need for dinner. This should include the individual components of the food, as well as other considerations like alcohol, formal dining accessories and decorations. Bring your list to the store with you to make sure you don’t forget anything.To keep things organized, draft your shopping list by what you need for each recipe.
Incorporate delectable ingredients that are fresh and in season., Due to food allergies, dietary restrictions and personal taste, you may have some diners who won’t be able to partake of everything you prepare. Take into account guests who are vegetarian or vegan, gluten free or just plain picky. Try to assemble a comprehensive menu that incorporates a range of dishes, flavors and cooking methods so that everyone will have something to enjoy.You’re not always going to please everybody. Make the kind of dinner you want to make, rather than trying to accommodate a dozen different preferences.
Encourage guests with special dietary needs to also bring some of their own favorite dishes.

, Set the mood for your holiday dinner by livening up your home and dining area. Make a playlist of your favorite Christmas music, dim the lights and put out festive decorations like garlands and mistletoe. When you set the table, make use of an ornate runner, or embellish with poinsettia arrangements and linens in scarlet, green, white or gold. A good dinner party is just as much about the ambiance as it is the meal, so transform your setting to embody the spirit of the season.Use candles and Christmas lights to illuminate the room rather than relying on ordinary light sources.Garnish your finished dishes with holiday-themed accents like holly and candy canes.

, Think of a few simple finger foods you can put out as you get the main course ready. You don’t have to get too complicated—Swedish meatballs and cheese balls with crackers are popular holiday appetizers, or you could splurge on a nice baked brie and some fresh fruit. Tell your hungry guests to help themselves until dinner is served.Light appetizers will make it easier for your guests to wait on a complex meal that’s awaiting its finishing touches.
If you want to keep things simple, lay out a charcuterie platter with a selection of cured meats, cheeses, olives and bread., There is perhaps no Christmas entree more decadent than leg of lamb. When cooked perfectly, it is succulent and tender, making it ideal for filling empty bellies on a chilly winter evening. Season the lamb with rosemary, garlic or thyme and roast in the oven until the meat is browned and sizzling.Create a bed of potatoes, carrots and onions at the bottom of your baking dish and roast them alongside the lamb. They’ll soak up the juices from the meat, making them crisp and flavorful.

, People have long served beef on Christmas Eve. Since it’s a more substantial meat, a medium-sized roast, tenderloin or prime rib can be enough to satisfy many hungry guests. Whatever cut you choose, cook the beef to the right temperature, and use a light hand when flavoring it. Let the meat speak for itself.Prime rib is best enjoyed on the rare side, while roasts should be a little more done, and other cuts can be cooked to individual preference.Pair your beef dish with a red wine sauce, horseradish cream or brown gravy.

, Ham is one reason why people get so excited for the holiday season. Slather the outside with brown sugar, honey or molasses, then bake it, slice it and serve it piping hot. One large ham can easily feed a crowd of a dozen or more, and pairs well with many different types of side dishes.Hams can take hours to cook all the way through, so plan ahead to allot yourself enough time.

, For a more classically-inspired Christmas recipe, cook up a few Cornish hens. These petite fowl can be prepared just like chicken, taking the guesswork out of serving them for the first time. Rub them with butter and dry seasonings, or try filling them with cornbread stuffing before you put them in the oven.For even more flavor, inject a marinade or herb butter under the skin.Because of their small size, you can serve each guest their own hen at smaller gatherings.

, Keep in mind that not all of your guests may eat meat or animal products. For these people, have one or two meat-free, non-dairy alternatives ready, such as baked ratatouille or a made-from-scratch tart loaded with savory vegetables. You can also buy some tofu and cook it the same way you do your main dish.Tofu is very simple to work with. It can be baked, grilled, fried or sauteed, and will absorb the flavors of the ingredients it’s prepared with., As a heavier side, you can’t go wrong with potatoes. These can be prepared in so many ways: baked, mashed, au gratin or simply chopped, drizzled with oil and sage and thrown under the broiler. In fact, potatoes are so versatile that you can get away with serving them in a couple different dishes, if you wish.If you’re serving more than one potato dish, make sure they’re sufficiently different in terms of flavor, texture or presentation. Too much one one type of food can seem repetitive.
Boil or pressure cook potatoes to get them done faster., Green beans are another vegetable that you can do a lot with. Crunchy and mild, these can benefit from the addition of onion, roasted peppers or pungent spices like black pepper, but they’re also tasty enough to stand on their own. Green beans are universally loved and pair well with a variety of meats and other sides.Simmer your green beans in a pot with fatback for a more Southern take, or go with a rustic French haricot vert with cloves of garlic and slivers of sliced almond.Green beans can be served whole or broken into smaller pieces to go in sautés and casseroles.

, Heat up a medley of fresh seasonal vegetables. Brussel sprouts and carrots are particularly revered around Christmas, but you might also use asparagus, turnips or squash, depending on your entree. Prepare each vegetable individually, or choose complementary flavors and dice them up, cook them and serve them together in the same dish.Look for different types of root vegetables in vibrant colors to add some visual appeal to the dish.

, Put the finishing touches on your feast with a basket hot, fluffy yeast rolls or a loaf of crusty French bread. You could even take it one step further and turn the bread into its own dish, such as miniature Yorkshire puddings. Your guests will agree that no meal is complete without bread.Serve with butter or a dish of olive oil and cracked black pepper.
If you’re baking your own bread, be sure to set a timer so that it comes out with the rest of your meal.

, When it comes time for a little something sweet, it’s important that the confections you have in store be the perfect conclusion to an already delicious dinner. Obviously you have a lot of freedom in selecting the desserts you serve, but some faithful choices include red velvet cake, a cream-filled “yule log” or a chilled chocolate cream pie. Give your guests a few different options to choose from never hurts, either.Take care of your baked goods the morning of so you can have them ready without adding to your preparation time.Pumpkin, pecan and cranberry pie are often enjoyed at Christmas time as well as Thanksgiving.

, Christmas pudding is made by combining sweet dried fruits, flour, molasses and zesty spices like cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg, then cooking it all down together. This dessert originated in Britain, but has since become a popular treat enjoyed the world. Since pudding is so dense and filling, it will be more than enough for those who only want a little nibble.In England, Ireland and other countries, homemade pudding is the traditional way to end Christmas dinner.

, Trifle is an essential part of Christmas cooking to many families. Stack airy sponge cake between layers of rich custard and fruit-flavored jelly. With so many scrumptious components, every bite of this dessert is like a little surprise. Its light consistency makes it manageable after a big meal.The layers of a trifle can come in many different colors and flavors.
Trifles take a lot of effort to put together. Don’t hesitate to buy one premade if you’re running short on time.

, Ask your diners if they would like a special beverage as a palate cleanser. Now is the time to uncork a bottle of red wine, champagne or brandy. Break out the eggnog for a splash of sweetness, or brew strong, hot espresso to provide a pick-me-up and help stomachs settle.Make hot cocoa, coffee, tea or cider available as well.Raise your glass and propose a celebratory toast to your guests to thank them for coming.

If necessary, abstain from those foods that are causing you to stray from healthy eating.,
There are also very many naturally made chips and other various foods that are delicious.,
There are plenty of healthy snacks.,
Don't give up.,
Pack little containers full of 100-200 calories worth of fruits.,
Snack on things that have a low calorie content, for example, pears.

, Eating these foods in portions about the size and thickness of your palm will assure that your hunger and appetite are being met.

, Add more fruits and veggies. Break out of your comfort zone and try fresh fruit you don't usually buy. Add seasoning like lemon pepper, ginger or garlic to steamed vegetables. Dress up eggs with fresh salsa and lots of it.

, This becomes easier once you have established the foods that are actually beneficial to your health. As you consume these foods, your taste will change and suddenly that vinegar on your romaine salad will be yummy.

, Try it for one day. If you feel better and find it easier to abstain rather than have small portions of junk food, then add another day. If you still feel better, keep going.

, The key is to regard a snack as another meal and not some separate activity., Try mixing different berries and fruits together. Learn healthy substitutes for unhealthy ingredients, for example, apple juice (or apples) make great substitute for sugar. Learn the healthier ingredients and make your own snack. There are many healthy snack recipes out there.

, If you feel like you can't survive with chocolate or potato chips, try eating fruits whenever you are hungry - don't overeat -if you survive a few days without unhealthy snacks, you won't feel the need to have it anymore.

Decide when the snack bar will be eaten.,
Choose your grains.,
Choose your binder.,
Choose your sweetener.,
Choose your inclusions.,
Choose your spices.",How to Make a Healthy Snack Bar1," The snack bar may contain different components depending on when it is going to be consumed. The ingredients of a bar made for breakfast would typically differ from a bar made for post workout consumption. That doesn’t mean you can’t eat your snack bar anytime of the day; it just helps you supplement your diet with what is nutritionally required when you only have time for a meal replacement.


For a breakfast bar, you should aim to include protein, carbohydrates, fruit or veggies and some good fat into it. The bar should be large enough that when eaten with a glass of milk, you feel satiated. One and a half to 2.5 oz. (42 to 70 g) is a good starting point for the size of the bar.
For a post workout bar, you should aim to have protein and carbohydrates. The bar should contain 12 to 18 g of protein and 50 to 75 g of carbohydrate per serving.
For a general snack bar, you should aim for a bar that will satiate you until the next meal without filling you with empty calories. A breakfast bar or a post workout bar will work just fine as a snack. Whole grains and protein will help satiate you and won’t leave you feeling sluggish. It is important to keep the amount of fat down and the sugars to a minimum to avoid getting sleepy or crashing.;
, The snack bar can be made into a soft, chewy bar that is more dense (consistency of a brownie), it can be very grainy and hard (consistency of granola cereal bar), or it can be grainy and chewy (chewy cereal bar).


For a soft, chewy bar you should use whole grain flours. Some good flours to choose from are whole wheat, whole white wheat, multi-grain, oat flour, and rye flour. These work well with savory as well as sweet bars and will add in extra fiber and vitamins. The whole grain flours also help manage blood glucose levels because the whole grains are less starchy and digest slower, keeping glucose levels in the blood steady. Since whole grain flours absorb more water (not just immediately, but also after they have been baked), it’s important to add more water to your recipe than you would use when cooking with refined white flour. These flours also contain more oils and will develop a rancid “cardboard” flavor sooner than refined flours. To help avoid this ‘off’ flavor, use fresh flour (check dates on the flour before purchasing), and keep it in an airtight container after opening. It may be helpful to buy small bags of flour to keep it from sitting in the cabinet too long. You can also add oats, cooked quinoa, cooked rice, wheat bran and other grains to the mixture to vary the texture and add more nutrition.
For grainy bars, you should also use whole grains. However instead of flours, use the actual grains themselves. Ingredients like quinoa and rice will need to be cooked before use, while oats, flax and hemp can be used toasted or plain (quick cook oats work best when using oats). If you are making the bar crunchy, then dry out the quinoa in an oven before using. If you are using rice, then buy puffed rice cereal for a crispy cereal bar because it is cheap and easier than puffing rice at home. Seeds and nuts are also a great option to improve nutrition and taste, and they work in both savory and sweet bar recipes. Some seeds and nuts to try are almonds, sunflower seeds, walnuts and pumpkin seeds, which will add protein and good fat to the bar.

, The binder is an ingredient that acts like a glue to hold everything together.


Soft chewy bars do not need a binder because they are dense and the flour holds everything together.
For grainy bars, you will need a binder to hold all the ingredients together. Try ingredients like beans, soy flour, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, honey, milk chocolate, agave nectar, peanut butter, or almond butter.
Try to use ingredients that serve more than one purpose; for instance, peanut butter is source of fat and protein and will hold your bar together.
When using beans, cook, drain and mash them up before use and mix with something sticky, like honey or almond butter.
All these ingredients are nutrient dense because they serve a function in the bar and have macro and micronutrients in them.

,


Not all bars need a sweetener in them but if you do decide to add one, keep in mind that it can also act as a binder.
It is best to use liquid sweeteners to make the bars, but this is not a requirement. Granulated sugar or brown sugar can be used, but it will need to be melted first and will work best if mixed with butter to keep it from solidifying too quickly. The butter will also help it mix evenly with the other ingredients in your bar.
You can use an artificial sweetener in your recipe as long as it is very soluble in water; Sucralose works well in this low-moisture application because it dissolves easily in water.

, Inclusions are ingredients added for taste and health purposes. Inclusions work best when used in pieces. All the pieces should be roughly the same size for even distribution.


Soy nuts are great for adding protein and crunch. Soy is one of the few plant-based proteins that is a complete protein; it contains all the essential amino acids the human body needs. Having said that, any nut is a good source of protein, even if it is not a complete protein, because nuts contain many amino acids the body uses for refueling and muscle repair.
Adding an inclusion for protein may not be necessary because most of the whole grains or binders used will contain a fair amount of protein already. For instance, quinoa, flax and hemp are complete proteins. Also, combinations of ingredients will achieve greater protein content. Conversely, beans and rice are not complete proteins on their own, but together they create a complete protein.
Other inclusions that work well are Edamame, chocolate nibs, dried fruit pieces, raisins, nuts and seeds, low-moisture vegetables, and yogurt bits. These all serve a health purpose and add good flavor.
Cranberries are good for both men and women because they help prevent the adherence of bacteria throughout the urinary tract.
Dark chocolate is a mood enhancer and full of antioxidants, which adds additional value to your bars.
When making your bars, don’t put too many inclusions into them or the bars will not hold together properly.

,


Cinnamon is a classic flavor and it has the highest antioxidant content of all the spices. This makes it good for you and good for the shelf life of your bars. When using cinnamon in a soft chewy bar, use it sparingly because it will affect how well the bar stays together.
Other spices to try are soy powder or sauce, Worcestershire powder or sauce, cardamom, nutmeg, or clove.
Remember that a little spice will go a long way, so be careful when adding spices.
Spices are optional and can be omitted from your chosen recipe.

Mix the ingredients.,
Bake the bars.",How to Make a Healthy Snack Bar2,"


Some items may need steaming, such as rice or carrots.
Some items may need to be dried or toasted, such as quinoa or oats.
Sugar and butter may need to be melted.

, The ingredients should be mixed evenly.


When making a soft, chewy bar you will be adding items to a thick batter. As such, you will need to make sure the particles are suspended evenly so that they do not fall to the bottom of your bars.
If the inclusions you have chosen are too heavy, try smaller pieces. Alternatively, try drying them out. For example, walnuts may need to be chopped into small pieces as well as slightly dried to ensure they stay suspended in your mixture.

, Most bars need to be baked to keep everything together and to ensure that all the raw starches are properly cooked.


The mixture should be spread into a baking pan at the desired thickness.
Setting your oven to a temperature of 350 °F (177 °C) should be sufficient.
Bake times will vary depending on the type of bar you are preparing.
For thick batters, use a toothpick to check the bars are cooked adequately. Stick the toothpick in the middle; when the toothpick is removed and contains no raw batter, the bars are done. For other bars, bake until desired level of crunchy or chewy.
Some bars can be made quickly and don’t require baking, but do need refrigeration; these are the bars that have no raw flour in them. An example would be a peanut butter and granola bar.

Cut the bars once cooled completely.,
Determine the best way to store the bars.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Healthy Snack Bar3,"


If you cut into the bars before they are fully cooled, they will stick to each other.

, If you intend to eat them within two days, the bars can be covered and left to sit out at room temperature because of their low moisture content. The more sugar a bar contains, the safer it is to store it at room temperature because the sugar absorbs moisture and creates an environment that is hard for bacteria to thrive in. If they are going to be consumed over a longer period of time, you will need other options.


Vacuum seal individual bars to keep them at room temperature. The oxygen free environment reduces the chances that bacteria can grow. These can be kept in a cabinet for up to 5 days.
Refrigerate the bars. This is the safest and best way to store them. In the fridge, the bars can last 7 to 10 days. Be wary of other foods in the fridge because the bars may have a tendency to pick up volatile flavors, like onion, which can ruin their taste.
Freeze the bars. Bars can be frozen for an indefinite period of time without worry of microbiological contamination. However, the quality of the bars will degrade. It is best to freeze homemade snack bars for up to one month for optimum quality. Freezing will slowly dehydrate the bars, and, since they have so little moisture to begin with, too long in the freezer will cause them to crumble. Also, the moisture that comes out of the food can cause ice crystals on the surface of the food, which acts like a knife to the food breaking the texture.

Melt the butter with the rest of the sugar.,
Add a pinch of salt.,
Pour the glaze over the popcorn.",How to Make Sweet Popcorn1," Heat 3 tbsp (45 mL) vegetable oil and three popcorn kernels in a large, heavy-bottomed pan with a lid. When all three kernels have popped, the pan is hot enough to add the rest.


Canola oil or another vegetable oil with a medium or high smoking point works best.
If you're using microwave popcorn, just microwave the bag and skip down to melting the butter and sugar. You'll miss out on some flavor, but it will work out.;
, Remove the pan from heat and add ½ cup (120mL) popcorn kernels. Wait 30 seconds, then return to medium-high heat. This delay lets the kernels reach an even temperature so they pop closer to the same time., About every ten seconds, lift the pan and shake from side to side for three seconds.Occasionally crack the lid so air and moisture can escape.

, Once the first kernels start to pop, add granulated white sugar and shake well to mix. Wait until the popping starts again, then heat until the popping slows to once every one or two seconds. Pour the popcorn into a bowl and set aside. Don't just take the pan off the heat, as the hot pan can still burn the sugar.


The sugar can get very hot. Let it cool before you snack.

If you smell burning, pour out the popcorn right away. There's a fine line between browned sugar and charcoal.

, Stir together ⅓ cup (75g) butter and ⅛ cup (2 tbsp / 25g) granulated sugar. Heat and stir in the pan until fully melted, or simmer for a couple minutes for a caramel sauce.You can also melt this in the microwave in about one minute.For a thicker, caramel-y sauce, use ¼ cup (50g) golden syrup instead of sugar. You can put this on normal popcorn instead of sugared popcorn, unless you really have a sweet tooth.

, Sprinkle on about ½ tsp (2.5 mL) of salt, or to taste. Not only does this add a flavor of its own, it can make the popcorn taste sweeter by masking the bitter flavor from burned kernels or scorched syrup., Stir the butter and sugar mixture until smooth, then pour it onto your popcorn bowl. Wait at least five minutes before eating so the glaze cools down and the popcorn crisps.


If you want the glaze to harden, chill it in the refrigerator for 15–20 minutes."

Bake at minimum temperature (~250ºF/120ºC) with the oven door slightly open.
Remove when apple slices are wrinkled and mostly dry, about 2 hours.
Let cool to room temperature. The slices should become mostly crisp.

, You can pop the kernels on the stovetop (see above) or use a microwave bag. Use non-flavored popcorn, since butter will go on later.

, Melt ¼ cup (55g) butter and 2 tbsp (25g) brown sugar over medium heat, stirring frequently. You can stop as soon as both ingredients are melted, or keep cooking another couple minutes for a thicker caramel sauce.


You may use white sugar instead. The brown sugar adds a stronger caramel flavor and works with the apple pie spices.

, Pour the butter-sugar mixture into the bowl. Add 1 tsp (5 mL) cinnamon, ¼ tsp (1 mL) nutmeg, and ¼ tsp (1 mL) vanilla extract. Stir together well, pour over the popcorn. Give the butter a few minutes to cool down before eating.

Make sure you leave room for the popcorn-- it will expand as it cooks.

, Popcorn kernels have a small amount of moisture in them that literally explodes when it gets hot enough, creating popcorn. However, if the popcorn is heated slowly then the moisture simply escapes through the kernel, making it impossible to pop. If you've cooked the kernels for 3-4 minutes and they still don't pop, stop and throw them away., For the most part, this setting is guessing how to cook the popcorn. You should always listen in to the popcorn as it cooks -- if there are long pauses between ""pops"" or the smell of smoke, stop the microwave immediately.

, Line a baking tray with parchment paper or a silicone baking sheet.


If the baking dish is non-stick, you could rely on that, but note that the Kool-Aid will probably make the surface sticky and harder to stir/remove the popcorn pieces, as well as clean the dish.

, Using a wooden spoon, spread the popcorn on the baking dish. Try to avoid heaping the popcorn, instead aiming for a neat and flat single layer. If you find the dish isn't large enough, use two dishes.

,, In a small pot, place the sugar, syrup and butter into a saucepan. Heat to boiling and boil for three minutes until the liquid bubbles. Remove the pot from the stovetop and set aside for about 10 minutes. This forms the sugar syrup.


Keep an eye on this while the syrup boils and stir if needed. Do not let it boil for too long, as it can easily burn.

, Add the two packages of Kool-Aid in a medium mixing bowl. Pour the baking soda and mix thoroughly using a spoon.

, Slowly pour the sugar syrup into the Kool-Aid mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine completely.

, Put the burner on medium-high heat and cover while it warms. Once one of these three kernels pops you'll be ready to make your popcorn.

, As you do, keep an ear out for your test kernels to pop -- this is your indication to start cooking.

, This is your clue that the oil is the perfect temperature. Note that you only need to wait for the first kernel to pop -- don't worry so much about the other two.

, The hot oil is only half of the cooking equation -- you also need the steam to help pop your corn. Mix everything up so the sugar and oil are well-distributed around the kernels and then replace the lid., Early on this should only be occasional -- every 15-20 seconds or so. Use a potholder to hold the lid down snugly without burning your hands., As the pops become more vigorous, start shaking the pan more and more frequently, occasionally placing it back on the heat for a few seconds to stay hot.

, If the interval between pops has dropped to the point where there's only one pop every few seconds, cut the heat. Your popcorn is done.


While you'll always have unpopped kernels, waiting too long in an attempt to pop them all will lead to burnt kettle corn.
This whole process, in general, should only take 2-3 minutes., The hot pot's residual heat will cook and burn the popcorn if left in for too long. Sprinkle it out on the baking sheet and spread so that you only have one layer, helping the popcorn cool evenly.

For the classic, ""exploded"" kernel, with it's thin, rough edges, you can use ""movie popcorn."" For softer, hull-less popcorn, use the ""tender"" variety. For the big, ballooning kernels popular at state fairs, you should look for ""mushroom popcorn,"" which retains a rounder shape.Unless you live near a specialty store, you may have to order these versions online.

, This variation is a delicious, spicy-sweet take on kettle corn for those who don't just want something sweet. As soon as the popcorn is finished, sprinkle the chipotle powder and squeeze half a lime over the popcorn, stirring quickly. Spread and cool like normal.For an even spicier popcorn, add 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper as well.

, The most common choices are coffee syrups, the same ones used for flavored lattes. Make a note of the ingredient list on the syrup -- if they contain a lot of sugar, consider cutting the sugar to 1/4 cups. Simply add the syrup when the popcorn goes in and cook like normal., To make this delicious variation, put 2/3 cups (160ml) brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and 3 tablespoons butter in a bowl and microwave for 30 seconds, until hot. Cook the popcorn like normal and, right before pouring it out to cool, pour the hot butter mixture over the popcorn and stir quickly. Cool like normal.


Note -- the butter mixture should still be hot when poured, so don't be afraid to reheat it for 10-15 seconds if needed., Cook 4 slices of bacon in a pan, keeping all of the excess grease, and let it cool. Cut the bacon into small pieces and toss with 1 tablespoon maple syrup, setting aside. Use the excess bacon grease in place of the normal 3 tablespoons oil, supplementing more vegetable oil if you don't quite have enough, and use it to cook the kettle corn like normal. Once the popcorn is done, stir in the maple bacon and cool as you normally would.

You can use microwave popcorn for this recipe, or you can use an air popper and kernels. You’ll be adding your own butter to the popcorn, so don’t worry about buying any that’s already buttered– unless you really, really like butter!;
, Depending on your method, cooking times will vary. Check the microwave popcorn bag or the container of kernels to get specific instructions. Different brands have different cooking times, depending on amount and voltage of the microwave.


For microwavable popcorn, place the bag in the microwave and don't move.The sounds and smells of the popcorn will let you know when it’s finished. Once there is about a two second pause between popping noises, your popcorn is finished. Obviously, if you smell the scent of burning, remove sooner.
To use an air popper, first plug it into an outlet. Make sure that the plastic chute, which will guide the popcorn into your bowl, is unattached. Let the popper heat up for about a minute, and then pour your kernels into the chamber. Your container of kernels will say how to measure your kernels to get a certain amount of popcorn. Put the chute back onto the air popper, and place a large bowl under the chute. Stand back, and watch your bowl fill up!, If you used an air popper, the popcorn will already be in a bowl, so just unplug the popper and let it cool. If you chose to make microwave popcorn, you will need to transfer your popcorn from the bag to a large bowl.


The bag will be hot, so be careful. Grab the bag cautiously from the ends to pull it out of the microwave. The bag will indicate which end is the opening. Be aware that hot steam will be released when you open the bag, so don’t open it too close to your face.Dump out all of your popcorn from the open side. You’ll want to use a fairly large mixing bowl so that you can easily stir the ingredients into your popcorn without pieces falling all over your counter. Don’t worry about any unpopped kernels that fall into the bowl, because they’ll just move to the bottom.

, You can melt it in a pan on the stovetop or in a bowl in the microwave– whatever you prefer. The amount of butter that you'll need to melt depends on the amount of popcorn you have, but most microwave bags yield about ten cups of popcorn.About three tablespoons of butter should coat all of the popcorn, but the amount of butter you choose to add is really a matter of personal taste.There are typically tablespoon lines on your butter wrapper, but if not, three tablespoons is a little less than half a stick.If you love your popcorn drenched in butter (and no shame if you do!), just melt more.

, There are different ways to go about this. If you melted the butter over the stovetop, keep it on low heat and mix in your garlic powder. If you melted your butter in the microwave, add your garlic powder and put it back in the microwave for about ten seconds.


Again, the amount of garlic you add depends on your personal taste. For a delicious hint of garlic, add one teaspoon of powder. For some eye opening, super garlicky popcorn, add a a tablespoon.
It's always better to add a little bit of garlic at a time, so that you don't over-do it. Take a small taste test until it tastes exactly how you like.

, Add a pinch of these seasonings to taste. If you love your buttery, salty movie theater popcorn, this is an important step. It's much easier to add your seasonings to the butter, rather than sprinkling directly on your popcorn., If you want to add even more pizzazz to your popcorn, you can add other seasonings to your popcorn. You can add things like onion powder, rosemary, dill, or even chili powder.Every time you make this recipe, you can try a new addition. However, it’s certainly good with just butter and garlic!

, To make this a bit easier, use one hand to pour the butter while the other hand stirs the popcorn in order to coat all of it. After all of your butter is dispensed, continue gently stirring the popcorn so that every piece is coated. Don’t stir too vigorously, or you’ll break popcorn pieces. Once you think the butter is evenly distributed, you’re all set.

, This yummy garlic popcorn is a perfect treat for a movie night, a party, or a midday snack. Once your popcorn is coated with the garlic butter, you're ready to dig in. Just make sure to keep a stack of napkins next to the bowl. Buttery hands can make a mess– but they're also the sign of a great snack!

A bag of corn kernels
Cooking oil, such as canola oil, vegetable oil, or olive oil
Two large bowls
Oven mitts;
, You want to make sure you have the proper kernels to oil ratio before making your popcorn. In general, you will need 3 tablespoons of oil for every 1







, Place the proper amount of oil into your first pot, as well as 2 to 3 kernels of popcorn. Turn the stove to medium heat. Let the oil sit on the stove until it's hot enough to cook your popcorn.








Make sure to watch the oil the whole time. You do not want to leave a pot on the stove unattended.

, You want to make sure your oil is neither too hot nor too cold. Watch the kernels you placed in the oil. As soon as they pop, the oil is ready and you can add the rest of your kernels.








Measure out your kernels before you place the oil over the heat. You need to transfer them quickly as soon as the oil heats up.

, As soon as the kernels are in the pot, cover the lid. You want to keep it covered until you're done making the popcorn. Resist the temptation to lift the lid and peak, as this can cause your kernels to heat unevenly.








If you like to watch the popcorn pop, you can use a clear lid. This may eliminate some of the temptation to peak.

, Exactly how long the popcorn will take to heat varies depending on how much you're making, the heat of your oil, and other factors. In general, it should not take more than 20 or 30 seconds. Listen to the pot. You should hear a lot of popping noises. Once these noises slow to a few seconds between pops, your popcorn is ready.








Carefully remove the lid. Make sure to use your oven mitts, as the lid will be hot.
Stand back a little in case any popcorn flies out of the pan. It will be hot and can hurt your skin.

, Once the popcorn is in the bowl, shake the bowl vigorously. This should cause any un-popped kernels to shift to the bottom of the bowl.








Here, use a bowl that's larger than you need. You should only fill the bowl about half of three quarters of the way full of popcorn. This way, you can shake the bowl without having the popcorn fall on the floor.

, Use a large cooking spoon to transfer your popcorn to the second bowl. You should get all the popped corn out, and the un-popped kernels will be resting on the bottom of the first bowl.








Throw the kernels into the garbage to dispose of them. They may clog your skin if you flush them down the drain.

, If you do not want to use the stove, you can also make homemade popcorn in the microwave. To start, you will need the following:Half a cup of corn kernels
1 teaspoon of vegetable oil
1/2 a teaspoon of salt
A brown paper lunch bag

, To start, place half a cup of kernels in a small mixing bowl. Drizzle the half teaspoon of vegetable oil over the kernels, and then sprinkle on the salt. Use a spoon to mix the oil, kernels, and salt together. You can also mix by shaking the bowl slightly until the oil is evenly dispersed throughout the bowl.







, You want to seal the bag to make sure the kernels pop correctly. To do so, fold the top of the bag over twice. Make sure to crease your folds with your thumbnail to make sure they're secure.







, You will have to listen to know how long to leave the popcorn in the microwave. Usually, it should take between 2 and 3 minutes. You should hear popping noises while the bag is microwaving. Remove the bag when the popping slows down to the point there are a couple of seconds between pops. Your popcorn should be ready at this point., Melted butter is a classic popcorn topping. How much melted butter you want to add is up to you. Usually, a few tablespoons should be sufficient. Too much butter can make the popcorn soggy, however, and it also adds calories.








If you melt butter over the stove, do not melt it on high heat. This can burn the butter. Butter should be melted slowly, over medium or low heat. You can also melt butter in the microwave if you cut it into sections first. Cover the butter with a paper towel and only heat it for 10 to 15 seconds at a time.
When adding butter to your popcorn, it's a good idea to pour the butter around the edge of the bowl. This way, the butter will disperse more evenly throughout the popcorn.
Sprinkle some salt over the popcorn and taste. If you feel it still needs more flavor, you can add a bit more salt.

, Brown butter can add a sweet, nutty flavor to your popcorn. You'll end up with something like kettle corn. Brown butter is butter that is heated until it gains a brownish color.








Place your desired amount of butter in a pan with a light-colored bottom. You want the bottom of the pan to be a light color so you can monitor the butter's color.
Watch the butter as it heats. When the butter begins to foam slightly, it will turn a lemon color, then a golden color, and then a brown. Remove the butter as soon as it turns brown to avoid burning it.
Let the butter cool for a few minutes and then add it to your popcorn.

, A cheesy flavor for your popcorn can be nice, but cheese powders are full of additives and cheese itself has a lot of calories. To preserve the health benefits of homemade popcorn, try adding nutritional yeast instead of cheese-based products. Sprinkle nutritional yeast over your popcorn, tasting as you go until you reach your desired flavor.








Nutritional yeast can be somewhat hard to find. It may be in the health food section of your supermarket. However, not every supermarket carries nutritional yeast. You may want to call ahead of time and check.
If you can't find nutritional yeast at a conventional supermarket, health food stores like Whole Foods usually carry nutritional yeast.

, Caramel corn can be a fun treat for the holidays. To make caramel corn, you'll need 3








Melt your butter over medium heat. Add the sugar and mix until it's moist. Turn the heat up to medium high and heat the mixture until it starts to boil. Allow it to boil for 3 to 4 minutes as you stir.
Remove the mixture from the heat and add the remaining ingredients until the mixture is thick and frothy. Pour the mixture over your popcorn, mixing as you go so it's dispersed evenly. Place the popcorn on a baking sheet and bake for 10 to 15 minutes at 250 degrees. Let the popcorn cool before serving.

, You should not remove the lid from your popcorn until it's done. If you remove the lid, popcorn could fly out, making a mess and burning you in the process. Wait for about 20 to 30 seconds before removing the lid., You do not want to remove the lid until the popcorn is ready. Removing the lid too soon will result in a lot of un-popped kernels. Removing it too late will cause the popcorn to burn. Listen carefully while the popcorn is popping. Wait until popping has slowed to one pop every few seconds before removing the lid.









Do not leave the popcorn unattended on the stove. This could start a fire.

, You should not make homemade popcorn without oven mitts, especially if you're making something like caramel corn which requires baking. The lid of your pot will be hot to the touch when popping is done, and you could burn yourself if you touch it without oven mitts. You should also be sure to use oven mitts when lifting the pot to pour your popcorn into a bowl."

Add 9 tablespoons (113 g) of unpopped popcorn to a brown paper bag, and fold the bag closed several times.When you’re making a large amount of popcorn, it may burst out of the bag when it pops. You may want to use a piece of tape to secure the bag closed.
You should wind up with approximately 12 cups (96 g) of popped popcorn if you start with 9 tablespoons (113 g) of unpopped kernels.;
, Once the popcorn kernels are secure in the bag, place it in the microwave. Heat the popcorn on high for 2 to 3 minutes, or until there are 4 seconds between each pop.The time needed to pop the popcorn will depend on your microwave. Start with just 2 minutes and only microwave it longer if there are a large number of unpopped kernels.

, After the popcorn has finished popping, carefully remove the bag from the microwave. Allow it to cool for 1 to 2 minutes, and then dump it into a large bowl. Sort through the popcorn, and remove any unpopped kernels.You can also remove any burnt or misshapen pieces of popcorn.

, Add 16 ounces (453 g) of vanilla candy melts to a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave the melts for 1 minute at 50% power, and then stir the bowl to ensure that the candy melts evenly. Continue heating the melts in 30 second intervals, stirring after each one, until the candy is fully melted.You can substitute marshmallow flavored candy melts for the vanilla if you prefer.

, Take 8 cups (64 g) of the popcorn you’ve popped, and place it in a large bowl. Pour the melted candy melts into the bowl, and use a spatula to stir the mixture until the popcorn is well coated.Be gentle as you’re stirring the popcorn and candy melts together. You don’t want to break the popcorn pieces.

, Once the popcorn is coated with the candy melts, add 2 cups (480 g) of cotton candy that’s torn into small pieces to the bowl. Fold the cotton candy in with the spatula so it’s evenly distributed throughout the popcorn.You can usually purchase cotton candy at candy stores and some grocery stores.

, After you’ve mixed the cotton candy in, pour the popcorn out onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Sprinkle ¼ cup (40 g) of colored sprinkles over the popcorn, and toss to combine the two.You can omit the sprinkles if you prefer.

, Take 2 small microwave-safe bowls, and add 3 ounces (85 g) of blue candy melts to one bowl and 3 ounces (85 g) pink candy melts to the other. Heat them in the microwave one at a time to melt them just as you did with the vanilla candy melts.If you prefer, you can use just one color of the melts. However, using blue and pink makes the popcorn look like cotton candy.

, Take the remaining 4 cups (32 g) of popcorn, and divide it in half. Place 2 cups (16 g) in one medium bowl and the other 2 cups (16 g) in another. Mix the blue candy melts into the first bowl and the pink candy melts into the second to coat each half.Use a spatula to gently mix the popcorn and candy melts so you don’t break the popcorn.

, After you’ve mixed the two bowls of popcorn with the colored candy melts, pour each out on a large cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Allow the popcorn to sit for 3 to 5 minutes so the candy coating can set., When the colored candy coating has set on the popcorn, transfer the blue, pink, and white popcorn into one large bowl. Gently toss all of the popcorn together to mix the colors, and serve.The popcorn makes ideal party favors for a birthday or baby shower. Place it in small cellophane bags and tie them off with blue and pink ribbon.

, Add 1 cup (237 ml) of water, 1 ⅔ cups (333 g) of sugar, and ⅓ cup (100 g) of light corn syrup to a large pot. Whisk the ingredients together, and heat on the stove on medium.It’s best to use a heavy-bottomed pan when you’re mixing up the syrup.
When you’re whisking the mixture, avoid getting sugar crystals stuck to the sides of the pot.

, Allow the mixture to heat on the stove until it comes to a boil, which should take 5 to 10 minutes. Once it reaches a boil, let it bubble it for another 5 to 6 minutes, or until it takes on a syrup-like consistency.Do not walk away from the stove while the mixture is boiling because it can easily bubble over. Lower the heat if it seems like that’s about to happen.
Don’t stir the mixture as you’re boiling it. If sugar crystals are stuck to the side of the pot, use a pastry brush to push them down.
The finished syrup shouldn’t be golden. The sugar should remain clear.

, After you’ve cooked the syrup, take the pan off the heat. Mix in 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of cotton candy flavor oil and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract until they’re thoroughly combined.Cotton candy flavor oil is like flavored extract that you’d use for baking. You can usually find it in the baking aisle of your grocery store, but a variety of online stores sell it as well.
If you want to make colored cotton candy popcorn balls, you can add a few drops of blue or pink food coloring to the syrup too.

, Once the cotton candy oil and vanilla are mixed into the syrup, add the 12 cups (96 g) of popcorn that you made earlier. Use a spatula to gently fold it in, so all of the popcorn is well coated with the syrup., After you’ve mixed in the popcorn, let the mixture sit for 2 to 3 minutes so the syrup has time to cool. Once it’s cool enough to handle, use clean hands to shape the popcorn into balls.You can make the balls as large or as small as you’d like, but a handful of the popcorn mixture makes a good size ball.
If you want to make the popcorn balls easier to hold, you can stick popsicle sticks or straws into the bottom of the balls to serve as handles.

, Place 1 ½ cups (338 g) of pink or blue candy melts in a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat the melts in the microwave at 50% power for 1 minute. Remove the bowl and stir well. Continue heating the melts in 30 second intervals until the candy is completely melted.Be sure to stir the candy after each heating interval so it melts evenly.

, When the candy is melted, take each popcorn ball and dip the bottom in the candy coating. While the candy is still warm, sprinkle colorful sprinkles over it for garnish."

, This should equate to about 1-2 seconds between pops. The time will vary depending on your microwave and bowl, so you may need some trial-and-error on the first batch or two to figure out how long it takes the popcorn to cook. If you cook it too long, it will burn, smoke and stink, so keep a close watch.








, Leave the unpopped kernels in the bottom of the bowl. This will keep it from sticking to the bottom of the bowl as it cools. There will be some of the cooked syrup mixture in the bottom of the bowl, along with some unpopped kernels.

However, if you only have salted butter, you can omit the salt.

, Once the caramel mixture comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low. Let the mixture cook for another 5 minutes, making sure to stir it the entire time., After you’ve cooked the caramel for several minutes, remove the pan from the heat. Add a teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda, and stir it in with a spoon until it’s fully incorporated.The caramel mixture will foam slightly when you add the baking soda.

, Immediately after you’ve mixed in the baking soda, add the caramel mixture to the popcorn in the roasting pan.

, When the kernels pop, add the rest of popcorn kernels in an even layer. Cover, remove from heat, and count 30 seconds.








This method first heats the oil to the right temperature, then waiting 30 seconds brings all of the other kernels to a near-popping temperature so that when they are put back on the heat, they all pop at roughly the same time.

, The popcorn should begin popping soon and all at once. Once the popping starts in earnest, gently shake the pan by moving it back and forth over the burner.








Try to keep the lid slightly ajar to let the steam from the popcorn release (the popcorn will be drier and crisper this way, rather than chewy)., Remove the lid, and dump the popcorn immediately into a wide bowl..









With this technique, nearly all of the kernels pop, and nothing burns.

, Drizzle over popcorn and toss to distribute evenly.









Note that if you let the butter get just a little bit brown, it will add an even more intense, buttery flavor to the butter and to your popcorn..

, Sea salt is a great alternative to traditional table salt.









You can also add other flavorings and seasonings, like smoked paprika, cayenne powder, chili pepper, curry powder, cumin, grated Parmesan or cheddar cheese, and fresh herbs like rosemary.If you want to make your own sweet and salty popcorn, sprinkle some sugar over the top and mix thoroughly while the popcorn is still hot. Alternatively, you can also add the sugar to the kernels once you've placed them in the oil and they begin to sizzle."

Cool the unit.,
Wash the cover and melter.,
Rinse the chute with a damp cloth.,
Replace all components and store.",How to Clean a Popcorn Machine1," Before cleaning, allow the unit to cool entirely with all components in place. The unit should be allowed to cool on its own. Do not introduce water or other agents to help cool the machine.Unplug the machine while allowing it to cool.
While many machines can cool in as little as an hour, it may be advisable to let the machine sit for a few hours or overnight to allow it to cool completely.;
, Wash the cover, the butter melter cup, and any other removable components with dish soap or a mild detergent and warm water. Unless the manufacturer’s manual specifically states the components are dishwasher safe, wash all components by hand.Do not wash any electrical or non-removable components with water, as this could cause damage to the maker.
Use a sponge or washcloth to wash the removable components. Do not use steel wool or other scouring instruments.
Allow the components to dry completely on a drying rack or on the counter before replacing them.

, If the chute is not removable, use a damp cloth to wipe it down. Avoid rinsing inside the popping chamber, as this could cause problems with the electrical equipment.Clean out debris from the popping chamber by using a dry cleaning cloth such as a microfiber cloth or fleece cleaner.

, Once all components are clean and dry, place them back in their appropriate spots on the popcorn maker. Store the maker in a dry place such as a cabinet or shelf in the kitchen.


Make sure that the cord is wrapped properly and not hanging down when the maker is stored to help prevent damage to the plug.

Place the oil, popcorn, and salt in a large, 6-quart, metal mixing bowl.,
Place the bowl on the stove and turn to medium heat.,
Remove the bowl from the heat and carefully remove the foil.,
Slowly drizzle melted butter over the popcorn, while spinning the bowl.",How to Make Popcorn on the Stove2," Cover with heavy-duty aluminum foil and poke 10 slits in the top with a knife.








The slits will let the steam from the popcorn release and help make the popcorn crispier, with just the right crunch.

, Shake the bowl constantly, using a pair of tongs to hold the bowl. Continue shaking until the popcorn finishes popping, approximately 3 minutes.







, Stir in any salt that is on the side of the bowl with a spatula.







, Serve immediately.








This method is slightly quicker than the traditional method, since you don't test 3 or 4 kernels and then wait the 30 seconds once those have popped.
This method also creates fewer dishes, since the bowl you use on the stove to pop the kernels is also the bowl you serve the freshly popped popcorn in.
Make sure that the bowl is cool enough to be passed around or placed in someone's lap. If it's still too warm, put a dishtowel underneath it.

Drain and rinse the kettle.,
Use a non-ammonia based cleaner to wipe the glass.,
Clean the outer surface.",How to Clean a Popcorn Machine3," Before starting, make sure all of the lights and heating components are turned off, and that the machine is completely unplugged. Allow the kettle to cool for at least an hour before beginning cleaning.All popcorn and kernels should be removed from the kettle before beginning the cleaning process.
The kettle should be cool to the touch. Hover your hand near the kettle without making contact with the metal. If you can feel heat radiating off the kettle, it is too warm to start cleaning.

, Unplug the kettle and remove it from the larger unit so that it can be easily wiped down. Use a damp sponge or towel to wipe down the kettle on the inside and the outside.Do not submerge the kettle, as this could cause damage.
Once the kettle has been wiped down, reinstall it back in the machine.

, Once a week to once a month depending upon use, boil out the kettle using a specially-formulated kettle cleaner, available from most kitchen supply stores. Mix the cleaner concentrate with the necessary amount of water as specified by the packaging, and bring it to a boil in the plugged-in kettle.Once the cleaning solution is at a boil, unplug the whole unit and allow the solution to sit for the amount of time specified on the packaging of the cleaning solution concentrate.

, Drain the liquid out of the kettle over the sink. Once the kettle has been drained, rinse it out fully using a wet cloth or sponge. It may take several passes with the sponge to fully rinse the kettle.


Once the kettle has been rinsed, place it back in the unit.

, Look for a food-safe, non-ammonia based cleaner to wipe down the glass and the interior metallic surfaces. Use a towel to wipe away the cleaner, and allow the surface to fully dry before turning the machine back on.Read the instructions on the cleaner carefully before use. It should be safe for both metal and glass surfaces. The label should also tell you whether you need to rinse the surface with water after use.
Food-safe cleaners are typically available from kitchen supplies retailers, as well as online.

, Wipe down the outer surfaces with a damp towel. If there are spots such as fingerprints or oil slicks, use a food-safe glass cleaner to remove the marks and debris.Exterior metal surfaces can generally be cleaned with warm water and typically don’t require a specialized cleaner. Dish soap and warm water can help remove any spots on metallic surfaces.

Heat two tablespoons of butter in the microwave.",How to Use a Popcorn Maker," Most automatic stirring popcorn makers have a ceramic or metal ""E"" and a large, domed lid that doubles as a serving bowl. To begin, turn the bowl upside down and attach it to the base. Most popcorn makers will have some sort of locking mechanism to keep the bowl in place — you may, for instance, need to screw the bowl in or use fasteners to hold it down.


Make sure your bowl is firmly attached to the base before you begin. Popping your corn without fastening your base down is a surefire recipe for a spill., Next, add your main ingredients — the popcorn kernels and the oil you'll cook them in. See the chart above for serving size suggestions. Most stirring popcorn makers will have a removable portion in the center of the lid for adding the ingredients — simply open this hatch and drop your ingredients in to get started.


Most neutral cooking oils will work well for stirring popcorn makers. For example, vegetable oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, and coconut oil are all great choices. Don't use margarine or an oil with a low smoke point — these can burn and give your popcorn an unappealing smoky taste.

, Most standard stirring popcorn makers have a small slot at the top for adding butter. As the popcorn cooks, the butter in this slot will melt, giving the popcorn an even coating. Add your butter in a few skinny slices — the thinner the slices are, the quicker it will melt. See the chart above for serving suggestions.


Softening the butter for a few seconds in the microwave before adding it can help ensure the popcorn melts completely.

, When you've added all your ingredients, close the lid and plug your device in. Some popcorn makers will start heating up right away, while others will have an ""on"" switch you'll need to hit. The stirring arms should begin turning, stirring the popcorn as it cooks., Depending on how much popcorn you're making, the type of kernels you're using, and their freshness, the cooking time of your popcorn will vary. A few minutes after you turn your popcorn maker on, you should hear your kernels begin to pop. The pace of the popping should quickly increase, then die down. When you start hearing only one pop every few seconds, turn your machine off.


Sometimes, kernels may get caught under the stirring arm during cooking. If this happens, you may begin to hear a slight scraping sound. This isn't harmful., You're all done! Carefully turn your popcorn maker over and remove the lid to use it as a bowl.Most people like their popcorn with a little salt, but there are dozens of possibilities. Below are listed just a few seasoning ideas to get you started, but there are many more — any flavor you like can make a great seasoning.


Black pepper
Cajun seasoning
Garlic salt
Hot sauce
Chocolate candy (M&Ms, etc.)

, For most popcorn makers (including the home ""stirrer"" type), maintenance is minimal. After making your popcorn, simply use a paper towel or rag to wipe away excess oil from the base and bowl. This prevents the buildup of grease over time, which can give the popcorn an unappealing taste or texture.


If you wish, you may also want to use a non-toxic cleaning solution to cut the grease.Don't allow the cleaner to dry on the popcorn maker or it may spoil your next batch of popcorn — instead, remove it with a damp rag when you're done cleaning.

, The way a movie theater-style popcorn maker works is remarkably similar to the way a home ""stirrer""-style popcorn maker works. In fact, if you open up the cooking chamber, you'll usually see a pair of stirring arms just as you would in a home popcorn maker! To start, add your main ingredients — kernels and oil — just as you would normally.


For most theater-style popcorn makers, the cooking chamber is a metal ""bucket"" with a handle attached to it suspended in the middle of a clear glass case. Usually, all you need to do is lift one of the metal flaps on top to open it so you can add ingredients.
For some movie-style popcorn, the kernels are packaged together with the oil in a single packet, while for other popcorn, the two are kept separate. In the latter case, see the table above for serving suggestions.

, Next, simply flip the ""on"" switch to start the cooking process. Depending on the exact model of popcorn maker you're using, this may be on the front, on the back, or even on the cooking chamber. If you look into the cooking chamber while the popcorn is cooking, you should notice the stirring arms evenly distributing the melting oil over the kernels.


As with a home ""stirrer"" popcorn maker, you'll want to turn the machine off when pops slow to about one, every few seconds. As the popcorn cooks, you should notice popped kernels rising out of the cooking chamber, spilling over the sides, and gathering at the bottom of the glass case below.

, When the popcorn finishes cooking, you should have a good amount of popcorn gathered at the bottom of the case. Use a large spoon or scoop (most popcorn makers should have one included) to serve the popcorn. Traditionally, theater popcorn is served in paper bags, but if you don't have any, you can use ordinary bowls. Most popcorn machines have a number of holes in the bottom of the case for allowing unpopped kernels and very small ""crumbs"" to fall into a crumb drawer located below the bottom. Before serving the popcorn, it is advisable to carefully rake the scoop back and forth so that those ""old maids"" will fall into the drawer.

, Your popcorn is ready to eat! Add salt, butter, and/or other seasonings as you wish and enjoy! See the section above for a short list of seasoning suggestions.


As you might know, if you've ever ordered buttered popcorn at the theater, ""butter"" is usually added to theater-style popcorn after it's been served (usually with a pump). If you're at home and you don't have butter for your popcorn, try melting about a tablespoon of butter in the microwave and drizzling it over the top of your popcorn with a spoon for an authentic movie theater taste.
Movie-theater ""butter"" is almost always not real dairy butter. Instead, it is typically a blend of coconut oil and/or (often, partially hydrogenated) soybean or canola oil with artificial butter flavor, TBHO, with citric acid added to improve stability, beta carotene added for color, and methyl-silicone added as an anti-foaming agent.

, Whether you're using a home popcorn maker or a theater-style machine, putting flavorful spins on the classic popcorn recipe is a piece of cake!

For instance, if you want to make mouth-watering kettle corn, try adding about 1/4-1/3 cups of sugar to the popcorn maker after you add your kernels and oil.As the popcorn cooks, the sugar should melt, giving it a delicious sweet crunch!






After your popcorn finishes and starts to cool, the melted sugar may start to stick to itself, forming clumps. This is normal — just stir to break them up.

, For a high-class treat, try sprinkling a little gourmet truffle seasoning on your popcorn. Adding just a pinch of truffle salt or a light pinch of truffle oil can give your popcorn the incredible aroma and taste of truffles at a fraction of the price. This delicious snack recipe has to be tasted to be believed, so head to a specialty grocery store near you for some truffle seasonings today!


Note that truffle-based ingredients can sometimes run very expensive. The most affordable truffle-flavored seasonings are usually about $15-$20 for a small jar, but truffles themselves can often cost hundreds of dollars., Try this recipe for a sweet treat! Buy caramel from the store (or make it yourself with sugar and cream) and stir in your popcorn. While you wait for it to cool, melt bittersweet chocolate in a double boiler., Lay the popcorn out on a parchment-covered baking sheet and let it cool (you can put it in the fridge to speed this process up).When it's cooled completely, break it up with a spoon and enjoy!

, For a high-energy outdoor snack, try adding your favorite trail mix ingredients to popcorn. No matter which ingredients you choose, all you need to do is stir them into your popcorn and you're done! Below are just a few ideas for what you might want to add to your trail mix besides popcorn:


Nuts (peanuts, cashews, almonds, etc.)
Seeds (sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc.)
Pretzels or other salty snacks
Granola
Marshmallows
Dried fruit (raisins, dried berries, dried apricots, etc.)
Chocolate chips or candy (M&Ms, etc.)

, Believe it or not, popcorn is a highly versatile food — it's even possible to turn it into vibrant, exotic dishes with the right spices.

For instance, for a sweet, spicy, curry-flavored popcorn, start by mixing 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric, and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne powder in a bowl while you wait for your popcorn to finish cooking.

, Combine with one tablespoon of honey to make a sweet, syrupy sauce.


Pour the liquid sauce over your popcorn and stir to give it an even coating, then gradually add your spices while shaking to combine. The end result should be sweet, savory, and spicy — a new spin on regular old popcorn!"

1/3 cup of popcorn kernels;
, Place the butter, oil, syrup and salt in a large pot. Melt the ingredients together until they're completely combined. Stir occasionally to incorporate the ingredients.








, Stir in 1/4 teaspoon of liquid food colouring. If you want the popcorn to have a deeper colour, add more; for a pastel colour, add less. Use a spoon to mix the food colouring in thoroughly.








, Pour 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels into the pot and stir them around so they're coated in the syrup mixture. Put a tight-fitting lid on the pot and turn the heat to medium high. Shake the pot every few moments as the kernels heat up and begin to pop. When the popping begins to slow down, remove the pot from heat.









If you want to use the microwave instead. pour the syrup mixture and popcorn kernels into a glass microwave-safe bowl with a lid. Pop the popcorn on high for three to four minutes, or until the popping slows to a stop. Do not use a plastic bowl, even if it's microwave safe, since the syrup will get very hot and could scorch the bowl. Be sure to use a glass one.

, You can oil the baking sheet or line it with parchment paper so the popcorn won't stick. Spread it into a thin, single layer and allow it to cool completely. The popcorn will get crispy as it cools. Enjoy immediately or store in an airtight container. "

8 cups of popped popcorn (if you're not popping it from scratch, choose an unflavoured kind)
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup corn syrup
1/2 cup sugar
3.5 oz flavoured, unsweetened gelatin mix or fruit drink mix

, Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or spraying it with cooking oil, and set it aside.

, Put all of these ingredients into a small pot and heat them over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to allow it to simmer. Simmer the mixture for 5 minutes.








, Use a long-handled wooden spoon to stir the mixture in with the popcorn, and try to thoroughly incorporate it so every piece gets coated.








, Use the spoon to spread it out in a single layer. Examine the popcorn for unpopped kernels and pick them out.

, This hardens the flavouring so the popcorn becomes crunchy, rather than chewy. If you want it extra crunchy, bake for 15 minutes. If you like your popcorn chewy, take it out after 5 minutes.








, Once it's cool enough to handle, enjoy the popcorn or store it in an airtight container for later."

This buttery popcorn will turn out delicious and vibrantly coloured, but unlike the sweet caramel version, savoury colourful popcorn will dye your fingers and mouth with food colouring. If you don't mind having green, red or blue fingers and lips, try this recipe. If you do, make the sweet caramel or fruity kind. Here's what you'll need for simple buttered popcorn with a pop of colour:


1 tablespoon of butter
1/3 cup of popcorn kernels
Liquid or gel food colouring
Salt

, Place a tablespoon of butter either in a stockpot or a large bowl (the same one you want to use to pop the popcorn). If you're using a pot, melt the butter over a burner on the stove. If you're using a big plastic bowl, you can melt it in the microwave.








, Since this colourful popcorn will stain your fingers and lips, you only want to use a few drops of food colouring. Pour in five to ten drops, enough to give your finished popcorn a burst of colour without making too much of a mess.









If you're using red food colouring, check the label to make sure it says ""unflavoured."" Red food colouring often has a bitter flavour, but if it's labeled as unflavoured, it won't.

, Pour the 1/3 cup of kernels into the butter mixture, and stir them around so they're completely coated. Cook the popcorn either on the stove or in the microwave; both methods work equally well.









If you're using a pot, cover it with a tight-fitting lid and place it on the stove over medium high heat. Shake the pot every few moments as the popcorn kernels heat up and begin to pop. When the popping slows down, remove the pot from heat.

Use an air popper.,
Air pop your popcorn in the microwave.,
Make popcorn on the stovetop with healthy oils.",How to Enjoy Healthier Popcorn1," The healthiest way to make popcorn is with an air popper. It is an appliance that just uses hot air to heat the kernels and pop them, so you don’t need to use any butter or oil. That means your popcorn has fewer calories and less fat than microwave popcorn or popcorn that’s popped in oil or butter in a skillet.Air poppers are relatively inexpensive, usually ranging in price for $15 to $35. If you eat a lot of popcorn, purchasing one may be a good investment.
Using an air popper is easy, but always consult the instruction manual. In most cases, you only need to pour some corn kernels in the popping chamber, place a bowl under the popper’s chute, and turn it on. The popper usually takes several minutes to finish popping a batch of popcorn.;
, If you don’t want to invest in an air popper, you can air pop your popcorn in your microwave. Put approximately 3 tablespoons (36 g) of corn kernels into a brown paper bag and fold the bag closed. Microwave the bag on high for approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds or until all of the kernels are popped.Exact cooking times will vary based on your microwave. Start with a minute and half, and only heat it longer if there are a bunch of unpopped kernels left.
You can tape the bag shut if you’re concerned about the popcorn escaping from the bag as it pops.

, While air-popped popcorn is usually the healthiest way to enjoy popcorn, you may want to cook it in oil on the stovetop for added flavor. However, it’s important to choose a healthy oil so use one that is low in saturated fat.Extra virgin olive, walnut, and avocado oils are usually the best options for popping popcorn.
Canola oil is a decent option, but it has more saturated fat.
Avoid popping your popcorn in soybean, sunflower, or corn oil.
To make popcorn on the stove, heat 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of your chosen oil in a saucepan with a thick bottom on medium high. Add ⅓ cup (75 g) of popcorn kernels to the pan in a single layer. Cover the pan, and remove it from the heat for 30 seconds. Return the pan to the heat, and the popcorn will start popping. Take the pan off the heat when there’s more than 2 to 3 seconds between pops.

Shake the bottle vigorously to mix the two together.The water doesn’t need to be boiling. Hot water from the tap is warm enough.
Don’t substitute margarine for the butter. It had a tendency to clump up so it won’t spray well.

, Take 8 cups (64 g) of plain, air-popped popcorn, and place it on a cookie sheet. Be sure to lay the popcorn out in a single layer.You can also spread the popcorn out on a large piece of foil.

, Once the popcorn is spread out, lightly spray it with the butter and water mixture. Be sure to spray evenly so the butter flavor is evenly distributed. Transfer the popcorn to a bowl, and serve.You can sprinkle some salt over the popcorn after you spray it. However, don’t use too much or the popcorn will have too much sodium.
You can also sprinkle the popcorn with a lighter seasoning after spraying it for extra flavor.

Sprinkle with cayenne pepper or chili powder.,
Season with Old Bay or jerk seasoning.,
Add garlic powder and parmesan cheese.",How to Enjoy Healthier Popcorn3," If you want to give your plain popcorn a spicy kick, dust it with a little cayenne pepper or chili powder. You can add as much or as little as you like, depending on how much heat you want your popcorn to have. Toss the popcorn well to ensure that the seasoning is evenly distributed.You can also season your popcorn with taco seasoning, but choose a salt-free or low-salt option to keep your popcorn on the healthy side.
Tossing your popcorn with some hot sauce can also give it some tasty heat. Just be careful not to add too much or the popcorn may get soggy.

, If you want your plain popcorn to have more distinct spicy flavor, sprinkle some Old Bay or jerk seasoning over it. Look for a salt-free option, though, to make sure that the popcorn doesn’t have too much sodium.Make sure to toss the popcorn well after you add the Old Bay or jerk seasoning to make sure that the seasoning doesn’t clump together.

, Garlic and parmesan cheese make an ideal topping for plain popcorn. Sprinkle a little of each over your popcorn, and toss well to coat. Be careful not to use too much cheese, though -- it can be high in sodium.If you’re having trouble getting the garlic powder and cheese to stick to all of the popcorn, mist it lightly with olive oil first to give it something to stick to.

"
Learn the proper serving size.,
Eat your popcorn with protein.,
Avoid microwave popcorn.",How to Enjoy Healthier Popcorn4," Serving sizes will vary based on the type of popcorn that you’re eating, but 1 cup of plain, popped popcorn contains 30 calories. Make sure to measure how much you’re adding to the bowl that you plan to eat from so you know the precise amount that you’re eating.Keep in mind that any toppings that you add to your popcorn, such as butter, oil, or parmesan cheese, will add extra calories and fat. Measure the toppings too, so you can keep track of how much you’re eating.

, You can make your popcorn more filling by pairing it with protein. Proteins are usually more filling than the carbohydrates in the popcorn, so you feel full longer if you eat your popcorn with a tablespoon (16 g) of peanut butter or 2 ounces (75 g) of cheese. That can help keep you from overeating.You can eat the popcorn with your favorite protein. Just be aware of the serving size for the food, so you don’t overeat.
If you’ve already topped your popcorn with parmesan cheese, it’s best not to eat it with cheese. You may wind up consuming too much fat and sodium.

, While making microwave popcorn may be quick and easy, it is often extremely unhealthy because it’s full of sodium and artificial flavorings. It’s also hard to control the portions that you eat because the bags are large. Make your own popcorn so you can control how much eat and what goes into it.Don’t assume that light or low-fat microwave popcorn is healthy. It is usually loaded with sodium and artificial butter flavoring that can be very unhealthy.

Remove the sweet potato chips.",How to Make Sweet Potato Chips1," Pour 3 to 4 cups of canola oil into a wok or deep-fryer. You may need more or less oil, depending on the size of your wok or deep-fryer. Just ensure that you have about 3 inches of oil in the bottom of the fryer. Heat the oil between 360 and 375 degrees F (182 to 190 C).If you don't have a wok or deep-fryer, you can use a wide saucepan to fry the sweet potato chips.
You may want to attach a deep-fry thermometer to the fryer so you can check the temperature as you fry.;
, Scrub one pound of sweet potatoes under cold water and peel them. Take a sharp knife and cut the sweet potatoes into slices that are as thin as paper. It may be easier to use a mandolin and slice them on the thinnest setting. A mandolin will give you more uniform chips.You may want to use organic sweet potatoes since you'll be leaving the skins on the potatoes. Studies on pesticides in potatoes found that pesticides are concentrated in the peel.

, Carefully place a single handful of the sweet potato chips into the hot oil. They should fry quickly and begin to turn brown and curly. Avoid letting the sweet potatoes fry for more than one minute.Avoid frying more than a handful of sweet potatoes at a time. If you add more, the temperature of the oil will drop quickly, so they won't fry properly.

, Use a deep-fry skimmer to scoop out the fried sweet potato chips. Set the cooked chips on a rack that is lined with paper towels and sprinkle them with salt to taste. Continue to fry the rest of the sweet potato chips in batches.When frying more sweet potato chips, ensure that the oil gets back up between 360 and 375 degrees before adding another handful of chips.

",How to Make Potato Chips2," You can cut your potatoes by hand if you want, but a far more efficient — and probably more effective — way of slicing them would be to use:









A food processor slicing attachment
A mandoline slicer (be very careful!)

, After they've soaked for 30 minutes, rinse them in a colander, then rinse them again and let dry.








, While vegetable, safflower, corn, or peanut oil are all perfectly viable options, many people are increasingly turning to olive oil because it contains no trans fats.Since deep-frying is already the least healthy method of cooking potato chips, it might be a good idea to use the healthiest oil you can get.

, Optimally, use about a quart of oil. At the bare minimum, cover the bottom of your pan with an inch of oil.


Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature of your oil. If you need to eyeball things because you don't own a candy thermometer, stick the end of a wooden spoon into the oil and wait for bubbles to start forming at the end of the spoon.Another way to check the temperature of oil without a thermometer is by frying a small cube of bread. Bread will turn a golden hue at 320° F after 30 seconds; 355° F after 15 seconds; and 375° F after 10 seconds., Cooking your potatoes all at once can drop the temperature of the oil too far too quickly.







, If desired, season immediately.

",How to Make Potato Chips3," Cut your potato slices anywhere from 1/4"" to 1/8"" thick for best results.

, Start to let air dry.


If you want to salt your potato chips, adding about 3 tablespoons of sea salt to the water you use to soak the potatoes in creates enough saltiness in the final product.

, Water is the enemy in this process, so be sure to remove as much as possible before microwaving.

Remove the sweet potato chips.",How to Make Sweet Potato Chips2," Turn the oven on to 250 degrees F (121 C). Move the rack in your oven so that it's in the center. This will ensure that the sweet potato chips bake evenly. You should also set aside one or two baking sheets.Consider using rimmed baking sheets. The rims can prevent the cooked sweet potato chips from sliding off of the sheet as you remove them from the oven.

, Scrub two large sweet potatoes under cold water and dry them completely. Take a sharp knife and cut the sweet potatoes into very thin slices (as thin as you can get them). You could also use a mandolin and slice them on the thinnest setting. A mandolin will give you more uniform chips.You may want to use organic sweet potatoes since you'll be leaving the skins on the potatoes. Studies on pesticides in potatoes found that pesticides are concentrated in the peel., Place your sliced sweet potato chips into a large mixing bowl and drizzle them with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of salt over the chips. Use a spoon to toss the mixture so the sweet potato chips are completely covered with the oil.If you'd like a spicier chip, you can also sprinkle 1/4 of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper on the sweet potatoes.
For a sweet and salty chip, you could add 2 tablespoons of maple syrup when you drizzle the olive oil over the chips., Place the chips on one or two baking sheets so that they're laying flat in a single layer. Bake the chips for one hour. Remove them from the oven and carefully flip the chips. Return the chips to the oven and bake them for another hour.Flipping the sweet potato chips halfway through cooking helps the chips crisp up on both sides.

, The chips are done once they're crisp and golden brown in color. If the chips were a little thick (more than 1/4 inch thick), they may be firm or tender in the center. Remove the sweet potato chips from the oven and let them rest for 10 minutes. Once they've cooled and crisped, you can serve them.The sweet potato chips won't stay crispy for very long, so try to use them immediately.

, Scrub the potatoes under running water to remove dirt, and cut off any green areas.You can leave the flavorful skin on, or peel it if you prefer a uniform appearance.


Russets and Yukon Gold are two good options for this recipe. Avoid waxy or boiling varieties, since these tend to fall apart or cook unevenly., Uneven slices are much more difficult to cook, since the thin slices will burn before the thick ones are ready. Use a mandoline set to ⅛ inch (3 mm), or a slicing disc attachment on a food processor.If you don't have either of these, sharpen a knife as much as possible and cut by hand.


Keep the mandoline surface wet to keep the starch from sticking to the surface.
Use a corrugated knife or mandoline blade if you prefer wavy chips.
This size makes a thick-cut, crunchy chip, similar to store-bought kettle-cooked chips.You can cut the slices thinner with mandoline, but thin slices burn more easily.

, Starch molecules are essentially long chains of sugar, and just like sugar, they caramelize and turn brown when heated. If you prefer a light-colored potato chip with no burnt flavors, parboil the slices first to get rid of some starch:For every two large or three medium potatoes, combine 2 quarts (2 liters) water and 2 tbsp (30 mL) white vinegar in a large pot. The vinegar stops the potatoes falling apart.
Bring to a boil.
Add potato slices and cook for exactly three minutes. Cook for one or two minutes instead if slices are thinner than ⅛ inch (3 mm).
Drain potatoes and transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels.
Pat dry, then leave on paper towels for five minutes to finish drying. Move slices occasionally for even drying.

, Grease heavy-gauge baking sheets or roasting pans with a light layer of olive oil, butter, or cooking spray.Thin, lightweight baking sheets may warp in the oven or burn the chips. If these are your only option, let the sheets warm in the oven as it preheats, and cover the entire surface with chips.

, Brush or spray on a little bit more oil or butter over the slices, or just flip them over once on the greased pan.

, See below for additional flavor ideas.

, Check on the chips frequently, since the cooking time can be unpredictable due to differences in potato variety. Rotate the pan halfway through for even cooking. Remove chips as soon as they are completely dry and the edges are starting to turn golden brown. You can leave them to brown a little more if you prefer them that way.


If some slices brown more quickly than others, remove them with tongs and continue baking the rest.
This cooking time is for ⅛"" (3mm) slices. Thicker slices may take much longer to cook.

, Transfer your homemade baked potato chips onto paper towels to absorb the excess grease. Leave them uncovered to finish crisping as they cool.

, Homemade potato chips will turn soft sooner than store-bought chips. Keep leftovers in airtight containers in a dry, cool location., You can add just about any seasoning mix or dried spices to your potato chips, before or after cooking. Try paprika, pepper, garlic salt, or barbecue spice mix. Mix a Cajun spice blend or invent your own blend if you're feeling creative.

, Rosemary or thyme are excellent flavors to pair with potato chips, but a pile of dried leaves is not too appetizing. You can buy them in powder form, or infuse dried herbs in olive oil instead. Toss the potato chips in the olive oil before cooking for an extra-crisp, extra-flavorful result.


Also try dill, oregano, or chives.

, Toss the slices from two large potatoes in 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of lime juice, a pinch of cayenne, a pinch of chili powder, and pepper to taste. These strong flavors pack plenty of kick and no sodium.

, These take more time and effort to cook, but the basic process is the same. For best results, line the pan with foil and coat the foil and both sides of the chips with oil. Cook at 325ºF (160ºC) for about 40 minutes or until they start browning, flipping every five minutes.You can add sugar or cinnamon instead of salt to make sweet potato dessert chips.

",How to Make Barbecue Potato Chips," Peel the skin off completely and use a vegetable peeler to slice the potato in thin slices. Slice the potato from one point to the other, holding it vertically.

, You can hand slice the potatoes or use a mandolin. The mandolin will produce the most even results.


Keep the mandolin guard in place when using this device. If not used properly, it can slice fingers too.
Slice potatoes using the 1.33 setting for crisp but hearty chips.

, Once all the potatoes have been sliced, drain the bowl and rinse the potatoes. Dry the slices on a clean towel and roll pre-cooked chips up until you're ready to cook them.

, Use a large pot and only fill it halfway with the oil, to avoid splatters.


Don’t drop chips into the pot until you know the oil has reached 350ºF/180ºC. If you drop the chips in too soon, they could become soggy as they cook instead of crisp.

, Turn the chips after they’ve been in the oil for over 30 seconds, to brown each side.


Only drop two or three chips into the pot of oil at a time (depending on the size pot you are using). You want each chip to have room to fry and not stick to each other. The amount you can add may vary depending on the size of the pot you're using; just be sure to keep the frying chips separated.






Cook the chips until they're golden brown and the bubbling oil calms. Use chopsticks or tongs to handle frying chips.







, The towels will absorb any excess oil and allow your chips to set before you add salt or any other topping.


Once all of the chips have been fried and drained, transfer them to a large bowl. Toss with a few teaspoons of sea salt and a dash of pepper, tossing the chips around the bowl until each chip is delicately covered.

",How to Make Microwave Potato Chips," Start by cutting the potatoes in half lengthwise. Then, slice them into sections that are between 1/8th and 1/16th thick using a sharp kitchen knife, hand slicer or mandoline. Place the potato slices into a colander or strainer as you go.A single potato will be enough for a snack-sized portion. To have enough to share with others, use at least two large potatoes.
You can peel the potatoes before slicing them, if you prefer. Peeling is recommended if you’re using potatoes that aren’t as fresh, as you can remove eyes, discoloration and spoiled spots this way.;
, Turn on the tap and run a stream of cool water over the freshly-cut slices. The water may appear cloudy or dirty for the first few moments as dirt, starch and natural juices wash out of the potatoes. Continue rinsing until the water runs clear.Toss the potatoes in the colander to keep dirty water and sediment from becoming trapped at the bottom.

, Fill a large bowl with lukewarm water and drop in the rinsed potato slices. Give them 8-10 minutes to soak. This will help clean them more thoroughly while softening them up in preparation for cooking.Soaking the potato slices leeches out starch, which will make them cook up extra light and crispy.Having a higher water content will also make the potatoes less likely to scorch as they cook.

, Press the slices firmly between the layers to squeeze out excess moisture. There should be no visible water remaining on the outer surface of the slices. After drying the slices, lay them out side-by-side in even rows on the paper towels.Take care not to break the slices while you’re drying them manually.
Don’t let the potatoes get too dry. This may make them unpredictable while cooking. A simple pat-and-press will do.

, Pour a couple ounces of cooking oil into a small bowl. The exact type of oil you use is up to you—vegetable, canola, peanut or olive oil will all work just fine. Dip the tip of a basting brush into the oil and spread a small amount over the outside of each slice until they glisten.The addition of oil will crisp and brown the potatoes similar to frying.
Use an oil that has a high smoke point. Microwave heating is intense and direct, and can easily cause oils with low smoke points to burn., Grab a generous pinch of kosher salt and sprinkle it evenly over the top of the slices. Feel free to add whatever other spices or seasonings you’d like as well, such as cracked black pepper, seasoned salt, garlic salt or onion powder.Season to taste, using as much or as little of each spice as you wish.
Experiment with different combinations of seasonings to create your own flavored chip varieties.

, Transfer the slices to a spacious mixing bowl. Toss them lightly a few times using a circular motion. This will help the oil and seasonings coat the potato slices more thoroughly.You can also use a large Ziploc bag to shake the chips, oil and seasonings together.
Shake off excess oil before cooking the potatoes to keep from getting oversaturated., In order to cook the potatoes, you’ll have to microwave them in small batches. Place as many slices as you can fit in a single layer onto a plate or platter lined with paper towels. Make sure that each slice is lying flat and you’ve left a little space between them.Separating the slices will ensure that the heat will be distributed properly.
Microwave the chips on a bacon tray to cook out excess oil and bring the calorie count down a little., Microwave the first round of potatoes at 100% power between 2-4 minutes. Keep an eye on the slices to make sure they aren’t getting done too fast. They should brown slightly around the edges when they start to crisp up.You may not notice much of a change of appearance after the initial heating. This will just start to cook the potato.
Different microwaves heat differently. Depending on the intensity of your unit, your potato chips might not need a full 3 minutes at a time, or they may require a little longer. Watch them closely as they cook and use your best judgment to determine when they’re done.

, Remove the plate and carefully flip over each potato slice. Put them back in the microwave for another 2-4 minutes, this time at 50% power. Once the chips have begun to turn golden brown in the center, they’ll have a delightful crunchy texture.Continue microwaving in 3 minute intervals at 50% power until the chips are fully cooked.
Look for a consistent golden coloring throughout. Remove the chips from the heat before they burn or blacken.
When cooked with convection heat such as a microwave, potato chips need to brown in order to be crispy. Don’t be off-put by chips that come out a little darker, as this won’t affect their flavor., The potato slices will be extremely hot after two trips through the microwave. Let them sit for a few minutes before digging in. Once the chips have reached an edible temperature, throw them into a bowl big enough for everyone to grab a handful!


If you want, you can add another sprinkle of salt as the chips are cooling.

, Enjoy the potato chips while they’re still warm or have cooled to room temperature. If you have leftovers (which isn’t likely—they’re that addictive!), place them in a large lidded Tupperware container, or a gallon freezer bag with air squeezed out. The chips will stay crunchy for 2-3 days.Serve with rich French onion dip or hot, melty pimento cheese for an extra burst of flavor.

It's your choice., Mandolins set to the thinnest setting are always the best option, as you'll get perfectly even, thin chips. However, you can use a knife if you work slowly and carefully. The thinner the better.

, The salty water draws out moisture, which allows the potatoes to crisp up perfectly when cooked.

, Remove the sliced potatoes from the water and lay them on paper towels to dry. Pat the tops with more paper towels to fully dry them.

Lay's claims they only do a ""gentle peel,"" which leaves a bit of skin on some of the edges., If you have a mandolin, this will be much easier to do. Set the mandolin to a medium thickness and get slicing. If you are using a knife, slice as thinly as you can without endangering yourself. Aim for regularity over your top thinness -- if they are roughly the same thickness, they will all cook at the same rate.


Baked chips must be a bit thicker than their fried counterparts, so you don't need to go as thin as you possibly can.

, This step is necessary to pre-cook the starches, which allows you to bake the chips later and get them nice and crisp. If possible, use a metal strainer or sifter to boil the potatoes in, which you can carefully lift out with tongs once they chips have finished boiling, letting all the water drain away., You want a nice high cooking temperature to really crisp the edges. This is why your pre-boil -- the potatoes are already cooked when they go in the oven, allowing the high heat to simply crisp them up.

, Add the oil slowly, mixing the whole time, so that you only use enough for a thin coating on all the potatoes. Add the salt generously.

, Do not layer the chips -- they should not be touching each other as they cook. The parchment paper will prevent sticking, which can cause your chips to rip as you remove them later.

, You can flip them once, at about the 7-minute mark, to ensure that they cook equally. This isn't strictly necessary, though it can help for older ovens that may heat up somewhat unevenly., Add a touch more salt and enjoy once cooled.

, If you look closely at Lay's you'll see that they still have some bits of thin skin attached. That said, you want to remove as much skin as possible.

, If using a mandolin, set it to the thinnest possible setting and carefully shave the potatoes into paper thin slices. If you're using a knife, know that this thin isn't quite possible -- you'll need to cook them a little bit longer.

, Use a gallon-sized resealable bag and shake until all of the potatoes are well coated.


You do not need to dry the chips like the other methods, as microwaves use this moisture to actually cook the potato.

, Take this parchment paper and place it on a plate in the microwave. If desired, sprinkle with extra salt or a little bit of black pepper.

, These chips cook quickly, so be ready to remove them once finished. The final time depends on the microwave's strength, the number of chips, and the placement in the microwave, so keep a watchful eye.

, If they aren't brown at all, they won't get crispy. If they get too brown, they will quickly burn. Keep your eye on them and remove as the start to crisp up -- they will cook just a bit more as they cool, so go a little on the early side.

, Since the chips can't be overlapping, you can't cook too many of them at once. Remove the first batch, set aside to cool, and get another batch going."

Powder
Carob chips or drops
Bars;
, It might be as simple as your preference for the taste. One of the main reasons for preferring it over chocolate is that a person has allergies or unpleasant reactions to chocolate. Chocolate causes headaches and some other reactions in sensitive persons. In this case, carob can be substituted without the side effects of chocolate. Another reason is simply that carob adds its own taste dimension to food.

, Carob does not taste like chocolate, so don't expect miracles. However, carob can be used in some of the ways that we use chocolate (such as coating raisins, almonds etc.) and as explained above, you can use less or no sugar with carob. Here are some possible substitute ideas:


Use the powder instead of cocoa powder;
Use in place of hot chocolate powder (the sweetness and lack of dairy products is good for those with dietary restrictions);
Substitute carob chips for chocolate chips in cookie and ice cream recipes;
Use in a variety of baked goods in place of sugar. It will impart a slight brown colouring, as well as its own flavour but you can make the most of its fifty percent content of natural sugar to avoid added sugar content.

, Unlike chocolate, which is very dangerous for dogs, cats, and other pets, carob can be used in their treats without ill effect. Doggy chocs should really be doggy carob drops.

Research the nutritional significance of almond meal.,
Find recipes that use almond meal.,
Prepare your own almond meal.,
Buy almond meal from a health food store.,
Use almond meal as a thickening agent.,
Use almond meal as a flour substitute.,
Use almond meal as an additive in sweets and desserts.,
Use almond meal as a staple in a raw food diet.",How to Use Almond Meal," If you plan on using almond meal consistently in your kitchen, it is a good idea to learn about the health benefits and nutritional significance of almond meal. Many people jump on the bandwagon of a fad diet without thoroughly understanding the purpose of a particular diet or a particular food product. Individuals who do this may be missing out on the basic elements of a specific diet and may end up doing nothing positive for their overall health.


Almonds are considered to be a super food, and they have incredible health properties such as a high vitamin content, high protein levels and high antioxidant levels.
Almond meal is a great substitute for wheat flour because it doesn't have as many carbohydrates and it doesn't contain any gluten.;
, If you want to cook with almond meal you will need to find recipes that use almond meal effectively.


Many gluten free cookbooks or raw food diet cookbooks feature almond meal predominantly because it does not contain gluten and is made entirely out of whole almonds, an approved food on the raw food diet.
Recipe books can provide you with amazing suggestions for making the most out of your almond meal, and you will find that almond meal is an incredibly versatile food product.

, Individuals who want to ensure that theirs is extraordinarily fresh and wholesome can use a mill or a food processor to make their own almond meal. Because almond meal is simply made of almonds that are ground into a fine powder, anyone can create his or her own almond meal.


Simply fill a food processor or flour mill with whole, unsalted almonds. Pulverize the almonds until they have been reduced to a superfine powder.
If you have issues with the pulverized almonds clumping into a buttery consistency, try adding ½ cup of sugar for every 2 cups of almonds. The added sugar will absorb some of the moisture.
Grinding your almonds in a coffee grinder will also result in a powdery consistency rather than an oily, buttery consistency.

, If you don't want to take the time to create your own almond meal, you can find fresh and wholesome almond meal at your local health food store.


Because almond meal is made from whole almonds, it has a relatively short shelf life when not kept in the refrigerator. It is important to carefully evaluate the date on which the almond meal was made to ensure that you are buying the freshest product.
Almond meal purchased from a store can be kept in a refrigerator for several weeks.

, One of the easiest ways to use almond meal is as a thickening agent in soups and stews.


Instead of adding flour or cornstarch to a soup or stew to thicken it up and make it heartier, several spoonfuls of almond meal can have the same effect without any of the adverse health effects.
Almonds have a very subtle flavor, so the almond meal won't negatively affect the flavor of the dish you are preparing.

, Some individuals have found success using almond meal as a flour substitute. However, almond meal does not have the same chemical properties as wheat flour.


In order to get the same results when cooking with almond meal, the meal generally must be combined with other flour substitutes in a mixture. Common substitutes include potato flour and rice flour with the addition of xanthan gum. Xanthan gum is a sticky substance that replaces the gluten found in wheat flours.
Keeping almond meal on hand will ensure that you are prepared to make a gluten-free baked item at a moment's notice.

, One of the best ways to use almond meal is as an additive in desserts and smoothies. Because almonds are nutty and slightly sweet, they make a perfect addition to an already sweet menu item.


You can add a half a cup of almond meal to a smoothie to give it a rich, nutty flavor.
Almond meal can also be sprinkled on cookies or incorporated into ice cream for a deliciously original spin on a variety of classic desserts.

, Almond meal is very popular as a food item in the raw food diet. This diet strives to eliminate processed foods in favor of whole, raw foods like fresh fruits and vegetables.

Go for oven-baked chips.,
Select healthy tortilla chips.,
Try Pop Chips.,
Select bean chips.,
Look into high-protein chips.",How to Choose Healthier Chips1," In general, oven-baked chips are better than chips that have been fried. When you're considering potato chips at the store, look for those labeled ""oven-baked."" These are generally lower in calories and fat.Lays oven baked potato chips only have 120 calories per serving.
Kettle baked potato chips are also generally healthier, and only have three ingredients: potatoes, oil, and sea salt.;
, Tortilla chips are another option. While some people feel they're healthier than potato chips in general, the health drawbacks and benefits are generally the same.However, if you prefer the taste of tortilla chips, seek out varieties that are lower in calories and fat.If you like foods like Doritos, opt for Guiltless Gourmet chipotle tortilla chips. They have a similar taste but are lower in calories.

, Pop Chips are a very popular, relatively healthy low calorie type of chip. Pop Chips are sold in most grocery stores and come in a variety of flavors. They have a crunchy feel, much like regular potato chips, but have the same flavor and calorie content of baked chips., Some chips are made with rice and beans. These types of chips contain some vitamins and nutrients, as well as protein and fiber. These chips are also generally gluten-free and may be vegan., Look for chips labeled as being high in protein, such as Simply Protein potato chips. These chips are high in protein, but also generally low in calories. This makes for a more well-balanced snack that will keep you full longer."
"
Read the nutrition label.,
Watch out for processed vegetable oils.,
Keep an eye on fat content.,
Avoid high-calorie chips.",How to Choose Healthier Chips2," Always read a label carefully before purchasing a potato chip. You want to avoid potato chips that are filled with unhealthy additives and ingredients.In general, the less ingredients you see, the better. A lot of additives may indicate a less healthy chip.
If sugar is listed as the first or second ingredient, opt for a healthier chip.
Go for chips made out of whole grains over processed grains.

, Hydrogenated oils and shortenings are generally an indication a chip is not the healthiest. These foods are high in saturated fat, which is bad for heart health. Skip chips with hefty lists of oils and shortenings as main ingredients., Many brands of chips are 57% fat or greater. These chips should generally be avoided, as they're not good for you. Instead, opt for chips with 8 grams of fat or less.You can find information about a chip's fat content on the nutritional label.

, In general, calories count. When it comes to losing weight, or maintaining a healthy weight, too many calories can lead to weight gain. Many chips have less than 200 calories per serving. Opt for these types of chips over chips with a higher calorie content."
"
Choose healthier sides when possible.,
Look at the serving size.,
Control your portion sizes.,
Satisfy cravings with popcorn instead of chips.",How to Choose Healthier Chips3," When eating out, skip the chips as a side once in awhile. When you're at a restaurant, you don't always have control of the types of chips you're consuming. Ask for a healthier side instead.For example, you can order a side salad, grilled vegetables, or mixed fruit. Even something like a light soup would generally be better than chips.

, While some chips boast only 140 calories per serving, you should always look at the nutritional label for the serving size. A bag of chips may only have 140 calories per serving, but the whole bag may be two servings. Be careful of deceitful labeling when purchasing chips., Watch out for portion sizes, especially when eating out. It's easy to overindulge if you're not paying attention to portions. When eating out, always ask for small servings of chips over large ones.Eat chips from a bowl instead of straight out of the bag. This will help you keep track of how much you're eating.

, Popcorn is a grain. It's generally healthier and lower in calories than chips. If you want a snack, opt for a bowl of popcorn over a bowl of chips.The healthiest type of popcorn is made on the stovetop at home, with kernels and oil. Processed popcorn or microwave popcorn are generally less healthy.
Minimize your use of toppings — a light layer of salt and butter or coconut oil is all you need.

Spread the walnuts out flat.,
Toast the walnuts until browned.,
Remove the walnuts and allow them to cool.",How to Toast Walnuts1," Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Non-stick cooking spray will also work.;
, Ideally, the shelled walnuts will be divided into halves or quarters. Whole walnuts may not toast evenly, while pieces smaller than quarters may toast too quickly and burn as a result. The walnuts should be in a single layer to ensure even cooking.

, At this temperature, the walnuts should only need to bake for 5 to 10 minutes, especially if they are in smaller pieces. Check the walnuts after the first 5 minutes to make sure that they have not started to burn. You can even stir them with a heat-resistant spatula to improve even browning.

, Once the walnuts smell toasted, they are done. Remove them from the oven and transfer them to a heat-resistant bowl until they cool. Enjoy them warm or at room temperature, but you should at least wait until they are no longer burning hot to the touch.

Ask guests to dress in clothing suited to 1912 or near that era.",How to Throw a Titanic Party1," Look for designs including cruise ships, anchors, seascapes, and so forth. You could also consider designing invitations that resemble tickets or boarding passes. Check out Etsy or Zazzle for original designs. To add a personal touch, use greeting card software or online templates that allow you to get creative. You can find free customizable templates at https://www.greetingsisland.com.;
, Documents from 1912 show that cursive handwriting was more common than it is today.You can reproduce this with popular fonts, such as Edwardian Script ITC or Lucida Handwriting (both available on Microsoft Word). Certain applications offer different font selections. Stick to typefaces that guests with vision problems will find readable and large enough to see.

, Women's clothing emphasized length and straight posture.Formal attire for men was similar to today's long-tail tuxedos and trousers.Don't be too fussy, since it can be hard to find affordable costumes from that era.


Women can tie their hair up in a bun.

Heat a large skillet.,
Pour the walnuts into the pan.,
Stir frequently.,
Cook until browned.,
Remove from heat.",How to Toast Walnuts2," Place the skillet on the stove burner and heat it over medium-high heat. You need to use a dry heat, since the fat and oils in the walnuts will be enough to toast them. As such, you should not use non-stick cooking spray, oil, or butter in the pan.

, The shelled walnuts will toast best if divided into halves or quarters, but since it is easier to monitor the toasting process on the stovetop, you can also use smaller pieces if desired. Try to keep the walnuts on a single layer to promote even toasting.

, Stirring the walnuts allows each one to be exposed to the heat for an equal amount of time and, as a result, you will get more evenly toasted walnuts and find fewer burnt nuts. Stirring constantly is best, but you can allow the nuts to rest for brief periods as long as you still have an eye on them.

, The process should only take about 5 minutes, but may go even faster if you have small pieces. Once done, the walnuts will be a deeper shade of brown and will smell toasted.

, Immediately transfer the nuts out of the pan once done. Otherwise, they will continue to cook on the hot metal. Transfer them to a heat-resistant bowl or dish and let them cool until they reach your desired serving temperature.

Place the walnuts into a microwavable glass bowl.,
Microwave on high for 1 minute.,
Cook the walnuts for another minute on high.,
Microwave in 20 second intervals as needed.,
Let the walnuts cool slightly before serving.",How to Toast Walnuts3," A microwave-safe pie dish works well, but any dish marked safe for microwave use will be adequate. Only add enough walnuts to cover the bottom of the dish in a single layer. Keep the walnuts in halves or quarters to ensure the best possible toast.

, Check the walnuts to make sure that none have burned. Stir them using a heat-resistant spatula to make sure that each nut is getting cooked evenly. If your microwave does not have a rotating tray, turn the dish 180 degrees before continuing.

, Smell them to see if they have finished cooking. If done in the microwave, walnuts will not brown, but the toasted smell should still come through.

, This will not usually be necessary after the first 2 minutes of cooking, but it might prove useful if the halves are especially large.

, Eating them directly out of the microwave could cause you to burn your mouth.

Inspect the shell for cracks and holes.While it might be tempting to select walnuts with cracks in the shell to make it easier to peel the shell away after cooking, shells with cracks or holes in them do not offer much protection for the kernel inside, and as a result, there is a higher chance that the walnuts will have gone rancid or will have lost some of their original flavor.,
Rinse the walnuts.,
Cut a small ""x"" into the shell.",How to Toast Walnuts4,", Even though the heat will likely kill off most of the contaminants on the walnut shell, starting off with clean walnuts is always more sanitary. Clean the walnuts by rinsing them under warm running water. If you notice any stuck-on dirt, gently scrub the walnut shell with a vegetable brush. Allow the nuts to air dry before toasting., Using a sharp, serrated knife, cut a small ""x"" onto one side of the walnut. One of the main reasons that people typically remove the shell before toasting the walnut is because the shell is a little harder to remove after it is heated. To make it easier to peel the shell, cut an ""x"" into it before you begin toasting."
"
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius).Prepare a baking sheet by covering it with a sheet of nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper.,
Spread the walnuts out in a single layer on the baking sheet.,
Bake the walnuts for 10 minutes.,
Stir the nuts at the halfway point.",How to Toast Walnuts5,", In order to make sure that the walnuts toast evenly, you should keep them all in a single layer rather than allowing them to pile up. The nuts will also benefit from being spaced slightly apart, but they will still toast even if they are touching. For best results, position the nuts so that the ""x"" marked on the shell faces up. The mark does not need to be completely upright, but it should not be covered by the baking sheet or by other nuts., The nuts should continue toasting until they become fragrant and take on a slightly darker hue. The shell should also begin to turn up slightly where the ""x"" is at. You might need to cook the walnuts for as long as 15 minutes, but they generally toast a little faster in-shell, so 10 minutes is often enough., It is not necessary, but stirring the nuts will help ensure even and thorough cooking. Use a spatula, as the nuts and baking sheet will be too hot to touch by hand. Make sure that the ""x"" on each shell can still be seen and is not covered."

Make a boardwalk for the entrance to your party.,
Add paper waves around the boardwalk.,
Make life preservers.,
Make portholes.",How to Throw a Titanic Party2," Corrugated cardboard, especially from an old box, is a good inexpensive choice.


Tape several pieces together if one piece is not long enough. Cover the finished boardwalk with white contact paper.

, This will give the setting a more realistic feel. You can use white paper colored with blue markers or blue construction paper. Use scissors to cut out the wave pattern.

, You can attach them to a piece of rope to hang on the back of your sofa or dining room chairs. Inexpensive polystyrene rings from the local craft shop are a good choice as a first step.


Use red markers to draw solid red rectangles at the top, bottom, left, and right of the ring. Alternatively, you can wrap strips of red fabric around the ring at these spots. The finished design should look like a cross.
Using lettering stencils and a blue marker, write ""R.M.S. Titanic"" across the top and ""Southampton""across the bottom. The lettering should be on the face of the ring.
Glue or tape a piece of rope to the outside of the ring at the edge of each red area. Make sure the rope hangs freely in the areas between the areas of red.

, Decorate half of the portholes with pictures of a calm ocean. Use pictures of icebergs and choppy seas for the other half. Hang the portholes on the wall using a putty adhesive, which won't damage your walls.


Paper plates with the centers cut out of them work well for this decoration.Glue old metal nuts or ring-shaped cereal to accent the frame.
Color with silver or gold paint or markers.
Apply clear plastic to each plate to act as the porthole's window.

Add the walnuts to the pan.,
Stir the nuts frequently.,
Remove the nuts from the heat after 10 minutes.",How to Toast Walnuts6," Allow it to warm up for five minutes or so to ensure that it is appropriately hot. Do not use oil or cooking spray, since the nuts themselves contain enough oil to cook. It would be beneficial to use a non-stick skillet, however., The nuts should only be cooked on a single layer, and it is not recommended to toast a large batch that forms a multi-layer pile. It is generally a good idea to start with the ""x"" facing upward on as many of the nuts as possible, but it is not essential, since the walnuts will not stay in the same position for long., After the first minute or two, begin stirring the nuts. They can rest for 30 second intervals or so, but for the most part, the nuts should be stirred continuously to ensure even and thorough toasting. Use a heat-resistant spatula., The process may take a little longer or a little shorter depending on how hot the heating elements in your stovetop make the pan. Once the nuts begin browning and become very fragrant, they are ready to be pulled off. You should also dump them out of the pan since they will continue cooking there even after it has been removed from the heat."

Fill a microwave-safe pie plate with a single layer of walnuts.,
Cook the nuts in 1 minute intervals until done.,
Stir the walnuts in between intervals.",How to Toast Walnuts7," Any microwave-safe plate will work, but a pie plate is especially useful since it has raised sides. Keep the nuts to a single layer for even toasting and make sure that the ""x"" marking made in the shell is not covered by other nuts or facing the bottom of the dish., The walnuts should be cooked on full power, and it will usually take several intervals before they finish toasting. The shells will not deepen in color like they do when toasted in the oven or on the stove, but they will become fragrant and the shell should begin to peel slightly at the cut part of the ""x."", Stirring the nuts allows them to toast evenly. Keep as many “x” marks showing even after you stir the nuts, but if the marks become covered, the nuts should still toast without much problem."
"
Allow the nuts to cool slightly.,
Peel back the corners of the ""x."",
Use a nutcracker only if necessary.,
Rub the walnuts with a towel.You can either use a clean dish towel or paper towel.,
Serve warm.",How to Toast Walnuts8," Toasted walnuts taste best when served warm, so you should not let them cool to room temperature. They will be hot after you finish toasting them, though, and handling them immediately can lead to burns. Wait until the nuts have cooled just enough to comfortably hold in your hand., The shell should have begun peeling up slightly at the ""x"" mark as the walnuts toasted. Use your fingers to grip the corners and forcefully peel the softened shell off. The shell may still pose some problem, but it can usually be worked off with only your fingers., If the shell is still too hard to peel away, gently crack it using a nutcracker as though the nut were still raw. Apply pressure carefully, though, since toasted walnuts tend to be a little softer than raw walnuts and will break apart more easily., Rub the towel over the nuts using small yet rapid strokes to remove the bitter skins., You can also store the toasted nuts in the refrigerator or freezer if necessary, but most people prefer the taste of warm toasted walnuts over cold walnuts."

If you’d rather have an evening pool party when it’s not as hot outside, any day of the week could work.
If you live in an area where rain is frequent, consider setting an alternate “rain date” for your party. This way, guests will know what to expect if it rains on the party day, and you can still have your party later.;
, If you have a pool at your house, you can host your party at home. Otherwise, you’ll want to look into local neighborhood pools and exercise facilities.


Inquire about parties well in advance of when you’d like to have your party.
Different pools require reservations and party fees. Depending on the facility, you may be able to rent the entire pool or just host your party during normal pool hours.

, Make sure to send them out at least a week in advance.


Use cute water-themed phrases in your invitations. Say something like: “Dive in for a night of fun with us at our summer pool party!”
If you can hand-deliver your invitations, consider giving out a “message in a bottle.”Roll up your invitations, and place them in clear plastic bottles. You can even add a bit of sand or seashells to the bottom of the bottles for extra beach flair.
If you’re inviting a lot of kids to the party, make sure to include their parents, as well. At a pool party, you want to have as much supervision as possible for maximum safety.

, Possible themes include:


“Luau”: Give all of your guests flower leis, and encourage everyone to dress up Hawaiian style. Decorate with tiki torches, and play Hawaiian music.
“Patriotic Party”: If you live in the U.S., and it’s close to July 4, you might want to make your pool party a patriotic one. Decorate with flags and red, white, and blue.
“Surf’s Up”: Throw a classic beach bash. Decorate with surfboard images, and play music like the Beach Boys. Place seashells around your tables for an added nautical touch.

, When you’re planning a pool party, make sure to have plenty of pool supplies that guests can use and enjoy.


Practically, have extra sunblock on hand, and some extra sunglass, since it will most likely be bright outside. Also, have a few extra towels, in case someone forgets to bring one.
Even if you plan on having other drinks, make sure to have cold water available to party guests who get overheated.
You can also have an array of pool noodles and rafts for guests to float around on. Encourage guests to bring their own, as well.

,


To play Marco Polo, one person starts out as “it.” This person counts to 10, and everyone else scatters around the pool. The person who is “it” plays with their eyes closed. Every time they shout, “Marco!” everyone else must answer back, “Polo!” The person who is “it” tries to catch someone who says “Polo!” Whoever gets tagged then becomes the next person who is “it.”
In the game of Sharks and Minnows, one player begins as the shark, and the rest of the players are minnows.The shark starts on the opposite side of the pool as the minnows. To begin the game, the shark says, “Sharks and minnows, one two three, fishies, fishies swim to me!” The minnows try to swim to the other side of the pool. If the shark tags them before they touch the opposite side of the pool, then they become another shark in the next round. This continues until there is only one minnow left.

, For a more freeform and fun game, have an ongoing water fight with all of your pool party guests.


Before the party, fill up water balloons, and set them out in large buckets.
If you have them, set out water squirters, and encourage guests to bring their own to the party.
To make it more fun for everyone, have plastic bracelets or necklaces in varying colors. Have one color, such as red, for people to wear if they absolutely do not want to be a part of the water fight. This way, those who want to avoid being splashed can do so.

,


If you don’t have a net, you can simply volley the ball back-and-forth. If you’re ambitious, you can even make your own pool volleyball net set up.Either use a volleyball meant for the water or an inflatable beach ball.

,


Set out a plate of fresh fruit like watermelon, pineapple, and berries.
Have plenty of tortilla chips with fresh salsa or guacamole.Serve cut vegetables with dips.
Have cucumber sandwiches for another bite-sized treat. You can even cut them into the shape of fish.

,


Cook burgers, hot dogs, or vegetarian burgers.
You can also grill seasonal vegetables like corn on the cob.
Prepare sides like pasta salad ahead of the party.

, Since it’s hot, it’s a great idea to have cold treats at your party. If you don’t have a freezer nearby, have coolers stocked with ice to keep them cool.


Serve individual containers of ice cream and popsicles.
For a healthier option, you can also freeze fruit, such as grapes.

, For the adults, you can serve summer cocktails like strawberry daiquiris, pina coladas, mojitos, and hurricanes.For kids and adults who don’t want alcohol, you can serve lemonade, iced tea, and fruit punch.
Provide a permanent marker so guests can write their names on their cups.

See guests off as they leave.",How to Throw a Tea Party," Choose a date and time for your tea party, ideally a week or two in advance so that those invited will have time to work the event into their schedules. Weekend afternoons are great for tea parties, as most people are off from work and looking for leisurely activities. A tea party in the afternoon will also serve nicely as midday refreshment.


Schedule the event around holidays and big events so that more of the invited guests will be free to attend.;
, Make a list of people you want to invite and address a special invitation to each one individually. Get creative with your invitations: rather than simply sending a plain card with the time and date, cut colorful cardstock into the shape of tea pots, or mail the invitations in floral envelopes with fragrant tea bags inside.A single invitation will suffice if you’re inviting multiple people from the same household.
Specify on the invitation if any refreshments aside from tea are to be served. You want your guests to bring an appetite!

, If you’re hosting the tea party at your own home, set aside a space to be the designated seating area. An outdoor garden will do wonderfully for this purpose if it’s roomy enough, or you could set a table on your patio or just inside in your kitchen.Assuming the weather is hospitable enough, consider having a picnic style tea party out on the lawn.
If you’re holding a tea party indoors, make sure the blinds are open and the windows are up to let in the afternoon sunshine.

, In addition to tea, you might wish to serve food to your guests. These should be simple choices that aren’t too filling, like cookies and other sweet confections that complement the tea, or small finger sandwiches to stave off your guests’ hunger. Put together a rough draft of your menu and start thinking about how best to start preparing food and beverages before the event.Some good lighter fare to serve with tea could include:

Tea cookies or crackers

Biscuits with butter and jam

Baked brie with fruit
Chicken salad with sliced bread
Small cakes or petit fours


Crustless sandwiches with cucumber, salmon, spreads and other light ingredients



, Once you’ve settled on an area to use for your tea party, begin decorating to make the space more festive. You can hang streamers, put out flowers and other greenery or break out the fine china that you’ve been saving for a special occasion. Fixing up the venue where your tea party is to be held can really liven things up and make sure that your guests feel comfortable and at ease.Decide on a loose theme for your tea party and stick to it. It doesn’t have to be complicated—a design scheme as basic as stripes, chevron or floral patterns, or light pastel colors in the hotter months, will help keep your decor attractive and consistent.
Make a checklist of everything you think you’ll need so that you don’t forget anything important: place mats, linens, silver, tea cups, saucers, drinking glasses, plates, centerpiece decorations, candles, etc., The dining table should be set prior to the arrival of your guests. Make the table presentable by first draping it in a table cloth—white or another light shade will work best for afternoon tea. Each place setting should consist of a plate for the foods you've prepared, a cup and saucer for tea in the upper right corner of each setting, linens and silverware to the left of the lunch plate, and all condiments, serving platters and other fixtures ranging the table above the place settings. You'll bring the tea and coffee in on a tray once it's time for it to be served, so save the center of the table for this purpose.Use dishes sized for smaller portions (such as bread or salad plates) at each place settings, as afternoon tea should be light refreshment rather than a full meal.Avoid setting the table with scented candles or bringing in additional scents, with the exception of fresh flowers. The fragrance at the dining table should come from the food and tea.

, Dishes like cheese platters or chicken salad can be made ahead of time and refrigerated until time for the event. This will save you the trouble of trying to keep too many steps coordinated once it’s time for guests to start showing up. A day or two before the party, get basic items ready and keep them on ice.Sandwich and fruit trays, pasta salad and other light fare can be bought or whipped up quickly and chilled until they’re ready to be served.

, If any of the refreshments you’re planning need to be fresh (if you intend to do any baking, for instance), make sure that you time their preparation so that they’re finished by the morning of the tea party. With the basic food items out of the way, you can concentrate on any time-consuming tasks like baking, marinating, slicing or searing that need to be taken care of. The last thing you want is for your doorbell to ring while you still have two dozen muffins in the oven.


Don’t overdo it. While it can be fun to come up with wild ideas for what you’d like to serve at a tea party, a simple menu is always best. Formulate your foods around the tea and keep it simple.

, Take a sampling approach to serving the tea, and give your company a wide variety of teas to try. Stock up on loose leaf tea, as it's the freshest and most flavorful. Have the tea brewed, strained and heated in the kitchen to bring out once everyone is present and seated. You might also provide guests with separate infusers and have hot water ready so that they may each have their individual preference. Guests may be served tea in turn, or the components can be brought out and placed in the center of the table along with the food so that they have the opportunity to serve themselves at their leisure.Pair your teas with the food to enhance their enjoyment. For instance, foods like biscuits and cheeses with more uniform flavors will pair well with light and zesty teas, while rich, savory appetizers can be offset by complex blended teas.For guests who would prefer a different type of beverage, you might also serve coffee, hot chocolate, fruit punches, iced tea or even wine or champagne for celebratory occasions., When your guests show up, everything should be ready and waiting for them in the seating area. This way, they only have to sit down and join in the revelry, rather than standing around waiting for the table to be set or tea to be brewed. Get all major decorating and cooking done the night before, and finish setting up first thing in the morning. Aim to have everything in place and ready to serve before the first knock on your door.Make sure you have an accurate estimate of how many guests to expect so that there is a place for everyone at the table.
Have the water heated for tea, but wait until all guests have been seated to begin serving it. Don’t forget condiments like milk, sugar and honey!, As your guests begin to arrive, be ready to meet them at the door and invite them in. Show them to the area you’ve set up for the tea party and introduce them to other guests with whom they are not yet acquainted. Encourage them to begin sampling the refreshments while the rest of the party trickles in. As the host, yours should be the first face that the guests see when the door opens.Be courteous and thank your guests for coming. Electing to spend their free time attending your party shows that they value your friendship.
Offer to take coats, purses and umbrellas and have a place set aside to keep them., If you have guests at your party that have never been in your home, give them a brief tour, ending where tea and refreshments are to be served. Point out each item on the table and explain how the refreshments you’re serving were made and what they contain. Your guests will be impressed by the level of detail and organization that you’ve put into throwing your tea party.


Answer any questions your guests have and accept compliments modestly. You probably stand to receive quite a bit of adulation for all the work you’ve done!

, While your company is taking their tea, make yourself available to accommodate any requests that they may have. Refill water glasses and tea cups, offer seconds and clear dirty dishes off the table. Try to make it so that no guest has to lift a finger to serve themselves or help clean up. Part of being a good host is seeing to the needs of the invited in every possible capacity.Though you’ll undoubtedly be kept busy, make sure you have time to eat and entertain your company yourself.

, As the gathering draws to a close and guests begin to tire, show them to the door yourself. Thank them again for coming and invite them to return for another tea party or luncheon soon. Send them off with a parting gift or leftovers, if applicable. A successful gathering will strengthen the social bond between you and your guests and leave them feeling invigorated.Prepare small gift baskets containing candles, confections or samples of tea that each guest can take with them when they leave.If you really want to go the extra mile, mail out thank you cards for everyone who showed up for your tea party."

Advertising.,
Start your party.,
Problems: Belligerent individuals.",How to Throw a Keg Party," Ideally, there will be a place where parties are most acceptable in the area, so locations will already be narrowed down for you. In any case, there are several factors to think about when deciding whether a house is suitable:


Size of party space in square feet (basement, etc).
Proximity to campus, this should eliminate any possibilities of DUIs, everyone should be walking.
Bathroom locations, window locations, entrances (an entrance from the back yard, directly into the basement, and a bathroom in the basement is ideal)
House layout and flow.
Strength of walls in party spaces and ability to withstand damage.
Neighbors
Seclusion factor
Landlord
Nearest Police Station, just in case things get out of hand and you need help.
Basement drain.
Central Air Conditioning (nice to have).
""DJ Booth"" location (should be inaccessible to guests).;
, Preparing the house is something which can save you time and money. It cuts down on theft, damage to property and unwanted guests (police, campus officials, undercover cops, hookers, drug dealers, etc).


All rooms which are not party space should have pad locks installed, this includes the ""DJ Booth"" if you are using a room for that purpose. This especially references bedrooms and bathrooms which you do not want guests using. These keys should be kept on your person for the duration of the party. DO NOT give special treatment to any guest (ie: to use the extra bathroom because the line is too long), you will regret it. Do not give in to women who try to get you to give them special treatment, everyone will want to use the clean bathroom next. If guests nag too much for access to the rooms, give the keys to a neighbor or trusted friend who is not attending your party.
Anything which you would mind having stolen, broken, or destroyed should be moved into a locked room. Anything which someone could injure themselves on, or use as a weapon, should also be moved.
Make the most of your space by removing any junk that has accumulated in your house and basement. Do a very thorough cleaning. If a body could fit there, move the item, or throw it out.
Rearrange furniture, etc. You want to maximize flow, so there are minimal bottle necks in the house.
Steps which could be slippery when covered in beer should have traction tape put on them to prevent any injuries.
Ideally the flooring for your party space will be cement, tile, or older hardwood (to be stained the beer color of your choice). If you are stuck with wall-to-wall carpet, and hope to get your security deposit returned, you should cover it with two layers of plastic tarp and then a few planks of particle board and an old couch or two to weigh it down. Any mobile carpet should be rolled up against a wall.
All windows which can be seen from the street should have thick drapes, or be covered in black garbage bags. You should ensure that your house looks completely pitch black, and sounds the same. Under no condition should these windows ever be open during a party no matter what temperature the house is. Put locks on them too, if necessary. Police should notice nothing, even if neighbors complain. Eventually the police may stop coming because they think the neighbors are making fake complaints. They will be confused as to which house the call was made about. Ninety percent of the time they will leave, unless you give them cause to stay. They may pass by as many as three times, they may do ""surveillance"" at the end of the street, they may be in an unmarked car. At this point, you are on lock down. Turn the music down, and lock the front door. No one goes out, or comes in. Send a scout out the back door to wander around the block to see if they've really left.
All doorways exposed to the street should also have a curtain installed within 3 feet (0.9 m) of the door itself. This assures that even if the door is open, police will not be able to see alcohol containers.
If you live in an area where the police are clever and actually care about this kind of thing (after all, they are worried about real crimes) buy a police radio. Some of the more expensive models will actually tell you how far away the transmissions are coming from.
Watch for unmarked cars at the end of streets and undercover officers. If you need to, check for university IDs at the door so that you know who is coming in.
If you have Central Air Conditioning, consider yourself lucky. Otherwise, select a single window which is the most adequate to pump air into the house. Ideally this will be a small basement window. Buy a fan appropriate for your needs and hang it in front of the window. If the window is street side, cover it, or paint it black. Place cheaper fans in the house to circulate the air from the window. Consider buying an industrial fan or air conditioner if you still have problems.
Most furnaces have fan test switches where it will circulate air through the house without heating it. This does help, but keep in mind to turn it off after you are done because it is hard on the furnace.
You should drop the temperature in your venue two hours before the party is scheduled to begin. If it is winter, the furnace should be shut off (you still might require fans or air conditioning).
Make sure there is adequate toilet paper (multiple rolls). Make sure you have your TP in some sort of dispenser, or it will simply fall in the muck and get ruined. If you do not have a sink, provide handy wipes. Remove from the bathroom everything which isn't needed.
You should have several forty gallon garbage cans in various places throughout the venue. They should be double bagged with commercial fifty gallon bags. Ash trays are another great addition.
Add lighting and decorations. Street signs, fire hydrants, alcohol paraphernalia, can collections, pools full of jello, pool tables, beer pong tables, beer funnels, disco dance floors, disco balls, stripper poles,Christmas lights, couches, bars, dance cages, black lights, posters, whatever floats your boat.
Wire the house for sound. Ideally you want to place speakers in a fashion which creates an area for people to dance while immersed in sound but so that the sound has to travel a distance, through something, or bounce off of something before it travels out the front of the house to the street. Rear of the house, in the basement, is best. If you do this right, you shouldn't be able to hear any sound on the street. You don't need anything extremely expensive or elaborate. A good 5.1 surround sound system will work just fine. Mount the speakers to the walls or ceilings. Wire the inputs to a computer or even an iPod in a bedroom (it's important that guests not be able to access it). Drunk people don't really care about superb sound quality. In fact, its better to have a sound system that can only get so loud, this is in case someone gets access to the volume controls. It's a proven fact that the louder the music is, the more people drink. This is because loud music is extremely uncomfortable and people have to do something to deaden the pain. Since you are not charging for individual drinks, obscenely loud music would be counter-productive to your goals.
If you've opted for cans, you need to prepare the refrigerator and bar area. A few hours prior to your party, clear as much of the refrigerator and freezer (turn the temperature down) as possible, fill it full of beer cans and pile the cases in the backyard, or dumpster. Don't put more beer in the refrigerator then you will use, however(as the beer is consumed, you'll be putting more beer in anyway). Block off the kitchen by putting wooden crates in the doorway and make a makeshift bar. For some reason drunk people congregate in kitchens, so it's imperative that you block it off from guests.
Get a cash box and change. Stash it in a bedroom or locked closet, or safe. This is where the cash for the next party will end up.
Alternative drink preparation. Buy an athletic drink cooler. You should prepare some sort of mixed drink a few hours before the party starts. Usually lemonade and vodka works well, and is cheap enough. Grain alcohol will probably give you more for your buck if you can get hold of it. In any case, make sure you have enough cups on hand. Stash the mixed drinks with the beer behind the bar so you can still cut people off when things begin to get out of control.
Offer non-alcoholic beverages. This may seem stupid, but sometimes, you will even have occurrences of drunk people drinking things like canola oil and thinking they are something else. Have of bottled beverages or fruit juice to help hydrate your guests. Always have water and vitamin b12 on hand. It can prevent people from getting sick in your house and also makes youngsters not old enough to drink feel welcome.

, Creating a play list is a job in its own regard. Unless you are throwing a theme party, you will most likely be playing lots of rap, hip hop and possibly some eighties music. If you don't normally listen to this sort of thing all the time, you can look at billboard.com for the most popular songs. It's also important to keep your play list fresh. Live performances can be a good change of pace, but there are trade-offs, since they tend to take up a lot of space and tend to be louder. In any case, never let a DJ or band take control over your party, never.

,


Kegs

Advantages:

A lot of beer.
Ability to do the infamous keg stand.
Sometimes cheaper then alternatives.
Cuts down on theft of beer. Minimal supervision.


Disadvantages:

Tagged and traceable by police in many jurisdictions, rendering this option useless in those cases.
People tend to over pump, a lot of beer is lost in foam (unless managed properly).
Tap Problems, rental fees, etc.
Extremely heavy.
Damages the house.
Cannot be stored for long periods of time at room temperature.
Requires much ice to keep cold.
Requires cups.
Empty kegs are often prone to theft, as many opportunistic individuals will steal them for their deposit value (often upwards of $30).




Cans

Advantages:

Doesn't require you to buy cups.
Numerous and in wide variety.
Warm cans can be stored at room temperature for long periods of time.
The cheapest beers are sold in cans.
You can cut off people who do not know their limit, far more easily.
Safe, in terms of roofies, etc.


Disadvantages:

Creates an obscene amount of trash.
Leaves you open to theft of beer (unless managed properly).
Requires a bar and bar tenders to manage properly.
Requires ice, or refrigerator rotation.




Bottles can be used as weapons and therefore should not be purchased at all (except for a private stash of good beer).
Unless your party has over two hundred guests, cans are usually the way to go. A kegerator behind a bar that's managed properly is the ultimate, but otherwise forget it. If you have the room and have a junk fridge, that could also work. The biggest advantage to cans over kegs is the fact that leftover cans can be kept for your next party, a half empty keg, cannot (unless you have a kegerator). You do not have to bother predicting how many people will come. You can never buy too many cans, since they will just be used some other time if you have leftovers. In addition, if you can find a way to get ""broken cases,"" directly from a brewery, you will be paying less per case.
When determining what type of beer to purchase, shop around. Find every distributor in your area and find out their prices, specials, and closing times (in case you have to buy more beer mid-party). Take advantage of this knowledge. Usually local breweries provide the best cost advantage as does buying from wholesale. Usually wholesale does not advertise that they sell to the public, and requires cash purchases. Attempt to buy from wholesale though, it's worth it. In addition, make sure you do your math and make sure that the twenty four pack is cheaper per can than the 30 pack. Most people will drink whatever you give them (there are some exceptions to this rule, however), but whatever you do, do not purchase a wide variety (unless you are trying to make your party look BYOB) as people will think they have a choice, and the beer line will be longer and slower.
If you choose kegs, estimate the number of people who are coming to determine how many kegs you will need. One keg will usually allow about thirty to forty people to drink throughout the night (more or less). Also think about lines - the more kegs, the smaller the lines will be and the more fun people will have. Make sure you get the keg the day of the party so it is cold. If you have to pick it up in the morning, find a box, or buy a container made for this purpose, and fill it with ice to keep it cool!
A week in advance, find a local beverage store and reserve your kegs. Kegs usually have a cost plus a deposit.

, Advertising is important. Don't be worried if your first party is an absolute flop. Your reputation will get better and better with each party you throw, except for with the people who think that drinking parties are lame. Your situation will determine what you can get away with in terms of advertising. You should begin your advertising at least a week in advance (which is usually a few days after your last party ended). Keep in mind that people never want to be the first ones at the party, don't be surprised if your party actually starts an hour later then advertised.

Scream and yell. Go through the dorms and popular areas on campus and tell people about your party.
Desk Aides. Take advantage of this high traffic area. Desk Aides see more people then anyone and can tell people about your party or hand out flyers.
Flyers. Flyers are by far the most successful method. Using this method you can achieve some level of control over the types of people who show up at your parties. Simply get someone to sign you into the dormitories (usually someone from your last party) and slip flyers under the doors. There are some basic rules you should observe, however.

DO NOT UNDER ANY CONDITION suggest, or imply that there is alcohol at your party. People can figure that there is alcohol at your party for themselves.
Don't name the names of the hosts or anything. Simply, ""Party at the brown house"" will do just fine once your reputation has caught up to speed, until then simply mention directions.
Favor the female dormitories over the male dormitories, as a more balanced male to female ratio will result (you will have to experiment and adjust your advertising as needed). The downside of this is that most of the males that come will be brought by females and you will encounter more douche-bags and troublemakers this way. Do not give preferential treatment just because a troublemaker was brought by a girl, be willing to eject them both.


Facebook. Facebook is useful. Just observe common sense and don't mention alcohol.

, The house is prepared and your best friend just ran out the door because he forgot cups. All the padlocks are locked and the windows are covered. The house is frigid. The punch is made. The rest of your friends are already drinking. These are the jobs they have to take turns doing:


Doorman. Someone must be at the door at all times. This person needs either be completely sober or completely responsible when totally hammered.

Make sure there is no one loitering outside of the house at any time (this is the #1 fatal party killer). Even getting them into the house and closing the door before they pay(If there is a hallway that you can use as a queue).
Makes sure no one leaves the house with alcohol.
Ensures everyone pays to get in the party, unless your campus' customs dictate otherwise.
Ensures unwanted guests do not enter the party.
Ensures the door is closed and locked if the police arrive. Signals to kill the music and shut the downstairs window. Ensures no one steps foot outside the door until the police have left.


Bartenders. Friends who stand behind the bar to serve drinks.

Ensures that every can they hand out has been opened before giving it to a guest.
Ensures that the guest isn't drinking beyond his/her limit.
Listens to the police radio for the house address to be mentioned. Tells the doorman.
Places more beer in the refrigerator as the colder ones are distributed.
Gives a 3 cases remaining beer warning (so someone can go buy more if it is still early).
Decides when to call the party ""full"" and not let anyone else in.


Roamers. Any trusted friend instructed to keep an eye out for belligerent behavior.

,


Be swift. Do not give second chances. Fighting, destruction of property, etc. cannot be tolerated. Return with a group of friends, and ask the individual to leave, if he does not. Remove him. No second chances. Don't rationalize with him or talk with him. Just have you and your friends pick him up and remove him. It is important that you have enough muscle to remove people like this. It also helps to have a taser gun handy for self defense in an emergency. If the individual cannot be removed, for whatever reason. Do not get in fights. Call the party finished, turn on the lights, kill the music, and tell everyone the police are on their way. People will leave immediately. His reputation will suffer more than it has already because he ended the party. This type of behavior will occur less and less frequently as you display zero tolerance for it. If there is still trouble, call the police.

If you can think of anything else, it just makes the party all the more interesting!

, No guest wants to be hungry, so put out a selection of goodies for them. You can bake delicious treats like cupcakes, cake, cookies, and have drinks like apple juice, apple cider, chocolate milk, fruit punch, and much more! You can find awesome recipes for these at the bottom, underneath the 'Tips' category. After choosing your recipes, you'll need to go to the store and get all the ingredients (if you don't already have them, of course).

, Some of these games are easy to make at home, if you're an arts and crafts person, or you want to save money. Fun party games or MLP games are 'Pin the Tail on the Pony', 'Bobbing for Apples', 'Bingo', 'Charades', or board games like 'Checkers', 'Connect Four', 'Headbanz', 'Life', 'Trouble' 'Balderdash', etc. Make sure everyone wants to play the game.

, They are a great way to lighten the mood of the party, as long as no one gets physically, or emotionally hurt. For example, don't give an exploding snakes/confetti present to someone who scares easily. But here are some classic party pranks from My Little Pony: Pepper and/or hot sauce hidden in one of the treats like in the show, there was pepper in the vanilla lemon drops, and then on the drink cups, use dribble cups, relighting birthday candles, and the exploding snakes/confetti present. If you have any other party pranks up your sleeve, feel free to use them, just remember, not everyone likes pranks.

,;
, Take out that decor, and make it, well, fabulous!

, Get down to work, maybe grab a friend, and get baking! Set out the baked goods and snacks on a table, and don't forget the drinks. Try laying out an MLP tablecloth. But if you're tight on money or can't find one, it isn't required.

,,, A fun way is to make the other snacks My Little Pony themed. Like to represent Spike, have rock candy, because he eats gems. For Applejack, get some candied or caramel apples. And maybe for Rainbow Dash, you could put out a bowl of Skittles. Those are just a few examples. You should put out some real food like cheese and crackers, fruit and nuts, in case your guests get really hungry.

Make Jonas-themed invitations!,
Decorate the house.,
Play music in the background.,
Play a bunch of Jonas Brothers-themed games!,
Serve a variety of food and drinks.,
Tell your guests to dress a certain way!,
Give the guests Jonas Bags with things like free posters, Jonas Stickers, Candy, Magazines, Jonas Brothers Pencils/Erasers, etc.",How to Throw a Jonas Brothers Party," Cut pictures out from magazines and tape them onto paper, then run a photocopy of them. Or, make digital copies on your computer, using pictures from the Internet. Print off the pictures and send them out. Be creative!;
, Put up a bunch of Jonas Brothers posters all over the house. If you want a more 'Hollywood' theme, have a red carpet in the party room. Also, make or buy stars such as the ones on the ""Walk of Fame"". Write your guests names on the stars, and don't forget to write Nick, Joe, and Kevin's names on the stars too! Buy Jonas Brothers cardboard cutouts and put them on the red carpet. This will make your guests feel like they're at a red carpet event with the Jonas Bros! You can even get some family members or friends to dress as paparazzi and take pictures of them with the cutouts. Have the 'paparazzi' throw roses onto the carpet too.

, Since it's a Jonas Brothers party, you'll obviously want to play Jonas Brothers music! If you don't already have them, buy Jonas Brothers CDs, or download their songs off of iTunes. Play the music on repeat in the background while your party is going on. If you don't want to go out and buy/download the Jonas Brothers music, have your guests bring their Jonas Brothers CD's.

, Here are some ideas to get you started:


Jonas Trivia: Make a trivia game all about the Jonas Brothers! Where were they discovered? Who's their little brother? What's their favourite food?
Pin the tie on the Jonas: Blindfold your guests and have them pin a tie onto a poster of the Jonas Bros. Whoever gets the tie the closet wins!
Jonas Bros scavenger hunt: Buy a bunch of Jonas Brothers-related things such as ties, pins, rings (like their Purity rings), etc. and hide them around the house.
Name that Song: Play snippets of Jonas Brothers songs. The first person to guess what song it is gets a point. Whoever has the most points wins.
JB Karaoke: Sing Jonas Brothers karaoke songs. To make it more competitive, whoever messes up is out. Whoever can make it through a whole song with no mess ups they get a point! For extra JB karaoke fun, make up your own dances to go with the songs!

, If you're serving lunch/dinner, try pizza, sushi, Chinese food, etc. Make sure to have munchies such as chips and cheese as well. Find out some of the Jonas Brother's favourite foods and serve them as well. Have a cake with the JB logo or an edible picture of them on it! Yum!

, If you're doing the ""Hollywood"" theme, tell them to dress fancy, because they'll be on the red carpet. You could also tell your guests to dress like a Jonas Brother! Wear ties, vests, skinny jeans, leather jackets, etc. Or, keep it simple and just wear a JB shirt!

, Don't forget a thank-you card!

Make sure that you will clean up the place after the party.,
Keep your guest-list short and sweet.,
Keep in mind that a kid’s party is bound to messy and hard to maintain.,
Say ""Yes"" to simple foods.,
Play and keep safe with classic games.,
Go for games like 'Musical Chair', 'Pin this Tail on Donkey' or 'Simon Says' which are classic games, never out of fashion always fun.,
Make sure that someone is always around to supervise the kids so they play safely and securely.,
Find undiscovered talents.,
In the local college bulletin post for a clown or fairy princess if you wish.,
Go smart while inviting guests .,
Share your party.",How to Save Money and Reduce Stress While Arranging a Party," And yet the best place is to arrange a kid’s party in your local park. Children will love it the most. They can have plenty of space to play with friends. Just take a bench or two and decorate it with some streamers, balloons, festoons etc. Surely it will be less expensive and more joyous. However, see to it that - if required - permission from civic authorities is obtained beforehand.;
, Sometimes we make a guest list without thinking. While making a guests list we often end up with a list with all our friends and relatives' names on them. That's not at all necessary; review the list again a few times to tune down the number of guests.

, The more people you invite, the harder it will be to manage. So choose carefully whom to invite and limit your guest numbers. Most importantly invite only those who are comfortable around lots of kids. This way everyone can enjoy the party.

, The foods no wonder take a huge part in a celebration. Food has to be tasty and enough for everyone. There is no need to go for a full meal. Just a beautiful cake, pizzas, burgers, some juice, sweets and snacks are good enough to make a kid happy.

, A child is easy to amaze. You can organize a magic show for the little guys. That will keep them busy throughout. You have many options in this field.

, If the cash permits you can even hire a Bouncy Castle!

, They have boundless energy and can be up to pranks you can't imagine!

, Some of us try to hide from limelight. In this case you should get an entertainer. Anyone who can juggle or can paint faces, or sing. Sometimes the dad or an uncle disguised as a clown can be life of the party. He can tell jokes and make everyone laugh.

, Drama students sometimes act in parties to earn few bucks.

, Don’t spend extra money on paper invitations. It is not that fast a service and requires mentioning of the mailing addresses. In present day, use modern technology and send invitations via e-mail or on-line invitations. Of course, traditional mail can be used if you don't have the e-mail addresses or social network/messaging IDs. You can find lots of party graphics on internet. Just jazz it up and it becomes a personal invitation to your guests.

, Most of the time kids don’t mind sharing a party as long as they can enjoy. So you might even get together two or three kids who share the same birthday or have birthdays coming soon. Combined birthdays can be even more fun to celebrate. It inculcates a spirit of sharing and building comradeship among kids. Besides, the expenses get reduced by being shared among parents! And the kids? The party will give them a time like no other!

Plan to have an indoor event with outdoor flow.",How to Prepare for an Outdoor Event During Uncertain Weather," If you choose to have your event outdoors, prefer a location that is near an indoor back-up location. For example, you could decide to have a garden party that is near a clubhouse, garden conservatory, or a cafe.
, It will be important to have the rights to move everyone indoors if the weather turns sour. This might necessitate paying extra and keeping those responsible for the indoor venue updated about your intentions, especially from the early hours of the actual day of the event., Purchase a marquee or erect a temporary structure to house people should the rain pour down or the icy winds gust. This can be left shut if the weather remains glorious, or used as a coat and gift area to save guests having to hold everything they came with. If the weather changes during the event, be sure to have helpers who can shift everything quickly into the temporary shelter so that the event can continue. You will need to arrange for helpers to move things in at one end to allow guests to mill around out of the weather's way at the other end., The easiest option and possibly the most cost-effective as you will use both venues, is to plan to have an indoor event that encourages outdoor flow. This makes the best of both opportunities and also allows people who feel more comfortable indoors to remain inside when others go out."

It’s a good idea to get together with a couple of your closest friends and try to brainstorm some possibilities. They know you well, and will be able to tell you if you have a really bad idea and offer some suggestions if you’re drawing a blank.Remember you want to do something that you like, but if you going to be with a group of friends, you want everyone to have fun.;
, Once you’ve come up with a few ideas, and before you get too excited, run them by your parents. They are going to be doing a fair bit of the organising and will know more than you about the costs and limitations. They might disappoint you by not seeming too enthusiastic about an enormous expensive party, but be understanding and work together with them. They really do want you to have fun!


Don’t be rude and demanding to your parents, that definitely won’t help with the party organization.

, After getting some ideas with friends and talking to you parents, the first big decision is whether you are going to do something at home, or go out somewhere for the day. Each of these have their advantages and disadvantages, so it’s really about what you think would be fun and what you can organise with friends and family.


If the party is at your house, decide where is going to be off limits. Your parents won't want a bunch of teens trekking through their bedroom.

, The next step is to decide how many people you want to come to celebrate your birthday. You might want to keep it small with just close friends and family, or have a big party with your whole class. What works best will depend on what kind of party you are going to have, but it’s a good idea to have a rough idea of numbers before you get too far ahead in the planning.


If you are keeping it small, be aware that word will travel around your class.Try not to get into an awkward situation where you are inviting everyone from your class apart from one or two people.Do you want it to be co-ed (girls and boys), all girls, or all boys? Talk it over with your parents and make sure that they approve your final decision.

, You'll want to pick a perfect date to have your 13th birthday party on. Ideally, it should be around your real birthday, but it doesn’t have to be. Try to have your birthday party on a weekend, or at least on a Friday night. You could also hold it on a day where you don't have school. Be careful if your birthday is during summer, spring, or winter break, as some of your friends may be on vacation.


It’s a good idea to check if another friend is having a party around the same time as you. You don't want to have your friends torn between going to your birthday or another person's birthday if they're on the same night.

, Now you have a good idea of the size, the date, and whether you are having your party at home or out, you can think about what theme you would like. There are almost endless possibilities here, so talk it over with friends and family and try to come up with something that will be really fun and is a bit special. A theme is a good way to tie the party together.Here are just a few ideas:


Rollerskating party
Sleepover

Pool party (at your home pool or a community pool)
Retro party (from the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, etc.)
Theme party (Hawaiian, Hollywood, etc.)
Murder Mystery party

Spa party (at home or at a professional spa)
Makeover party
A movie party (watch a movie at the theatre or at your house)
A camp-out (in the wilderness or your backyard)
Game show theme (American Idol, Survivor, Amazing Race, America's Next Top Model, etc.)
Go to an amusement park
Go horseback riding with friends
Have a dance party (at your house or a community center)
Have a beach party

Go to a concert

, Your venue is where you will host the party. If you have decided to have a party away from home you need to book somewhere sooner rather than later to avoid disappointment. Bear in mind how many people you are inviting and make sure you are booking somewhere with enough space. Think about if you need space for dancing, and a space to put your stereo or DJ.


Having a party at a specialist place can be easier to organise and handle for your parents than having one at home., For some places, like an amusement park or a sports game, you will need to buy tickets. It is easiest and quickest to do this in advance, you don't want to spend ages queueing. It’s best to leave this stuff to the parents to sort out, but make sure you know what is going on and your friends know if they need to get their own tickets separately.


Sometimes you can get group tickets at a discount.
If you going to a sports game make sure you get seats together.

, Once you know where and when you are going, you need to think about how everybody is going to get there and back again. Maybe you will all get a mini-bus from your house, or carpool. Again, this is something your parents will organise with your friends’ parents, but make sure everybody understands what the plans are, including you.

, Once the plans are well-advanced you can go ahead and send out the invitations. This is a chance for you to be a bit creative and show how much you want to share your birthday with your friends, as well as set the scene for your party.You can either write out the invitations by hand, email them out to your guests, or tell them in person or by calling them. You could also use free services on the internet that create invitations, such as Evite.


It’s a good idea to ask people on the invitations to let you know if they are allergic to anything. It wouldn't be good if there was an allergic reaction at your party!
Don’t forget to ask people to RSVP, and confirm whether or not they can come. This will be helpful in your planning. It will make arranging food, transport, entertainment, and anything, much easier if you know how many people are coming.Give all the information and the venue, date and transport on the invitations.

, Plan what you are going to need food-wise. You don't want a bunch of hungry 13 year old teens turning up to a party with no food. Chips, candy, pretzels, pop, juice, fruit, and chocolate work great for finger food.You can also have little appetizers such as sausage rolls or buffalo wings. If you're going to have your guests stay for a real meal (lunch or dinner), either order in some pizza, sushi, or Chinese food, or go out to a restaurant.


Be sure you take into account any dietary needs of your guests.
You can tie the food into your theme.
Don't forget the cake!

, Decorating your party space isn't essential. It's more important if you're having a theme party, but it's always nice to have some little decorations, even if it's only a couple balloons. You’re decorations will depend on your venue.Decorate as little or as much as you want (and as much as you can take financially).


It’s great to have decorations that go with your theme.
If you are having your party at an outside venue they will most likely take care of all the decorations before you arrive.

, Games and entertainment can be tricky at a 13th birthday, as you might not want to play the kind of games you liked when you were younger. Be sure to talk to your parents, so you all know what kind of entertainment you and your friends would like.You can keep it simple and provide some music, or maybe a movie, depending on what kind of party you're having. You could also hire some live performers/dancers to really get the party started. You could also have some classic party games such as:


Twister
Wink Murder
Truth or Dare

Scavenger Hunt/Treasure Hunt
Karaoke
Trivia

Make sure to have comfortable seating and R&R room - like seats and even tents.,
Plan the duration of the party.,
Choose a suitable location?,
Put it into action.,
On the day of: Arrive at area early by a few hours to set everything up.",How to Plan an Outdoor Party," First thing you need to consider is who is coming; this will lead to what you will be able to do. For the best results invite plenty of people. If you are a teen, then invite as much people as possible (since parties -especially outdoor ones - don't usually turn out great unless there are a lot of guests). Also, the more people the less is needed of you, more people allows everyone to mingle with each other, that way not much is needed of you for entertainment.;
, So now that you have the list of invites it's time to think of what you will do with them. Being outdoors makes this easier since there are such a wide variety of things to do. You could be hiking, swimming, biking, eating, just listening to music and dancing, talking. You could have a theme for your party; beach, bonfire. Generally, you should have one main thing to do besides mingling and eating and taking pictures. Perhaps a game or bring along sports equipment for anyone interested.


No matter what you plan on doing there are things that have to be there: Music - ask people to bring their own CD mixes to play & burn one yourself with fast beat songs that are popular right now. Food - Again, you should ask a group of friends to help you purchase/make the food. Keeping it simple is the best option. Bring some pizza or pasta and plenty of junk food. Such as chips, ice cream in a cooler, and pop.

, (Once again, things might start to get out of reach, and you should ask guests to bring their own)

, When? And For How Long? The party should probably be on a day where you have nothing to worry about the after. Such as during Spring Break or Summer Vacation. Or a weekend. The best days are Fridays and Saturdays. The party should be around a mealtime; either lunch or dinner. A lunch party would be nice and relaxing and casual but since the sun is up there's plenty more to do, while a dinner/night kind of party would be more exciting but there wouldn't be as much stuff to do. An outdoor party should be longer than most indoor ones. On average it should be around three or four hours long. Any longer than 5 hours would sound unappealing to guests and less than 2 doesn't give much time to do everything.

, This decision affects numbers 1,2 & 3. If you have a theme of a beach, you should go to a beach, maybe a place where you know that there isn't going to be too crowded, an area you would be able to have privacy. Another great place would be going to a campsite - that comes with a campfire pit. Also great if camp is in the forest, if a night party a suggestion would be to go hiking with flashlights in the dark. Though be cautious since it could be dangerous. Check in the daylight for hazards.


If your city or areas near your city doesn't have such accommodations, then maybe rent out a sports field (local community centre for details) or go to a city park.

,


Weeks before: Once you've figured out where, when, what, and who. You need to actually start the plan. Find your area, book it, rent it, and talk to your parents if you have to about it. Mark it on your schedule. Contact the guests by email or printed invites. Ask everyone to RSVP and on the invite note to bring their own music and food if possible. With a close group of friends maybe plan all this together so you can all split the cost amongst yourselves.

, Not much decoration is needed, just have the games/sports equipment ready and play music while guests arrive.

,, This is to make Santa's bearded face.

, Do this gently, as you don't want to squash down the hat. Pipe a much smaller bit of whipped cream at the very top of the hat, to form a pompom.

, These are the buttons.

, Place just under the hat in the whipped cream face, where eyes should go. Alternatively, place two small chocolate chips there.

, The finished product should be a little strawberry Santa. Repeat for each of the strawberries you're turning into Santas.

, Place in the refrigerator until needed but if uncovered, don't leave in there more than one to two hours, or they may start to take on fridge odors and won't taste as nice.

, Do this just before you're going to add them, to ensure freshness. Nuts can be ground in a food processor or a coffee bean grinder that has been purchased for nut grinding.

, The thickening will occur once the nuts are added and the nuts need to be cooked in.


Ground nuts can be added to stews and soups toward the end of the cooking process if the stew seems too runny. You may need a little longer for the nuts to help thicken the these dishes though, so keep a close eye on them.

, Whip the nuts in using a wire whisk. Stir continuously to help thicken the sauce. The cooking process should take another 1 to 2 minutes.


If it's a soup or a stew, use a wooden spoon to stir the nuts through.

, Serve as intended.

Grind nuts in a food processor.,
Finely chop nuts with a knife.,
Mix different chopped nuts for a unique coating.,
Use the right types of nuts.,
Purchase almond meal or almond flour.",How to Use Ground Nuts Instead of Breadcrumbs1," If you'd like to make a ground nut coating, you can take whole or sliced almonds, pecans, or macadamia nuts and grind them into a meal that you can use to coat food. Grind the nuts until they reach the texture that you desire. Make sure not to over-grind your nuts, or you'll create a nut butter with them.Using 1 to 2 cups (125 grams to 250 grams) of nuts will be enough for most recipes.Decide on whether you want a coarse or light coating for your food.If you want a finer coating, grind up your nuts more.
You can use blanched, unblanched, whole, sliced, slivered, or toasted nuts.;
, If you don't have a food processor, you can finely chop your nuts with a knife to create a nut coating for your food. Pecans and almonds are great as a coating for different proteins like fish, chicken, and vegetables. If you're going for a fancier touch the more expensive macadamia nut make a great replacement for breadcrumbs.Make sure to be careful and to use a sharp knife when cutting nuts apart. If you don't have good knife skills, make sure to take your time., If you can't settle on a single type of nut, you can mix different types of nuts together to create a unique and tasty coating. Combine your nuts before you chop them up and mix the chopped nut coating with a spoon before using it in your food.

Mixing more expensive nuts, like macadamia nuts with pecans or almonds, will also lower your costs at the grocery store., Nuts like pine nuts burn easily, and shouldn't be used in a ground nut coating.Think about your food and how the nuts will enhance the taste. For instance, nuts coated in sugar will add a caramelization and sweet taste to your food. Also, you should talk to whoever is eating your food and make sure that they don't have a common nut allergy, such as an allergy to peanuts., Almond meal and almond flour are two products that are available at many grocery stores and can act as a replacement for breadcrumbs. Almond meal is made from skin-on unblanched almonds, and the texture is coarser than most bread crumbs.Almond flour, on the other hand, is created with blanched almonds and is finer than almond meal.

Almond flour makes a great coating for fish such as tilapia.You can use almond meal to create almond chicken."

Season your ground nut coating.,
Create an egg wash to fry foods.,
Use flax seeds or chia seeds to help bind things together.,
Bake your food using the ground nut covering.,
Fry your food on the stovetop.",How to Use Ground Nuts Instead of Breadcrumbs2," You can add dried basil, cumin, paprika, salt, or Italian seasoning to your breadcrumbs to enhance them. Add your dried seasoning to your ground nuts and mix them thoroughly.

Cumin and paprika will make spicier breadcrumbs.

, Your nut breadcrumbs may be more coarse than traditional breadcrumbs and will require something extra to stick to your proteins or vegetables. To create an eggwash combine one large egg with 1-3 teaspoons (4.92-14.78 mm) milk, heavy cream, or water. Beat the mixture until well blended, then dip your raw food in the egg wash before covering them in your breadcrumbs.

You can add salt to season your egg wash.

, If you prefer not to use eggs in your cooking, you can use chia or flax seeds to help bind the ground nuts to your proteins or vegetables. To use flax and chia seeds as a binder, mix one tablespoon (4.92 mL) of ground flax or chia seeds with three tablespoons (14.78 mL) of water and wait for 5 to 10 minutes. The solution should create a jell that's similar to eggs. Once it's a jell, proceed to use it the same way you'd use an eggwash., Cook your food the same way that you would when using breadcrumbs. Pay close attention to the surface of your food because nuts are prone to burn. To bake your food, dredge your food in your flax seed mixture or egg wash and then get an even coating of breadcrumbs on it. Heat your oven to the appropriate temperature for the food and let it cook.


Chicken cooked at 350°F for 45 minutes will cook through and should leave a golden brown coating.Remember to flip your food over half way through cooking so that there is an even cook.

, A breadcrumb or nut coating tastes great when fried. Fill a deep pan with two inches (25.4 mm) of frying oil and place it on a stovetop on medium-high heat. Let your oil get hot before placing your nut covered food into the oil. Cook the food evenly on both sides and remove it once it's golden brown.

Use your egg wash or flax mixture to bind the ground nuts to the surface of your food.
You can use vegetable oil or canola oil.

Consider making meatloaf or meatballs with ground nuts.,
Fry Chicken with ground nuts.,
Coat and fry fish with ground nuts.,
Cook southern style vegetables using ground nuts.",How to Use Ground Nuts Instead of Breadcrumbs3," Recipes for meatballs or meatloaf require breadcrumbs to act as a binder for the meat. Make your meatloaf or meatballs the same way as your normally would, combining ground meat with eggs and spices. Instead of adding breadcrumbs as a binder, however, try adding ground nuts instead.

You can also use almond meal or almond flour.Experiment with different quantities of nuts until your meat reaches the consistency and texture that you desire.

, Instead of coating your chicken with flour or breadcrumbs, consider using ground nuts instead. You can use similar cook times, just pay attention to the surface of your food. Dredge your chicken in your egg wash and then fully coat them with ground up nuts. Once your chicken is coated, fry it over the stovetop or cook it in the oven as your normally would.

Reduce overall cooking times by using thinner pieces of chicken so that your ground nut coating does not burn while it's being fried.

, You can fry fish on the stovetop the same way that you'd normally do so when covered in breadcrumbs. Coat your fish fillets in your egg wash or a chia seed jelly before coating them in your ground nuts. For lighter fish, make sure to finely grind up your nuts.

A fish fillet will only need about 2-3 minutes of cooking time on medium-high heat on a skillet., Coat your vegetables with the eggwash or flax mixture before covering them in nuts. You can either pan fry the vegetables on medium heat until they are golden brown, or you can cook vegetables like zucchini in the oven at 450°F for 10 minutes.Experiment with different vegetables like peppers, onions, cauliflower, eggplant, and okra."

Heat the sugar and water.,
Stir in the sweetened condensed milk and almond extract.,
Combine the punch ingredients.,
Scoop and float ice cream snowballs.,
Garnish and serve the white snowball punch.",How to Make Snowball Punch1," Place 1 cup (225 g) of sugar and 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water in a small saucepan. Turn the heat on to medium-high and stir the mixture occasionally. The mixture should boil and turn syrupy.It's important to boil the water and sugar so that you don't have grainy punch.;
, Remove the pan of syrup from the heat and stir in 1/2 (7 ounces or 200 g) of a can of sweetened condensed milk and 1 1/2 teaspoons of almond extract. Ensure that the sweetened condensed milk is incorporated.The mixture will start to look snowy white after you add the sweetened condensed milk and almond extract.
You can use vanilla extract if you prefer the flavor of vanilla over almond.

, When you're ready to serve the white punch with snowballs, pour the mixture into a punch bowl or two and pour in 3 (2-liter) bottles of lemon-lime soda. Stir the punch gently so it combines.You can prepare the mixture ahead of time. Just refrigerate the punch mixture and add the soda right before you're ready to serve it.

, Get out a container of vanilla ice cream or frozen vanilla yogurt. Scoop at least 1/4 of the container into large scoops that resemble snowballs. Gently drop the ice cream snowballs into the punch bowl.If you want a slightly melted effect, consider scooping and adding the snowballs to the punch about half an hour before you plan on serving the punch. This will give the snowballs a chance to melt a little.

, Let your guests help themselves to the punch or ladle the punch into glasses ahead of time. Ensure that each glass has a melting snowball and consider topping the drinks with:


Whipped cream
White snowflake sprinkles
Mini-candy canes

, Get out one container of vanilla ice cream and scoop 10 large scoops of ice cream. Try to make them as round as you can so they look like snowballs. Set the snowballs into the punch.If you'd like the snowballs to keep they're round shape, you can place the scoops of ice cream on a baking sheet and freeze them until they're completely hard again. Then you can add them to the punch.

Garnish and serve the punch.",How to Make Snowball Punch3," Pour 1 (32 ounce or 950 ml) bottle of chilled cranberry nectar, 1 cup (325 g) of chilled seedless red raspberry jam, and 1 1/2 (2 liter) bottles of chilled lemon-lime soda into a large punch bowl. Slowly stir the ingredients.To get the red color, you could also use a fruit jelly (like cherry or strawberry). Just use something that doesn't contain seeds or pieces of fruit.

, Remove 1 (1.5 quart) of frozen vanilla yogurt from the freezer and let it sit out for about 15 minutes. This will soften the frozen yogurt and make it easier to scoop. Scoop the frozen yogurt into round balls that look like snowballs. Add the snowballs to the punch and stir them so they start to melt into the punch.For an even rosier punch, you could use a different flavor of frozen yogurt. Try strawberry frozen yogurt for a really vibrant punch.

, Set punch glasses near the bowl or fill glasses with the punch. Ensure that you get a snowball in each glass. Top the red punch with fresh cranberries or slices of orange for a holiday touch.


To make the cranberries look frosty, rinse them with water and roll them in sugar. The sugar will coat the berries so they look frozen.

Decide on a number of Guests to Invite.,
Decide on how large a venue you need.,
Determine the number of invitations you send out.,
Send the cards 1-2 months in advance.,
Organize the court and cotillion.",How to Throw a Debut Party," You probably want to invite family first before anyone else. Again, a debut party is second only to a wedding in terms of grandeur, so family is first, then very close friends and so on. List out all the people you are considering on sending invitations to. Make a note of how likely it is for them to attend, how far they live, if they are willing to travel, etc. A typical debut will have anywhere from 100-200 people.;
, If your house is large enough, opt to have it at home. This will cut down costs tremendously. The downsides are limited parking for your guests, possible property damage, and neighbors calling the cops on you for having loud music.


When selecting a venue, keep in mind whether they rent out equipment, such as a sound system, chairs, tables, etc. Check to see if they have a kitchen, clean accessible bathrooms, enough parking, plenty of electrical outlets, etc.






If they do not have equipment for rent, then you may want to look at your local directory for party rentals for chairs and tables.







, Keep in mind that one invitation can potentially yield 5 people in return. A card per family, and you send out 50 invitations, you can have a room of 200 to 300 people.


Custom cards are nice, but can get very costly. To thwart costs, you can pick up an invitation kit from your local Target or Walmart in the party supply section. A kit can have 20-40 pairs of both a blank invitation cards and thank you cards and envelopes. To give your invites a more professional touch, purchase some vellum from an arts and crafts store, usually about a dollar depending on the design or texture.
If you don't already own one, get a single hole puncher. You will hole punch the invites and the vellum, and tie the two with a ribbon. Ribbon color will be based on your theme and motif. Instead of printing directly on to the card, you will print on to the vellum. Do a test print on ordinary paper before you start cutting your vellum.
On the invite include the name of the celebrant, date, venue, your royal court, RSVP, theme if you have one. Some relatives, may live far, so include directions on a separate insert. If you have RSVP cards, include postage on a self-addressed envelope.

, For family and friends that live close by, hand them out to them personally to cut costs on postage. Or mail them if you don't feel like driving and wasting gas, it's up to you.

, A typical debut usually has a royal court which consists of 18 males and 18 females. Oftentimes peers, or close to the age of the celebrant. Many opt to have close cousins, best friends, brothers and sisters.


The 18 roses, or 18 males, will share a dance with the celebrant, each handing a rose. The last dance is usually reserved for the father or the escort. The escort is usually the main suitor, boyfriend, or best male friend of the celebrant, but does not have to be.






The 18 candles, are the females who each will give a short speech that can either be about their relationship with the celebrant or wishes for the celebrant.






Some cases, the debut is centered around the cotillion or waltz, where the 18 roses and candles dance. Unless you plan on having rehearsals and practice, this is becoming less and less common, so you don't have to oblige you court to do so.

Add extra details.",How to Make Santa Pancakes," The Santa aspect of your Santa pancakes is all in how you top and decorate them. So, to make the pancakes themselves, just follow your favorite recipe as you normally would. If you’re stuck for one, browse others on Wikihow, or simply follow this one for your batter:

For four pancakes, combine 1 cup (125 g) of flour, ½ teaspoon of baking powder, 1 tablespoon sugar, and ¼ teaspoon salt in a large mixing bowl. Then stir in 1 cup (237 ml) of milk and 1 large egg until the batter turns smooth.;
, First, lightly coat a large skillet with cooking oil. Turn the burner to medium-low heat. Once the skillet’s hot, ladle your batter into the skillet. Cook each pancake on one side until the top begins to bubble. Then flip it over with a spatula and cook the second side until it turns golden brown.For each Santa that you plan to make, you can ladle out a ¼ cup of batter for a standard-size pancake to use as Santa’s head.
Additionally, you can make a second pancake of equal size to trim down to an undersized body.Or, you can ladle out a 1/4 cup for the upper torso and a smaller portion for the head for a more proportionally correct Santa.

, If you’ve made two pancakes for each Santa, with one meant to be his full body, transfer one pancake to a cutting board. Use a paring knife to trace an outline for Santa’s body. Discard the excess, or snack away on it while you repeat for any additional Santas.Alternatively, you could also save them to add to Santa’s face or body.

, If you’re using only one pancake per plate in order to make Santa’s head, set your pancake closer to one edge. Leave yourself plenty of room up top to create a large hat to fill your plate. If using two pancakes for a head and body respectively, do the same and place Santa’s feet as close to one edge as possible., For each pancake, set two chocolate chips where his eyes would be.Or, to make them stand out even more (and to add more flavor and vitamins to your meal), slice up a banana. Lay out a slice for each eye first, then top each with a chip.If you trimmed a second pancake down to make Santa’s body, you could also cut two circles out of that and set the chips on top of those instead of bananas.

, Use your favorite red fruit to add some color to his face. Trim a strawberry into a nose shape and set in between his eyes. Center a fresh raspberry or cherry in his face.Or, instead of fresh fruit, scoop out whole chunks from pie filling and use those.Again, if you have excess left from cutting an outline of Santa’s body, you could also use these to shape a nose if fruit isn’t your thing.

, Use more banana slices or scrap pieces of pancake to shape ears on either side of his head.Load a liquid dropper with compote or red food coloring and give each cheek a drop of red to give Santa a blush from the wintry cold. Melt some extra chocolate chips and then draw a mouth, eyebrows, wrinkles, dimples, and/or laugh-lines with a toothpick.If you created a body, too, use a food brush to paint his boots, belt, and/or gloves with the chocolate while it’s still melted.

, Brush compote or jam over the top of Santa’s head where his hat would cover it. Then arrange fresh red fruit like strawberries, raspberries, and/or cherries over it. Add more fruit to the plate above his head, shaping a red hat.Alternatively, you can just use cherry pie filling to simplify things.If you made a body, do the same for the red parts of his suit.

, Either use a spray can or fill a piping bag with whipped cream from a container. Outline the brow of his hat and give its tip a little pom-pom of white. Finish Santa’s face at the same time by giving him his beard.Detail his suit too if you made a body, with cuffs around his sleeves, a stripe along his waist, and another connecting his beard to his waist.

, Arrange mints leaves with small bits of red fruits to shape a Christmas tree if there’s free space on the plate. Dust powdered sugar over it and Santa’s boots. If you made a body, add chocolate chips to stand in for buttons on his suit."

Have fun!",How to Throw a Fabulous Party Without Alcohol," Establish whether this is going to be a large party or a smaller gathering. Knowing the size of the party in advance will help you create a more accurate budget and get the right amount of food and non-alcoholic beverages.;
, Write down a list of the people you are going to ask to come. Be sure to invite people who you know will be comfortable not drinking. The goal of the party might be to have guests not even notice that there isn't alcohol being served. This will be hard to do if you invite guests that you know rely on alcohol to have a good time or guests that keep bringing up the fact that there is no alcohol.

, Although you don’t need to send invitations until you have decided on a theme and a date, you may want to decide the format in advance. Be sure to let people know there won't be alcohol at the party.


Invite people through Facebook. You can create a Facebook event in a matter of minutes. If you’re short on time and the party is coming up, social media is a great way to spread the word.
Send paper invites. Depending on the ages of the people you are inviting to the party, paper invitations may be a better choice. For example, if your guests are older adults, they may not use social media. Paper invites require slightly more time, and they can add to your total party costs.

, The best themes for your party align with your guests’ interests. Think about the ages and genders of your invitees. Since this will be a party without alcohol, some themes like wine and cheese or others based around alcoholic beverages won’t be appropriate. However, a theme will be important and need to be prominent for it to be a fabulous party.Focus on an upcoming holiday. Seasonal themes, such as a Halloween costume party or an ugly sweater Christmas party, can be popular with your guests.
Base the party on food. Your theme can be as simple as a potluck where everyone brings a food item to share, or it can be something more creative like a make-your-own-pizza party or cookie decorating.
Use a pop culture theme. If the invitees are all interested in a certain TV show or movie, such as Game of Thrones, this can set your theme. Be sure the theme is something that will appeal to the entire guest list so no one is left out.
Host a costume party. There are limitless themes in this area. You can hold a party based on the styles of a particular decade, for instance. If guests are expected to dress up to add to the theme, be sure to inform them in advance.

, The theme serves as a guideline for a lot of the details of the party. Some themes may not require a great deal of decorations, but they always add something. For example, a Halloween party can always benefit from spooky decorations to set the mood.

, The food you serve at the party can work with the theme, but it’s also important to decide if you will be serving a meal or hors d’oeuvres. The guest list will help you determine how much food you need. The food will be especially important since there won't be alcohol.


Have alternative foods for guests. Be aware of any allergies or dietary restrictions guests may have so you can work around this.
Choose foods that fit the theme. If you’re holding a party based on a movie or other specific theme, you can include food items that are reminiscent of it. For example, if you’re hosting a Harry Potter party, offer cookies with glasses or lightning bolts.

, Parties with alcohol often don’t have many planned activities, but you will want to schedule something for a fun party without alcohol. It helps steer the party in the right direction.


If you're throwing a party with a lot of people who know each other, you may not need to do much to have a fun time without alcohol. It can be simple entertainment, such as watching the movie that gave the party its theme. , There are a number of fun games intended for parties, such as Apples to Apples, Cards Against Humanity, or Catchphrase. These also serve as icebreakers for guests who may not know each other, which can help guests mingle at a party where alcohol isn't served. Choose a classic. Charades and other party games have been around for a long time, but they can still make your party a hit. Rather being general, charades can align with your theme.
Make up your own game. If you can't find a game that fits your theme, create your own game. This can be bonding experience for guests. Write down the rules for the game so they will be easy to follow. You can even put a non-alcoholic spin on a drinking game, like Sprite pong instead of beer pong.

, If there is going to be down time during the party, such as when guests are eating dinner, a themed playlist can help set the mood. You can either choose your own songs or use a streaming service like Pandora or Spotify to pick a playlist that fits the theme.

, Fortunately, you won’t have to worry about providing alcohol for your guests, but other party expenses can add up. It’s important to make a budget before sending out invitations because you may need to adjust your plans to keep costs down.


Get quotes from caterers. If you decide to utilize a catering service, contact a few different companies in the area to get an idea of price before making your selection.

, Without alcohol, food will likely be the bulk of your party expenses. You may want to consider catering if you can afford it, which could cover a dinner or appetizers. You can easily avoid hiring a caterer and have a fabulous party.

, Depending on the theme of your party, you may want to offer favors for guests. For example, if you were hosting an 80s dance party, you could give guests neon bracelets and other accessories. It’s important to factor the cost of these items into your total budget.

, Party decorations help set the theme, but you don’t need to go overboard. If you are trying to cut back on expenses, you may want to select inexpensive decorations, make your own, or purchase items that can be reused in the future.

, Just because there won’t be alcohol at the party doesn’t mean you have to stick to offering your guests nothing besides water or soda. Many cocktail recipes can be adjusted to leave out the alcohol. Pinterest is a great source of ideas and recipes for non-alcoholic drinks.


Search by theme. If you're trying to get drink ideas, try searching based on your theme. You may find recipes you hadn't thought to use.

, The non-alcoholic beverages you serve can enhance the theme of your party. For example, if you are hosting a tropical party, you can use tiki glasses and paper umbrellas.

, If your party has a seasonal theme, there may be a beverage that fits right in. For example, if it's a fall harvest party, you could serve warm apple cider. Peppermint hot chocolate would be perfect for a Christmas or winter party.

, Make sure your house is tidy before your guests start arriving. Pay close attention to the areas where people will be, like the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. As you're cleaning, set up decorations, leaving yourself enough time to be thorough.

, Purchase all the food, snacks, and refreshments you were planning to have at your party. Depending on what you will be offering, you may need to cook some things, such as cookies or other baked goods, in advance to save time. Be sure to leave yourself enough time for everything that will need to be done ahead of time.


Write a schedule. Parties often have many different aspects. Write a list of everything you will need to do and choose times to accomplish each item.
Ask a friend for help. Setting up for a party can be a lot of work, so you can ask a friend or family member for assistance so everything looks perfect when guests start to arrive.

, After the hard work of organizing an event, enjoy yourself. Circulate and talk to each of your guests. Have fun with the activities you’ve planned for the party.

Add some red lentils to make the food healthier.,
Add ¼ to ½ cup (40 to 75 grams) of raisins.Sugar isn't all that healthy, but raisins are just as sweet and much healthier.,

, You can also use steel-cut oats, old-fashioned oatmeal, or quick-cooking oats.Santa's reindeer love all sorts of oats.


This food is meant for Santa's reindeer. Do not eat this, or you may get a tummy ache. If you want to make some yourself, try using cereal instead. Corn flakes and rice cereal are great for this.

, The oats should be coated with the dye, but not soggy.If the oats are too watery, add some more oats. They will soak up the rest of the dye.

, Any baking sheet will do, but try to get one that is at least 18 by 13 inches (45.72 by 33.02 centimeters). If you do not have a baking sheet, you can use a plate, pan, or even a plastic lid from a box. You will need to spread the oats out over this in a thin layer, so make sure that it is big enough.

, You can also use a spoon or spatula if you want to keep your hands clean. Make sure that the layer is thin. You do not want any clumps or piles of oats.

, The oats must be dry before you move on to the next step. Any water left in the oats may cause the sugar to melt. It will take about 1 hour for the oats to dry., You are now ready to add the rest of your ingredients.

, You can also make your own edible glitter by mixing ¼ cup of sugar with ½ tablespoon of red food coloring, and then baking it at 350°F (175°C) for 8 to 10 minutes.Do not use craft glitter. If you leave the reindeer food outside, other animals may try to eat it and get sick. Edible glitter is safer., You can make your reindeer food healthier by adding things like nuts and raisins. You can also make it taste better by adding in crushed candy cane or chocolate. This section will give you a few ideas on what you can add. Don't get carried away, or the food won't taste as good anymore. Choose two to three items from this section and mix them in.

, Try to find some star-shaped sprinkles, red sprinkles, or red sugar strands.You can also use Christmas sprinkles. They come in many fun shapes, such as snowflakes, candy canes, and Christmas trees.

, You can use other spices, such as nutmeg or pumpkin pie spice.

, The red lentils will blend right into the oats. Even the pickiest reindeer won't be able to see it., They will appeal to the pickiest sweet tooth.


Do not add raisins if you or your neighbors have pets that visit your yard. This food is meant for Santa's reindeer, but cats and dogs may try to eat it too. Raisins are not good for cats and dogs, and can really hurt them.

, Nuts and coconut will fill them up and make them ready to travel the globe again.


Try toasting the seeds, nuts, and coconut in an oven at 400°F (205°C) for 5-10 minutes. This will make them smell nicer and bring out the flavors.
If you know that the reindeer visiting you are picky, you may want to skip these and try the red lentils instead. Picky reindeer may see the nuts and coconut and turn the food away.

, Place a few candy canes into heavy-duty resealable bag. Put the bag on a hard surface and hit the candy canes with a rolling pin. Keep smacking them until you get a powder. Add the crushed candy into the reindeer food.


If you don't want any large chunks in the food, pour the crushed candy through a sifter. The sifter will catch all of the big pieces, and let the powder pass through.The food will still taste just as sweet.

, You can buy them during the holiday season. If you cannot find any red chocolate chips, use red-colored melting chocolate instead. You can find it in the baking section of an arts and crafts store.


If you are using red melting chocolate, break it into smaller pieces before you add it to the reindeer food.
If you or your neighbors have pets that go into your yard, do not add the chocolate. It can be deadly for both cats and dogs, who may try to eat it.

, Mix 1 ½ tablespoons of water with 8 to 10 drops of green food coloring. Stir this into 1 cup (100 grams) of plain oats. Wait for the oats to dry, then add them to the red ones.

, Put the food into a jar, plastic sandwich bag, or a plastic container. Keep the food in a cool, dry place. If the food gets wet, it will get moldy. Reindeer won't eat that.

, If the reindeer are hungry when Santa stops by your house, they will eat the tasty food you made for them.

, Some reindeer do not like picking food out of grass. They may like eating out of a bowl or tray more.


Try finding a bowl with pictures of reindeer or Christmas trees on it.
If you can find a large dog bowl, paint the word ""Reindeer"" on the side. That way, the reindeer will know it is for them.

, Be sure to include a pretty label and some instructions on how to use it. Here are some ideas for cute containers that you can use:


Put the reindeer food into small, plastic bags. Tie the bags with red or green ribbon. See if you can find Christmas themed bags.
Pour some food into mini takeout boxes. You can decorate the boxes with stickers, or draw on them with a marker.
Buy some mini tins and decorate them with stickers before adding in the reindeer food. Stick a label on the bottom of the tin with the instructions.

Surprise them!",How to Throw a Surprise Party," There are three types of people in this world: those that don't like surprise parties because they always want to be prepared, those that don't like surprise parties because they think they're being forgotten, and those that love a good surprise party in your honor. Make sure your party-person falls into the third category!


There are a few things you can do to get around the fact that your party-person is the first or second type, though. If they always want to be prepared, tell them a similar story about what they're ""going to be doing"" so they're dressed appropriately and know what mood to be in. If they think they're being forgotten, have something well in advance of their actual day.;
, If this surprise party is for a birthday, holding a party on the day of might be a little hard to turn into an awesome surprise; your person is probably expecting something, especially if you've known each other for a long time. To avoid that (and to avoid the person thinking you've forgotten about them, which may, in itself, be suspicious), plan something before the actual occasion, like their birthday.


In addition to picking a date before their actual day, choose a time and date where all of their friends are able to go and of course, the guest of honor, too. Since this is impossible to know without asking, improve your odds by giving them a lot of notice and choose a time and date where you don't know of anything else already going on.

, If you tell your party-person that you're heading to the nicest restaurant in town, they'll know that there's an occasion. However, if you tell them that you're heading to the same restaurant you go to every Thursday night, suspicion will be kept at a minimum. Pick a place that seems ""normal,"" whether it's a restaurant, a bowling alley, or just another friend's house.


If you do choose a restaurant, be sure to make a reservation around a month in advance. You want to be sure you can get prime space for all the people in your party.

, An easy way to get people jazzed about a party is to give it a theme – they get to come up with a crazy outfit to wear, see everyone else's, and you get the chance to use your creativity when it comes to decorations, prizes, and activities. The best part? It can be anything – cartoon-themed, color-themed, holiday-themed (who said you can't have an ugly Christmas sweater party in July?) – anything!


However, keep in mind that even if you don't have a theme, the party can still rock! It'll be a bit more casual and for that reason, likely less suspicious. Your party-person could wander in and not even realize they've wandered into a party for them! What's more, if there isn't a theme, your guest of honor will be able to fit right in, not having prepared anything themselves.

, You essentially have two options: a nice, small gathering or a big, roaring get-together. Here's what to consider:



A small group. This is easier to manage, people can keep their mouths shut, and it creates a more intimate environment (easier to book at restaurants, etc.) However, it's less impressive and more people might be upset that they're not invited.

A large group. This is harder to manage and coordinate, the word might slip out, it's harder to get a space, but in the end, your party person might be floored by seeing everyone they love in one room (alternatively, they could be overwhelmed, depending on their personality).

, The hardest part about a surprise party is making sure your guest of honor doesn't find out, people you don't want there don't find out, no one else makes plan with your party person, and other people aren't hurt they're not coming. To avoid these issues as much as possible, tell people individually, face-to-face, over the phone, or via a personalized email. This way it's not a large group thing that everyone is buzzing about, ruining everything.


Having a one-on-one talk is better for a plethora of reasons: you make sure they understand everything, can emphasize how important it is to kept a secret, and you know no one else is around to overhear you. If they have any questions, they'll come to you later, and not starting talking to other people.
Keep in mind that you may have to lie to some people – those that you think may blab the secret. But don't think of it as lying! Think of it as protecting the integrity of your party. Tell them that you're doing a dinner or night out, but don't tell them there's a big deal behind it. However, tell them it's only a few people, so don't mention it. This way, they'll have no reason to talk about it.

, No, that doesn't mean, ""Hey, party for you next Friday!"" It means you make other plans with them to reserve their time – this way they don't make other plans that you have to beg them to cancel later on. It doesn't really matter what it is, just make sure they're dressed appropriately!


Tell others not to, too. This is where it gets tricky – even if some people aren't invited, you may want to tell them not to make plans with your party person. Let them know you're doing something with them for their big day that day (just a small thing) to keep their schedule clear.

, Taking a surprise party all on your own shoulders is a lot to ask – it can get very, very stressful quickly. To help spread the weight, have one of their best friends help you with the organization. Besides, you'll need someone to be with the guest of honor while you wrangle up the guests!


Be sure it's someone who's actually close to them. If you choose someone who's not really interested, they could be late, make the wrong suggestions, or blab to people you don't want knowing.

, If you're doing it at someone's home, you'll need to take care of everything from decorations to food to party activities, if any. If it's at a restaurant, provide a few minimal decorations, like a few balloons or party favors.


If it's a themed party, that'll make choosing decorations and food a little easier (fewer options). Just make sure you have some hors d'oeuvres, drinks, and, for a birthday party, a cake!

, Here's the thing: you have to make sure your guest of honor doesn't see the food and the decorations. If he or she opens your fridge and it's stockpiled to the brim, you may have to field some questions. So get an off-site location (like a friend's house the party person won't go to) to store everything. The day of the party, bring everything in.


This includes correspondence stuff, too. Don't leave a message with someone else where the person can find it!

, The night before, re-confirm the details with all their friends by text messaging or calling. Don't send them an e-mail, in case they might not check their e-mail that day. Call them and let them know any extra buzz.


At this time, you may want to tell any guests you fibbed to of the actual details of the event. Just say you wanted to be sure it was kept a secret – there's no way they can argue with that!

, To keep it simple, set up everything for the party the day of. This way if the party person happens to drop by, you won't go scurrying to hide anything. Give yourself extra time in case anything goes wrong or is forgotten.


Have guests who are bringing items (like a dish) come even earlier, if they can. They can also go run an extra errand if need be, while you can continue setting up.

, If your party starts at 7, have all the guests be there by 6. People are always late to parties – this way, everyone will be together by 6:30 and you'll have plenty of time to organize the big reveal.


You'll have a few people who are actually punctual. For them, make sure you have some food and drinks ready on time so they're not left bored and hungry.

, This is why having their best friend helping you out will be a life saver. They can have the person with them, going and doing whatever the cover plan was, and you can correspond with them – they should let you know when they're on their way, etc. You can then manage the party and the guests.


Make sure they keep you posted on how things are going and how far away they are. This way when you get a text that says, ""10 minutes!"" you'll be fully prepared.

, Some people choose to go with the standard lights off, hide-behind-couches surprise. Other people choose to pretend it's just a normal party and let the person find out when they see their name on the cake. However you choose, be sure all the guests are on the same page.


Make sure all the logistics are covered. Can your friend get in? Make sure the door is unlocked so you don't have to ruin it by coming to the door in a dark room. Will parking be an issue? Is anyone in the bathroom as the party person is walking up the stairs? Get them out!

, And success! Your well-planned party has gone off without a hitch! Well, hopefully. Did they have any idea? Even if they did, they'll feel incredibly loved and appreciate all the work you went to.

, In the United States, ABC, ESPN and Univision will be airing World Cup games. If you want to host a party but you don’t have cable television, you will need to plan it during one of the 10 games that will be aired on the ABC network.

, If your friends aren’t avid soccer fans who watch foreign leagues, then you should choose a game featuring the home team in your country. Everyone can appreciate the national pride.


If your friends are avid soccer fans, choose a more heated game against rivals who repeatedly win the World Cup. France, Brazil, Argentina, England, Germany and Italy are generally crowd-pleasing games.

, You may ask your friends to pick a team or even bet on the whole World Cup results. If they are soccer fans, start an email chain, a fantasy World Cup league or a group Facebook page to increase the excitement before the day.

, You will need at least $25 to $50 to get snacks and decorations. However, you can also have an elaborate party with color-themed costumes, sports memorabilia and a full dinner if you have a larger budget., Soccer fans start making their plans to watch World Cup games weeks or months in advance, and you will have some competition from other parties during your home team’s group round and qualifying games.


The type of invitations you send out will depend upon your budget. If you have a low-budget party, send emails or e-vites. If you have a larger budget, send mail and online invitations. If you have a large invitation, consider sending out flags or key chains for the national teams to get everyone excited.
You may also want to plan an impromptu party when you team qualifies for the next round. Send email invitations and go to the dollar store for supplies a day in advance.

, Most people are happy to bring one dish and six-pack of the drink of your choice. You will unusually take on the burden of providing extra food and drink in case the stores run out.

Choose finger foods if you don’t want to spend a lot of money on disposable plates and silverware.

, At the very least, opt for streamers and balloons in the countries’ colors. Consider these other options as well:


Split the room up by color and country. Decorate one side of the room in one country’s color combo and the other side in the opposing teams colors. Guests can choose sides if they want to promote the rivalry.
Buy inexpensive cotton shirts or tank tops in the teams’ colors. If you don’t think people will wear jerseys, they can decorate their shirt with marker when they get there. Have a team roster and ask them to choose a player and write the last name across their shoulders.
Order team flags. You can get a set of 10 country team flags for $10 on the Internet. You can also find flag drink picks, stickers and temporary tattoos, if you want to provide more for your guests.

, Remind people to bring a dish or wear team colors if they want to. Announce that the party will start promptly 30 minutes before kickoff to avoid interruptions during the game.

, If the game is at night, it can be disruptive. Controversial calls and penalty shootouts can cause fans to yell.

, Some fans may come over for a pre-game show or a pre-game drink. You want to encourage early attendance when a game is televised live.

, Unless everyone is rooting for the same team, don’t be too aggressive. You should encourage friendly competition, not anger toward an opposing team.

, Encourage them to dress up or don a streamer as a scarf.

, A porch or another room will allow them to leave without interrupting the game for the fans.

, A foosball table, lawn soccer field or small foam soccer set will be popular with athletic or competitive friends., Keep spirits up when it’s not going well. You may find yourself in the role of the cheerleader as the host.

Know when to call it quits.",How to Throw a Party," Plan at least 3 months out so that you have ample time for publicity and to create a large e-mail invite guest list. Give your guests a six week ""Save the Date"" e-mail. Make sure formal invites (via mail or email) are dated no less that 2 weeks out. This gives your guests ample notice and gives you time to prepare the party of the year. Here are things to consider:


Pick a date when nothing else is happening. If there's a big community event going on or your friends always have ""wines day Wednesdays"" for example, avoid partying on that day. You want people to come to your party, right?! Make sure to check sports, community, church and other organization calendars before finalizing your date. You would not want to plan a 6pm event downtown if a major sports event is scheduled with in an hour of your event. Think about things like traffic, commute time, event parking and other factors that could lower your attendance. Does the time or date conflict? Will parking be plentiful and free? Will the commute for the majority of the guests be short?
You don't have to have your party at night. How about a brunch party? Everyone's looking for an excuse to eat pancakes and drink mimosas over the weekend, aren't they?
It's easiest if the party is at your home church, though it can be somewhere public like a community center, restaurants or a bar, but you could also look into venues for rent (community centers, parks, historical areas, recreational or sports centers.);
, Usually only 20% to 25% of the invited guests attend. A good rule of thumb is ""the more the merrier."" However, you don't want your guests packed in like sardines, so consider the place you're working with and how many mouths you need to feed! If you want 200 people in attendance make sure you have ample time to create a minimum of an 800 e-mail guest list.


Remember, people always come late or sometimes never show. Also, if guests are bringing friends it could get out of hand rather easily. On the invitation, indicate whether or not it's okay to bring uninvited guests.

, Avoid ""80s"" or ""White trash trailer bash"" if you can -- those are parties your guests probably went to last week. How about a cartoon theme? Or a theme around your favorite TV show or movie? A location, a specific food (like one of those 24-layer cartoon sandwiches!), a concept, or a season work too.


Your theme can be as simple as a color. It would be easy to decorate and choose your food and drinks. Invite guests to wear this color, and have a contest for who wears the selected color the best!
As for this ""concept"" idea, your party could have its own occasion. A beer or wine tasting? Heck, a mac n' cheese tasting?! A holiday, a random day in history (Moon landing day, say), a murder mystery party, or even a superhero party taken to the next level -- where everyone walks in, in costume, to their own theme song playing!

, No more snail mail -- Use a Facebook page and approved apps, then text the people your friends (more about them helping you out later) and send a reminder a few days before the party, especially if you're asking your guests to bring dishes or goodies. And be sure to talk about your party with those around you! Gotta get the excitement pumping!


Do you want people to RSVP, bring a dish or a drink? Include this on your page/text/in your conversation! Otherwise you'll have 50 empty-handed people show up to your door. Oi.

, Throwing a party can get expensive. Ridiculously. Buying food and drinks and decorations, we're talkin' serious money. If you're contemplating going to the nines, consider budgeting. X amount of money for food, X amount of money for drinks, etc. Whatever doesn't fit gets scrapped. Parties aren't fun if the bank is broken.


This is the reason a pot luck-type fest, decoration and money donations are a good idea. When your guests have duties, it takes pressure off of you, guarantees attendees -- an on time, presentation, and money. So if ""on a shoestring"" is more your style, don't let it deter you from partying -- just expect help from the people enjoying it! Make sure you start 6 month out to get item or money donations and 2 months out for pot- people and organizations need to budget their donations, so be sensitive to those on tight budgets.

, No party is complete without food -- if you want your guests to stick around, provide food. But you also don't want to spend the next three days glued to the kitchen, so what do you do? The party has to be fun for the host, too!


Consider a DIY-style food service. Have all the ingredients for tacos, sundaes, breakfast, or anything your heart could imagine. And it's another element of fun for your guests when they feel like they're doing something, it gives them something to talk about and enjoy.
Have finger foods available for guests as soon as they enter. Something they can pop in their mouth in the blink of eye. They'll be content from moment one! Anything from veggies to chips to fruit to cheese to dessert is good! Also, finger food is easy and quick to prepare, too.

, Think DOA -- drinks on arrival. Just like the food, you want your guests sated as soon as possible. Having something to drink from the get-go allows you freedom from worrying about serving, in addition to all your other responsibilities as people trickle in.


You could have a signature drink for the entire night (matching the color theme?) Just for the record, having a bowl of punch is efficient and tasty, and you could also have DIY cocktails too (set up everything for martinis with a little instruction sheet in the corner, for example). Or just a big ol' tub of alcohol and soda!
Take care of your DDS, if you have them. Don't relegate them to drinking water or Diet Coke. Have flavored syrups available for homemade soda, or splash up that tonic water with fruit juices and garnishes.

, Arrange it so that you won't be distracted from being a good host/hostess by the need to tend to the music. Putting your iPod on shuffle just means something embarrassing like the Oklahoma! soundtrack will start playing or worse, someone will steal your iPod. So set up music that keeps it pumping and that no one will be walking away with.


Wireless speakers are a good investment if you don't already have them. Design a playlist now of all songs that meet your party needs. This is a great activity for a committee and the committee members can include their teenage children to help! Make sure the playlist is long enough so repeating will go unnoticed. When the party rolls around, you hit ""play"" and your DJ-ing job is done!

, This is another good activity for a decorations committee. Your theme should make this a lot easier -- once you know it, you can narrow down what you need and let the committee handle it. If you don't want traditional decorations, use tablecloths and/or place-mats and the like, for easy clean up. Here's a bare minimum checklist of things to have:


Tablecloth and/or placemats
Matching plates/cutlery/napkins
Centerpiece for table(s)
Lights
Party favors, seating tags, drink tags, etc.

, Your home probably isn't ideally set up for a party yet. You want easy access to the bathroom, the food and drinks from just about anywhere, and loads of lounging space. So where will everything be? Do you have enough chairs? How about the music?


Make sure everything you DON'T want messed with doesn't get messed with if you're in a location that has important or necessary items for it organization. So, designate a catch-all space for all things that your guests are not welcome to get near; breakable goods, antiques, valuables.

, If you have a small guest list and know exactly who is coming, consider having a few personalized items to make them feel special and to remember the party. It can simply be a specially-decorated cupcake, a table centerpiece, a favorite dish, or a glass that's all their own.


If you're using the same glassware, have a drink marker to identify their drink with as a simple, personalized touch. These can take the place of name tags. Never have over 20 people in a room without some type of name tags and a mingler game! With all the labels and things you can print off the Internet, you have no excuse!

, We're not going to beat around the bush here: if you're having a party with alcohol, children or teens drunk proof and kid proof everything. You'll regret not doing so way before morning when it rears its ugly head. Lock doors that you do not want children behind unchaperoned or provide a chaperoned area. Get the pillows and Advil ready and have the carpet cleaner on standby


It's your party, so you are responsible for your guests. If drunk driving is an issue, take their keys when they arrive. Hide them and only give them back when they're sober enough to drive. You're not being a square -- you're saving your butt if something were to go wrong.

, ALWAYS have a clean-up committee. What's worse than a great party and a huge mess to clean up afterward? A good party and a huge mess to clean up afterward with no cleaning supplies. So when you're buying your cream cheese and vodka, take a gander through the cleaning section. You'll need some paper towels, some garbage bags, some sponges, and some cleaning spray, if you don't already have these.


Ideally, you've roped a few friends into helping you clean up afterward. Either that or you've prepared a really effective guilt trip for them before they walk out the door. Even seen clean up games for adults where groups are assigned areas and the winning group gets a nice prize. You're a good guest to them, right?

, Delegate. DELEGATE! The time has come: your party is going to start soon. Grab a few close buddies and delegate duties. Or plan in advance and ask specific people or groups to be responsible for specific tasks. It only helps your attendance and trains volunteers to be future leaders. This might sound tyrannical, but it can actually make them feel more involved -- so long as you're not giving them bathroom duty! Have someone set up the table, someone or a committee doing the decorations, and time will fly by.


Consider delegating your guests, too, as a party idea. When guests are given a job not only do they feel like they're part of the party magic but then they have to come! One person can bring a dessert, one person the ice, etc. Only together do you have a party -- with way less responsibility on your part.

, People need to be able to circulate, sit down, and use the washroom. Make sure there is handicap access and that bathrooms are geographically close. Rearrange the furniture as needed and planned out in your setup. Stash supplies somewhere accessible, but safe -- when you run out of something, you'll be prepared. The place has to be functional for you, too!


To a certain extent, it's just going to get messy. So while you should have a clean floor, a clean toilet, and a clean table, don't bust out your toothbrush and start etching away years of grime. You can do that after the party, when you're already on your hands and knees mopping up patches of mysterious sticky goo.

, This can be as simple as throwing on a tablecloth and waiting for the potluck dishes to show up or as extravagant as lining the entire room in glitter snowflakes, making fake snow, and turning the AC on high. Luckily, there's no wrong way to go about it.


The one thing you shouldn't forget, it's lights. People love shiny things, especially if your party is outside. So, tiki torches, candles, Christmas lights (or variations thereof), and light-up decorations put the icing on the cake. Think what a lighting committee could come up with to add that extra something!
If your party is hard to find, put up signs! Going to a new place can be nerve-wracking, especially with the fiasco that parking can be. A few signs can alleviate your guests' frustrations. This applies to not only parking, but bathrooms, chaperone rooms or large venues with large geographic area like churches. Don't make guest come into your party frustrated because you have sent them on a hunt to find your party on a large church or public center. Again.... think committees. A logistics committee is a sure fire winner where guests are concerned.

, This should only partly be your job -- you should be having fun, too! You might think of assigning this to particularly bubbly or extroverted attendees in advance. Give them a simple list of communication ideas. Maybe a different colored wrist band, glass or name tag. But do keep an eye on the feel of the room -- does the music need to be changed? Has anything run out? Are people mingling appropriately? Mix 'em up and get them talking if you have to! New people may need a nudge in the right direction.


You can suggest games or activities for your guests, too. Turn your sundae bar into a sundae eating contest or your cartoon sandwich into a photo shoot. It's normal for guests to want to follow the host's lead, so show them what kind of party you want to be having!
If you have different groups of friends present, you're the glue that brings them together. So break out your inner social butterfly and find ways to get them talking to each other. Remember to have a few mingler games on hand in case one flops or the party starts to become dull. Parties are so much more fun for everyone when new experiences are had and new relationships are made.

, A party can be raring for hours, but you have to know when to start suggesting people head for the exit. If it's 2 AM and you have to clean up a pile of red Solo cups the Egyptians would be proud of, don't feel embarrassed to start rounding them up like cattle. It's been fun, it's been real, but party time is over, folks. It's time to call it a day.


An easy way to do this is to start cleaning up. People will generally get the hint -- and hopefully they'll help out! Tell them you're very glad they came and you'll see them soon -- the next party should be on their turf! You'll bring your famous enchiladas.

Party like it's 1999.",How to Throw a 1990s Themed Party," The great thing about a 90s-themed party is that you can throw one anytime of year! It works for New Year's Eve, Halloween, the 4th of July or just any random Friday night. If you want to get clever, you can plan a 1999 themed party on the 9th of any month at 9 p.m.;
, If you're the crafty type, you can get really creative with the invitations. What's more 90s than a little bedazzling? If you'd rather keep it simple, find a picture of the cast of Saved by the Bell, add the event details and print them up.

, If you're into music or were alive during the 1990s, you'll especially enjoy this part. All kinds of music existed in the 90s, from boy bands to punk to Pearl Jam to Phil Collins.

, Your options are endless when it comes to 90s shoes, attire and hairstyles. For your footwear, think jelly shoes, Doc Martens or skater shoes. Your jeans can range anywhere from high-waisted and acid washed to wide-legged and distressed. Depending on which end of the decade you aim for, you can choose to play up the grunge and punk or stick closer to the neon 1980s. The same goes for your hair -- either crimp it and go big, or part it down the middle. (This advice works whether you're a guy or a girl -- that's the beauty of the 90s.)

, Food in one room, dancing in another, and a TV show or movie in another area is a great way to make sure all your guests find an activity they enjoy. You can pick an iconic 1990s movie to show during the party, or show a few episodes of Boy Meets World, Sabrina the Teenage Witch or Seinfeld. You can find many of these shows on Netflix or check them out for free from your local library.

, Food is timeless, so no need to go overboard with the theme in this area. Every party needs enough food, though, so don't skip this step! If you and your friends were children in the 90s, you can serve PBJ's, Squeezits and other childhood snacks.

, Just like the invitations, you can get as crafty as you want with this part. Streamers and balloons work for almost any party. Add a few posters of boy bands and Britney Spears and you'll be set!

, This part is self explanatory. Crank up the tunes, push play on the playlist you created and enjoy the party with your crowd of friends in 90s outfits!

Choose an appropriate size.,
Determine the size of restroom trailer (stations required) for your event.,
Decide on the features.,
Plan where the restroom trailer will be located at the event.,
Make sure there is an adequate electrical source.,
Some trailers are completely self-contained for their water supply, but some do require a garden hose hook-up which is normally a ¾” line and require to have 40psi of pressure, while other restroom trailers can increase their capacity with a hookup.,
Tow the restroom trailer to your event.,
Other items to consider in renting and setting up a restroom trailer are:


who is responsible for the cleaning of the interior of the restroom trailer if the event is longer than one day
who is responsible for having the waste tank pumped once it becomes full
will insurance coverage be required
will an attendant need to be at the restroom trailer during events to handle any potential issues

",How to Set up a Restroom Trailer," The size of the trailer you will need will be determined by the number of estimated people who will attend the event, how long the event will run and whether food and beverages will be served. Restroom trailers are normally sized in terms of number of “stations”. This is the number of toilets and urinals that can be used at the same time. For example if a restroom trailer has 4 toilet stalls for both males and females and 2 urinals this would be a 6 “station” restroom trailer. Along with number of stations the physical outside dimensions should also be considered to determine if you event has space for the restroom trailer.;
, With an expected attendance of 100 people for the 4 hour event a 2 station should be sufficient to accommodate the crowd. Any more than 100 and any longer in length of the event and a larger restroom trailer is suggested. As another example would be an event of 250 to 500 guests for 6 hours. This event would normally require 6 stations. Again, if the event is longer than 6 hours or if alcohol is served it is recommended that more restroom stations are offered.

, All will have the ability to connect an external fresh water source to the trailer. All will have the ability to have a large waste holding tank. And all will need to have access to an electrical supply source. The amenities of the restroom trailer may vary greatly from trailer to trailer.

, Will a towing truck be able to access the location? Is there a maintained road to the site? Will rain or bad weather change the road to the site? Is the access clear of narrow gates, trees and obstacles? Ideally, you need to have a level ground with access that is not obstructed with low hanging branches, low hanging power lines or fencing. A location should be chosen where the guests can see and get to the trailer easily but without taking away from the events appearance. Don’t forget to allow enough room for the steps to the trailer to be set up. For long-term rentals, placement is important for servicing and pick-up. A service truck must be able to get within 20 feet (6.1 m) of the drain valve on the trailers.

, Restroom trailers require electricity to run their lights, heating, air conditioning and pressure pumps for water. The larger the trailer the more electric that may be required to operate the trailer. Additionally, if the trailer is going to be used in the cold weather of winter it may be equipped with tank and room heaters which require additional electrical circuits. Larger models usually require two to four 20-amp circuits; in remote locations, a generator can be used to power the trailer. Smaller models require one or two 20-30 amp circuits for power.

, Even though locating these mobile restroom trailers near sewer or water hookups is convenient and less expensive, it is not absolutely necessary. Water can be trucked in and waste holding tanks that can contain up to 1,000 gallons (3,785.4 L) of water are available for rent along with the units.

, When renting a restroom trailer the restroom trailer provider normally will deliver the trailer to your desired location. The rental company will normally include delivery of the trailer as part of the rental fee but may charge extra for excessive distance for the delivery. If it is necessary to tow the trailer yourself if is important to know some of the basics of towing. It begins with having the proper sized tow vehicle. The trailer will have two very important weight indicators on a federal sticker located on the exterior of the trailer. By reviewing this sticker you can determine the actual weight of the trailer and the maximum weight the trailer is capable of hauling with cargo on board. The only normal cargo weight of major consequence for a restroom trailer is the weight of the waste and water inside of the tanks. The UVW (unloaded vehicle weight) is the actual weight of the trailer without any water or waste weight. This UVW is sometimes referred to as the “curb weight”. Your truck must have as a minimum the ability to tow this listed weight. On average a restroom trailer may weigh 6000 lbs. This would require at least a ¾ ton sized truck to tow the trailer. The other important weight listed on trailer is the maximum weight of the trailer. This is the GVWR (Gross vehicle weight rating) and refers to the maximum weight the frame structure, tire and axles are designed to carry. This is confusing some times because this weight included the UVW which the amount the trailer weighs along with the cargo weight. So for example if a trailer weighs 6000 lbs as listed in the federal sticker on the side of the trailer and the GVW rating is 10,000 lbs, the maximum the cargo that the trailer could carry is 4,000 lbs. With water weight of 8.33 pounds per gallon the maximum gallons of weight the trailer could carry is 480 gallons (1,817.0 L) of waste.


Truck Towing Requirements. Another key component of your towing vehicle is the hitch. Most truck bumpers are not capable of carrying the hitch weight of the normal restroom trailer and require a professionally installed towing hitch. See a professional hitch installer. All trailers are equipped with some type of braking system. The most common is the electric brakes. To operate this braking it requires your towing truck to have an electrical brake system to be installed in your truck. This brake controller on your truck operates in conjunction with the brakes on the truck so that as you push the brake peddle on your truck it activates the electric brakes on the trailer. Most restroom trailers are equipped with heating and air conditioning. For cold climates, some of our equipment is fully winterized to ensure proper function even in freezing weather.

Plan carefully and in advance.,
Line up help.,
Have a time limit for the party.,
Have kid-centric food.,
Have appropriate games.,
Send them away happy.",How to Throw a Successful Party1," What you really don't want to be doing is flying around a few hours before the party trying to get food and decorations and goodies all sorted out. You also want to make sure that you know who is coming to the party, so you want invitations to go out at least a few weeks in advance.Make a list of the food you're going to have, the decorations and games you're going to need, what your budget is. This way you won't be caught by surprise when the party suddenly rolls around.
Have a people limit. Make it clear to the parents of the kids who are coming whether siblings are allowed, what the age group is going to be, and whether or not they need to stick around with their child (the answer to that is yes, yes they do). Some people will ignore your request, but at least it will be out there and will make the more polite parents do as they are asked.;
, Make sure that your family knows what they need to do to help you out. Do not attempt to run a children's party all on your own. You will end up exhausted and worn out, no matter what, but having people to help with things like set-up and clean-up and the games can make everything 100 times easier.


Ask family members or close friends to lend a hand with the party (especially if they've got a kid coming to it). It can be something as simple as bringing over some food, helping put up decorations, or even pick up the cake if it's a birthday party and you can't.
Have your kid help you make the invitations and the decorations. This can be a fun process for both of you. It will lend a kid's touch to the proceedings, which is really what it's all about, right?

, If you don't do this, there are going to be meltdowns from the children and you'll end up as a de facto babysitter for some of the kids who aren't yours. By having a specific time that you start and end, you'll make sure that people get their kids out of the way before all the tantrums start.If your child is at the age where they're still napping, make sure that you don't schedule the party right during nap-time. That's basically a recipe for a meltdown. Keep to their schedule as much as possible, by having it in the morning before the nap or in the afternoon after the nap.
Keep the party short (unless it is a sleepover, in which case, you'll want to limit the number of guests). Have the party go for about 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours. This will help make sure you and your helpers don't get too exhausted.

, Even if you're a health nut about what food your kid eats, you can still make it so the food at the party is food that they like and that the other kids will like. Parties are supposed to be fun and a little out of the ordinary (especially if it's a birthday party, or a party for a holiday like Halloween).


Try to avoid really messy foods. This is why chips and snacks are so good for children's parties, because they're easy to eat while you're running around. For example: spaghetti and meatballs is probably not a good choice for a kid's party, especially one with lots of younger children.
Depending on the type of party you can style the foods to go along with the theme. For example: for a Halloween party you might have cookies shaped like pumpkins, or delicious pumpkin bars. You could have baked pumpkin seeds, peeled grapes (eyeballs!), and that sort of thing.
It can be a fun idea to have a build your own ice cream sundae or cupcake. Set out bowls of different sprinkles and different things they can build for dessert. Make sure that you've put out newspapers underneath, because sprinkles will get everywhere.

, Whatever kind of children's party you're throwing, you want to make sure that the children are properly occupied. In the time that you have (1 1/2 hours to 2 hours) you'll probably want to have 1 or 2 activities. Too many and the kids will be all over the place and too few games, the kids will get bored.Make sure that you have some activity planned right off the bat. This eases the awkwardness and gets all the kids involved in something, so that they aren't just running all over the place.
Scavenger hunts are great fun for kids. The level of difficulty can be raised or lower depending on the age of the children. They can also be adapted to a variety of themes (Pirate treasure hunt, a princess scavenger hunt, find a pumpkin scavenger hunt). Simple make sure that there are prizes for all the children.
Avoid competitive games. You especially want to do this for younger children. Competitive games mean winners and losers and the losers will inevitably start to cry. To avoid that, have games like freeze tag where no one actually wins or loses.

, This is an especially good idea for a birthday party, because (especially amongst the youngest crowd) tantrums may be thrown because they want gifts too. To avoid this, have a little something for each child so that they feel included.


Have goody bags. Most kids don't care that much what is in the goody bag, they just like that they're getting something. Have it be a cheap, small thing that goes along with the party's theme (a sparkly princess hair clip, or a pirate's eye patch). If you don't want to overload them with candy, too, have a thing of animal crackers instead.
You could also do a craft project that they can then take home with them. Do something like make tie-dye (there are really easy kits out there, so that it doesn't turn into a huge mess), or get a bunch of different fun beads to make necklaces, or have them draw something related to the theme of the party.

You can pick out Mexican-themed party invitations at most party stores or make your own.


Consider using patterned stationary. Look for paper with a chili pepper border or something similarly festive.
Instead of using standard card-style invitations, consider printing your invitations on plain paper, rolling them up, and tying them with a bandana.
If you do opt for card-style invitations, throw a handful of confetti in the envelop for a fun surprise.;
, Invest in a few CDs from popular Latin music artists or stream festive Mexican folk music through your computer.


You can search for a specific online radio station that only plays Mexican music, but an easier option would be to select or build a Mexican music station on Pandora or a similar Internet radio website.

, Classic party decorations can work well at a Mexican-themed fiesta, but to make them fit the occasion better, choose red, white, and green decorations.


These are the colors of the Mexican flag, so basing your décor on this trio is a simple way to pay homage to the culture the holiday celebrates.
Use this color scheme when selecting tablecloths, napkins, plastic utensils, and paper plates.
Don't be afraid of being cliché. Hang streamers and inflate balloons. Provide party hats. This is a time to cut loose and relax, so you and your guests shouldn't have to worry about maintaining appearances.
For an evening fiesta, place colorful candles in lanterns or luminaries and scatter them around the party space.

, Flowers and plants can set the tone of any party, and your Cinco de Mayo fiesta is no exception.


Display a few potted cacti in colorful pots. Make sure that these prickly decorations are kept out of the reach of small children, though.
Create a simple centerpiece by filling a wooden bowl with various citrus fruits, like lemons and limes.
Use sunflowers. Place a single sunflower stem in a glass jar or bottle. Set up a few of these and use them as centerpieces or other decorations.If real plants don't appeal to you, you can make dozens of colorful tissue paper flowers to display, instead.

, Throwing a few undeniably Mexican elements into your décor can give it an added boost of authenticity.


Consider displaying the Mexican flag or decorating each table with a miniature Mexican flag.
Similarly, you can display a few full-sized sombreros or scatter a few miniatures around. If your fiesta is small enough, you can even give each of your guests a sombrero to wear.
Keep a few sets of maracas lying around for your guests to shake and rattle during the more exciting moments of your party.

, Instead of preparing a small number of impressive-looking appetizers, set a spread of tortilla chips, salsa, and guacamole.


This option is both popular and practical since chips and dip can serve a large crowd for a relatively low cost.
To save time, you can buy commercial sauces and spice them up with a few fresh ingredients. Mix a mashed avocado and spritz of lime juice into a jar of guacamole or a few chopped cherry tomatoes into a jar of salsa.If you want to include something for the rare guest who doesn't enjoy chips, you can still prepare something simple by setting out cubes of fresh tropical fruit, like pineapples and mangoes.

, Delight the adults at your fiesta by serving a few simple yet classic Mexican beverages.


Mexican beer is the simplest option. Any export brand provided by Group Modelo will work, including Modelo, Pacifico, and Corona.
Consider serving shots of tequila or preparing tequila-based cocktails, like the Margarita.

, Unless you're having an adults-only party, you'll need to include a few non-alcoholic beverages for those under the age of 21.


Even if you are having an adults-only fiesta, the designated drivers in attendance will appreciate your consideration if you provide some non-alcoholic options.
Mock-margaritas, mock-daiquiris, and similar drinks are a good way to make everyone feel included. For something simpler, you could buy Jarritos (Mexican soda).

, This option is simple to prepare and allows your guests to customize their own food to their liking.Set up separate stations: one for the tortillas, one for the meats, and one for the toppings.
Offer both flour and corn tortillas. You can also consider providing both soft and hard shells.
Provide two to four kinds of meat. Chicken and ground beef are the simplest to prepare, but you can also include strips of seasoned steak and shredded pork if you're feeling bold.
Get creative for your fillings and toppings. Shredded cheese, lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and sour cream are a few basics worth setting out, but you can also include options like Latin-style rice, refried beans, pico de gallo, and black beans.

, No fiesta is complete without a sweet treat to enjoy at the end.


Purchase flan from a Mexican bakery or learn to make your own flan.
Other popular Mexican desserts include sopaipillas, churros, fried ice cream, and fried plantains.
If you're not much of a baker, a simpler option would be to locate the nearest Mexican bakery and ask for a dessert recommendation. Alternatively, visit a Mexican grocery and walk down the baked goods aisle for something both authentic and easy.

, This is a class party game both kids and adults can enjoy. You can make your own piñata or buy one from a store.


The kids version should be filled with candy, stickers, and small toys.
If you want to create an adult gag version, consider filling it with things like tiny plastic bottles of alcohol or scratch-off lottery tickets.

, Most of your guests will probably recognize the sombrero as a symbol of Mexican culture, and the Mexican hat dance is a tradition that encompasses that symbol. Take the concept of the Mexican hat dance and adapt it to a party game.


Hire a professional to teach an authentic Mexican hat dance to your party guests. Consider asking the professional to teach other Latin dances, as well, like the salsa, samba, rumba, bachata, or folklorico.
Ask your guests to perform their own versions of the Mexican hat dance. Have awards for things like “the most original hat dance” and “the most authentic hat dance.”
Host a Mexican hat dance relay. Split into two teams. Place two sombreros (one for each team) an equal distance away, then have the team members run to their sombrero and back. Once they reach the sombrero, each teammate should do their version of the Mexican hat dance. Reward the team that finishes first.

, Challenge the bravest of your guests to see how many chili peppers they can eat before the heat becomes too much for them. The guest who can eat the most peppers or the hottest pepper wins.


Another twist on this game is to have a heat guessing contest. Buy a variety of peppers and ask your guests to guess how hot each one is before biting into it. The guest who guesses right the greatest number of times will win.Mildly hot peppers include pepperoncini, banana peppers, and pimentos. Hotter options include jalapenos, chili, poblano, and habanero.
Have glasses of milk waiting on standby for your brave guests. Milk will take the edge off the heat better than ice water can.

, Hide enough of each item for every team to find one, then reward the team that gathers all the items first.


A few possible items for your scavenger hunt can include: miniature Mexican flags, dried chili peppers, sombreros, maps of Mexico, packets of taco sauce, miniature cacti, limes, and tissue paper flowers.
When setting up a scavenger hunt for kids, however, you should avoid using items that could cause injury, like cacti and chili peppers.

Plan in advance.,
Pick a type of party.,
Set a time.,
Get the pieces of the party together.,
Set up zones for the party.,
Make sure there is appropriate supervision.,
Clean up afterwards.",How to Throw a Successful Party2," Throwing a party for a teenager can be a difficult process, since what they think is cool and what their parents think is cool, often are in entirely different universes. You will want plenty of time to check in with them about what they would like, or if you're the teen planning the party, you'll need plenty of time to check in with your parents and talk to your friends.


Budget the party. See what you can spend on things like food, drinks, decorations, music, and so on.
Have the teen deal with invitations. Again parents usually don't understand what is cool or embarrassing for their teenagers and handwritten invitations could be just the ticket to loserville at school. Let them decide how they're going to invite people, as long as it's the agreed-upon guests and not open to every person in school.

, While a theme party might not be cool enough for your teen, there are lots of different kinds of parties to have. Is it a birthday party? A holiday party (like Halloween)? A graduation party? Each of these will require different decorations (if the teen wants decorations) and, sometimes, different foods.


You should also think about the type of party in terms of its location. A beach front party with a bonfire is going to require different set up and energy to pull off than a Halloween party at your house. An outside party is going to require weather preparations (having an area nearby that's under some sort of cover, for example).
Remember, a girls sleep-over is going to be very different from a graduation party. For the former, a chaperone or parent will simply need to make sure that the girls aren't sneaking out, otherwise you don't usually have to worry about them. The latter type of party is more likely to get out of control and will need supervision.

, You want to make sure that the teen's friends can make it to the party, so try for advance notice for a bigger party, like a birthday bash or Halloween extravaganza (a couple weeks, at least). For a smaller party, you usually won't need as much time, unless it's a really important party.


Avoid school nights and Sunday nights during the school year. Teens should, hopefully, be rested for school and have time to do their schoolwork. Partying will cut into that time.
Make sure that the parents of the invited teens know what's going to be happening at the party .

, Pulling everything together will make the party successful. This means having the right food and the right music. If you've planned it out beforehand, this part shouldn't be too difficult.


For food, you want something that is easy to snack on. Chips and dip, pretzels, candy and cookies, pizza, and some cut up veggies and dip, are all great choices. You could also cut up some fruit and have a fruit platter. If you put some chocolate dip in the middle you'll have a fun (and somewhat healthy) option.
Let the teens provide music themselves. They will typically have iPods and phones packed with their types of music. Simply hook up some speakers and an MP3 hook-up, so they can have it louder to dance to. If you're worried about the neighbors, make sure to test it beforehand and check in with them.
For drinks you'll want sodas and water. Remember, unless the drinking age is 18 or less, you could get in trouble for having alcohol at the party, even if you didn't provide it.
It's a good to use paper plates and cups and forks to make for less clean-up afterwards. Teens aren't usually that picky about what they use to eat with. If you're environmentally conscious, there are usually biodegradable paper plates and things that you can use.

, Again, this can depend on the type of party, but it's usually a good idea to have different designated areas for different activities, like dancing, playing Foosball, video games, an eating area.


Make sure that you've provided obvious trash containers in each area. This will make it easier for them to be less messy and have the clean-up be easier.
It's best if the teen figures out where each area to be (with adult consent) because they know their friends and peers best.

, While having a chaperone hovering nearby can be off-putting for teen parties, not having some sort of supervision can result in a lot of poor decision-making by the teens have the party.


If it's an adult doing the supervision, Try to be somewhere else during the party. For example, if the party is at the teen's house, one of the parents or an older (responsible) sibling should be in one of the other rooms of the house. Occasionally, check up on the party by doing a walk-through on the way to the kitchen or the bathroom.
If there's someone who is in their late-teens, or twenties that is trustworthy, see if they will chaperone the party. They'll be a lot cooler than a parent, but will still be able to keep the party from getting out of hand.

, It's best to have the teen clean-up as a part of their learning process. They have the party, they have to clean-up afterwards. It should also make it less likely that the party gets out of control because they know that they'll be taking care of whatever happens.


Have a few friends stay afterwards to help with the clean-up. Put on some music to make it more enjoyable.

Clean up.",How to Throw a Successful Party3," It's best to decide this in advance so that you're able to invite the people you want and have the party that you want. Choosing the date will tell you how much time you have to get things ready.


Unless you're only having a small get-together, you'll want to make sure that your guests have enough time to plan to make your party.
You also want to take into consideration things like the weather, other events that are happening, when you're picking the date. For example: you don't want to plan an outdoor party in the middle of winter (or if you do, you'll want to make sure both yourself and your guests are prepared).

, You will need to know how much money you have to spend on the party since this will mean that you may need to come up with creative solutions in terms of food and drinks and entertainment.It's a good idea to set out how much money you're willing to spend in certain categories: drinks, food, entertainment, decorations, etc.
You can also think about what you would like to be able to do (have a 20s themed party, etc.) and figure out ways to make that possible on a limited budget (for example: print out prohibition era images, drape your lamps in fabric, tape bead chains to your ceiling, to give the effect of a 20s speakeasy).

, This could be a birthday party, a cocktail party, some sort of special celebration, or just a friendly get-together with your favorite people. How you prepare for the party will depend on how big it is, how lavish it is and what it is the party is about.


There are certain logistics to consider for different types of parties. For example, if you're planning a surprise birthday party for a friend, you have to make sure that they'll be available, that other people don't spoil the surprise, that you have a way to get the friend to the party, and so on.

, Now it's time to figure out who you're inviting and how many people you're inviting. This will depend on things like the timing of the party, what kind of party it is, and what your budget is.


If you're having the party in your house or a friend's house, consider how many people you can comfortably fit into it (or not; maybe you'll all be dancing up on one another).
If you've decided to have a nice dinner party, then you should probably keep down the number of people you're inviting. Make sure that you invite people you find interesting and who might find one another interesting. The worst thing is when you invite people who are really unsuitable for one another and don't mesh well (for example: your friend from your punk rock group and your boyfriend's corporate work cronies).

, Now that you know what kind of party you're having and how many people you're inviting it's time to figure out where you're going to have the party. If it's a dinner party or a small group of friends, it's fine to have it at your house or apartment. If it's going to be bigger you might want to start considering alternate options.


You also want to make sure that you're aware of the limitations offered by the different locations you're considering. For example: if you're having the party at your house and you only have a hot plate, or a very small stove, you might want to avoid food that you have to make, or you might want to farm out that task on a friend.
If your party is too big for your house consider different options like: having outside at the park or in a greenhouse, having it at a museum, going to a state park and having it there, renting some sort of hall.
Have the appropriate seating. If you're having a sit-down dinner you will definitely need to make sure that you have a seat for each person. Even if you're having a buffet style meal, you'll want to make sure that people can sit down and eat (otherwise you'll be having more spills to clean up).

, Parties have to have something that makes them enjoyable and makes them successful. This can be anything from a sweet playlist to a full scale swing band, board games (or something like Cards Against Humanity), a theme (like a noir murder mystery party), or anything you want.


The more people you have the harder it would be to have a party that is about games, because it would be hard to organize all those people (not impossible, if you really want to). For large parties having music and a dance floor is a good idea.
You can even do a craft style party (or a letter writing party). Have everyone bring there supplies; provide tea or alcohol and have at it.

, This is another reason why it's good to plan ahead, and also why it's good to ask people to bring something. You don't want to run out of drinks or food during the party.


A good idea for drinks is to have one signature drink (in addition to the beer and wine people usually bring). It could be something like champagne (classy); you can get Prosecco for half the price. You could also do something like a pitcher of Sangria, or margaritas.
Make sure that you have drinks for the nondrinkers and the designated drivers, if this is a party with alcohol. You can do something fun for them like having bubbly water with a little fruit juice and some fruit.
For some creative food ideas you might try fondue (you can have cheese fondue with bread and veggies and things, and a dessert fondue with bits of cake or strawberries dipped in chocolate). You could do your food buffet style and have a theme (like Mexican food night).
Have people bring a little something. To make the party planning and throwing easier on you, ask people to bring something, like some appetizers, a nice wine or some beer. This way all the food and drink planning won't rest entirely on your shoulders. A good idea is to make a list of the food and drinks that you want at your party. Mark down which ones you are capable (and your kitchen) is capable of handling and then ask your guests to pick something that they can bring.

, Make sure that you enlist a couple of your closest friends to help you clean up after the party so you aren't stuck doing it by yourself. Depending on the time of the party (afternoon, all night, morning, etc.) you may want to wait and clean up the next day.


Put on some music to help get you through the boring parts of the clean up and if you're with friends chat about the party and how much fun you had. It will make you less irritated that you're having to clean everything up, if you remember why you're doing it.

Have a theme.,
Have a slumber party.,
Have a dessert party.,
Have a tea party.",How to Throw a Successful Party4," While this may seem like a not so creative option, you can have many variations to spice it up. Theme parties are great both for parties where you'll be drinking and parties where you won't. You can even pair them with other options, like a '20s theme with a murder mystery, or a pun theme where you play Cards Against Humanity.


One theme idea is invent your superhero or villain. Come up with a costume and a backstory. This is a great mingling idea, because you can then spend a lot of the time asking people about their costumes.
Another theme idea is the pun party, where everyone dresses up as a pun. For example, you could be a wallflower and dress up as a flower against a wall (or a flower made of of bits of a wall).
You could also do the seven deadly sins as a theme and have each room in your house correspond to one of the themes. Everyone can dress up as a version of one of the sins, like carrying a mirror as Vanity.

, This is great fun because everyone can come dressed in their pajamas. Put on a movie, or pull out all those games you played in elementary school (like MASH, or Truth or Dare).


You could also have everyone help you build an awesome pillow fort and have everyone sleep in it that night.

, This is where all you have at the party are desserts and everyone has to bring their favorite dessert. You won't have to worry about alcohol or dinner, or anything like that. The desserts can even have themes (dessert from around the globe, etc.).


Some delicious dessert ideas are banana splits, hot fudge sundaes, different cakes and pies, a whole slew of ice cream (you could even make your own).
You can also have a baking party that turns into this. Have a bunch of friends over and make lots of different delicious desserts.

, These are lots of fun and you can make them as fancy or as simple as you need. Likewise, you can add another theme to this. For example, it could be a fancy dress tea party, or everyone has to dress up as a character from a novel, etc.


You could even go the Alice in Wonderland route have a mad tea party. Have everyone come dressed as characters from the book or movie, or just really crazily and have giant teacups and a dormouse (probably a stuffed animal is best).

Find your favorite films and songs from the 40s to set the mood of the party.,
Capture the glamour of the 40s in your decorations.,
Consider a Hawaiian Luau theme.,
Encourage 1940s dress.,
Serve the distinct tastes and drinks from the 40s.",How to Throw a 1940's Themed Party," The 1940s in America are characterized with many major political changes, but the decade contained many specific cultural changes that are frequently overlooked. If you are interested in film, you should know that Hollywood was booming and producing the world's most famous directors, such as Alfred Hitchcock, Frank Capra and Orson Welles, and memorable actors, such as Humphrey Bogart and the beginning of Marilyn Monroe. Familiarize yourself with the era, and explore what you like to get started.;
, Consider making them on cardstock paper, using black and white, or decorating them with piano sheet music. Write the address and time in script, and encourage your guests to come dressed as though it was the 40s.

, Jazz, the blues, folk, Big Band, and 'swing' music became very popular in the 1940s. It was also the era in which film really started to take off. Here are a few suggestions for songs and movies that can be playing at your party:


Pop: Frank Sinatra's Saturday Night (Is the Loneliest Night of the Week), or Bing Crosby's White Christmas, Swinging on a Star, I'll be Seeing You and Sunday, Monday or Always.
Jazz: Ella Fitzgerald's A-Tisket, A-Tasket, Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit, Frank Sinatra's Five Minutes More, Nat King Cole's Nature Boy, or Louis Armstrong's, When It's Sleepy Time Down South, and Coal Cart Blues.

Popular movies: Rebecca, It's A Wonderful Life, Casablanca, Citizen Cane, The Bicycle Thief, Pinocchio, Bambi, Dumbo, Miracle on 34th Street, or His Girl Friday.


, It was a dramatic, fabulous decade; black-and-white but also with many rich colors. Photography was developing and pictures from the decade are valuable antiques today. Balls and parties from the era were legendary. The decorating is all in the details. Here are a few ideas for decorating your tables and recreating a 1940s atmosphere:


Hang posters and place photos all around. There are many famous war propaganda posters, such as I want YOU for the U.S. Army and many encouraging women to join the effort, such as We Can't Do It Without Them or Rosie the Riveter's We Can Do it. There were many posters advertising local bars, movies, and soda (there were many for Coca-Cola at the time). Find a few printable posters, or purchase some vintage ones from a thrift store, and hang them around. Put a few photos of famous musicians from the era in ornate picture frames, and place them on tables.
Make centerpieces with war items (model airplanes, trench helmets, camouflage, etc.), glitzy candle holders, trumpets, piano sheet music, strings of pearls, mason jars, party blowers, and vintage radios.
Hand out ice cream cones, glass bottles of Coca-Cola, rock candy, candy buttons, homemade, colorful 40s party hats, and party favors in bags or jars tied with twine.
Include black and white as a part of your décor. Black-and-white is a clear indication of the 40s period; coordinate your food, desserts, tablecloths, and party favors with the colors to create the distinct black-and-white feeling.

, With Hawaii's heavy involvement on the American front and with many American soldiers stationed there, Hawaiian culture became popular in mainland America.


Include vintage Hawaiian posters and postcards, and brightly colored faux flowers, Tiki cups, Tiki poles, Tiki huts, leis, lights, lanterns, and garlands. Consider fashioning a bar lined with Hawaiian luau skirts and leis.

, The fashion industry in the 1940s was booming, and clothing for the common person was a definition of status and class. People dressed to the nines wherever they went, especially to balls and parties. Encourage your guests to incorporate these items into their outfits (check out How to Dress in American 1940s Fashion for more information):


Women: mid-calf or knee-length, hourglass dresses with high heels and complicated undergarments. Accessorize with shoulder pads, luxurious hand-bags, gloves, cat's eye glasses, and heavy makeup (red lipstick, mascara, eyeliner, etc.).
Men: grey, double-breasted suits with wide-leg trousers. Accessorize with hats (fedoras were especially worn). Post-war, many men wore casual shirts as a part of the Hawaiian trend.
Children: girls wore dresses with frills (sailor dresses especially), large woolen coats, and Mary Janes for shoes. Boys wore trousers, sailor suits, or knickers. Both sexes wore jeans, denim, and corduroy as the style became more popular, and saddle shoes.

, American cuisine in the 1940s was decadent, flavorful, and rich. Here are a few suggestions on meals and drinks to serve that contain that 1940s flavor:


Endive salads
Watercress and grape salads
Frozen fruit salads
Clam chowder
Sweet-Sour Carrots, cooked carrots in a sugary, vinegar sauce.
Stuffed olives or stuffed celery
Canapes
Deviled Chicken, a greasy, fried chicken in a mustard, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce.
Gingerbread
Caramel custard
Oatmeal cookies
Cola Marsh Ice, a marshmallow, coca-cola dessert
Scotch shortbread, or Gold Nugget cake, a banana shortcake
Lemon Merengue Pie, Icebox Pie, or deep dish apple pie.
The most famous cocktails from the 40s were the Martini and the Manhattan. For the martini, use 1 part vermouth, 2 parts gin, and 3 olives; serve it chilled and strained into a martini glass. For the Manhattan, use 1 part vermouth, 2 parts bourbon, and a splash of bitters; chill, strain, and serve with a cherry.

Gather up everybody who is helping you out, and review.",How to Start an Anime Convention," This will be your crew helping you pay off those giant charges, and helping you get the job done. Make sure these people are very trustworthy, smart, hard-working, but also fun with brilliant ideas. Meet after-school every day or form a secret website for you and them to plan out on.;
, A good brainstorming list is: hotels, universities and convention centers good for the con, some possible convention guests, departments you might need, problems you could run into, getting attendees, people who might want to join staff, who's going to pay for the hotel deposit, should you form an LLC or corporation, taxes you'd have to pay, a list of possible con expenses and a list of events. Fell free to write your own brainstorming list anytime.

, The best conventions normally happen during the summer, but you can make yours anytime. Location matters, too. You wouldn't want your convention to be all the way down in Houston while you live in Baltimore, now do you?

, Look closely at the time of it and its location. Don't hold it too close in date or location.

, Next is a very critical step. Doing it right is the difference between getting what you want and getting a horrible deal. In this step you will be asking the hotel/convention center you choose to hold the convention for information. Look for the ""Request for Proposal"" form. This will tell them the space that you need and it will clarify you are planning. Don't go into stuff the hotel doesn't understand.

, Most actors can charge up to $10,000 per day of convention! Make sure your team has the money they need.

, You can ask some classmates, or email some friends. Make sure these people are not snobs, are trustworthy, and know what to do.

, You can make some flyers to give to people at school or make an advertisement on the computer. If advertising is against your school's law, secretly hand them out or ask permission from the school's administration team.

, Most of your hotels will respond in the next few days. They’ll provide you with a “proposal”, and some will send you their contract directly. You need to review each one and take notes of key points:


How much do you pay for the space if you get zero hotel rooms and zero dollars in catering? This is your “base price”.
How many hotel rooms are they offering you? This is your “base room block”.
Multiply the number of rooms by number of nights to get your “base room nights”. 50 rooms at 2 nights each is 100 room nights.
What is the price you pay if your attendees fill all the hotel rooms? This is your “discount rate”.
How much will attendees pay per night for a hotel room? This is your “room night price”.

Wander around the room.,
Make eye contact.,
”Die” if you’ve been winked at.,
Solve the crime.,
Say “I accuse!” If you think you know who the wink murderer is, you raise your hand and say “I accuse!” A second person must “second” the accusation.",How to Play Wink Murder1," Wink murder is a fun game to play with friends, family, and even strangers as an icebreaker. It works best if you have at least ten people, but no more than thirty, as the game may take too long., Wink murder is convenient because it can be played indoors or outdoors. That means you can play in your living room, on your deck, in the park, anywhere you can imagine. Just pick the location that works best for everyone playing.


Everyone will be walking around, so when picking a location the only thing you might want to consider is space. Make sure everyone has room to mingle and sit or stand comfortably.

, Pick one person to be the moderator. The moderator will stand out of the game to pick the “wink murderer” and facilitate.


Everybody can take turns being the moderator. That way, every person gets the chance to play.

, Everyone sits or stands with their eyes closed while the moderator walks around and picks a “wink murderer.” No peeking!


The moderator can tap a person’s shoulder to signify they’ve been chosen as the wink murderer. This method keeps it a secret to everybody else playing.

, Once the wink murderer is chosen, everybody stands up and wanders around the room. You can make casual conversation. Chat about the weather or what you ate that day.


To get into the game even more, everybody can pretend to be detectives and speak like they’re on a crime show. Your conversations can be about clues and predictions.

, The key to the game is that everybody must make eye contact with each other. While most people are just chatting and looking at each other, the wink murderer is trying to make eye contact and wink at you without others noticing. This is how he “kills you.”

, If you make eye contact with the wink murderer and he winks at you, you have been “killed.” Wait a few seconds after the wink murderer kills you and then pretend to die. Once you have died, sit off to the side and observe the game until it’s over.


Dying dramatically makes the game even more entertaining. Clutch your heart or gasp with loud noises and fall to the ground. See how creative and dramatic you can be.Make sure you wait a few seconds after the wink murderer kills you. If you die right away, you’ll give the mystery away too easily.

, While you’re chatting with everyone, pay attention to your surroundings and try to figure out who the wink murderer is. Just be careful you don’t make eye contact with the wink murderer.

, If there is a second, you yell the name of the person you suspect and the person who seconded you yells the name of the person they suspect. The accused must say “yes” (they are the murderer) or “no” (they are innocent).The seconder may guess a different person. In this instance, the seconder is only penalized if the first person guessed incorrectly too. If the person who originally shouted “I accuse” guesses the murderer correctly, the seconder isn’t penalized because the game is over.
You can say “I accuse” at any point in the game. Just make sure you have a strong idea of who the murderer is because if you’re wrong, you’re out of the game.
If nobody seconds you, you cannot guess. Wait a minute and then try to guess again.
If you were incorrect, you must leave the game as penalty and the game continues until the killer is identified. The seconder must also leave if they are incorrect.
If you were wrong but the seconder was correct, they win the game.
If you were right, the murderer has been successfully caught which means you win and everybody can start a new round.

Gather a large group of people.,
Sit in a circle.,
Pick three murderers.,
Make conversation.,
Make eye contact and pay attention.,
Don’t die!,
Say “I accuse!” If you’ve been paying close attention and you think you know who the murderer is (or murderers are), you raise your hand and say “I accuse!” A second person must “second” the accusation.",How to Play Wink Murder2," You will want a minimum of 15 people because there are three murderers. If you tried to play with just a few people, the game would be over within seconds.

, Whether you’re sitting on the floor or in chairs, arrange yourselves in a circle. You want to be able to see everybody’s faces.


This version of the game is a seated version so you don’t have to walk around.
Make sure you’re comfortable. You’ll be in this position for quite a while, especially if you play multiple rounds, so grab a pillow and get comfy.

, Use a deck of cards and pick three cards (like the Joker, the red Queen of Hearts, and the black Queen of Hearts) to represent who the murderers are. Everybody draws a card and whoever draws the “murderer cards” are the murderers.


One murderer will wink at you to kill you. The second murderer will look at you and twitch to kill you. The third murderer will look at you and pout to kill you.Make sure the deck of cards you pick from is the same amount of people playing. If you have 15 people playing and an entire deck of cards, it could take a couple times before the three murderer cards are drawn.
You could also use scraps of paper with three of them marked “twitch”, “wink”, and “pout” if you don’t have cards. Everybody picks three pieces of paper so with this version, one person could potentially be all three murderers!, While everybody is sitting in a circle, make light conversation. The entire group can be engaged in one conversation or you can talk amongst the people around you. Just remember to watch everybody’s faces while you chit chat.


Your conversations can be about anything. Chat about your plans for the week, where you’d like to go on vacation, or what you did that day. You can use even use fake accents to get everybody laughing.

, Everybody must make eye contact with each other and pay attention to each others faces. The murderers are trying to kill you by winking, twitching, and pouting so you have to pay attention to what everyone is doing with their face to try and catch them.

, It takes three murders to be killed in this game. You must be killed by twitching, winking, and pouting so if you’ve already been murdered twice, be very careful not to get hit a third time.


Raise your right hand. If the wink murderer kills you, die by raising your right arm. Keep your arm raised for the rest of the game or until you’re out.Raise your left hand. If the twitch murderer kills you, die by raising your left arm. Keep your arm raised for the rest of the game or until you’re out.Cross your legs. If the pouting murderer kills you, die by crossing your legs. Keep your legs crossed for the rest of the game or until you’re out., If there is a second, you yell the name of the person (or persons) you suspect and the person who seconded you yells the name of the person (or persons) they suspect. The accused must say “yes” (they are the murderer) or “no” (they are innocent).The seconder may guess a different person. In this instance, if you are guessing the first or second murderer, the seconder would be penalized if they guessed incorrectly. If you were guessing the last murderer, the seconder wouldn't be penalized because the game would be over.
If you guessed incorrectly but the seconder guesses correctly, you are out and the seconder stays in the game.
If nobody seconds you, you cannot guess. Wait a minute and try again until someone seconds you.
You can guess one murderer at a time or if you think you know them all, you can guess them all at once. Be careful though because if you guess two or three murderers and are incorrect about even one of them, you're out of the game.
If you were incorrect, you must leave the game as penalty and the game continues until the killers are identified. The seconder must also leave the game if they are incorrect.
If you were right about one murderer, that murderer leaves the game and everybody continues playing until all of the murderers have been caught. If you guessed them all correctly you can play another round!

Ask guests to come to the park.,
Run activities that make the best use of the outdoor space.,
Provide food.,
Keep a close eye on the kids and their level of energy and enjoyment.",How to Throw a Child's Birthday Bash on a Budget1," Your child will have a fun birthday at the park with all of their friends with cake, ice cream, and presents too. At the same time, you will have more money left in your wallet, no before and after party cleaning of your house, and a pretty low maintenance party where you can actually stand (or sit) back and watch the joy on your child's face.


The park party has many benefits, including removing mess from your house, getting kids to let off steam and parents can hang around too, if they wish.;
, Most parks have pavilions that you can rent out. Sometimes they are pretty cheap. However, you can also just pick a good spot at the park that is open, meaning not crowded with people, and throw down a picnic blanket and some lawn chairs.


Sometimes you can get lucky and the pavilion won't be rented out and will be available for use, you just have to share with others if they wish to use any part of it.
Try to keep your special spot in a reasonable distance to a bathroom or port-a-loo.

, Guests can meet you there and bring their own blankets and chairs if necessary.

, There are many fun-filled activities that can be done at the park. It's a great place to bring a corn hole set, Frisbee, almost any kind of ball (baseball, kickball, dodge ball, football, etc.). Smaller children can also play games like Simon Says, Mother May I?, Red Light-Green Light, etc. Let your imagination run wild, and the children too––they are outside after all.


You can even play party music, as long as it's not disturbing others in the park. 

, Cake and ice cream? Bring a cooler with water bottles, sodas, and/or juice bags along with ice cream cups or sandwiches. Cakes are usually easy to transport.


Don't forget the paper plates and forks for the cake, unless you chose to bring cupcakes.
Also bring along a trash bag for easy clean up. 
If you want to incorporate a theme, you can do that with your paper products. You can get such items cheaply at the dollar store. If you can't find the theme you want at a low enough cost, a color scheme is cheap. 

, Be sure to switch to new activities when the current one begins to lag. Keep the energy and movement flowing, and the time will pass before you know it.

Glow-in-the-dark t-shirts for everyone. This will help you to find one another easily and is a lot of fun.

, Choose games that make the most of being in a darker environment. Just be sure to make the games age appropriate––nothing too scary for younger children. Also, be careful about bumps in the dark; use a space where there is nothing to bump into that could harm a child.

, Have a homemade cake and cupcakes that have been frosted with glow-in-the dark frosting. And, of course, have some ice cream and you've got a really fun party.

Activities can include water balloons, a sprinkler (what kid doesn't love running through the sprinkler?), water soaked sponges to toss, a slip and slide, etc.

, Invitations can be written with a sharpie on a balloon. Blow the balloon up and just hold it closed long enough to write the invite on it and then let the air out. When the guest receives it, they will have to blow the balloon up to see what it says. Fun!


Be sure to get the permission of all parents for children to use the swimming pool. Find out who cannot swim and request that parents supervise their own child.

, Have a birthday cake, sandwiches, crisps, cupcakes, vegetables and dip and other tasty foods. Keep the food simple and in small amounts, and ensure that food is eaten after the swimming has been finished, to avoid tummy aches.

Once teams are decided, have each team head to a separate room, or at least opposite sides of the same room.Alternatively, you could play a less competitive version of this game where players act out a word or phrase and anyone can answer. The person who gets it right first is usually the next to act things out.If you aren’t playing with teams, you can have the player act out a phrase they have picked out on their own. This can simplify the game by eliminating the need for slips of paper.;
, Now that teams are in different rooms (or at least on opposite sides), write out common words or phrases on slips of paper with a pen or pencil. Keep these secret! These phrases will be given to the opposite team to draw at random when it’s their turn.


There are six common categories in traditional charades: book titles, movies, TV shows, song titles, plays, and well-known quotes or phrases.
Generally, long phrases and foreign phrases are not allowed. When in doubt, poll your teammates. If half have heard it before, it should be fine.
Avoid writing down a single proper name on the slip. Without context, if a player doesn’t know who the person is, they’ll have a difficult time., You’re almost ready to get started. Fold each of the slips of paper in half so the word or phrase is hidden. Put these slips in a container and rejoin the other team in the room you’ll play the game. Exchange containers, but don’t look at the slips of paper!Baskets or hats are commonly used as containers for the slips, but in a pinch, you can get creative. Pull an empty drawer from a coffee table or use a pillowcase.

, Flip a coin to determine which team goes first (or something similar). Each round usually has a set amount of time, but you can adjust this depending on the age group and skill level of players. Two minutes might be a good starting time limit.

If you don’t mind rounds going on for a long time, you don’t have to use a time limit. In this situation, teams would try to guess until they gave up.
At this point, you might want to agree upon a penalty for anyone who speaks when they should only be gesturing. For example, you might deduct a half point or forfeit the round."
"
Have the starting player draw a slip.,
Convey general info to help your team narrow down their guesses.,
Act things out until your team gets it right or you run out of time.,
Play until you run out of slips or there is a clear winner.",How to Play Charades2," The team that won the coin toss starts things off. They should choose a single player to act out a slip first. All players on a team must act out a slip at least once before anyone can go for a second turn.If you have difficulty deciding who goes first, have the winner of a quick rock, paper, scissors tournament select a strip and get the game started.

, Things like the category and the number of words in the phrase will give your teammates a better idea of where to focus their guesses. You can come up with gestures all your own, but usually:

Holding up a number of fingers at the start of a turn indicates the total number of words.
Following this with another number of fingers indicates the word you’ll first act out.
Laying a number of fingers on your arm indicates the number of syllables for the word.
Sweeping your arms broadly through the air indicates “the entire concept.”, Some gestures you think will work out great turn out to be a dud. Don’t be afraid to switch to a new gesture. The more hints you give your team with gestures, the more likely they’ll be to figure it out.


When your team guesses the answer, the round ends and your team gets a point. Then the other team repeats this process.
If your team doesn’t guess the answer and time runs out, your team passes the turn without getting a point, then the other team tries., If you and your friends are having fun, you don’t have to stop when you run out! Split up and write up some new slips. In some cases, there might be a few really good players on one team, making things imbalanced. Reshuffle teams to make things more fair."
"
Discuss common gestures with all players.,
Express categories with standard gestures.,
Encourage guesses on the right track.,
Guide teammates to the right tense or form of words.,
Use similar sounding words to your advantage.,
Improve your game with practice and speed.",How to Play Charades3," Common gestures allow you to bypass concepts you'll have to express each turn, like categories, so you can get to the good stuff. But it would be unfair if a few players didn't know these, so run through common gestures with all players before starting., Because every word or phrase will fall into a category, it helps to have standard gestures for these. This way you don’t have to waste time thinking up a unique gesture on the spot and can instead focus on gestures useful for the words on the slip.


Indicate book titles by unfolding your hands, as though opening a book.
Gesture as though you are cranking old fashioned camera for movies.
Draw a square or rectangle in front of you to signify TV shows.
Pretend to sing (without actually singing) for song titles.
Pull on a rope to raise a theatre curtain to indicate plays.
Make air quotes with your fingers when your slip has a quote or phrase., When a teammate is close, allow excitement to show on your face. Use the distance between your fingers or hands to indicate closeness. To discourage teammates on the wrong track, point at them and shake your head “No” or form an X with your arms.If a teammate is on a roll and they seem like they might say the right word, us a beckoning “come here” gesture or roll your hands in a circle.
Moving your hands farther apart usually means “more,” but in some cases, this can also mean the word is “bigger,” like when it has a prefix or suffix.

, In some situations, your teammates might have the right word, but it might not be in the right tense, or it may need to be plural when they've said it in the singular. When a teammate is close, point to them and then:

Link your little fingers together to indicate a word is plural.
Wave your hand behind you in a “way back” gesture for past tense. Do the opposite of this for future tense., By cupping your hand to an ear, you’ll signal to your team that you’re only acting out a word that sounds like the one you’re working on. After that gesture, if you pointed to your eye, it would be obvious the word you’re working on is “I.”, The faster you clearly gesture, the more quickly your team will be able to guess your phrase. Practice by playing Charades often so gestures come to you naturally, without wasting time thinking.

If you have difficulty clearly expressing yourself through gestures and you really want to get good, take an improv class or a mime class.

If you are playing with a group of people who have never met, you will need to conduct an icebreaker before you start the game.;
, Make sure to get a blindfold for each person. Blindfolds can be purchased at a party supply store or made from bandanas or other fabrics.Unless you are skilled working with fabric, purchasing blindfolds is recommended to ensure that the blindfolds work properly.

, When blindfolded, it is easy to stumble or even fall. Safety should be the number one priority when using blindfolds.You may need to clear furniture away to create an empty space.


Make sure that no furniture is sharp or protruding from the edge of the room.
Blindfold activities should take place on grass, carpet, or other soft surfaces.

, This person will not wear a blindfold and will be responsible for watching everyone during the game.


A parent, older sibling, or relative is a good person to assign as a supervisor. You can also be the supervisor.

, If people are talking or distracted, make sure to get everyone to pay attention to you.


While blindfolded, no one should move quicker than a slow walking pace.
When touching other people during the game, everyone should touch gently from the neck and above.

, Have each person test their blindfold to ensure they cannot see anything through it.

, If you are playing with a group of people who don't know each other well, an icebreaker is a great way for everyone to meet.If your group is shy, you can start by introducing yourself first. Ask each person to share:


Their name.
Their favorite hobby.
One interesting fact about themselves.

Remember always to be appropriate with the way you touch one another."", Instruct everyone that the guessing will begin. Ask each blindfolded player to tell you who his or her partner is.


If everyone has just met, ask the blindfolded people to describe their partner if they don't remember their partner's name.

, Watch their reactions as they discover who their partner is.


Each person who succeeds in guessing their partner's identity, or is able to describe what they look like, wins.

, Have the other group put on their blindfolds and play the game again.


Keep switching roles and play as many times as you like.

Find a suitable group to play the Awkward Question Game.,
Decide on house rules.,
Agree on expectations.,
Build up to good questions.,
Continue to ask interesting questions.,
Have fun and laugh a lot!",How to Play the Awkward Question Game1," You might play this game with your best friend during a sleepover, or you could play with a group of friends when you're hanging out together. The goal of this game is to ask and be asked awkward questions, so you should be comfortable telling the people you play with personal things.


You should try to find a private place to play this game. You don't want someone you don't trust overhearing the answers to your awkward questions!
You might want to keep the ages of the people you play with close to your own. Older kids may ask questions that younger kids are less comfortable with.;
, There are many variations of the Awkward Question Game, and you and your friends can modify it so you have the most fun possible. You might make rules about who you can ask a question to, what kind of questions you are allowed to ask, the order in which you ask questions, and so on.


You could ask your questions directly to an individual, or you could ask a question and then have everyone answer it. Asking a question to the group is a good idea to prevent any one person from being picked on.
You could make a question limit to prevent someone from being targeted by others. For example, you and your friends might agree that you can't ask the same person a question two times in a row.
If you are younger, are concerned about bullying, or if your parents wouldn't like you playing the Awkward Question Game and asking inappropriate questions, you might make a rule to keep all questions rated PG. This means no one should ask questions or talk about things you wouldn't see in a PG rated movie., Some of your friends might not have played the Awkward Question Game before, and won't know what to expect. Take a moment before you start playing to make sure everyone is on the same page. Some appropriate expectations you might use could include:


You must answer every question honestly, unless you pass.
You can only pass on a question three times during the game.
You can't talk about answers you learn playing the game after the game is done.
Don't pry or pick on people after their initial answer. Any answer is OK.
Repeated questions are automatically skipped and the turn goes to the person on the left., Starting off with a super awkward question might make people feel uncomfortable and unwilling to play the game. By starting small, you can get everyone into the game, so that when it's time to ask a real awkward question, people are ready for it. Some questions you could use to start off the Awkward Question Game include:


What color underwear are you wearing?
What was the color of your last poo and how big was it?
What's the most embarrassing question your parents asked you in front of a friend?
What's the worst place you've ever had to go to the bathroom?

, While you're waiting for others to ask and be asked questions, think of new questions you can ask your friends. You might even get an idea from a question that one of your friends asks, so don't forget to listen up! Remember, the point of this game isn't to ask the most awkward question, but to bond with your friends and learn more about them. Some more example questions are:


What was your last kiss like?
Are you a virgin?
When was the last time you were caught farting and what happened?
Have your parents ever walked in on you doing something inappropriate?
Where is your most ticklish spot?, There's a different between laughing at someone and laughing with someone. Remember that some things embarrass others more than they might embarrass you, so try to be sensitive if one of your friends seems uncomfortable.

"
"
Come up with a manner in which people should answer questions.,
Include a point system and award a special prize.,
Make the questions beforehand.",How to Play the Awkward Question Game2," For example, you can write down many different kinds of accents on slips of paper before you start playing the game. Then you can put those slips in a hat. Every time a person has to answer a question, have them draw a strip from the hat and answer the question in the accent written on the paper.


Some accents you might use include: British, southern, French, German, Russian, valley girl, pirate, and more.
You could also write one-time rules on slips of paper, like ""Do not use the words ""the"" or ""a"" while answering your question.""
You can include challenges on your slips of paper, too. For example, one challenge might ask you to keep at least one hand on the table for the rest of the game. Failing the challenge might result in consequences, like having your turn skipped., There are many different ways you can award points while playing this game. If you've decided to use slips of paper with accents/rules, you could have everyone playing vote thumbs up/thumbs down after answering the question. In this case, a thumbs up would mean that person did a good accent or followed the rule, while a thumbs down would mean they didn't do a good job. If there are more thumbs ups than thumbs down, you can give the person who answered a point.


At the end of the game you can count up points to see who has the most. You never know - you may have a friend who is excellent at impersonating voices! The person with the most points could get a special prize, like a candy, a special seat while you watch a movie later, or something else!
Even a small reward can get your friends more interested in the Awkward Question Game. People tend to try their hardest and get more involved to achieve a goal., Even good people sometimes get carried away when playing games. Sometimes this can lead to someone's feelings getting hurt. To prevent questions from getting out of hand, you can write up the questions you will use for the game on slips of paper before you play. These can then be drawn out of a hat, paper bag, or laid face down and mixed up on the table where each can be selected. Picking a slip of paper would be the same as being asked a question.


To make your friends feel included, you might all come up with the questions together. This way no one is surprised by the questions, but no one knows which question they'll be asked.
You can include a few ""Wildcard"" slips with your questions. When a person draws a wildcard, she can ask anyone any appropriate question she wants.

Choose your players.,
Make sure no one is uncomfortable before you begin.,
Agree to a set of rules.",How to Play Truth or Dare1," The game requires at least three players, and more than seven or eight makes it take too long. Ask people to play that you know will get into the spirit of a game that can get embarrassing and weird! Now you can even play with your friends through an app (see the citation) -- but it might not be as fun if you’re not face to face., Explain the game and the kinds of things you do. Let people know it’s ok to decline to play. For those who are ok with it, gather the players into a circle. Sitting on the floor or at a table is a good way to get organized. Make sure you get comfortable., Write them down so that you can refer back to them if there are questions. One popular rule lets players choose the same thing only twice in a row. For example, if they choose truth two times in a row, their next turn has to be dare. It’s important to have ground rules beforehand -- both what you should and shouldn’t do -- so that you don’t get held up discussing it once the game begins.


What kinds of questions will be off-limits (if any)?
Where can dares occur?
Do people have to watch the person perform the dare?
Can dares involve people not in the game?
Can dares be done in the presence of adults?
What kinds of limits will you place on the dares?
Are we going to go around in a circle or spin the bottle so the player who is answering or doing the dare is chosen randomly?

Many confetti companies offer confetti products that can be used as party favors, such as confetti eggs and confetti cones. Additionally, decorative packaging is used to make the confetti more attractive to buyers.
Traditional confetti is made by shredding strips of paper or punching holes into colored sheets of paper to make tiny, round pieces of paper. To create custom designs, you'll need a pattern hole puncher. Ask at your local craft supplies store if they sell any, or go directly to the manufacturer to ask if they can create a unique design for you.

Make a list of questions.,
Think of some fun dares.,
Work with the other players to come up with questions if you’re having trouble.",How to Play Truth or Dare2," Each person needs to do this independently so they have a place to start when the game begins. Sometimes it’s hard to come up with good questions or dares while you’re in the middle of the game. Some possible truth questions might be:What is the most embarrassing thing to happen to you at school?
Who do you have a crush on?
If you only had 24 hours to live, what would you do?
What is the most disgusting thing you have ever done?
If you had to pick one parent to live and one to die, which would you pick?

, They need to be weird enough to make people pause before doing them, but not dangerous or harmful. Some good dare examples might be:Greet everyone you meet for the day with “I’ve got my eye on you. Aliens are watching.”
Use indelible marker to put “makeup” on your face.
Put your hands in another player’s pocket for 15 minutes and keep them there no matter what.
Howl at the moon for 10 minutes in the front yard.

, If, when the game begins you don’t want to ask yours, you can ask for help from other players. You are able to cooperate with other people to think of a truth or dare, but you must ask the person being asked for their permission to consolidate. Remember you are the one to dare the person, not the other people.

"
"
Choose a player to begin.,
Move to the next player.,
Don’t let the dares go too far.",How to Play Truth or Dare3," If you’re going to move around in a circle, do it as follows: player 1 will ask the question to the person on his or her left, player 2. Or you can choose a person to ask the first question (player 1), then he or she spins the bottle in the middle. Whoever the bottle lands on (player 2) will have to be the one answering or doing the dare.The exchange should go something like this:Player 1: “Truth or dare?”
Player 2: “Truth.”
Player 1: “When was the last time you ate your own snot?”
Player 2: “Ummm . . . . last Tuesday.”
OR
Player 1: “Truth or dare?”
Player 2: “Dare.”
Player 1: “Ok. You need to eat a tablespoon of hot sauce in less than 30 seconds.”
Player 2: “Yuck. Ok, here goes.”

, This will be the person who just answered the question or dare. He or she asks the person next in the circle, or spins the bottle to find the next person. Question as before. Continue playing until you can't go any more!

, Don't do anything illegal or life-threatening. If someone really doesn't want to do a dare, everyone in the game will pick a difficult dare of their own. The player then must choose one of the new dares. Choose wisely when electing to go to the alternate dares because they could be much worse. Remember, you don't have to do a dare if it's too much and surpasses the ""limit"" of what the group is playing for."

Lay down ground rules.The basic rules of ""Who Am I?"",
Gather participants.,
Decide on a theme.,
Write names on cards.,
Distribute the game cards.,
Stick the post-it note to your forehead.,
Start with broad answers.,
Form specific questions based on your running deduction.,
State your answer.,
Answer the other players' questions.,
Keep your answers simple.If there's an element of competition in your game, you'll want the answers other players receive to be as unhelpful as possible.,
Stay honest.,
Play again.,
Ask your group if they think any change should be made to the rules.,
Look into well-known variations of the game.,
Make variations to the game's order.,
Play in teams.","How to Play the ""Who Am I"" Game"," are fairly simple. Each player writes down a name of a thing, based in an agreed-upon category, such as celebrities or historical figures. Once they have written a name, they hand it face down the player next to them. Next, all players place a post it note with a famous person or thing on their head without looking at the answer. Players ask the group questions about their assigned figure in hopes of deducing who or what it might be. This may be done one at a time revolving in a circle.. Finally, the player who guesses his answer correctly first wins the game.


Customize the theme and rules to best suit the people you're with.
Questions should only be answered by ""Yes"" or ""No"". Anything more complex risks spoiling the game's challenge.
Unless you're playing in a competitive context, you should allow everyone a chance to figure out their answer.
The ""Who Am I"" game doesn't have any mandatory rules you need to follow. Rather, it is meant to be customized according to the desires of whomever's playing.;
, ""Who Am I?"" is a party game, or something you'll play after dinner. The minimum number for a game of ""Who Am I?"" is 2, but 6 to 8 players is the recommended number of players.Generally speaking, the more people you get onboard, the more pleasantly chaotic your session will be.


The game is meant as an ice breaker for upbeat socialization. It's a good way to start school or work sessions. If you have a choice of people, choose people you think will be able to make the session fun and enjoyable for the other players.

, Celebrities are a common theme for this game.Though unnecessary, themes help to give character and a sense of fairness to your game. Discuss some ideas amongst yourselves, or come up with a few ideas yourself if you're the host.


You should pick a theme that will interest your group the most. Historical figures, countries and bands are all possible themes you can choose.
There are a few well-known versions of this game. For instance, ""Celebrity"" focuses on guessing a popular celebrity. ""Botticelli"" is based exclusively on historical figures, and centers around more educated answers, such as ""Did you paint a picture of Venus rising?""
For example, if you're doing historical figures, a few names you might put on could be: Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Alexander the Great.

, In a lot of party sessions, cards will be made by having each of the players writing down an answer on a Post-It note and handing it facedown to someone nearby.If you're playing the game as well, this is preferable to writing up all the cards yourself.


Make cards with someone else. That way, you won't have an unfair advantage by knowing all of the cards.
You may write it on a regular piece of paper and attach it to someone's back as well. This is preferred if your party is standing up.

, Write down a name, place, thing or concept onto a card, and lie it facedown. You can make all of the cards in one go, or tell players to make cards to give to each other.


Include some information on the name card.Before delivering the cards to other players, it may be helpful to advise that some basic info be included on the card beside the name. If the players don't have much knowledge overlap, include a few words about what he, she, or it is on the card alongside the answer.
The ""Who Am I"" game is so synonymous with Post-It notes that the Post-It note company features the rules on their official website., Place the note on your forehead with your eyes closed. Rub in the tab to make sure it sticks properly. Make sure you don't read the answer while you put it to your head. This will spoil the fun if you do. If you accidentally see the answer, get a different card and start again.

, You will have a given number of questions you can ask about your answer. Because you technically start with an infinite number of choices, ask questions that will eliminate the widest amount. Big questions (like ""Am I an animal?"" or ""Am I alive?"") will get you to the point where you're able to steer your questions towards what you have confirmed so far about your answer.


Most games of ""Who Am I?"" limit players to only asking yes or no questions. This process tends to result in the most interesting guesswork.

, Narrow down your questions as the game goes on. Each subsequent question you make should be benefitted by the ""Yes"" answers you received earlier in the game. With that, you'll be able to divide whole categories into manageable sections.


For example, if you received a ""Yes"" answer to ""Am I an animal?"" last round, you can break that answer down further, by saying ""Am I a land animal?"" or ""Am I a mammal?""

, Regardless what your session's rules on guessing are, there will come a point where you'll have to put your theory to the test. When you are reasonably certain what your answer is, call it out. Don't give an answer unless you're confident with it. Even for rounds where there are no disqualification penalties for wrong guesses, being liberal with the number of answers will cheapen the sport of the game for everyone.At the same time, don't be too conservative with your guesses. In most cases, the stakes for a game of ""Who Am I?"" won't be too high. Stressing out over the certainty of an answer won't make the game more fun. If there's a competitive aspect to your session, hesitating with your answer may end up with someone beating you to the chase.

, Listen carefully to the other players, and give answers to the best of your knowledge. Whether you're playing one by one or trading turn as a group, there will be many points in the game where you have to answer questions they have about their card. If their card name isn't familiar to you and you don't know the specific answer they're looking for, allow another player to give the answer, or tell them to choose another question.

, Although you always have to be forthcoming with information, certain versions of the game allow for more than ""yes or no"" answers. If this is the case, you should try to get by telling them as little as possible about their answer.


This includes attempting to make a poker-face when it comes to revealing how close a player is for guessing correctly. You can still have lots of fun and laugh, just try not to make expressions directly based on the competition.

, Be forthcoming with whatever answers you give. Honesty is the only way a game of ""Who Am I?"" can function. Even in the most competitive scenario, a single dishonest answer can skew someone's entire game. Give the other player the correct answer to every piece of information he's looking for.


In certain silly circumstances, giving a player bad information may be seen as an amusing prank.

, You and your group may choose to play again once the other players have finished guessing their answers.If this is the case, you should make a new set of cards for people to use. Reshuffling and swapping the cards you've already used is an option as well, but since people will have seen all of the cards, a second round offers players the possibility of deducing their answer simply by looking at the cards of other players.


Sessions tend to get more enjoyable once people have warmed up and have a positive social momentum going.

, Addressing the rules will make it more interesting (or challenging) for the whole group. It can also be done to handicap players that are significantly better at the game than the rest.

, Games like ""Botticelli"" are specialized by their theme (historical figures at least as famous as the Italian painter Sandro Botticelli) but invert some of the rules. In ""Botticelli"", players choose their own identities, and give other players the initial of their identities.


Celebrity"" is another permutation of the game. Players write the names of a bunch of different celebrities on slips of paper and put them into a hat. From there, a player will take a name out of the hat and offer clues to other players. So long as the clues do not make mention of the name directly, any statement is fine. The goal is to get other players to figure out your celebrity as fast as possible.
There are many possible alternatives. If you don't like ""Yes"" and ""No"" answers, you should try experimenting with something different. Well-known game versions can be borrowed from when making your own rules as well.

, In most games of ""Who Am I?"", people will ask one question each, going clockwise in a circle. Alternatively, the game can be done one person at a time, where a player can ask as many questions as he needs to before coming up with an answer. In fast-paced party environments, rules on asking order may be relaxed completely, resulting in a free-for-all of question asking and answering. Once you have the basics of the game down, you should experiment with these game orders.

, If you want to temper the competitive element with aspects of team play, split your group into two halves. Each half can become a team. From there you score each half as a whole. This may have the effect of making other players taking a greater interest in the round that's currently occurring.

Find or think of phrases.,
Start recording, if you choose to record the Challenge.,
Get everyone to put on headphones.,
Have one person say a phrase.,
Pass the sentence along.,
Say the sentence out loud.,
Switch it up.",How to Do the Whisper Challenge," You can play the Whisper Challenge with at least one friend, but you can get more friends together. If you want the chance of having more absurd sentences, gather together more friends; if you want the sentences to go by quickly, aim for one or two friends.


You can have as many people as you want, but you may want to stick with a small group of people, since the more people you have, the longer it takes to pass around the sentence.;
, There are many reasons you could record a Whisper Challenge - you could post it online to get views, or you could just keep it as a keepsake to look back at and laugh at, for example. Just keep in mind that if you're recording your Whisper Challenge, you should record it with something that has full battery life, so that you don't realize that the recording stopped halfway through because the camera died!

, Once you've found your friends and decided whether or not to record the Challenge, find or think of phrases that you want to use for the Challenge. Anyone else partaking in the Challenge should do the same (but make sure nobody tells anyone what phrases they're coming up with!). There are many phrases you can use in the Whisper Challenge, so take some time and see what you can come up with.


Idioms and figures of speech are fairly common and can become quite funny.
Nonsensical sentences can spurn some great lines.
You can also look at messages that YouTubers have received. Many popular YouTubers who have done the Whisper Challenge have used social media (such as Twitter) to ask their followers for phrases for the Challenge. Or, if you have a substantial social media following, ask your followers on your own!

, If you choose to record the Challenge, get a device that's has good battery life and start recording. You can use something simple like a phone, but keep in mind that most video cameras record in better quality than a phone.

, The main part of the Whisper Challenge that differentiates it from Telephone is that instead of whispering the phrase into someone's ear, the players put on headphones and turn up their music. Get everyone to put on their headphones and turn on the music - and turn it up loud enough so that it's hard to hear what other people are saying.


The person who is saying the phrase can take off their headphones while they're saying the phrase, but everyone else should have their headphones on.
Noise-canceling headphones are best for this challenge, but they're not a necessity. You'll have to turn the music up louder if you don't have them, though.

, Once everyone has their music playing, one person who was previously picked out will whisper a phrase to the person next to them, and they have to lip-read. It then gets passed along the line if there are any other people playing the game. Have one person turn to the person next to them and whisper a phrase to them.


You may want to set a limit on how many times a person can ask you to repeat the phrase, to make sure that you don't get stuck on the same people for too long.

, If there are more than just you and one other person in the game, then have the ""interpreter"" whisper the phrase they heard to the person next to them. Continue doing this until you've gotten to the last person in the group.

, Once you've reached the last person in the group, have everyone take off their headphones, and have the last person say what they heard out loud. Chances are, it'll be funny and nonsensical, especially if the sentence went through a long line of people.


The person who originally said the sentence can also repeat what the original sentence was, to display how garbled the sentence became.

, Once the sentence has been said, switch to the next person and have them say their phrase. Continue to play the game like this, and you've got the Whisper Challenge down!

Ask an assistant to follow you to another room.,
Tell the assistant how the game works.,
Return to the room alone.,
Ask an audience member to pick any object in the room.,
Call the assistant back into the room.,
Point to a few objects in the room, asking ""Am I thinking of ___?"",
Point to a black object.,
Point to the correct object.,
Let the audience try to guess how it's done.",How to Play Black Magic1," You'll need to teach an assistant the secret to your black magic. Pick someone and take him to a separate room, or contact him before you get together with your friends. The rest of the group will be the audience, and stays behind.


If you want to be dramatic, tell the group that you need a quiet room for ""forming a psychic connection."";
, In private, tell your assistant the secret to the game. Tell him that you will be pointing to different objects in the room, and asking whether each one is the object you're thinking of. He should keep answering ""No"" but pay attention to the color of the object you are pointing to. When you point to a black object, he will answer ""No"" again, but the next object you point to will be the right answer.He should answer ""Yes"" to that one.


If you don't understand this step, read the rest of the instructions to see how the game is played in more detail.
There are many variations to this game, that use a different secret signal. Some are described below in another section.

, Leave your assistant behind. Make sure there is no way the assistant can hear you, or the audience may suspect, incorrectly, that the ""psychic"" assistant is just eavesdropping.

, Ask a volunteer to select any one object in the room. Ask her to tell you what the object is, explaining that you will be sending a psychic message to your assistant so he will know which object she chose.


If the audience thinks the assistant is listening in, have the volunteer point to the object instead. Ask her to walk over to the object and point to it from close by, to make sure you have the right one.

, Check that everyone in the audience knows what the object is, and tell them to keep it a secret from your assistant. Call the assistant back into the room. If he can't hear you, send out a group of several people to bring him back.


If you only send one person, the rest of the group might think he is telling the assistant the object, making the trick less mysterious.

, Point in turn to a window, a chair, a person's clothing — just about anything in the room that wasn't chosen – and ask this question. Fill in the blank with the name of the object. As long as you remember to avoid black objects, your assistant should answer ""No.""


Try pointing in different ways, using two fingers for one object, then vaguely waving at the next. People will suspect that you and your partner have set up a specific code with your gestures, which will lead them down the wrong trail and make it harder for them to guess the real method.
Optionally, you can make a show of ""transmitting the psychic message"" before pointing, holding your fingers to the sides of your head and staring at the assistant.

, Point to a black object, picking something that the volunteer did not choose. Ask ""Am I thinking of ___?"" naming the black object. Your assistant should once again answer ""No.""

, As arranged in advance with your assistant, the object you point to right after the black object is the object the volunteer guessed. Your assistant will answer ""Yes"" to your question this time, and the audience will be amazed at how you managed to pass along the secret.

, At this point, your audience will usually try to guess at how you did the trick. Smile and answer ""no"" when someone guesses wrong, or repeat the trick in a different way to show that they're wrong. For example, if someone guesses that you always point at the right object on the fifth question, repeat the trick with a different object and point to it on the third try, or the eighth.


To keep your audience guessing longest, use the variations in the section below. If you set it up in advance, you can even come up with an elaborate plan with your assistant. For instance, you can use the ""black"" method the first time, the number method the second time, and the black method again the third time.

"
"
Pick a number with your assistant.,
Come up with a coded gesture, and let someone else ask the questions.,
Name words instead of pointing to objects.,
Try to guess without any code at all!",How to Play Black Magic2," Instead of using the ""black object"" method, tell your assistant that the seventh object you point to will always be the right answer. Of course, you can do this for any number, but choosing something higher than five to make it less obvious to your audience.

, To really impress your audience, let a volunteer point at objects instead. Arrange a signal in advance with your assistant to let him know when the right object was selected. For instance, tap your foot lightly, blink rapidly, or scratch your arm when the volunteer points at the right object.


Suspicious audience members might look at you during the game, so this is a difficult method to pull off. Stand behind the audience members if possible, and make other small motions that aren't part of the code to mislead your audience.
An assistant who can distract the audience's attention is even better for pulling off this version of the game. Have him crack jokes, stretch, or pretend to think hard about each question, all while looking for your signal out of the corner of his eye., Come up with a ""rule"" for which words are ""good,"" but don't let anyone else know the rule. The rule can be ""words that end with T are good,"" ""words with two vowels in a row are good,"" ""words with a SH sound are good"" – anything you can think of. All other words are ""bad."" Have your audience say words aloud, then tell them whether each word is good or bad. Your audience members should try to guess just by naming words; ask them not to guess at the rule aloud, so that other people who haven't figured it out yet can keep guessing.

, Even if you don't believe in actual ""psychic"" abilities, you might be able to guess when someone is lying or telling the truth through their tone of voice or body language. Pick a close family member or friend, since you are more familiar with talking to him, and watch him closely. Have him say ""I'm thinking of __."" while looking at you, and try to figure out when he is lying based on his facial expressions, movements, and tone of voice.


Most psychologists and other researchers do not believe in the existence of ""Extra-Sensory Perception"" or other mysterious abilities that transmit thoughts, but there are plenty of studies on that topic if you're interested in learning more."

Find a suitable box.,
Cut a rectangle from one end of the shoebox.,
Cut a circle from the other end of the box.",How to Make a Guessing Box1," This will depend partly on what you intend to keep in the box but to begin with, a shoebox with an intact lid is a good size and is what this project uses as an example.;
, This will be the hole through which things are added to the box. Use a ruler and marker to mark the rectangle, then cut the shape out, leaving edges all around it still.

, Use a compass or trace around a can or similar wide round object. Leave plenty of edges around the circle still. See here for advice on cutting out the circle.

Glue or tape the rectangular piece of fabric to the inside end of the box that has the circular hole.,
Decorate the box.,
Put the lid on the box.",How to Make a Guessing Box2," This will likely be rectangular in shape.

, Cut this line most of the way but leave the edges intact. This will form a slit through which the player places his or her hands to feel the objects.

, Smooth down and make sure that the slit sits in the center of the circle.

, This isn't essential but if you want the box to reflect a particular theme or color scheme, there are lots of possibilities to decorate it. For example, paint it, decoupage it, add labels, etc.


Also decorate the lid in a similar or matching design.

, It's now ready to add things to.

Select items for the game.",How to Make a Guessing Box3," The objects need to fit in the box, be safe to handle blindly and yet also offer a bit of a challenge! You can have a lot of fun with this part and the possibilities can change every time you play the game. Some examples of things you might like to add include:


Keys, keyrings
Balls of different textures (rubber, yarn, foil, etc.)
Hairbrush, comb, open pot of gel
Candies (gel, hard, sticky, soft, sugary, etc.)
Plastic toys (guess the shape/animal)
Velcro, zipper, buttons, etc. from the craft basket
Cat collar or rubber dog bone
Think of sticky, gel-like, slightly spiky, etc. textures but nothing that could harm a person's fingers.

Have the selector place the chosen items into the box.,
Have the guessing player place his or her hand into the box.,
Award a prize to the winner.",How to Make a Guessing Box4," This role can change through the game, or can be given to an adult or host who doesn't mind sitting out the game.

, The items should be kept inside a bucket/box/behind a screen etc. so that they cannot be seen in advance. Add them when the player is not yet near the box or ask the player to look away.

, At this point, how the game is played can be varied, such as:


The player must guess what it is within a time limit or pass to the next player.
The player must guess the best of a ""set of objects"".
In each case the player who gets the most guesses wins.
Time limits are important or the guessing can become boring for waiting players.

, It might even be something in the guessing box, which can be an incentive to guess right!

, Using a single, thick pillar candle can be very effective on a smaller table. It can be dressed up with a wreath of floral elements or other encircling pieces.

, A floating candle arrangement can provide glamour and style in the center of a table. Candles floating amid fresh petals is a particularly delightful arrangement.

, An effective arrangement can be achieved by using a row of candles in one place. They can be pushed into sand in a long container and placed in the center of the table. Or, you can cover the containers in an interesting fashion, as shown by the image.

, Does your family or grad prefer to shoot video over stills? If so, a video montage -- peppered with best movie lines and favorite scenes -- is sure to be a crowd-pleaser. As an added touch, you might consider burning extra copies of the montage DVD to give to guests as party favors.

, ""Say Anything,"" ""American Graffiti,"" ""There's Something about Mary"" and ""American Pie"" are just a few of the most memorable films about high school and beyond. If your grad is a movie buff, this is a great way to enjoy a rental projector over graduation weekend.

, Nothing brings friends together quite like a little competition. Imagine adding that extra element of fun to your party with larger-than-life projection with your favorite gaming system. Rental projectors work seamlessly with Wii, XBOX, Guitar Hero and more.

, Whether your party aims to be low-key casual or more of a dance floor party, big-screen projection can set the mood for romance, laughter, music videos, and more.

, Let's face it -- your parents have given a lot for you to get to this point! Why not surprise them with a special video thank-you (or a separate photo montage)? They'll love you even more for your thoughtfulness (and you might just get an even better graduation gift).

, Sure, what kid doesn't want a car or a killer graduation party when they finish high school? But think about what means the most for years to come...your unconditional love and support. Record a video or set images to music in a short ""parent's wish"" -- say what you've always wanted your child to know: you love them, you are proud of them, and you wish them every joy and happiness in life. Sure beats the heck out of a Hallmark card!

, Got a favorite teacher? One who's gone the extra mile to help ensure your success? Maybe a certain teacher recognized and encouraged a hidden talent, went to bat for you with school administration or a college board, or invested the extra time and attention needed to ensure the student didn't give up when the going got tough. Celebrate that teacher in living color with a video thank you or photo montage, displayed at the school graduation, graduation party, or other celebration.

, When the big day arrives, some grads don't want to talk, reminisce or even play video games -- they just want to dance, dance, dance. Sure, you could hire a DJ, but wouldn't it be even more fun to showcase favorite songs in all their rock video glory? All it takes is a rental projector and a huge blank wall to get the party started.

, Many rental projectors are compatible with karaoke machines and other kinds of karaoke fun. After graduation, everyone deserves to cut loose and have some fun!

Enjoy the party.",How to Throw a Last Minute Party," Are you wanting to throw a children’s birthday party, a themed party, a formal dinner party? There are many different kinds of parties that you could throw, so the first step is getting a clear idea about the type of party you are throwing.Consider other things like time of year, whether the party will be indoors or outdoors, how many people you can invite, and whether or not there will be alcohol at the party.;
, This will help you to figure out how many hours or days you have to plan for the party. If you only have 15 minutes to throw a party, you will be pretty limited in what you can do, but if you have 6 or 7 hours you will have more time to hang decorations, make food, go shopping, etc.


Obviously you also need to decide on a date and time so your guests will know when to show up.

, How much additional money are you willing to spend? Write it down and try to stick with it. Parties can be pretty expensive, especially if you are providing most of the food and drinks. As a quick and cost-saving alternative, you could do a potluck style party.If you don't want to cover the cost yourself or can't afford it, consider asking guests for help.
Asking guests to bring extra snacks or drinks is perfectly normal. Most guests will ask what they can bring., This doesn’t have to be a complicated list since the party is last minute, but quickly jotting down names of people you want to invite will give you an initial idea about how many people to plan for, and will make it easier when you are contacting everyone to let them know about the party.


When you make your list, it may be helpful to think about whether this person is likely to bring a guest with them (e.g. boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife). If you are allowing it, and you think they will bring someone with them, mark “+1” next to their name so you will have an accurate head count.

, Under normal circumstances, you might mail invitations through the post or via email. However, this isn’t an option for a last minute party. In this case, the best option for letting your potential guests know is to give them a call.If the party is more informal you could also send them a text message, a group message, or a message via social media.
If there is enough time, many people also use social media to invite their guests. For example, some social media platforms allow you to create an event where you can provide all the necessary information and invite specific people.
Don’t put pressure on people who can’t give you an answer right away. If they have to get back to you, but you can’t wait around to get everything ready, then just assume they are coming. It’s better to have too much than too little in this case.
If you’re wanting to throw a casual house party, you may want as many people as possible. If this is the case, call up or text message a few friends and ask them to bring friends and spread the word. You can also post on social media letting everyone know that you’re having a party and everyone is invited.

, For many party hosts, it is really helpful to know how many people to expect. Since your party is last minute, your guests probably can give you a straight answer about whether or not they can come.


Be polite, but direct. For example, you can say, “I know this is really last minute, but I am having a party tonight. I don’t mean to put you on the spot, but I’d love it if you could come. Are you free?” Don't forget to tell them the reason you are having a party, or tell them it's just to have some fun if you don't have a specific occasion to celebrate.
You should also be straightforward about your expectations for the party. For example, if it’s a costume party, be sure to tell them that you want everyone to dress up. If you want them to bring something (e.g. food or drinks) be clear about that as well. If the party is a formal dinner party, be sure to make that clear.
It is not uncommon to have parties where guests are expected to bring any alcohol, and you can easily make this clear by saying the party is “BYOB.” Alternatively, if you want to have an outdoor barbecue, but can’t afford to by all the meat, you can also make the party “BYOM,” which means “bring your own meat.”

, Though you might think you shouldn’t waste time doing this, having a list of everything you need to accomplish before the party will reduce your stress in the end. You will have a clear idea of your tasks, and you won’t be scrambling around trying to think of what you need to do next.You can prioritize the list by placing the most important tasks (e.g. buy drinks/food) at the top and the ideal, but less important tasks at the bottom (e.g. mop the floors).

, If you are lucky enough to have one or two people around willing to help you, then you should take full advantage of this. Look at your to-do list and see what can be done by someone else.


When you delegate a task it’s important to give the person control over the task. If you ask your helper to take care of hanging decorations, don’t walk around behind them criticizing their decisions. This will waste a lot of time, and will likely frustrate your helper.

, Since you don’t have much time, you won’t be able to make multiple trips to pick up everything you need. Write down any food, snacks, and/or drinks you want to pick up. If you want to buy ice, write that down. Write down any specific decorations you want to pick up. For example, streamers, balloons, confetti, etc.If possible, try to do your shopping at a store where you will be able to get everything you need. For example, most big box stores such as Target or Walmart have everything you need all in one place, which will save you lots of time.
If you are sending someone else to do the shopping be sure to include quantities and details about the things you want. If you want to buy 6 liters of soda, be specific. Write down how many liters and the specific kind. For example, write, “6 liters Coca Cola” don’t write, “6 bottles of soda.”

, How well you clean depends on how much time you have. If you don’t have much time, do a quick cleaning of the rooms where your guests will be. It doesn’t have to be spotless, but it should be fresh and presentable.For example, quickly vacuum the carpet, pick up any dirty clothes, toys or anything that is just lying around. If your guests will be in the kitchen, make sure all the dishes are washed or at least in the dishwasher. You can light a few candles or open a window (weather permitting) so the house will be fresh smelling.
If there are rooms you can’t get to in time, just close the door to these rooms. Place a sign on the door that says “Bathroom” so your guests won’t have to guess where it is.
Be sure to stock any guest bathrooms with plenty of extra toilet paper., How much you decorate will really depend on the type of party you are having. If you are having a formal dinner party, you may not need to do anything more than add a bouquet of fresh flowers to the table along with the plates, bowls, knives, forks, etc. If you are having a children’s party, you’ll want to have bright, colorful decorations that will be exciting for the children.Don’t stress too much if you don’t have enough time to get the decorations perfect. Do what you can, and remember that it won’t make or break the party.
Prioritize the most important things. For example, set up all the food and drinks wherever you have planned to have them. It’s best to have one or two main locations for food and drinks. If you are having any “main attractions” such as a beer pong table, a fire pit, a piñata, or board games, make sure you set these things up before working on any minor decorations such as balloons or streamers.

, Almost every type of party can benefit from a bit of background music. Even if you are having a formal dinner party, having a speaker playing some soft jazz or classical music will really add to the ambience of the party.If you want to have dancing at your party, set up an MP3 player with some speakers in the “dancing area.” If you aren’t having dancing, but still want to have background music, set up the music where it loud enough to hear, but also out of the way.
You can look on the internet for free playlists that you can stream or you can make your own party playlist using music you already have.

, If you are having food and planning to make it yourself, then make sure that you schedule enough time to get it all done. Alternatively, if you want to have food, you could consider ordering food. This will cost more money, but it will save you lots of time.For example, you could order pizzas to have delivered just before the party starts, or you could pick up some fruit, vegetable, and sandwich trays at a local deli. Some restaurants even offer complete meals that you can order for each guest if you are having a dinner party.
If you don’t want to order food, but don’t have time to make food from scratch you can pick up lots of pre-prepared foods. For example, frozen appetizers are tasty and easy to heat up.

, After running around trying to get everything together, you might look a bit frazzled. Try to give yourself a few minutes to put on some fresh clothes before your guests arrive. Obviously what you wear will depend on the party. If you’re having a formal party, but on something to match the tone you’re trying to set. If you’re having a costume party, make sure you have time to put it on.


Splash some water on your face and run a comb through your hair if you don’t have time for anything else. You want to look like your fresh and ready to party!

, Unless you are throwing a huge casual party, you’ll want to try to greet every guest as they come in. Take their jackets and ask them if you can get them a drink.If they have brought their own things (e.g. drinks or meat to grill) show them where they can mix their drinks and where the grill is, as well as a place where they can store their things.

, Part of being a good host is making sure that everyone is enjoying themselves. Obviously you can’t do everything for everyone, but you can periodically ask around to see if anyone needs a fresh drink.


If you have had helpers, consider them co-hosts of the party if they are willing to keep helping you out. They can also make sure everyone has what they need.

, Although you definitely want to be a good host, you also want to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Enjoy the food and drinks, dance, and talk with your guests. Don’t just spend your time running around trying to please everyone.If you are constantly running around, you will wear yourself out very quickly, and you will probably give the impression that you are very stressed.

Blow on or spin the ball.",How to Win at Beer Pong," You will need twenty plastic party cups altogether. Classic red party cups are most often used. Arrange ten cups in pyramid form on each end of the table. The row closest to you has four cups, and the last row that is closest to the middle of the table has only one cup. A regulation beer pong table is seven to eight feet in length and two feet wide, though you can use any type of table that is fairly long.The cups are usually 16 or 18 ounce cups. Red party cups can be purchased at most supermarkets and package stores.;
, You will need to partially fill the cups with beer, or any other liquid that you want to use. Water can be used for a non-alcoholic game. Typically, two 12oz beers should be enough to fill ten cups. More or less can be used depending on how much you want to drink. The cups need to be filled with beer because each cup that is scored on is supposed to be consumed and then set aside.Fill the cups about a ¼ of the way full.
Set up a cup filled only with water on the side of the table to clean off balls that fall on the floor or get dirty.

, A game can be played with one player, or two players on each team. Don’t have any more than two players on each team. If playing with two players on each team, each team plays with two balls instead of one., Determine who gets first shot by doing an eye-to-eye challenge. One opponent from each team looks the other player in the eyes and throw the balls towards each other’s cups. The balls are shot until one player sinks the ball in the opponent’s cup, and the other player misses. If playing in teams, switch partners until one partner succeeds in making the cup. The team that wins the eye-to-eye challenge gets the first throw in the game.Do not remove the cup if it is scored on. Just remove the ball, wash it, and begin playing the game.

, Take turns throwing the ping pong ball into each other’s cups. Drink the contents of the cup and remove it each time a ball makes it into the cup. Continue doing this until all of the cups are gone. The winner is the first to eliminate all of the other team’s cups.The game is automatically won if members of the same team sink the ball into the same cup of the opposing team.
The winning team typically gets to stay on the table and take on a new team for the next game.

, A common is rule is that elbows must stay behind the edge of the table when making a shot. In some games, the wrist is included in this rule. The shot does not count if it was made with elbows beyond the outer edge of the table. If the shot is made with elbows over the table, then the ball must be returned and the shot needs to be made again.This rule can be broken for shorter players, or players with poor throwing skills if it is agreed upon by everyone playing.

, A re-rack, or reformation of cups, is allowed twice per game. Re-racking can happen when 6,4,3, or 2 cups are left. You can ask for formations like a square, or a triangle. The last cup left in the game is always available to be moved and centered, however, even if the two re-racks have already been used.If you are doing really well, try to save your re-racks for later in the game. For example: Rather than using them on six and four cups and have them scattered try to save your re-racks for four and three (or even two) cups so, at the end of the game, the cups are closer to each other.
You can also ask to fix the cups at any point during them game. This is not the same as re-racking. Asking to fix the cups only allows for cups to be tightened up, or returned to position if they have been moved.

, If you bounce a ball on the table and it lands in a cup, you can ask for another cup to be removed along with the cup the ball was sunk in. It is your choice which additional cup is removed. Note that if you do choose to bounce the ball, the other team has the right to swat it out of the way and vice versa. Players can not protest a ball that has been swatted out of the way during an attempted bounce shot.It is best to wait to attempt bounce shot when your opponent is down to their last cups.
Try to make a bounce shot when the other team appears to be distracted.

, “On fire” can’t be called out unless “heating up” was called out first. Once “on fire” has been called out the player can continue making shots until he or she misses.Make sure the other team is aware of you calling out “heating up” and “on fire.”

, You are allowed once per game to call out a cup that is not touching any other cup. You can call out this cup by saying “island” or “solo.” If the ball is sunk in the called out cup, then the player can ask for an additional cup to be pulled out along with the other cup. If the player calls out a specific, isolated cup and hits another, then the cup that was accidentally hit must remain on the table.A lonely cup is not one that slid slightly away from the other cups due to wetness. It is isolated because other cups around it has been removed.

, A death cup is a cup that has been removed from the rack, or formation, and is currently in the player’s hand. This cup is eligible to be shot at by the opposing team. If the ball is made into the death cup, the game is automatically over. Three cups can be removed for a death cup that is still on the table and not in the player’s hand.Drink the cup as fast as possible to avoid shots being made at it.
Wait for the other team to be distracted when trying to make a death cup.

, Once a team has won, the losing team has a shot at rebuttal. To do this, each player of the losing team makes a shot at the opposing team’s remaining cups until someone misses. If cups still remain, the game is over. If all of the cups have been hit, then the game goes into overtime. Overtime consists of each team making a pyramid out of three cups and shooting until no cups remain on the losing team’s side.No re-racks are allowed during overtime, but cups can be fixed.

, Always wet the ball before shooting. This will increase its accuracy and will help it glide through the air more smoothly. A dry ball will go a shorter distance and can be harder to aim.


Clean it in the water cup before every shot.

, Form is key when preparing to shoot. Whichever hand you shoot with, that foot is in front. The opposite foot is set up further back for support. Make your elbows will not go over the edge of the table, and practice your aim before you shoot.

, When you release the ball, there are three main types of shots. There is an arc shot, where the ball is released higher and drops into a cup. A fastball shot is when a quick, direct shot is made at the cup. And there is a bounce shot, which is bounced on the table before dropping in the cup.Fastballs shots are sometimes not allowed because they can get out of hand.

, Always keep your eye on the table to avoid a sneaky shot being aimed at you. You can use the others teams moment of distraction to your advantage. One technique is to pretend like you are not paying attention. While the other team is shooting, you can look away or start talking to someone on the sidelines.

, If a ball is spinning on the rim of the cup and hasn’t dropped in yet, you can blow or take the ball out with your finger. The rule typically calls for girls to blow on the ball and for guys to take it out with their finger. As long as the ball doesn’t hit the beer, it will not count as a shot if it comes out.For girls, when the ball is spinning around, you are allowed to blow into the cup to force the ball out. Put your face near the cup and blow on the ball as hard as you can.
For guys, while it’s spinning, reach in with your finger and try to get under the ball. You have to be fast. Put your finger under the ball and pull out it quickly.

Play the basic, classic King's cup with this cheat sheet.",How to Play the Drinking Game King's Cup1," To play, fan out a deck of cards, face down, around an empty cup (the ""King's Cup""). Make sure everyone has a full drink of some sort. Players take turns drawing a card, then acting out the action described in the cheat sheet. For example, if someone draws a 3, that player must take a drink. If they draw a 5, all the guys playing must drink, etc. Continue until the final King is drawn or there are no more cards to turn over, whichever you prefer.;
"
"
Place a cup in the center of a table and surround it with a deck of cards.,
Pour everyone an individual drink.,
Determine the ""punishment"" length.,
Decide on the rules for each card.,
Pick up the first card.,
Up the stakes with new rules.",How to Play the Drinking Game King's Cup2," Set up your game by placing an empty glass or plastic cup (the titular ""King's Cup"") in the center of the table. Spread an entire deck of cards, jokers removed, in a circle around the cup, face down. You'll have a full ring of cards around your chalice when you're ready to play.


Everyone playing should be in a circle around the cup and should be able to easily pick a card on their turn.
If you are drinking out of cans, you can place an unopened can in the center instead of a cup. This variation is also a bit more sanitary since only one person will need to drink from the can instead of a communal cup.

, Each player needs their own beverage in front of them, and they will drink from it or contribute to the King's Cup as the game goes on. Each card in King's Cup, when drawn, means that someone has to take a sip of their drink, so if someone's drink runs out they should refill it or get a new one.


You do not have to all have the same type of drink, though it does make the King's Cup, a mixture of everyone's drinks, much easier to swallow.

, Each action forces someone to drink. Usually, this is a casual, single sip. However, some people like to make rules for each drink, something along the lines of ""3 seconds per drink,"" or some other amount of time.

, King's Cup has a very specific set of rules which all of the players need to be familiar with before playing. Each turn, one person will draw a card from the deck, and each card is associated with a simple action for someone at the table. You should feel free to adapt or edit the rules for your game, since there are countless variations and rules, but a common set includes:



2 is for you. If a player draws a 2 (of any color or suit) they may choose another player who then has to drink. The chosen person must drink for the duration of time agreed on at the start of the game.

3 is for me. If a player draws a 3, they must take a drink themselves.

4 is for floor. If a player draws a 4, everybody at the table has to reach down and touch the floor as quickly as possible. Last one to touch the floor drinks.

5 is for guys. If a player draws a 5, all the guys at the table must drink.

6 is for chicks. If a player draws a 6, all the girls at the table must drink.

7 is for heaven. If a player draws a 7, everyone at the table has to put both hands in the air as quickly as possible. Last one to do so must drink.

8 is for mate. If a player draws an 8, they have to pick another person at the table who must drink every time they do, and vice versa. This continues until someone else draws an 8. If either of the players forgets to drink when their ""mate"" is drinking, they must take an additional penalty drink.

9 is for rhyme. If a player draws a 9, they must pick a word and say it out loud, such as ""rat."" Moving clockwise, each player must say a word that rhymes with the original word, e.g. cat, hat, bat and so on, and they must do so in under 5 seconds. This keeps going round the table until a player can no longer think of a rhyming word. That player drinks.

10 is for ""Never Have I Ever."" If a player draws a 10, everyone at the table must hold up three fingers. Starting with the person who drew the card, that player must begin a sentence with ""never have I ever..."" and complete the sentence with something they have never done. If other players at the table have done that particular thing, they must lower a finger. This continues around the table. The first player or players with no remaining fingers must drink.

Jack is ""Make a Rule."" If a player draws a Jack, they have the ability to make a rule that must be followed for the entire duration of the game. They could rule that nobody is allowed to swear, that it's forbidden to use the bathroom, or that nobody can call anyone by their first name. Any player who breaks the rule must take a penalty drink. Read popular rules ideas below.


Queen is for Question Master. If a player draws a Queen, they become the Question Master. Until another player draws a Queen, everyone can only respond to the Question Master's questions with another question. For example, if Terry is Question Master, and asks Steve ""what time is it?"" Steve would have to respond ""Is it 2 o'clock?"" If Steve doesn't answer with a question, he must take a drink.

King is for King's Cup. When a player draws a King, they must pour whatever they are drinking into the cup in the center of the table. When the fourth King is drawn, that player must drink the concoction in the cup, signaling the end of the game. If you're playing with a can, Kings could mean ""finish your current drink,"" or you could make an alternate rule.

Aces are for waterfalls. If a player draws an Ace, everyone at the table must chug their drink, starting with the player who drew the card. Each player may only start drinking when the person to their right has started drinking and may only stop when the person to their right has stopped drinking. So if you're sitting to the left of the player who drew the card, you cannot stop drinking until everyone at the table has stopped., Choose a player to begin, then draw a card at random. Turn it over quickly and then act out the card according to your rules. Once you're done, discard the card and move on to the next player, who draws.


If playing with a can, slide the card underneath the tab of the unopened drink. As cards build up, eventually the can will crack open. The player who ""cracks the King's Cup,"" then needs to drink the entire can.

, There are hundreds of variations for each card, but there are also a few other rules that you can make that will spice up the game. Most of the rules are made to get people drinking more frequently:



Ring of Fire: The game is played as normal. Fan the cards out so all of them overlap. Any player who breaks the circle has to finish their current drink.

Color Kings: For all the numbered cards (not Jacks, Queens, or Kings), someone drinks for the number of seconds on the card. ""Red is to the Head,"" meaning you drink for the number of seconds. ""Black gives Back,"" meaning you pick who has to drink.

Replace the King's Cup rule to avoid drinking the pot.",How to Play the Drinking Game King's Cup3," A lot of the fun of King's cup comes from the ""house rules"" that have grown around it. Every game is different, and comparing games or playing with new people often leads to new and exciting rule changes. The following steps give 1-2 variations on each card, but you can mix and match them however you want.

, Aces are generally big rules, and often require the most drinking.



Ace is for race. If a player draws an ace, they must pick another player and race them to the end of their cup. Both players must finish their entire drink.

Ace slap your face. If a player draws an ace, everyone at the table has to slap their face. Last one to do so takes a drink.

, Two is almost always ""you,"" meaning you point someone out and they must take a drink. But there are some variations.



2 means shuffle. If a player draws a 2, everyone at the table has to switch seats with someone else. Last one seated drinks.

, In nearly every variation, 3 is me. But you can also use it as a ""direction shifter."" If a player draws a 3, the direction of play is switched from clockwise to counter-clockwise.

, Four is sometimes used for ""women must drink,"" thanks to a rhyme with a certain nightly profession.



4 is for dinosaur. If a player draws a 4, they have permission to use a permanent marker to draw a dinosaur on the face of another player.

, There are a lot of variations on 5, including:



5 is for jive. As soon as someone pulls a 5, everyone must start dancing. The last person to bust a move drinks.

5 is for dive. If a player draws a 5, everyone must dive under the table. Last one to do so must take a drink.

, Six is often used to mean, ""guys must drink,"" thanks to a rhyming similarity between ""six"" and some common male slang.



6 is for thumb master. If a player draws a 6, they become thumb master. Every time they put their thumb on the table, all the other players must do so too. The last one drinks. This can happen at any point in the game until someone else draws a 6.

, Seven is another card with a lot of variety, depending on who you're playing with. Some people make it ""thumb master,"" or ""never have I ever,"" depending on the other rules.



7 is for snake-eyes. If a player draws a 7, they become snake-eyes and anytime they successfully make eye contact with another player, that player must drink.

7 is buzzing. This is a group rule. Moving clockwise, the each player counts up, so the first player says ""1,"" the second says ""2."" etc. However, you must replace each multiple of seven (14, 21, etc.), or each mention of seven (27, 37) with the word ""BUZZ!"" Mess up and you drink, and the next card is drawn.

, Since 8 is so easy to rhyme with other words, this card has a lot of variations.



8 is for the hate. Choose a player, who must start drinking until you say stop. However, if they finish their drink before you say stop, you must play the same game-- but with them in control.

8 is for straight. There are two options for this rule. Either the player sitting directly across from the cardholder must drink or the person holding the 8 must drink a straight shot of any alcoholic beverage that the table deems fit. It must go down ""straight,"" without a mixer or glass of water

, These cards usually fill up whatever rules you didn't use with the other cards. Some idea include:


Draw again.

Minister of Foreign Affairs. This makes you the only person able to talk to people who are not playing King's Cup at the moment., Sometimes, if things are casual or the drinks varied, you might just skip the King's cup. There is a variety of ways to do this:


King's are table-slave.""' If you draw a King, you must now do the bidding of the table, within reason. Usually, this means you refill the drinks and get new ones every time someone runs out, or someone else draws a King. Never treat the table-slave poorly -- you never know if you're next.
""'Kings are Categories:'"" If a player draws a King they can choose a category, such as ""dog breeds"" or ""types of car"". Then each player at the table must name something that fits into that category, such as ""poodle"" or ""Toyota"". When a player cannot think of something that fits into the chosen category withing 5 seconds, they must take a drink. Some people play with 10 for Categories instead.

The first player takes the quarter and spins it on the table.,
Now where the game gets really interesting is when people start finishing their beer.,
So now it becomes a constant obstacle that a spinner must try to avoid.,
Finished.

","How to Play the Drinking Game ""Land Mines"""," While the quarter is spinning, the player must then take a chug of beer with the same hand they spun the quarter with and then pick up the quarter before it stops spinning also with the same hand they drank their beer with. If you are caught using the wrong hand, then you must take a drink and redo your spin till you get it right.;
, Basically any beer that has been finished by a player at the table becomes their own ""land mine"". By using these empty beer cans, you can smash a person's quarter mid spin causing them to have to down a good portion of their beer and restart their turn; not to mention that once that empty can is used, that empty beer can remains in the spot it was for the remainder of the game.

, If the quarter then hits any of the empty cans on the table, it becomes dead and the spinner must drink and respin. If the spinner is unsuccessful 3 times in a row, then he or she must pound a beer or take a shot and the quarter passes to the next person.

Buy some Pocky.,
Choose a partner.,
Propose the game at a party.,
Brush your teeth and check for good breath.,
Face your partner.,
Place a Pocky stick between you.,
Bite your end until reaching the middle.,
Don’t pull away.",How to Play the Pocky Game," Pocky are sweet Japanese cookies that come in many flavors. In order to play the Pocky game you’ll need to purchase a box from your local Asian market or find them in the international aisle at the grocery store. If you can’t find Pocky, any long, thin biscuit, such as a breadstick, will do.
, The Pocky game often results in a kiss, as the two players hold a thin, small cookie between them. Because of this, it makes sense to pick a partner you wouldn’t mind kissing to begin with. You can use this as an opportunity to break the ice with your crush or bring you closer to a good friend.


If you’re playing the game with a group of people, the rules of the game are the same. You can have two couples play at once. Then, the winners of both games can face off in their own Pocky game.

, The Pocky game is meant to be a fun (and sexy!) party game. Bring Pocky to a party, and then simply propose play. You might say, “Has anyone played the Pocky game before?” You’ll either be met with enthusiasm or curiosity. Either way, you’ll have a captive audience to teach the rules., Because you’ll be getting close to the other players, it’s considerate to brush your teeth so that you have good breath for the Pocky game. If you don’t have access to a toothbrush at the party, chewing a stick of mint gum for a little bit would do. Don’t keep the gum in your mouth for play though; you don’t want bits of Pocky getting stuck in your gum., Face the person you’ve selected as your partner for the Pocky game. You’ll both need to have the same posture, so both sitting or both standing. Get close so your faces are within about one foot of each other., Each take opposite ends of the Pocky stick between your teeth, so the Pocky is creating a line between your two mouths. Try not to snap the Pocky yet. One player then does a countdown backwards from three to begin play., Both players bite their end of the Pocky stick, moving towards the middle. Try not to drop the Pocky as you chew in this process. The goal is to reach the middle., Both players’ mouths will meet in the middle of the Pocky stick, but the first to pull away is the loser. It can be kind of funny to be so close to someone, so try not to giggle and lose your bit of the Pocky stick. Often, neither party will turn away, resulting in the kiss. In that case, everyone wins!

Pull one card from a deck of cards.,
Have everyone in your group sit in a circle.,
Pick someone to go first to pass the card.,
Pass the card to the person next to you with your lips.,
Kiss the person next to you if you drop the card.,
Start a new round when the card is dropped.,
Tear the card in half every time it’s dropped between a couple.,
Change the direction of the card passing whenever there's a kiss.,
Add alcohol to the mix.",How to Play Suck and Blow with Cards," You only need one card to pass around between everyone. If you want to play with multiple cards being passed for a faster-paced game, get a pack of cards to use. This game can be taken seriously, but more than likely the group is going to be laughing and having fun.;
, Usually suck and blow is played in a mixed crowd and the circle is seated boy-girl-boy-girl. At some point you will be kissing the person to your left or right if you fumble while passing the playing card.


Decide as a group whether you’re going to pass the card clockwise or counterclockwise.
If you're with your significant other or there’s someone in the group you’ve been wanting to kiss, try and position yourself next to them for the game.
To minimize awkwardness, have friends sit next to each other.
You can disregard the opposite gender seating if your group’s preferences are different.

, The first person places the card on their lips and sucks in air to keep it stuck there without any hands. Inhale through your mouth only so you use as much air as possible to keep the card attached to your lips.


As the game continues, the pace will pick up because everyone may start getting out of breath and possibly drop the card.

, Get close to your neighbor's face and without hands, transfer the card to their lips. Blow on the card to push it to their lips as they suck in to receive the card. You may need a practice round so that everyone can get comfortable with the motions.


Have everyone hold their hands behind their back to keep from cheating.The card transfer can get confusing as you try and remember to suck on the card to receive it and blow to get rid of it.

, When the card falls, the two people who dropped it have to kiss. If you drop the card on your own in between passes, you have to kiss the person to your right if you’re going counterclockwise or to your left if you’re going clockwise.

, You can either restart the whole game from the first player if the card is dropped. Or instead, you can continue playing from the person who just dropped the card. Another variation is to reverse the direction of the passing when someone drops the card.

, Another rule you can add is that the playing card gets torn in half every time someone drops it. So the card will be halved, then quartered, then start to diminish to almost nothing as the game goes on. After a while, there will be less of a playing card in play and more lips., If everyone has gotten comfortable with passing the card to the person to their right, switch the direction the card is passed in the circle. The new partners won’t be used to each other and there may be many more turns where the card is dropped.


You can also switch up the seating arrangement to make things interesting.

, If everyone in your group is 21 or older, suck and blow can be a drinking game if you make anyone who drops the card take a drink or a shot. If two people drop a card, they both take a drink and if one person manages to drop the card on their own, they’re the solo drinker. You can wait to start playing this game until everyone is already a little buzzed so there are less inhibitions.

Play the ""no touching"" rule.,
Play the ""no swearing"" rule.,
Play the ""nickname"" rule.",How to Play the Drinking Game King's Cup4," With this rule, players are required to imagine that they have a little green man sitting on top of their cup. Throughout the game, they must mimic removing the little green man from the top of their cup every time they take a drink and put him back afterward. If they fail to do so, they get an additional penalty drink.

, With this rule, players are forbidden from saying the words ""drink"", ""drank"" or ""drunk"" for the entire duration of the game. If a player accidentally says one of the three D's, they must take a penalty drink.

, With this rule, right-handed players can only pick up their cup with their left hand and left-handed players can only pick up with their right. If a player is caught picking up a cup with their good hand, they must take a penalty drink.

, This rule is fairly self-explanatory. Players are not allowed to point at anyone or anything for the entire duration of the game. If they are caught breaking the rule, they must take a penalty drink.

, With this rule, players must pick a body part (lips, hair, ears, etc) that no one is allowed to touch for the duration of the game. If a player is caught touching the forbidden body part, they must take a penalty drink.

, Again, pretty self-explanatory. No swearing is allowed while the game is in play. If a player swears, they must take a penalty drink. It might help to outline the list of included swear words before the game begins.

, Every player is given a nickname at the start of the game. If at any point a player fails to refer to someone by their nickname, they must take a penalty drink."

Allow the other person to change their mind.",How to Play Spin the Bottle with Two People," First, you obviously need a bottle. Any bottle will do. Glass will spin a little better, but plastic won’t break. Now you will want to find fun thing to share. You will want to collect 6-8 items to play with. Get creative! You can use paper, pen, markers, blindfolds, roses, books of love poems, or fortune cookies. The argument is still out on whether foods can be an aphrodisiac,but there is no doubt that some foods are considered sexy.


Strawberries are always a good choice and are heart-shaped and colored.
Chocolate is a common favorite as a romantic gift.
Chili pepper flavors can spice things up.
If you have a favorite food you both love, throw that in there.;
, You will want a large flat surface and some privacy. For ideal spinning, use a nice flat hardwood floor. This is going to work better than a textured surface like carpet. You could use the floor in your room, or get creative and find a secluded place in the park and set out a large blanket on a flat piece of grass in the shade.

, Spread out the food, markers, pens and whatever else you have chosen to play with. Make sure they are far enough apart that it will be obvious which item or person the bottle lands on when you spin it. Each person is also a part of the circle. The items are where the other people would be sitting if you were playing in a group.

, It should be on it’s side and within arms reach for both people, so the circle shouldn’t be too big.

, This game is best played with someone you are already in a relationship with. Asking someone to play this game as a way of getting to know them could be intimidating and awkward.

, This is pretty different from the group game, so take some time explaining how the game works and decide together what you want to do with each item in the circle.


Start by explaining the concept of the game, that each item will be placed in the circle in place of the group members in the common party game.
Decide together what you would like to do when the bottle lands on each item you have chosen for your circle.

, You can use a game of chance, like a coin flip, or you can talk it out and decide together.

, Reach out and grab the bottle. With the bottle still on it’s side, twist your wrist and give it an easy spin. Depending on the weight of the bottle, you won’t need to use too much effort for it to spin around at least one time. Glass bottles will have more weight and be more likely to stay in the middle and spin. Plastic bottles can get a little wild, so use a gentle touch.

, Whichever item the mouth of the bottle is pointing toward when the bottle stops spinning determines what the spinner must do. Grab the item or the person and do the appropriate action.


Feed the food to the other person.
Write them a love note with the pen and paper.
Draw them a picture with the markers.
Read a love poem to the other person.
Read their fortune from the fortune cookie.
Tie the blindfold around their eyes and surprise them by choosing any of the options in the circle.
Give the other person a rose or play “He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not.”
If the mouth of the bottle is facing the other person, kiss or hug them, whichever you are both comfortable with.

, Figure out what the other person likes and add these things to the game. Enjoy feeding each other. Draw fun pictures of how you see the other person as a superhero. Fold your love note to look like a flower. Get creative and enjoy your time together.

, It may take some explanation of how the game works, but now you’re an expert! The first and most important rule when initiating intimacy with someone is making sure they want to do the same things that you do.The best way know what they want is to ask them. It can be a simple yes or no question, or leave it open-ended and find out what they want. Consent is sexy.They these questions:


Do you want to do this?
Are you comfortable with this?
What do you want?

, Never pressure anyone into doing something which makes them uncomfortable. If they say, “no,” take it at face value and don’t write it off as someone being coy or playful. Also, don’t take it as a challenge and try to talk them into it. If they don’t want to play right now, that is fine. Don’t take it personally, just accept that this is not what they want to do and move on to something else.

, If they said yes and are enthusiastic about playing with you, that is great! If the enthusiasm fades or they seem to become less comfortable with what is happening, stop and ask if they want to continue.Ask one or more of these questions:


Are you okay?
Are you having fun?
Do you like this?
Do you want to stop?
Do you want to do something else?

, Even if someone gives consent, they can always take it away. Respect the other person and stop if they want to. This will show the other person that you respect them and they will trust you. Maybe they will even want to play again some other time.

Gather a group of friends.,
Sit in a circle.,
Spin the bottle!,
Kiss the person the bottle points at.,
Proceed to the next player and spin again.,
Enjoy!",How to Play Spin the Bottle1," When it comes to playing spin the bottle, the very first thing you'll need is other people (unless you want to play by yourself, which would be a pretty sad sight). To begin, find a group of willing friends — the more the merrier! Try to get a group that contains people of both genders so that there are a range of many different combinations of people who can potentially kiss.


Make sure your friends know what they are getting into before you start playing. Kissing is something that's usually reserved for people who really like each other, so forcing people to kiss who don't want to can be really embarrassing for everyone involved. Don't pressure anyone into playing with you who doesn't want to.;
, When everyone is ready (and willing) to play, arrange yourselves in a circle so that you're all facing inward. Traditionally, this is done on the floor, though there's no reason you can't also do it standing or sitting around a table. Regardless of exactly how you arrange your group in a circle, it's usually best to pick a spot with a tough, hard surface, like a section of hardwood floor. This ensures that the bottle you use can spin well without scuffing or damaging the floor.

, When you're all ready to play, pick one person to start the game. This person grabs a bottle (or, really, any similarly spin-able object, like a pen, glass, key, etc.) and spins it hard in the middle of the circle of players. After it starts spinning, no one may touch the bottle until it comes to a complete stop.


If you're unsure of how to decide who should spin the bottle first, you may want to try letting the oldest or youngest play go first or having one person think of a random number and starting with the person who guesses closest to it.

, When the bottle comes to a stop, its ""neck"" (the end that opens) should be pointing at someone sitting in the circle. The person who spun the bottle has to kiss this person!


If you're not using a bottle, designate one end of the object you're using as the pointing end. For instance, if you're using a pen, you might want to use the writing end of the pen as its ""point"".
If you spin the bottle and it lands on you, spin again.

, That's really all there is to it! After one person has spun the bottle and given a kiss to the person the bottle ends up pointing at, the person next to him or her in the circle gives the bottle a spin and gives a kiss to the person his or her spin lands on. Play proceeds in one direction — either clockwise or counter-clockwise.


Note that sometimes the bottle will end up pointing at the space between two people — in this case, you may want to make the spinner kiss the person that the bottle's point is closest to.
Additionally, the bottle may end up pointing at someone that you're not comfortable kissing because of your romantic preferences (for instance, if you're attracted to boys and it lands on a girl). In this case, you may want to kiss the person of the appropriate gender who's closest to the bottle's point.

, Congratulations! You've learned how to play spin the bottle. This fun and easy game is best enjoyed with a light-hearted attitude from all involved. Don't let things get too romantic or sexual — it's just a game, and one which can become pretty awkward pretty fast if it's taken too seriously.


However, if you do feel that telltale ""spark"" with someone after playing the game, there's no reason why you shouldn't make a point to get to know him or her after the game! Spin the bottle is great for igniting new connections you might not otherwise have made.

Try changing the ""prize"".,
Play with random stakes.,
Try using the back end of the bottle to select the kisser.,
Try ""Truth or Dare"" spin the bottle.",How to Play Spin the Bottle2," Though the classic version of spin the bottle is usually associated with teenagers kissing in their parents' basements, there's no rule that says you have to kiss the person that the bottle lands on. To spice things up (or make things more tame), try changing the spinner's ""prize"" to something else. Below are just a few ideas, listed from tamest to most racy:


Giving a compliment
Holding hands
Hugging
Kissing on the cheek
Kissing on the lips
French kissing
Making out
Playing ""Seven Minutes in Heaven""

Removing an article of clothing (for adults only!)

, If you'd like to play a version of spin the bottle with an added element of random chance, grab a six-sided die before you start playing. Designate a specific romantic action to each number 1-6. For instance, you might set 1 as kissing, 2 as hugging, 3 as making out, and so on. When you've assigned six actions, start play as you normally would. When the bottle lands on someone in the circle, the spinner rolls the die. The number that appears on the die determines which action the spinner has to perform on the person the bottle landed on.

, One simple variation of spin the bottle changes who does the kissing each round. Players proceed around the circle, spinning the bottle as normal. However, when the bottle comes to rest, the person that the back of the bottle points to, rather than the spinner, has to kiss the person that the front end of the bottle points at. In this variant, if you spin the bottle and the back end of the bottle ends up pointing at you, you still have to give a kiss — don't spin again.


Because this variant has the people sitting across from each other kissing each other exclusively, it's a smart idea to have everyone take new positions in the circle every few turns.

, One common variant of basic spin the bottle combines the rules of the game with those of Truth or Dare, the classic pranking, secret-telling game played at sleepovers all over the world. To play spin the bottle with Truth or Dare rules, begin as you normally would by having someone spin the bottle in the center of your circle. When the bottle lands on someone, the spinner asks him or her an embarrassing personal question. If s/he decides not to answer, s/he has to perform the dare that the spinner chooses, which can include kissing someone.


A second variant involves the person spinning the bottle announcing a dare to the group before spinning it. The person that the bottle lands on must perform the dare. This includes the person spinning, which adds a unique element of risk to the game.

Ready the game location.,
Gather the players.,
Explain the rules to the players.,
Create a random lottery.,
Play the game.",How to Play 7 Minutes in Heaven1," You'll need a small, closed off area of your home to play this game. This area is generally dark, though you could also choose one that is well lit. You might also want to include chairs for players to sit in, though this is not necessary to play the game.Some locations you might consider for your game include a closet, a bathroom, or a laundry room, to name a few.
If you want the room to be dark at all times, you could remove the light bulb(s) from the fixture(s) in the room.
Be sure that the area is clear and free of any obstacles that might be dangerous, especially if you've removed the lights from the room.
To keep players from watching the clock, you may want to remove clocks from the room where you'll be playing the game. This may include cell phones and watches.;
, Typically, this game is played with a roughly equal number of boys and girls, though depending on the preferences of the players, this might not always be the case. A group of 10 - 14 is common, though the game can be played with as few as 6 people.


You may want to play with friends from school, your neighborhood, or if you're at camp, you might try to play the game with campmates.

, Now that the room is prepared and you have your players gathered, you'll need to explain the rules of the game. This is particularly important because there can be many different variations of 7 Minutes in Heaven. Generally, the rules include:


Selecting two people at random.
Sending the chosen two into the room for a private 7 minutes. Don't forget to close the door!
Letting the chosen two out of the room at the end of 7 minutes.
You might also create ""house rules"" when you play, like ""the lights have to be on/off"" or ""no watches or cell phones allowed in the room.""
To prevent anyone from feeling uncomfortable, you may want to make a rule that no one has to go into the room unless they want to., This is how you're going to select the two people sent into the room for their 7 minutes in heaven. You might spin a bottle to randomly select two people or draw names from a hat. If you want to ensure that a boy and girl each are sent into the room, you could arrange your lottery by gender.To split your lottery by gender, you might spin the bottle once for the boys and another time for the girls. The person the bottle points to in each group will be sent to the room.
When drawing names from a hat or container, you might have one container for girls and one for boys. Each round of the game, you can select one name from each.

, Each round of the game consists of two people in the room for 7 minutes. You can play the game for as many rounds as you want, though you may want other activities, like a board game or cards, to keep other players occupied while waiting for the chosen two to finish their 7 minutes in heaven.A timer with a dramatic alert, like a siren, can add to the atmosphere of this game while helping you keep track of time.
When the timer is up, knock on the door and let the chosen two know that it's time to come out. Then you can select two new players with your random lottery.
You may want a dramatic reveal at the end of the 7 minutes in heaven. If this is the effect you desire, you could open the door suddenly when the time is up.

"
"
Set clear limits before playing.,
Voice discomfort as soon as it happens.,
Ask the other player before trying something new.",How to Play 7 Minutes in Heaven2," If there are no rules limiting how far you can go when playing this game, it's a good idea to set some personal limits with the person you'll be sharing your 7 minutes in heaven with. If you don't, the other player might misinterpret the signals you are setting and go too far.You might say something like, ""Can we just talk?"" or ""Let's talk first. I might be OK with a kiss, but I don't want to rush into it.""
You could also establish a firm boundary by saying, ""Kissing is OK, but I'm not OK with other touching."", Sometimes something will make you feel uncomfortable without you knowing it beforehand. When this happens, you should use straightforward language to tell the other player that you feel uncomfortable and want to stop.For example, if you are touched in a way you don't like, you could say, ""No. I don't want to be touched there.""
It can be difficult telling someone ""No,"" but if you don't, things might go farther than you intended. You should never take part in something that makes you feel uncomfortable., This includes things like hand-holding, petting, or other kinds of touches that might exceed the personal boundaries of the other player. This way, you don't accidentally violate someone's boundaries without knowing.


It only takes a quick second to ask, ""Is it OK if I hold your hand?"" or ""Is it alright for me to touch you like this?"""
"
Collect your thoughts.Give yourself a moment and take a deep, calming breath.,
Speak clearly about your feelings.,
Make an excuse.,
Suggest another activity instead.",How to Play 7 Minutes in Heaven3," In a peer pressure situation, emotions can get out of hand and make you say or do things you don't mean. Pausing for a moment will help you avoid a hasty response and better understand yourself in the moment.You might want to ask yourself, ""What kind of person do I want to be? Would that person do this?"" If the answer is no, it's likely you should not participate.

, People often get caught up in group mentality, but by expressing your personal feelings, you can connect with your friends/other players. This brings things from a group context to a personal one, making it easier for your friends to identify with you.You could say, ""I love hanging out with you guys and I don't want to be a stick in the mud, but I really don't feel comfortable playing this game.""

, Though honesty is almost always the best policy, if your friends/other players are determined to get you to play, an excuse can come in handy. This doesn't have to be a big fib, you could say something as simple as:""My throat's been a little sore lately and I don't want to get anyone sick.""
""I'm really embarrassed, but I have a canker sore that's been bothering me so I can't play.""

, There are plenty of group games you could play instead, and some of the other players might want to play these even more than 7 Minutes in Heaven. Some examples include Twister, charades, pictionary, UNO, and more.You may want to favor games that you know others in the group enjoy. You stand a better chance of playing a different game if others want to play.

, Don't worry, this is easier than it sounds because you have help. The lifters should help you get into said 'hand-stand' position by lifting the legs in an arc and guiding you up. Once there, hold steady. Once you are up, the valve operator will release the valve and hence the beer into your mouth.

, You can vary the amount of beer per cup so each side has an equal amount of beer in each cup.

, While sanitation isn't exactly the cornerstone of beer pong, nobody wants to drink a tainted cup of beer. Have some clean water handy so players can clean their balls before throwing, and keep paper towels on handy to soak up spills.

, The point of each triangle should face the opposing team. There will be one cup in the first row, two in the second row, three in the third row, and the base of the triangle will have four cups. Do not tilt the cups.You can also play with 6 cups.
The more cups, the longer the game will likely last.

, Many games are started by a member of each team playing rock, paper, scissors. Winners go first. Another variation to choose who goes first is playing “eye-to-eye.” To do this, teams try to make a cup while maintaining eye contact with the opponent, and the first one to do so goes first. You can also flip a coin.

, Each team gets to throw one ball per turn. The goal is throw the ball into a cup of the opposing team. You can throw the ball directly into a cup or bounce a ball off of the table into a cup.


Try to arc the ball when you throw. It is more likely to land in a cup.
Aim for a cluster of cups as opposed to the edges of the triangle.
Try underhand or overhand throwing and see which works best for you.

, When the ball lands in a cup, alternate drinking the beer between you and your partner—if you drink the first cup, let your partner drink the second. Set the cup aside once you drink it.

, Once 6 cups of beer have been drunk, restack the remaining 4 into a diamond. This will make shooting easier for everyone.

, Once 8 cups have been drunk, arrange the last 2 into a line.

, The team who has no cups loses, and the other team has won.

, There are many variations to the rules of beer pong. In this variation, the same team continues throwing 2 balls per round until there is a miss. After the turn is completed, the opposite team throws at the first team's cups, and the process repeats.

, This is one of the most common variations on beer pong. If you hit the cup you called, your opponent drinks that cup. If you miss your target and it goes in the wrong cup, it counts as a miss, and that cup remains on the table.

, The opposing team gets a last turn; this is called a “rebuttal.” They keep shooting until they miss, at which time the game is over. If they make the ball into all of the opposing teams’ cups in their last turn, then a 3 cup overtime is played. Now, the teams compete in sudden death to figure out the final winner.

, In this variation, a bounce shot counts as 2 cups, and the player that made the shot can pick the other cup that he/she wants to be removed.

, If you play two games it will kill an entire keg.

,, Fill the cups with beer as usual.

, Each side consists of a team of four people. The way it goes is that one team starts, either through winning an eye stare toss or whatever you decide to begin the game. It is not the other team's turn until everyone has thrown their beer pong ball. When cups are made they are left on the table until the end of the turn. If someone from your team makes it in the same cup as you then it counts for 3 cups. If you make 3 balls in the same cup it is 5 cups pulled. Bouncing counts as 2 cups. There are no re-racks in this beer pong game so be strategic about your tosses.

, When shot is made team drinks beer according to own rules (split between all members, or pairs of two, for example).

Purchase an 8x4 foot (2.43x1.22 meter) piece of plywood.,
Place your plywood over a tabletop or countertop.,
Secure your plywood to the table.,
Waterproof your beer pong table.",How to Make a Beer Pong Table1," Retailers and hardware stores typically sell plywood for framing and home use, in 8x4 foot (2.43x1.22 meter) sized pieces.You can also use leftover plywood that you have from a housing project, or you can contact a lumber or hardware store to see if they have extra scraps they are willing to give away for free.


If the plywood is cut to a slightly different size like 9x3 feet (2.74x0.91 meters), it's still suitable to use for your beer pong table.
The average cost of a cheap, 8x4 foot (2.43x1.22 meter) piece of plywood can be anywhere from $13 to $20.If the sales associate tries to get you to buy a more expensive type of plywood say, ""I'm only using this as a beer pong table. Give me your cheapest stuff because I don't need a high-quality plywood."";
, Place your plywood over a table or countertop. Longer tables work best because the plywood has something to rest on, rather than floating in the air. If you have a thicker or heavier plywood, there will be less of a chance of it tipping over and falling.


Advise people not to lean or stand on the beer pong table because it can quickly collapse.
Fold up tables or dining room table tops are usually the most commonly used beer pong tables.

, You must make sure that your plywood is steady on top of the table or it may topple over. Use duct tape to attach the plywood to the table by wrapping it around the table and your piece of plywood. Use as many pieces of tape that you need until your table feels secure to the table.


You can also place heavy objects in the center of the table to hold it down.
Do not use an expensive table when doing this because the duct tape could pull away some of the table's finish.
To test the security of your table, softly push down on either end of the table to see if it tips over.

, Waterproofing your table will prevent the plywood from becoming damaged if beer or other liquids get spilled on your table. Go to the hardware store or look online for waterproofing sealants, stains, or paints that you can purchase. Once you get them, apply a thin coat of the sealant to the surface of your beer pong using a wide painters brush. Allow the stain or sealant to dry fully before using the table.Sealing your table will make cleaning it much easier and reduce the bad scent that often comes with spilled beer.
Not sealing your pong table could result in mold growth if you don't clean up spills well.
When using a waterproof sealant or paint, do it outside or make sure that the windows are open.

Arrange cups 10 on a side, in pyramid formation.,
Each beer pong team of two starts off with one ball.,
Drinking is alternated.,
As soon as the ball touches anything, including a cup, it's fair game to be grabbed.,
Re-stack cups into pyramids when 6 cups and 3 cups remain on a side.,
When the last cup on a side is hit, the losing team has the opportunity to match, getting one or two balls to shoot depending on whether or not the winning team used both shots.,
Any cups left on the side of the winning team must be consumed by the losing team.

",How to Play Beer Pong Variations2," Three beers per side, evenly distributed.

, Beer Pong players throw the ball across the beer pong table, trying to get the ball in a cup. When a ball lands in a cup, one player from that side must chug that cup, and it is removed from the play area (pushing it to the side is OK). When both players on a team sink a cup, they get the balls back.

, One player drinks the first beer cup, the other drinks the second, the first player drinks the third, and so on. Throwing can either be alternated or done two at a time. Some people think that throwing two at a time improves accuracy, but studies are inconclusive. It's up to you and your partner.

, If it bounces in, great, but you'd better hope your opponents have no reflexes. Bouncing it in counts for two cups.

,


When 4 cups remain on a side, re-stack them in a diamond formation.
When 2 cups remain, they are placed one in front of the other.
When one cup remains, it is placed in the corner of the table.

, If the losing team manages to clear all of the winning team's cups while matching, both teams resume the game with three cups and one beer per side.

Streaking: If one team didn't make a shot the entire game, first they finish the other teams' beers.",How to Play Beer Pong Variations3,", Same rules, if you're playing doubles, partners rotate shots and drinks)

, As soon as the beer pong ball hits something, you can smack it away so it won't bounce in.

, You can't shoot back until your drink is drunk.

, After the last cup is made, the team behind gets 2 shots (one per partner) to try to rebut.

, This one is definitely different. Play with 2 beer pong balls. One is white, one is yellow. One partner shoots the white beer pong ball, the other shoots the yellow beer pong ball. If you make the yellow beer pong ball, you get it right back and retain your turn. You keep getting it back as long as you make it. Teams decide which player wants to throw their money ball. You can rotate back and forth between throwing the white beer pong ball or the money beer pong ball. Whoever is on a roll typically should throw the money beer pong ball.

, Male beer pong players can not blow the beer pong ball out of the cup in the event it is spinning.

, Then they proceed to take off their clothes and streak 1 time around the house/apartment.

Purchase a thick plywood.,
Cut the plywood in half.,
Arrange eight pieces of wood to form a frame under your tabletop.,
Nail your frame together.,
Nail the frame to the plywood.,
Attach a four foot long piano hinge to the center.,
Mount folding legs to the bottom of the table.",How to Make a Beer Pong Table2," A thick piece of plywood will add stability to your table. Buy a 4x8 foot (1.2x2.4 meter) piece of plywood, which will become the surface of your table. When looking for plywood, look for variations that are a 1/2 an inch (12.7 millimeters) or 3/4 of an inch (19.05 millimeters) thick.

, Measure four feet from the end of either side of the table, lengthwise, and make a mark with a pencil in the center. Use a straight edge to draw a line width-wise on the plywood. The line in the center of your plywood will be where the table folds. Use a circular saw, miter saw, or table saw to cut your plywood in half., Set your two tabletops on the ground with the top of the table facing down. Arrange planks of wood around the outer edges of your plywood to create the frame. Because each piece of your table top measures 4x4 feet (1.2x1.2 meters), the frame under your plywood must also be 4x4 feet. Create two frames for each side of your tabletop. Make sure that the plywood and the planks of wood run flush on all four sides. Once your frame is the right size, you can set your plywood to the side.


If your wooden planks are too long, then you may need to cut them down with a saw.
The frame will look like a shallow wooden box on top of your plywood.
You can purchase the framing lumber at most hardware stores.
For this project, a 2"" x 6"" (38 x 140 mm) piece of lumber could work for framing material.

, Once the frame is set up, nail the pieces together so that it forms two frames that are 4x4 feet (1.2x1.2) meters big. Put two nails in each corner of your frame, attaching the two pieces of wood together to form an L. Once all sides of your frame have been nailed together, you should have a square made out of your lumber.

, Position the plywood over your frame and make sure that the edges run flush. Once it's in the correct position, put nails or screws into the surface of your plywood, attaching the frame to the plywood. You may need to put multiple nails along the surface of the plywood to safely secure the top of the table to the frame.Repeat the process on the other piece of plywood.

, A piano hinge is a metal hinge that can be used to connect both sides of your table together. Flip the table over, so that the surface of the table is facing the ground. Bring the two piece of tables together so that the frames are flush with one another. Place the piano hinge to both sides of the frame and center it. Once the hinge is flush, put screws into each of the holes to firmly attach it to the table's frame., Purchase folding table legs at a hardware store or online. This will make it so that your folding beer pong table has something to stand on when deployed. Lay the legs under the table, inside of the frame. Test the legs and fold them out to see how they will function. Once you're satisfied with the placement, screw them in with an electric drill.Folding legs allow your table to be folded up and transported easily.
Do not get legs that are longer than 3.5 feet (1 meter), or they may not fit inside of your wooden frame.

Create your design before you begin work.,
Paint the surface of the table.,
Let your guests decorate the table.,
Get creative with your table.",How to Make a Beer Pong Table3," Think of ideas for how you want to decorate your beer pong table. Talk to your roommates and think of something that represents the house or an inside joke that you all share. You can also add to the functionality of your pong table with the design by designating where each player should put their cups. You can do this by drawing or painting round circles that are the same size as the cups that you'll be putting out.


If you're designating where players put their cups, make sure to trace the top of the cup because your cups will need to fit next to one another when you play. If you trace the bottom of the cup, the circles will be too close together.
Good ideas for designs include a favorite sports team, the university that you attend, or the fraternity, sorority, or club that you all belong to.

, Purchase paint at a hardware store and use a flat brush to paint the surface of the table. Laying down a colored base coat may make whatever you're painting on top of it pop. Before painting on top of another layer of paint, make sure that it dries.


If you want more accurate straight lines, lay down painters tape in the places that you want to make your line.
Using a stencil is also another great idea to get more detailed images by using paint.

, Another idea is to allow your guests and party members to decorate the table over time. Start the fun by using some thick markers to draw all over the surface of the table. Encourage people at the party to join in and draw something of their own. Over time, your beer pong table should fill up and have a personality of its own.

, There are other ways that you can alter or change your beer pong table. One example is a group that used LED lights to illuminate their table during games.You can also engrave a wooden table, or can use graffiti paint to create a unique design or tag. Get creative and think of different methods that you can use to enhance the look of the table.

Use 15 beer cups on each side, aligned in rows...5 beer cups in the back, 4 beer cups right in front, 3 beer cups in front of that, then 2, then one... All beer cups must be touching, so it forms a triangle.",How to Play Beer Pong Variations5," Each cup is filled about halfway with beer. There is a team of two beer pong players on each side of the beer pong table and no paddles are used. Instead, one team starts the game by each person tossing a beer pong ball and trying to get it into one of the cups. If you get the ball into one of the opposing team’s cups, one member of the opposing team drinks the beer in that cup, team members alternate who drink’s the beer every time the other team gets a ball in their cup. Once the beer is drunk from that cup, the cup is placed aside and out of the triangle. Once the team has taken their two shots at the cups, the other team shoots back, and it goes on like that. The point of the game is to eliminate all of the other team’s cups. The shot must be direct, and cannot bounce off the beer pong table and then go into the cup. Also, if both members of a team make their shots consecutively, the 2 balls are returned to that team and they get another chance. We used to play by your rules, but found this game to be much more competitive and fun. And it doesn't take a blackjack game genius to figure it out.

Get your teammates and materials.,
Arrange ten cups in the normal triangle formation.,
Eliminate cups.,
Play until someone wins.",How to Play Beer Pong Variations7," The game is played with teams of two and two pong balls. You will need 14 cups per team.

, Then, stack 3 more cups on top of the middle cups. They should also form a triangle. Finally, add one cup on top of the three cups. Fill with your beverage of choice.

, The goal of the Demolition is to eliminate the cups from top to bottom, starting by making a shot into the top cup, followed by the middle three and down to the base level.


Cups cannot be eliminated out of order. For example, a shot made into one of the bottom 10 cups only counts as a point if the top 4 cups have already been eliminated.
However, if you land your shot in a cup on a higher level and it proceeds to land into cups below it (WITHOUT knocking them over or off the table), the cups will count regardless of which level they are on. As such, they must be drank by the opposing team. This move is called a ""wrecking ball.""
Note that other than the exceptions mentioned above, normal beer pong rules apply. This includes bounces, which are worth two cups.

, Winners are the first team to remove all of the cups of the opposing team. Losers must finish all remaining drinks."

The skillet should be seasoned beforehand. Place it into the oven as it preheats, then remove it when you are ready to pour in the batter.;
, Crack two eggs into a small bowl. Gently whisk them together until the yolks and whites are roughly combined.


Break the yolks with the top of the whisk, then whisk the eggs together for 20 to 30 seconds. The yolks and whites only need to be partially combined; they do not need to be foamy or consistently colored.
Note that you could also use a fork instead of a whisk

, Add the cornmeal, flour, and baking soda to a large mixing bowl. Stir the ingredients together until evenly combined.


Use a wooden or plastic mixing spoon to combine the dry ingredients. Continue stirring until the cornmeal and flour look evenly intermixed.
This recipe uses standard yellow cornmeal. If you decide to use self-rising cornmeal, however, do not add any baking soda to the cornbread batter.

, Pour the buttermilk, beaten eggs, and vegetable oil into the dry ingredients. Mix together until the batter just barely combines.


If desired, you could mix the wet ingredients together in a separate mixing bowl before adding them to the dry ingredients. Doing so may make it slightly easier to combine the ingredients thoroughly, but it usually isn't necessary.
The finished batter may still have a few lumps in it. Most of the lumps should be beaten out, however, and you should not be able to distinguish any one specific ingredient from another.

, Pour the prepared cornbread batter into your greased baking dish. Use the back of a spoon or spatula to even out the top.


If you're working with a room-temperature baking dish, firmly grasp the baking dish by its sides and sift the dish back and forth. Doing so should help distribute the batter evenly throughout the pan.

, Place the baking dish into your preheated oven and cook the cornbread for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it becomes dry and golden brown.Test the inside of the cornbread by inserting a toothpick or knife through the center. The utensil may pull away a few moist crumbs, but it should not pull up any wet batter.

, Set the cornbread aside and allow it to cool to room temperature before proceeding with the cornbread dressing steps.


You can use the cornbread immediately after it cools, but you could also store it for up to two days in your refrigerator or up to two weeks in your freezer before preparing the cornbread dressing.
When storing cornbread for later use, place it in a freezer-safe plastic bag. Remove as much air as possible from the bag before placing it into your refrigerator or freezer.

, Meanwhile, lightly grease a 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) baking dish with cooking spray or shortening.


Even if you're making the dressing immediately after making the cornbread, it's still a good idea to turn the oven off in between. The cornbread will need to cool for several hours before you can work with it, and leaving the oven on during that entire time would be a significant waste of energy.

, Crumble the cooled cornbread into a large bowl or stockpot. Break up the toast with your hands and add it to the cornbread crumbles, stirring gently to combine.


Note that the prepared cornbread will produce roughly 4 cups (1 L) of crumbles.
The white bread can be toasted in the oven or with a toaster. If preferred, you could skip the bread and use 3 cups (750 ml) herb-seasoned stuffing, herb-seasoned croutons, or crumbled biscuits.

, Cut the butter into chunks and toss it into a large skillet. Place the skillet on your stove over medium heat and allow the butter to melt.


Butter will produce the richest, most traditional flavor, but margarine can be used as a substitute. Liquid cooking oils are less ideal, however.

, Add the diced onion and diced celery to the melted butter. Cook the vegetables for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the onion turns translucent and both become notably soft.You can save time by using packaged, pre-diced vegetables instead of chopping the vegetables yourself. If you choose to do this, you'll need about 1 cup (250 ml) diced onion and 1 cup (250 ml) diced celery.

, Carefully pour the onion and celery mixture into the cornbread mixture, then stir the ingredients together until evenly combined.


Scrape all of the melted butter out of the skillet and into the cornbread mixture, too. Do not strain the cooked vegetables from the butter.

, Add the broth into the cornbread-vegetable mixture 1 cup (250 ml) at a time, stirring well after each addition.


Only add as much broth as needed to make the dressing thick and slightly soupy. The dressing does need to be thoroughly moist to avoid drying it out in the oven, but there should be no excess puddles of moisture sitting on top of the dressing after you add the broth., Sprinkle the salt, black pepper, and poultry seasoning over the cornbread mixture. Stir well to incorporate these ingredients into the dressing.


You can adjust the seasonings to taste. Start with 1 tsp (5 ml) of each, stir well, and taste the dressing. Add additional seasoning as needed, working with 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) at a time.
The dressing mixture should taste exactly as you'd prefer it to taste after you finish adding your seasonings. Make all adjustments during this step; do not taste and adjust the seasonings after you add the eggs.

, Lightly beat the eggs in a separate bowl, then pour them into the bowl of dressing. Stir well until evenly combined.


Beat the eggs for 30 seconds using a whisk or fork. The yolks and whites should be slightly combined before you add the eggs to the dressing mixture.

, Spoon the cornbread dressing into your prepared baking dish. Use the back of the spoon the spread the dressing and even out the top.

, Place the baking dish into your preheated oven and bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until the dressing is set and golden brown.


To prevent the dressing from burning, cover the pan with foil for the first 30 minutes. Remove the foil and allow the dressing to continue cooking uncovered.
Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick or knife into the center of the dish. It should come out clean if the dressing is ready.
If you prefer drier dressing, you can let it continue baking for 5 minutes past its ""done"" stage. Monitor the dressing closely, however, to prevent the top surface from burning.

, Allow the cornbread dressing to cool at room temperature for several minutes before spooning out individual servings. Enjoy it while it's still warm for the best flavor.

, Many raw food recipes require marinades or soaking for tough grains and nuts. This may be impossible to do on Thanksgiving day. Many recipes also need considerable prep work, like shredding, dicing, or chilling portions of the recipes. Know what you are going to cook so you can start meal prep earlier that week., If you are considering serving dishes you have never tried before or hosting non-raw food dieters, select a few recipes for a test run. This helps you know exactly how they will taste and how to prepare them. If there are any problems, you can correct them before Thanksgiving day.

You can rate the recipes on flavor, denseness, and similarity to non-raw food dishes.

Turkey is packed with protein and makes an appealing main dish to any Thanksgiving meal.Rather than frying your turkey—which adds unhealthy fats to the meat—try smoking the bird or cooking it in a pressure-cooker.


Serve the turkey relatively early in the evening, rather than letting yourself and your guests fill upon side dishes to avoid the temptation to eat carbs.;
, If you (or your family or friends) prefer not to eat turkey, there are plenty of other high-protein, low-carb main dishes to serve. Consider cooking a spiral-cut ham, pork chops, or even a lighter protein like chicken or fish. Serving a lighter main course will fill people up less and leave more room for your low-carb sides.


Similar to the turkey, avoid breading or deep-frying these main dishes. The meat will remain low-carb—and healthier overall—if you cook it in an oven, smoker, or pressure cooker, without the use of breading or grease.

, While stuffing is typically a bready, high-carb part of the main dish, you can alter the primary ingredients make your stuffing with sweet and delicious fruits and nuts. You’ll gain proteins and healthy sugar, while sacrificing carbs. You can still put the fruit and nut stuffing inside the turkey and roast it all together, if you choose to serve stuffing in the bird.To make the stuffing, you’ll need access to a large number of ingredients, including: prunes, currants, celery, cranberries, onions, cashews, and walnuts. If you’d prefer not use any of these ingredients, individual fruits can likely be substituted out for a fruit with a similar texture and consistency.

, Rather than filling your table with rolls and gravy, you can serve equally delicious low-carb recipes. Focus on finding and cooking side dishes that emphasize proteins and vegetables. Make veggies and dip (like a spinach sauce or hummus), and serve cucumber slices or nuts instead of setting out a big bowl of carb-heavy tortilla or potato chips.A cheese plate makes a great side-dish. Fill the plate with slices of three or four diverse cheeses, a few olives, and crackers. Then you can add fruits and nuts: dried apricots, strawberries, grapes, and pecans will nicely round out the plate., This will modify your Thanksgiving meal by shifting the focus from fatty and high-carb dishes to something more focused in low-carb finger foods. A relish tray typically consists of pickle spears, olives, baby carrots, and roasted artichokes.Serving this relish tray early will also help you—and guests—curb your appetite early and save less room for potentially high-carb dishes later in the meal.
If you’d like to spice up the relish tray and serve more than the basics, you can include hot peppers (such as pepperoncini), roasted red peppers, or radishes.

, Many popular Thanksgiving sides and dishes are built around fairly healthy items, but are slathered with high-sugar, high-carb dressings or toppings. You can still serve yams or sweet potatoes at a low-carb Thanksgiving, but rather than baking them topped with marshmallows, serve the yams seasoned with butter, salt, and pepper.Green beans, another common Thanksgiving side, can similarly be served with more focus on the beans themselves. Skip the green-bean casserole (especially if it involves carb-heavy elements like mushroom soup and onion rings) and serve the green beans steamed and tossed with sliced almonds and butter., Salads are a Thanksgiving staple, and can be slightly altered into another popular, healthy, and tasty low-carb option. Skip the croutons and ranch dressing, and instead garnish your salad with olives, asparagus, sundried tomatoes, and use a light vinaigrette dressing.You can also branch out entirely on your low-carb salad. Try a recipe like this for a change: Swiss chard with crème fraîche, which is low-carb and nutritious.This or another atypical salad will provide a welcome break from typical romaine- or iceberg-based salads that are often served at Thanksgiving dinners.

, Many potato-based dishes are Thanksgiving staples. However, potatoes are also high in carbohydrates. You can create a more nutrient-rich meal by substituting sweet potatoes. Serve sweet potatoes mixed with low-carb veggies to get a nutritious, lower carbohydrate side dish.Consider making a root-vegetable salad, using sweet potatoes, carrots, turnips, and parsnips. Cut these veggies into bite-sized pieces, stir them with cooking oil, onion, and garlic, and roast in the oven until caramelized.
Sweet potatoes have roughly the same amount of carbohydrates per serving as white potatoes, but they are more nutrient-dense than other potatoes, with more vitamin A, and vitamin C per serving. They also have a lower glycemic index., You don’t need to sacrifice Thanksgiving dessert in order to avoid carbs. Instead, make a naturally low-carb dessert, such as a sugar-free cheesecake. This recipe substitutes almond flour for traditional flour in the crust, and also incorporates low-carb, high-protein pecans and Splenda.Thanksgiving desserts are notoriously high in carbohydrates, and include many bread-or grain-based stables including pumpkin and pecan pies, various types of cookies, and cakes. Try to remove as many of these high-carb treats from your Thanksgiving table as possible, and replace them with a low-carb dessert.

, If you’re avoiding Thanksgiving pies because of the potentially high-carb crusts, you can search online for low-carb substitutes. For example, make a crust using crushed crushed pecans or another substitute grain in the place of flour. Pie fillings can also be modified to have low carbs, by using sugar substitutes or alternate ingredients.If you check at a health-food grocery store, you may also be able to find a low-carb flour substitute which you can include in cakes and cookies.

, Sugar is considered a high-carb ingredient, but you can make dishes sugary relatively low-carb by swapping out the sugar for low-carb sweeteners, such as Splenda, Truvia, or sucralose. Try swapping the two ingredients in a pumpkin pie: make the filling using a low-carb sweetener.You can also use sweeteners in a whole-grain cranberry sauce, as a substitute for sugar. This will not diminish the taste of the sauce, but will lower the carbohydrates.

Serve hot.",How to Cook a Turkey in a Bag," The turkey must be fully thawed before you cook it. Pull it out of your freezer three days in advance and place it, unopened and breast-side up, on a tray in your refrigerator.When refrigerator thawing a turkey, give the bird at least one day thawing time for every 4 lbs (1.8 kg).
Alternatively, you can thaw the turkey in cold water. Remove the turkey from the freezer six hours ahead of time and place it, unopened and breast-side down, in a clean sink. Cover it with cold water and change the water every 30 minutes.

, Position one rack on the second-to-bottom rack ledge in your oven and remove any of the racks above it.


You must change the position of the racks to ensure that the bag will have room to expand as it cooks. The bag must not touch the top or sides of the oven; if it does, the plastic will melt.Pull out your roasting pan, too. The pan must be at least 2 inches (5 cm) deep and large enough to prevent the bag from hanging over the sides.;
, Remove the turkey from its plastic or paper wrappings, then reach into the cavity and pull out the neck and giblets (liver, heart, and gizzard).


To prevent possible contamination, keep the turkey in a clean sink as you remove the giblets.
The giblets will usually be held together in a small bag, and both the neck and giblets should be fairly easy to remove from a thawed turkey.
Discard the neck and giblets or save them to make turkey gravy, stock, or other similar recipes.

, Rinse the entire turkey with cool, running water. Clean both the outer skin and the interior cavity.


Pat the newly cleaned turkey dry using clean paper towels. Immediately discard these paper towels; do not reuse for any other purpose.

, You can cook both stuffed and unstuffed turkey using this method. If you want to stuff the turkey, loosely pack the prepared stuffing into the cavity now.


After packing in the stuffing, secure it by inserting a skewer through the ends of the open turkey cavity.
Note that stuffing the turkey will increase the overall cooking time. If you want to have both stuffing and a shorter cooking time, your best option is to cook the stuffing and turkey separately.

, Place the turkey on a large baking sheet and use cotton cooking twine to tie the legs and wings down against the body of the turkey.Tie the twine firmly, but do not make it tight enough to dig into the flesh of the bird. If you tie it too tight, the twine will leave marks in the skin even after the turkey is finished cooking.
Check the skin near the legs before tying them down. If there's a band of loose skin there, you can tuck the legs into that skin instead of tying them down with twine.
Tying or tucking these elements will prevent them from drying out as the rest of the turkey cooks.

, Use a basting brush to evenly cover the skin with melted butter, margarine, or vegetable oil.


Melted butter will usually create better browning than margarine or oil.
If desired, you could use a baster to squeeze additional melted butter into the space between the skin and the meat.

, Combine the salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning in a small dish, then evenly rub the blend over the entire surface of the turkey.


This combination is a very basic one, but you could use a different spice blend in the same way if you have a different poultry blend you would prefer. Other seasonings commonly used with turkey include garlic powder, paprika, and basil, among others.

, Place the flour in the roasting bag and carefully shake the bag until the flour coats its entire interior. Once you finish coating it, place the bag inside your roasting pan.


Coating the bag with flour helps prevent the meat from sticking to the plastic. Additionally, the flour also makes the bag less likely to burst.
Note that you could also coat the bag with nonstick cooking spray, if desired, but doing so is not necessary.

, Evenly spread the onion wedges over the interior bottom of the bag.


The onion will add flavor to the turkey as it cooks in its own juices. You could skip the onion altogether, though, and the turkey will still cook just fine.

, Carefully slide the seasoned turkey into the oven roasting bag. When finished, the opening of the bag should face the end of the roasting pan and should not face straight up.


No part of the bag should hang over the edges of the pan. If necessary, tuck the loose ends of the bag beneath the turkey to prevent them from sticking out.

, Draw the opening closed and tie it in place using the included nylon twist tie.


Most oven roasting bags are sold with appropriate ties. If there is no tie included with your roasting bag, however, you can tied the opening closed using cotton kitchen twine.
Tuck the newly closed end under the turkey to prevent it from hanging out over the side of the pan.

, Use a sharp knife to create six 1/2-inch to 1-inch (1.25-cm to 2.5-cm) slits over the surface of the closed roasting bag.Position these slits evenly over the top of the bag.
Puncturing the bag is necessary so that steam can escape while the turkey cooks. If you do not puncture the bag, that steam can build up, and the pressure could cause the bag to burst inside the oven.

, Poke a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the turkey thigh, inserting it directly through the bag in the process.


Do not place the thermometer inside of the bag since it will be too difficult to read there.
Make sure that the tip of the thermometer only touches the meat of the turkey and does not come into contact with the bone.
Even though most turkeys include a disposable pop-up thermometer, you should still insert an actual meat thermometer into the meat. Pop-up thermometers are not always an accurate gauge of doneness.

, Place the turkey in your preheated oven and roast it for 2-1/4 to 2-3/4 hours, or until the meat thermometer reads 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).The cooking time will vary depending on the weight of the turkey. As a general rule:

Roast for 1-1/2 to 2 hours for an 8 to 12 lb (3.6 to 5.4 kg) turkey.
Roast for 2 to 2-1/2 hours for a 12 to 16 lb (5.4 to 7.2 kg) turkey.
Roast for 2-1/2 to 3 hours for a 16 to 20 lb (7.2 to 9 kg) turkey.
Roast for 3 to 3-1/2 hours for a 20 to 24 lb (9 to 10.8 kg) turkey.


Note that these time ranges are for an unstuffed turkey. If you stuffed the turkey, you will need to add another 30 to 45 minutes to the cooking time.
You should also test the temperature of the turkey breast before removing the bird from the oven. The breast meat must reach an internal temperature of 170 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsius).

, Remove the finished turkey from the oven but let it stand in the roasting bag for another 10 to 15 minutes.


During this resting time, the meat will continue to cook, and the juices will distribute themselves and settle more consistently.

, Carefully slice the top of the bag open with a knife. Remove the turkey and place it onto a cutting board or serving platter.


Be careful when opening the bag. The steam will be hot and may cause mild burns if it comes into direct contact with sensitive skin.
To lift the turkey out of the bag and roasting pan, insert one carving fork into each end of the turkey, then lift it straight up and out.

, Carve the turkey as desired and serve it while the meat is still hot.


If desired, you can pour the leftover cooking juices out of the bag and into a bowl or saucepan. Skim the oil and use the rest of the liquid for turkey gravy or broth.

Untreated raw acorns contain high concentrations of tannic acid, so their taste is bitter, and they can be toxic to humans, if eaten in large quantities.Water process/treat only ripened, brown acorns. Avoid any acorns that appear mildewed, dusty, blackened, etc. Quality nutmeat will be yellowish in colour.Unprocessed, natural nuts of various kinds of oaks:


White oaks produce bland tasting acorns. The best for harvesting are the Swamp Oak, Oregon White Oak, and the burr oak.Generally these won't need leaching.
Red oaks produce bitter tasting acorns.
The Emory Oak's acorns are mild enough to not require processing.Black oaks produce very bitter tasting acorns and need a lot of leaching to overcome this.;
, Pouring off the hot water (also called blanching) with repeated changes of water. Continue doing this until the water stops turning brown when you strain and replace it.


Another method for leaching: Place one tablespoon of baking soda into one litre of water. Leave the acorns to soak in the baking soda infused water for 12-15 hours.
A Native American or rustic method is bagging the shelled nuts and allowing them to soak in a clean, flowing stream for a few days until no brown colored water is seen when checking their progress., (On the other hand, raw acorns can be stored for months without spoiling; this dramatically increases their value, being a ""process as needed food resource"".) But only when leached: are they ready to use.

, Peel the ripe, leached/blanched acorns. Divide the kernels. Place in an ovenproof dish and cover. Roast in a low heat oven to dry slowly. Stir frequently. Once roasted (light, medium or dark), grind. The resulting mixture can be blended into commercial coffee -- or used on its own to make acorn coffee.

, Read How to make acorn flour for instructions. Use the flour to make breads, muffins, etc.

, Spread the sliced almonds evenly across an ungreased, rimmed baking sheet.


The almonds will toast evenly if there is minimal overlap between the nuts.
Use a rimmed baking sheet to prevent the sliced almonds from spilling over the edges.

, The almonds will need to be flipped or stirred every few minutes, so try not to get distracted by something else or leave them unattended.


After about 5 minutes, open the oven door and stir the almonds around on the baking sheet with a wooden spoon. Alternatively, you could shake the baking sheet to redistribute the nuts.
Close the oven door and continue to stir the nuts every 5 minutes or so.

, The almonds will take between 10 and 15 minutes to toast completely, but you will have to pay careful attention to avoid burning them.


Wait until the nuts are fragrant and turning golden brown around the edges before you remove them.
Don't wait until they turn dark brown, however, because the almonds will continue to cook for a short time after leaving the oven, and will likely end up burnt.

, Allow the nuts to cool completely before using -- this will make them extra crunchy.


If you left the almonds in the oven for slightly too long, transfer them to a cold tray while they're still hot to prevent further toasting.
If you're not using the almonds immediately, you can store them in a sealable plastic bag (once cooled), to preserve their flavor and texture.

, Toasted sliced almonds are very tasty and versatile and can be used in a wide variety of dishes.


Eat them on their own as a quick and healthy snack -- you can drizzle them in a little olive oil and sprinkle them with salt first, if you like.
Use them to add color, texture and flavor on top of salads, desserts and even pizza.
Use them in cake, bread and muffin batters (toasted almonds are less likely to sink to the bottom).

Heat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for two to three minutes or until the seeds turn brown, glisten, and occasionally pop or jump.Do not add oil to the skillet.
For a nuttier flavor, try the longer thorough toasting method instead.;
, Alternatively, you can preheat the oven to 350ºF (175ºC), and spread the seeds onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake until lightly browned, shaking the pan gently every few minutes to spread the heat more evenly.This typically takes eight to fifteen minutes, depending on how thick the layer of sesame seeds is.


Use a baking sheet with deep sides to avoid spilling.
Sesame seeds can burn very quickly if the heat gets too high. Stay in the kitchen and don't forget to check frequently.

, Once the seeds are done toasting in either method, transfer them to a cool baking sheet and let them cool to room temperature. They will cool faster on metal than plastic or glass surfaces.

Heat on high until the seeds are dry.,
Reduce heat to medium.,
Let cool and store.",How to Toast Sesame Seeds2," Unhulled sesame seeds have a dull, hard coat that ranges in color from off-white to black. Hulled seeds have had this removed, and are always very white, almost translucent, and shiny.You can toast either type of seed, but the unhulled seeds are crunchier and have a slightly different flavor. Seeds with hulls contain more calcium but may be more difficult to digest, unless you plan to grind them, so the nutritional value is comparable.While you can soak unhulled seeds overnight, then remove the hulls by hand, the process is labor-intensive and rarely done at home. Both varieties should be available in Asian grocery stores, and often in Western stores as well.

, Rinse the seeds in a fine mesh strainer under running water, until the water runs through clear. If the seeds are straight from the farm or the water gets quite dirty, you may want to stir them in a bowl of water for a couple minutes, then let it sit. Discard dust that rises to the top, and pebbles that sink to the bottom.Rinsing will not negatively affect the nutrition of the seeds. Some people even prefer to soak seeds overnight to germinate them, which may improve the digestion of certain nutrients.These germinated seeds are typically eaten raw rather than toasted, however.

, Transfer the rinsed seeds to a dry skillet or frying pan over high heat. Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon, but watch the seeds constantly, as they burn quickly if the heat gets too high. This step typically takes ten minutes. Once dry, the seeds will feel and sound different as you stir them, and no moisture will be left behind on the pan., Continue to stir occasionally for the next seven or eight minutes. When the seeds are fully toasted, they will turn a light brown color, glisten, and a few will start popping or jumping in the pan.Pick up a few seeds with the spoon and pinch them between your fingers. Toasted seeds can be crushed into a powder, and have a nuttier taste than raw seeds.

, Spread the toasted seeds on a metal baking sheet and let cool to room temperature. Store any seeds you don't use immediately in an airtight container in the refrigerator or freezer.


The seeds should stay good in the fridge or freezer for over a year, but they will become less flavorful over time.Toast the seeds dry for a couple minutes to restore some flavor.

Optionally, grind the seeds in a food processor, liquidizer, or mortar and pestle if you prefer the less crunchy powder, or if you want to blend the seeds into a smoothie.
You can make your own quick seasonings by mixing sugar, salt, or black pepper into your sesame seeds.

, The only other ingredient you need is vegetable oil. Olive oil is a traditional choice that adds its own rich flavor, but you can use sesame oil or canola oil instead for a stronger sesame taste.Simply put the toasted seeds in a food processor and blend one spoonful of oil at a time, until the consistency is smooth but not runny.Take the next step and turn the tahini into hummus.

, Toasted sesame adds a great flavor to cookies, and can be safely added to gluten-free recipes. In many parts of the world, toasted sesame seeds are cooked with butter and sugar or honey to make sticky candies.

Make sure the seeds are spread out evenly to prevent any from burning.;
, Drizzle the oil or melted butter over the seeds. Stir the seeds with a fork, making sure that all the seeds are coated in the oil. The oil adds flavor to the seeds and helps the seeds brown.

, If you feel the need to cover the seeds to prevent oil splatters, only cover the seeds loosely with a paper towel.

, After the first minute passes, stir the seeds with a fork. Gently shake the dish to spread out the seeds and return them to a single even layer. Continue cooking the seeds for another minute.

, After each minute, stir and check the seeds once more. The sunflower seeds are done once they appear lightly browned. This could take anywhere from 2 to 4 minutes total.

Use your thumb and forefinger.,
Enjoy.",How to Shell Pine Nuts," If you have simply purchased shelled pine nuts, then you can skip this step. However, if you're looking to gather your own pine shells, then you should know that it's a lengthy process that can take months. Here's what you have to do:For the gray pine, you should collect the cones in September or October and keep them in an airy, but dry place, such as a garage. The cones should still be tightly closed at this point.
Wait for the cones to slowly open, revealing their nuts.
Then, bang the cones around in a gunnysack until all of the nuts fall out. Alternately, you pick them out by hand, if you don't mind getting resinous pitch stuck to them.
Toss out the winged part of the shell that connects the shell to the cone.
Remove any nuts with holes in them; this means bugs have gotten to them.;
, It's important to know which type of pine nut species you're dealing with. Pine nuts can have soft or hard shells, and hard-shelled nuts shouldn't be cracked with your teeth, or you could hurt yourself. Here are the main types of pine nut you need to know:The New Mexico pinon pine nut. This is a buttery nut that is wild and hand harvested. These are the most valuable pine nut in the world and they have a hard shell that is too hard to crack with your fingers or teeth.

The Italian Stone pine. This nut is popular in Europe and throughout the Mediterranean. It is a longer, rounder nut.

The Chilgoza pine nut. These nuts are typically found in Afghanistan or Pakistan and they are long and boat-shaped with a sharp end. They are typically shelled by roasting over an open fire; they are more rare.

The gray pine nut. Typically found in Northern California, these nuts have a bit of a softer shell.

The Nevada pine nut. These are sweeter, fruitier, larger, and easier to shell.

, Unshelled nuts have a long shelf life if they are kept refrigerated, so make sure you place them in the fridge if you don't plan on shelling them right away. However, once unshelled, your nuts may only last a few weeks, or even just a few days, without the refrigerator, so you should refrigerate them as soon as you can if you don't plan on eating them right away.


Many people like to put pine nuts in the freezer to give them an extra crunchy taste and to make them last longer, while others maintain that this takes away some of their rich, nutty flavor.

, If you don't care about maintaining the integrity of the nut and are working with a tougher nut to crack, then you may just want to place the nuts on a solid surface and hit them with a hammer. Aim to do it a bit more softly so you crack the shells without pulverizing the nuts. Now, this is likely to make a big mess or put a dent in your floor, so try placing them on a piece of cardboard or in a thick plastic bag outside, so you don't have any property damage as you try to break those stubborn nuts out of their shells.This method is not for the faint of heart and does require some power.
Once you're done, you can remove the nuts from the bag and peel off the extra shell.

, That's right. If you place the pine nut in the notched section of the can opener, right where the handles meet up, you can use the can opener as a kind of improvised nutcracker.This may do some damage to your can opener and it may take quite a while, as you'll be shelling the nuts one nut at a time, but it will give you the results you're looking for.


Once you've cracked all of the shells of the nuts using a can opener, you can peel the remaining shells away with your hands.

, If you want to invest in a pine nut shelling machine, this can make your job much easier. Though you'll have to pony up some money up front, it can save you money in the end if you plan on regularly shelling pine nuts. Pine nuts are much cheaper shelled than unshelled, so this may save you money in the end. Here's all you have to do to use one:


Place pine nuts of a similar size into the machine so that it is adjusted for their side. When you've finished with nuts of that size, put in nuts of a different size.
Wait for the nuts to come out of the machine without their shells.
Brush off any extra shells and enjoy.

, For softer pine nuts, you can simply place these nuts in a big plastic bag, push all the air out of it, place it on a flat surface, and then use a wooden roller to roll back and forth over the nuts. Continue doing this until you hear and see the shells of the nuts cracking, revealing the meat of the nut. This can take a little while, and you can roll the roller over smaller batches of nuts for best results.


Once you've cracked all of the shells, simply remove the nuts from the plastic bags and peel off the remaining shells with your fingers.

, Though using your mouth to crack pine nuts isn't the most recommended method, it will work in a pinch if you're using soft-shelled seeds such as the gray pine nut. Simply do what you would do to crack a sunflower seed's shell: place the nut in the back of your mouth and bite down on it a bit gently, until you hear the shell cracking. Then, remove the nut from your mouth and peel away the rest of the shell.


Be careful not to bite down too hard if you want to keep your teeth healthy.
This method is one of the best for preserving the original shape of the pine nut, if that's important to you.

, If you have a soft nut on your hands, then you may be able to crack it with the force of your hands alone. Simply place the nut between your thumb and forefinger and apply pressure to it until you hear and see a crack. Then, use your hands to peel the nut the rest of the way. This will be a repetitive motion and may take a while, but it can be better to use your hands than your teeth.This will also take a while because you'll be shelling each nut individually.

, Once you've shelled your nuts, you can enjoy them raw or use them in a variety of recipes. They are tasty, fairly rare, and add a buttery, rich flavor to any meal. Here are some things you can do with them:


Enjoy them raw, as a snack.
Use them to make pesto to use in pasta or fish or poultry-based dishes.
Lightly toast them in the oven and enjoy their crisp taste.
Add them to any salads, from goat cheese and beet salads to salads with brie and orange slices.

"
"
Freeze away possible pests.,
Package the nuts in an airtight container.,
Store for two to four months.",How to Store Nuts1," If you are storing nuts harvested from your own yard or purchased at a local market, you may need to freeze the nuts for two days prior to storing them to kill off any pests or eggs.


Insect eggs and larvae thrive at room temperature. Your eye may not see any pests on the surface of the nuts you collect, but that does not mean that there are no pests to be found. As such, fresh nuts need to be sterilized via freezing.
If you are storing commercially purchased nuts, you should not need to freeze them. The manufacturer should have killed off the nuts before selling them.
Place the nuts in an airtight container and sit that container inside the freezer. Allow the nuts to remain there for 48 hours at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) or lower.;
, Place the nuts in a glass or plastic container. The container should be clean and dry, with a lid that snaps or screws on with an odor-tight seal.


Plastic and glass containers are better than plastic bags. Plastic bags are permeable, so even though the bags have a good seal, odors can still seep into the space and taint the flavor of the nuts., Place the jar of nuts in a dark, cool location, like a pantry. You should be able to keep the nuts fresh for two to four months when you store them this way.


Chestnuts should never be stored at room temperature. They lose moisture quickly and can actually develop mold. If you do store chestnuts at room temperature, make sure that you use them within two weeks, since mold usually develops when kept past this amount of time.
Light can cause the nuts to go rancid at a quicker pace, so you should never store them on a shelf, kitchen counter, or other exposed area.

You can soak as many nuts at a time as you like. Use a tablespoon (19 g) of salt per 4 cups of nuts that you soak.You can also soak seeds, beans, grains, and legumes using this same method.;
, Different nuts benefit from various soaking times, and if you're not sure, soak the nuts for 12 to 24 hours. Place the nuts in a cool, dark place for the soaking period. The soaking times for different nuts are:12 hours for almonds and Brazil nuts
8 hours for hazelnuts, pecans, walnuts, and pine nuts
6 hours for cashews
4 hours for macadamia nuts

, When the nuts have soaked for their recommended times, drain the water by pouring the nuts into a strainer. Run fresh, cold water over the nuts to rinse them.


When the nuts have been rinsed, lay them on a clean towel to remove excess water.

, Once your nuts are soaked, you can eat them as is without drying them first. But dehydrating the nuts removes the water and makes them crunchier, and many people prefer the texture of crunchy nuts. If you don’t have a dehydrator, place the nuts on a baking sheet and roast them in the oven on the lowest temperature.


Spread the nuts out on the dehydrator trays in a single layer, and arrange the trays in the dehydrator.Turn on the dehydrator to 150 F (66 C).
Dehydrate the nuts for 12 hours and check them for doneness. For crunchier nuts, dehydrate them for an additional three to 12 hours.

, Transfer leftover dehydrated nuts to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for two weeks. For a longer shelf-life, store the nuts in the freezer for up to two months.


If you opted to not dehydrate your nuts, store them in the refrigerator and eat them within 24 hours of draining., Nut butters are tasty and nutritious spreads that are great on toast, fruit, ice cream, pancakes, and other foods. Nut butters can also be used for sauces, soups, and other savory dishes.


Some of the most popular nut butters are peanut, almond, and cashew butter. You can also make blended nut butters that combine different types of nuts.

, Nut milks like almond milk and cashew milk are great non-dairy alternatives to cow’s milk, and you can make your own at home with soaked nuts. Once you’ve made your milk, you can:


Drink it plain
Use it in cereal
Add it to coffees, teas, and smoothies
Use it to make cream soups
Use it in baked goods

, These delicious treats combine soaked and dehydrated almonds with chocolate, making them a tasty dessert for any occasion, a lovely gift, or a yummy topping for ice cream, cakes, and other desserts.

, Pralines are a tasty and decadent treat that combine nuts and sugar to make a crunchy, sugar-coated nut. You can eat pralines plain, put them on ice cream, bake them into cakes, or they even make a great addition to salads and soups.

, Sprouting is the process of soaking grains, seeds, beans, and legumes, and then leaving them in a small amount of water until they sprout. The first step in sprouting is soaking, because this helps to kick start the germination process.Place your lentils or other grains, seeds, or beans into a mason jar.
Fill the jar with lukewarm water.
Cover the mouth of the jar with cheesecloth and secure it in place with an elastic.
Let the lentils soak in the water for about 12 hours.

, After 12 hours of soaking, remove the cheesecloth from the jar. Place an inverted strainer into the opening of the jar and drain out the water, leaving the lentils in the jar. Fill the jar with clean water and screw on the lid.


Give the lentils a shake to rinse them, and then drain out the water by placing the strainer over the mouth of the jar again., Secure the cheesecloth back onto the mouth of the mason jar. Turn the jar on its side and give the lentils a shake to spread them out. Place the jar in a warm, sunny location and let them germinate for two to four days.Sprouts are generally ready to eat as soon as the sprout tail is about the same length as the original grain, bean, seed, or legume.

, After eight to 12 hours of germinating, rinse and drain the lentils using the same process as before. Then, cover the jar with the cheesecloth again, turn the jar on its side, and return the lentils to their sunny location.


Repeat the rinsing and draining process two to three times daily until the sprouts are ready.

, You can eat your sprouts plain, add them to salads, put them on sandwiches, or enjoy them any other way you like. Leftover sprouts should be stored in an airtight container or sealable plastic bag and kept in the refrigerator.


Fresh sprouts will last for about five to seven days in the fridge."

Pick vegetables that are overripe.,
Scoop the inside out.,
Add water to the bucket and let the flesh sit.,
Change the water after the seeds separate.,
Dry the clean seeds.",How to Store Heirloom Seeds1," Plants with under ripe or ripe vegetables will not have gone to seed yet. A vegetable needs to completely finish a developmental cycle before the seeds are fully mature. As a result, you should wait until the vegetables are brown and overripe.;
, Cut the vegetable open with a sharp, clean knife and scoop the pulpy, seed-filled flesh into a bucket.


Note that for tomatoes, you can throw the entire vegetable into a bucket instead of scooping out the inside.

, After several days, it will begin to rot. As the flesh rots, the seeds will separate and rise to the surface of the water. Viable seeds, on the other hand, will sink to the bottom.

, Pour the water through a find mesh sieve, performing the action carefully to prevent the loss of seeds. Rinse the seeds by pouring new water into the bucket or by running them under water in a fine sieve.

, Spread the rinsed seeds out on newspaper or clean paper towels. Let them sit in a room temperature location for several days until completely dry. Move them around periodically to prevent the seeds from germinating, however.

Store freshly purchased or picked, unpeeled chestnuts at room temperature for up to one week only.,
Store unpeeled chestnuts in the refrigerator.,
Be aware that once you have peeled the chestnuts and roasted them, they will not keep more than a few days in the fridge.",How to Store Chestnuts," Keep them in a well-ventilated and dry place.;
, To keep your chestnuts in top shape for a little longer, place them into a plastic bag and stick a few holes into the bag for airflow. Kept this way, the chestnuts should be fine in the fridge for two to three weeks. Place them in the vegetable storage bin of the fridge.

, If you have chestnuts like this, wrap them in aluminium foil or other freezer-proof wrapping that is air-tight and place them in the freezer. They can be frozen for several months.

"
"
Pack the nuts in glass or plastic containers.,
Chill the nuts for two months to one year.",How to Store Nuts2," Place the nuts in a non-permeable container. Make sure that the container itself is clean and dry, and that the lid of the container snaps or screws on with an airtight seal.


Note that insect eggs and larvae are not an issue when you plan on refrigerating freshly harvested nuts. Even if there are eggs on the nuts you harvested, prolonged storage in cool temperatures should prevent those eggs from hatching.
Glass and plastic jars are better than plastic bags. Nuts have a tendency to absorb odors, so the container must have a good seal and should be made from non-permeable material. Otherwise, the flavor of the nuts could become tainted during storage.

, Place the container of nuts in a refrigerator set to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) or below. When stored in this manner, most nuts will last for one year. Some varieties may go rancid quicker than that, however.


Almonds, pecans, pistachios, and walnuts should remain fresh for one year. This is true regardless of whether you keep them in their shells or remove the shells prior to storage.
When kept in their shells, chestnuts will only stay fresh for two to three months in a refrigerator. When the shell is removed, chestnuts can remain fresh for one year. Chestnuts are high in starch and lose moisture quickly, so they go rancid faster than most other nuts do.
Heat and light can make the nuts go rancid faster, so storing them in a dark, cold place lengthens the amount of time the nuts stay fresh.

"
"
Tightly pack the nuts in airtight containers.,
Freeze for one to three years.",How to Store Nuts3," Place the nuts in a non-permeable glass or plastic container. Make sure that the seal is odor-tight when you place the lid on. The container itself must also be both clean and free of moisture.


Since you will be freezing the nuts as you store them, you do not need to do any preliminary freezing to kill off any insect eggs or larvae.
Plastic bags are an acceptable storage medium, but hard plastic or glass containers are better choices. Bags are permeable, so odors can still find their way inside, thereby tainting the taste and quality of the nuts.

, Place your container in a freezer set to 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) or below. Using this storage method, most nuts will stay fresh for one to two years. Some varieties may last longer.


Almonds and chestnuts will usually stay fresh in the freezer for at least one year. Pecans and walnuts can be stored for two years, and pistachios usually last for as many as three years. These time periods apply to nuts stored in their shells as well as nuts that have been shelled before storage.
Both heat and light can make nuts go rancid at a much faster pace. Storing nuts in the freezer reduces exposure to both factors, making this the best possible method for long term storage."

Allow the plants to come to seed.,
Allow seedpods to dry on the plant.,
Harvest the seedpods or seed heads.,
All the pods to dry.,
Shell the pods.",How to Store Heirloom Seeds2," Do not deadhead or remove flowers, and do not harvest vegetables upon ripening. Instead, let the flowers die off naturally and let the vegetables become overripe. Approximately six weeks after you would normally harvest your vegetables, seedpods should have developed and matured.

, For vegetables, the pods will usually turn yellow or brown during this time. Corn seedpods shrivel and develop a hardened exterior. For flowers, the blooms will lose their petals and the stems will turn brown.

, Pluck them off the plant using your fingers or gently snip them off using clean scissors or shears.

, Lay them out on newspaper and place them in a dry, warm location. Allow the pods to dry for one to two weeks.

, After the pods have become dry, carefully peels the crumpled shell protecting the interior seeds. For flowers, you will need to crumble the flower heads to obtain the seeds.

Save plenty of seeds.As a general rule, you should save seeds for as many plants as possible to produce an adequate harvest the following year.,
Dry seeds further using silica gel.If you plan on storing your heirloom seeds for more than one season, you should consider drying them out even more than usual.,
Transfer the dried seeds to an airtight container.,
Sprinkle the inside of the containers with diatomaceous earth.,
Mark the date on the container.,
Freeze the seeds.While this may seem counter-intuitive, rather than hurting the seeds, freezing them actually keeps them cool and minimizes the amount of humidity.,
Store seeds of different varieties separately.,
Thaw the seeds out before use.",How to Store Heirloom Seeds3," Self-pollinating plants, like beans and tomatoes, do not need an excessively large number of seeds, and the same goes for plants that are both self-pollinating and cross-pollinating. Plants that rely on cross-pollinating, though, need large amounts of seed.

, Place the seeds in a glass jar filled with an equal weight of dry silica gel for one week.

, A freezer-safe storage jar or plastic sandwich bag should work. Keep each seed type in its own separate container. Do not mix the seeds since mixing increases your odds of cross-pollination between varieties.

, This organic product is an effective way to kill off any insect or pest eggs that may be hiding in the midst of your seeds. Add just a little DE to the container and mix the seeds around to spread it.

, Write the current date out on the container using permanent marker. By marking the date on the jar, you will be able to keep track of how long the seeds have been in storage.


Note that you should also mark the cultivar name and type of plant on the container, especially if you grow multiple plant varieties.

, Humidity is your worst enemy if trying to save heirloom seeds. As such, freezer storage is ideal. This is especially true if you store the seeds in a freezer that is rarely opened.

, You do not want different varieties to get mixed up. If this occurs, you will end up growing different varieties of the same plant too close together, leading to cross-breeding and ruining your chances of collecting heirloom seeds later on.

, Before using them, all the seeds to thaw out to room temperature. Then plant as normal.

Alternatively, if you are in a rush, you can place the sunflower seeds and salted water into a pot and leave to simmer for an hour and a half to two hours.
If you don't want your sunflower seeds salted, you can skip this step altogether.

, Pour off the salted water and pat the seeds dry with some paper towel.

, Spread the sunflower seeds on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, in a single layer. Try not to have any of the seeds overlapping.

, Roast the seeds for 30 to 40 minutes, until the shells are golden brown. The shells will also develop a slight crack down the middle as they roast. Stir the seeds occasionally, to ensure that they roast evenly on both sides.

Measure out 1.5 tablespoons (22.18 mL) of hot water and put that in a small bowl. You’ll also need 2 tablespoons (29.57 mL) of olive oil and 1.5 teaspoons (7.39 mL) of sea salt plus more to taste.Also preheat your oven to 375℉ (190.55℃).

, Don’t worry if it doesn’t dissolve completely. Pour the hot, salted water over the nuts in the large bowl. Stir until all of the nuts are coated with the salt water., You can also line it with silicone or spray it with oil. Spread the nuts over the baking sheet in a single layer. Bake the nuts for about eight minutes. Pull out the baking sheet, stir the nuts, rearrange them in a single layer, and bake them for another six or seven minutes. They should be brown on the inside.

Cut one open to check for browning on the inside.
Watch them carefully so they don’t burn.

, Pour the olive oil over them. Stir to coat them in the oil. Shake additional salt over them as you mix them with the oil. Remember they will already be a bit salty from the salt water., To speed up the cooling process, spread them out on the baking pan.

, Reduce the heat to a very low boil, and cover the stockpot. Boil the peanuts until they are soft. The longer you boil them, the saltier and softer they will become. Try boiling them for as few as 2 hours for firmer, less salty nuts or up to 12 hours for a very soft and salty nut., Drain the nuts, but do not rinse them. Store the boiled peanuts in an airtight container. Eat or serve all the peanuts within 2 or 3 days after preparing them. They will dry out and become inedible after that."

Vary the number of selections based on the number of guests.,
Pick from multiple appetizer families.,
Complement the main course.,
Consider the aesthetics.,
Include at least one convenience item.,
Prepare enough for your guests.,
Cook in advance.For any appetizers that need to be cooked or assembled, do as much of the actual preparation as early as possible.,
Create appealing displays.,
Know when to serve the appetizers.,
Serve some of the appetizers on trays.Cold appetizers that sit out the entire time can be placed on a table somewhere, but for hot appetizers served fresh, serve them on a large tray or platter.,
Clear room around the simple appetizers.Some appetizers, especially the cold ones, can be kept out on display for people to pick at.,
Set drinks out as well.",How to Serve Appetizers," For a small dinner party, you should choose at least three different appetizers to serve. This amount will grow as your guest list grows.


Stick with three appetizers when inviting 10 guests or less.If you're inviting 10 to 20 guests, offer five different choices. When your guest list ranges between 20 and 40 guests, offer seven selections. If your guest list exceeds 40 guests, provide nine different choices.
You do not need to provide more than nine different appetizers, no matter how large your guest list grows.;
, Appetizers can be grouped into various families. By choosing selections from more than one family, you'll provide enough variety to wake up your guests' tastebuds and prepare them for the main course.


Choosing selections from only one family, on the other hand, can cause guests to become too bored or ambivalent toward a certain taste by the time the appetizers are finished.
In general, appetizers can be classified under five families: garden, starch, protein, snacks, and dips/spreads.

Garden appetizers include vegetables, fruits, potatoes, and olives.
Starch appetizers include finger sandwiches, dumplings, pizza, phyllo pastry, bruschetta, breadsticks, crackers, and buns.
Protein appetizers include meatballs, sliced meats, skewered meats, chicken wings, sushi, and egg dishes.
Snack appetizers include nuts, chips, pretzels, cheese cubes, and popcorn.
Dips and spread include guacamole, relishes, preserves, compound butters, and any other spread served with crackers, fruits, or vegetables.



, Before selecting your appetizers, you should plan out your main course. Once you've determined that, you should choose appetizers that prepare the palette without overwhelming it.


Complements are essentially opposites. If your main course will be filled with rich foods, make sure that most of your appetizers are fairly light and fresh. Conversely, if you're serving a lighter dish as your main course, opt for rich appetizer choices.
Do not repeat flavors too often. You can work around a theme, but using the same exact flavors in each course of your meal can quickly dull your guests' palettes. For instance, if your main dish is heavy on cheese, you should avoid appetizer platters that include cheese.

, Great appetizers will please both the eye and the stomach. Choose appetizers with contrasting colors and shapes to catch your guests' eyes.


For instance, pale cheeses match well with bold, brightly colored fruits. Finger sandwiches with blunt edges pair nicely with rounded meatballs, eggs, or sushi rolls.
Similarly, the temperature and texture of your selections should also vary. Include both hot and cold appetizers. Mix and match crunchy foods with soft or creamy selections.

, Convenience items are simple appetizers that require no preparation beyond plating them. These choices are both cost-effective and easy to serve.


Your appetizers should include more than just convenience items if you want to really impress your guests, but the occasional convenience item is a welcome option. As a standard guide, consider making one-in-three appetizer choices a simple option.
Simple options include cold vegetables, crackers, cheese cubes, nuts, and chips. These foods can help fill up your guests without breaking your piggy bank. Moreover, unused portions are usually easy to save for later.

, No matter how many guests you have and how many appetizer choices you prepare, you should plan out the total amount around the maximum number of guests you anticipate having. The standard rule is to serve four to six pieces for each person.Note, however, that if you are planning an evening event that does not provide a main course and only has an appetizer, you should prepare 10 to 15 pieces per person.
The amount of time can also change this figure. For instance, if you plan on letting the appetizer course last for two hours or more, plan on guests eating around 10 pieces for every two hours.
Divide the total number of pieces by the number of choices to determine how much to prepare of each appetizer. For instance, if you have 30 guests, you will need about 150 pieces per guest and roughly seven different selections. That means you'll need to prepare approximately two dozen (or more precisely, 21 to 22) pieces of each appetizer.

, A day in advance is ideal.


Appetizers that need to be served warm should be prepared early and rewarmed as guests start arriving.
Do your cooking in an oven to make sure that the appetizers are crisp. Avoid cooking anything in the microwave, even when there are instructions on how to do so.
The only appetizers you should avoid baking too far in advance are those that will become soggy after being refrigerated, like soufflés or meats coated in a crispy batter. Do as much preparation as you can earlier in the day, then bake the appetizer, planning just enough time for the baking to finish immediately before your first guest should arrive. Continue keeping these appetizers warm in the oven as the rest of your guests roll in.

, The appetizer selection should be visually appealing, but the way you arrange the appetizers also needs to catch the eye. Consider arranging the foods in a unique way or decorating the serving platter the foods will sit on.


Use toothpicks and small plastic skewers to hold small complementary pieces of food together. You can even use thin pretzel sticks to accomplish the same purpose as long as you pair them with options that match well, like cheese and sliced meat.
For appetizers that need to be contained inside small dishes, like pasta salads and fruit salads, choose a non-conventional dish to serve them in.Options include martini glasses, hollowed out orange peel shells, tea cups, and sterilized candle holders.Remember to decorate the platters, as well. Non-edible decorations can include doilies and decorative placemats. Edible decorations include green leaf lettuce, parsley, and edible flowers.

, Cold appetizers should be set out before the party actually starts. Hot appetizers should be brought out once most, if not all, of the guests have arrived.


Serve the hot appetizers yourself, even if you have others to help you. Doing so will give you a chance to interact with your guests.
Crispy appetizers and those with melted cheese should be served fresh from the oven. Other warm options, like cooked vegetable dishes, can usually be served at room temperature without affecting the quality.

,


Serving foods on a tray makes it easier for you to take the appetizers around to each guest at your party, giving you the chance to mingle while fulfilling your duties as a hostess.
Trays also make it easier to refill appetizers in the kitchen once your guests go through a batch of them.
If you do not have a serving tray, you could improvise by using something like a decorating baking sheet or cutting board.

, Among these selections, your guests are more likely to crowd around the simple choices, so you should keep a little extra space around them to prevent the area from getting too crowded.


Simple choices that do not require any assembly by the guests and are easy to grab are often more popular. In contrast, people eat less when they have to put an appetizer together themselves, for instance, build-your-own finger sandwiches.

, Your guests will need something to drink as they munch on appetizers. Set up a separate beverage table where they can get what they need.


Bowls of punch are a common option, but they may not be the most practical. Guests who are already juggling plates of appetizers may struggle to pour themselves a drink.
A better option would be to set out pre-measured beverages. Depending on the nature of your party, light cocktails could be appropriate, or you might still prefer a non-alcoholic punch.
If you're concerned about making sure that your guests have enough to drink, set out enough prepared drinks for every guest to grab at least one. Place a punch bowl or pitcher behind the prepared drinks for anyone who wants a refill.

Make tea-party themed cupcakes.",How to Plan Snacks for a Kids Tea Party," Obviously, caffeine and kids don't mix. Therefore, it's best to stick to fruity, herbal teas. In addition, these teas are more suited to a kid's palate. Try a cinnamon-apple tea, for instance, or a mint tea. You could also use teas like jasmine or hibiscus.You could brew up a tea punch by boiling fruit in water, such as apples and pears. Throw in some spices, like cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and/or ginger. Near the end, add in a flavorful tea, such as hibiscus, plus sugar to taste. Let it steep until the tea is brewed, and then strain it.;
, If the kids won't likely be tea fans, hot chocolate is always an option instead. You could also add it as a non-tea choice, if you're offering several choices. Serve it with whipped cream or miniature marshmallows., Another non-tea option is lemonade. To make it extra special, serve a pink lemonade, such as strawberry or raspberry lemonade. Serve it in pretty glasses to make it elegant and fun for the kids., Cucumber sandwiches are a classic tea sandwich. Simply spread cream cheese or butter on thinly sliced bread (crusts removed). Add thin layers of cucumber. You can also add fresh dill or mint, but you may want to leave that off for kids' sandwiches. Put the sandwiches together, and then cut them into fingers, triangles, or squares., If cucumbers would make your kids cry ""Eww!!,"" you could go with something simpler, such as classic ham and cheese. Start with a bit of mustard or mayonnaise on thin bread without crusts, then top with a thin layer of ham and American or cheddar cheese. Put the sandwiches together and then cut them into shape., For a sweet sandwich, cut off the crusts, and spread peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other. Put the sandwich together, and then cut to shape. You could also do a single layer of a sweet cream cheese, such as cinnamon or strawberry. For more color, add a layer of strawberries.For another sweet option, try apple butter on raisin bread.

, Egg salad is another classic tea sandwich. Make an egg salad by finely dicing or grating boiled eggs, then adding mayo. You can also add other flavorful additions, such as dill, Worcestershire sauce, mustard or dry mustard, paprika, black pepper, lemon juice, and/or salt. Spread a thin layer on crustless bread, then top it with another piece of bread. If you're worried about them getting soggy, you can spread a thin layer of butter on the bread before adding the egg salad. Cut them to shape., Scones are a classic addition to any tea, and if you want your tea party to follow tradition, you should add a batch of your own. To make them kid friendly, consider options like chocolate chip scones or blueberry scones., Chocolate-covered fruit is elegant, tasty, and a bit healthier than some other treats. Trim and wash the fruit, and then let it air dry. Insert a skewer or popsicle stick in each one. Dip it in melted chocolate, than let it cool on parchment paper.You can stick it in the freezer to cool if you're in a hurry.

, Welsh rarebit is just a fancy kind of cheese toast. Make it cute for a party by creating miniature rabbits. Start by making the cheese mixture. For each rabbit, you'll need 1 egg yolk, a dash of cream (about a teaspoon), several drops of Worcestershire sauce, pepper, and 1/3 cup (79 milliliters) of grated cheddar cheese.Mix up the cheese mixture together, and spread it on a toasted English muffin. Broil the rabbits for about 3 minutes, keeping them a bit lower than you normally would when broiling. Add vegetable decorations to make ""rabbits,"" such as a black olive for a nose, chives for whiskers, and snow peas for ears.

, Celery with filling is usually a big hit with kids. Cut celery into 2- to 3-inch pieces. For a savory snack, add fillings like pimento cheese, spray cheese, or a savory flavored cream cheese. For a sweet snack, fill with peanut butter (or other nut butter), and top with raisins., You don't necessarily need to make ""special"" foods for a tea party. Instead, just use miniatures of your kids' favorites, like miniature corn dogs or hot dogs and macaroni and cheese served in foil cupcake holders. You could even do foods like chicken nuggets. Alternatively, cut bacon into smaller strips, and serve them with a foil cupcake holder of scrambled eggs topped with cheddar cheese.

, One option for dessert is to make it part of the fun. Make sugar cookies in fun tea-party shapes (such as teapots, tea cups, and flowers), and then set out things to decorate with, such as colorful icing, sprinkles, and colorful candies. Have enough decorations to go around so there's no squabbling., Tiny bites are perfect for tea time, but that doesn't mean giving up on favorites. You can just make them in smaller versions. For instance, if your kids love brownies, make a regular pan but cut them into bite-sized pieces. You could also make miniature chocolate chip cookies. Another option is rice crispy treats with colorful sprinkles cut into fun shapes., In lieu of a cake, make a batch of adorable tea-themed cupcakes. For instance, you could make cupcakes with tiny teapots on the top of each one. Another option is making ""flowerpot"" cupcakes.To make flowerpot cupcakes, start with a chocolate cupcake with chocolate icing. Add sprinkles. Attach a candy flower to the top of a pretzel stick with icing, and poke the stick in the cupcake. You can cut leaf shapes out of jelly candies.

If you can’t find the baby mozzarella, you can use a block of regular mozzarella. Just cut it into bite-size pieces.

, Take a toothpick or wooden skewer, and slide one piece of the mozzarella on it. Next, add a leaf of fresh basil and a ripe cherry tomato.You can create as many layers of each ingredient as you’d like. However, using one of each usually makes the appetizer easier to eat.

, After you’ve arranged the mozzarella, basil leaf, and cherry tomato on the skewer, add one final piece of mozzarella to top the skewer. Set the finished skewer on a plate, and repeat the process with all remaining cheese, tomato, and basil."

, As soon as you take the muffin tins out of the oven, run a sharp knife around each quiche. Turn the tray over to remove the quiches, and place them on a wire rack to cool.Let the quiche cool for at least 5 minutes. You can serve them warm, but you don’t want them so hot that they’ll burn you.

, When the quiches are cool enough to handle, set them out on a platter. You can serve them warm or at room temperature.You can make the quiches the day before. Store them in the refrigerator, and reheat them in the microwave briefly before you plan to serve them.

You want the pieces to be small enough to fit inside the peppers so aim for 1-inch cubes.If you prefer, you can substitute mozzarella for the auricchio provolone.

, After you’ve cut the cheese into pieces, cut 5 slices of thin prosciutto in half. Next, place several cubes of the cheese in the center of each piece of prosciutto and wrap the ham around the cheese in a bundle., Use a knife to cut the stems off 10 spicy cherry peppers and scrape out the seeds to create a well. Place one of the prosciutto and provolone bundles in each pepper to fill it.If you aren’t a fan of spicy foods, you can substitute cherry tomatoes for the peppers.

, Place the stuffed peppers in a bowl, and pour ½ cup (118 ml) of extra virgin olive oil over them. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the peppers. Allow them to marinate in the oil overnight., An hour or two before you plan to serve the peppers, remove the bowl from the refrigerator and set them out to come to room temperature.

Ask guests to contribute to a group gift.",How to Throw a Going Away Party," Unless you’re throwing the party for yourself, you’ll need to ask the guest of honor who they’d like to invite, since you may not know all of their friends. Ask for email addresses if you’ll just be sending out evites, or mailing addresses if you’ll be creating physical invitations.


If the party is going to be a surprise, you’ll need to contact a couple different friends or family members of the guest of honor to try to get an idea of all the people who should be invited.;
, You'll need to get an idea of how many people to expect before you can decide on a space, since 50 people might not fit into someone's studio apartment. Since the guest of honor’s belongings will be in boxes, avoid trying to schedule it at their home.If no one volunteers to host, research local parks if the weather will be nice, and look for areas that have picnic tables and public restrooms.
Call local restaurants to see if they have a party room available.
If the party will be at work or school, mention which room it will be in on the invitation.

, Make sure to select a time that will work for most of the guests. If you’re throwing the party for a coworker, schedule it during everyone’s lunch break. If it’s a school day party, throw it during lunch, recess, or immediately following the last class of the day. Otherwise, pick a time the weekend before your guest of honor is leaving.Avoid picking the day before the person is supposed to leave. They may have a lot of packing left to do, and a party could just add to the last-minute stress.

, If you’re just throwing a casual daytime party where people can drop in and grab a drink or some finger foods, you only need to send out invitations 1-2 weeks ahead of time. If you’re doing a more formal event, perhaps at night or where a meal will be served, send out invitations 3-4 weeks in advance.You can mail the invitations if the party is a few weeks away, but if it’s within two weeks, you risk not giving people enough notice. It’s safer to just design an online invitation on a site like Evite and email it to the guests., Before you purchase any decorations, pick the theme for the party. The most popular choice for going-away party themes is the person’s destination. Are they moving to England? Hang a British flag on the wall, place teacups around the room, and write ‘’Cheerio!’’ on a chalkboard. If they’re moving to California, opt for a surfing theme and decorate with seashells.Other possible themes include ‘’Bon Voyage’’ (decorate with airplanes and maps) or “Adios Amigo” (decorate with sombreros and a piñata).

, People will be interested to see the person’s new home up close, so hang a map of the new country or city on the wall. Tape a construction paper star to the exact spot where the person will be living. Keep a marker nearby and encourage people to write well-wishes and goodbyes on the map., Pick a chair where the guest of honor can sit and be the center of attention. Drape streamers over the back or tie balloons to it. Wrap it with battery powered Christmas lights or feather boas. Get crazy with it and then use it as a spot where everyone can take pictures together., Ask guests ahead of time to send you their favorite photos of the guest of honor. Or see what photos you can find on social media of them enjoying special occasions or nights out with friends. Hang these photos throughout the party space.Tape the photos to a long piece of ribbon and then hang it as a banner.
Put some of the photos in frames, place them around the room, and then give them to the guest of honor to take with them when they leave.

, If your budget is a concern, visit a dollar store and buy packs of balloons, streamers, banners, and other party accessories to make the room more festive. Even if you don’t want to do a themed party, you can at least use this opportunity to choose a color scheme.Some possible color schemes are black and gold, blue and yellow, or flag colors of the guest of honor’s destination.

, If the party is for adults, research cocktail recipes that would go with the theme of the party. For example, if you’re using a beach theme for the party, mix a large amount of sangria in a drink dispenser and write “Surf’s Up Sangria” on a small chalkboard or sign beside it.

For a kid’s party, you could pour strawberry lemonade into a drink dispenser and call it “Laguna Lemonade.” This is a cheaper option than offering a wide selection of beverages., If your theme is the destination of the guest of honor, research the traditional foods of that location. For example, if your friend is moving to Canada, put out a platter of poutine and some little plates for people to pile up with fries and gravy.If they’re moving to Japan, order or make different types of sushi.
For a Germany-themed party, grill some bratwursts and let people snack on large soft pretzels.

, Chips are always a popular party snack, but some people may also want a healthy option, like veggies and dip. Pick a few different types of food, like pretzels, mixed fruit, and small bite-sized cookies to keep everyone happy. Just make sure you’ve included some of the guest of honor’s favorite foods.Just like with the beverage, try to play into the theme. Serve macarons for a Paris-themed party, or chips and salsa for an “Adios Amigo” party.

, Unless you know the guest of honor doesn’t like sweets, send them off with a cake or cupcakes. If you’re not comfortable making it yourself, visit a local bakery or grocery store with a bakery section, and ask if they can write a custom message on top for you.

Either choose a message that goes with the theme, or stick with something simple like, “We’ll miss you, Kate!”

, Find a large mason jar and set it on a table with some small pieces of paper and some pens. Put up a sign telling people to write down their favorite memory of the guest of honor and put it in the jar. These can be read aloud later at the party, or kept private as a special gift to read later., Provide a suitcase, some clothing, and a few personal items, and have each guest try to pack it as quickly as possible. Use a stopwatch to time each person, and the one who packs it the fastest wins a prize., Research facts about the guest of honor’s destination and divide into teams to play a trivia game. Ask the questions aloud and have each team write down their answers. Whichever team has the most questions right at the end is the winner., Guests can give individual gifts if they’d like to, but it may be more fun and meaningful for everyone to pitch in on one big gift. Research the area around where the person will be living, and if possible, buy gift cards to restaurants or boutique stores nearby so that your friend can explore the area when they arrive.If it’s not possible to buy the gift card online, often you can call and purchase one over the phone, then have the owner hold it for the recipient until they come in.
Look into purchasing a deal from a site like Groupon, which offers fun excursions in lots of different cities.
For a simpler gift, have everyone pitch in for a gift card from a home furnishing store so that the guest of honor can buy decorations for their new space.

Know the signs of exhaustion.",How to Throw a Glow Party," If there's one thing that comes to mind when someone hears the words ""glow party"", it's usually this! Black lights give a fluorescent glow to brightly-colored objects and clothing, turning your party's dance floor into a whirlwind of color. While black lights aren't required for a great glow party (you can always just use standard glow-in-the-dark decorations and accessories), they can take an ordinary glow party to the next level, so consider buying or borrowing some.


Note that there are specialty sites online which offer both black lights and decorations designed to glow under their light for sale (like, for instance, this site). The cheapest black light options will cost you less than $10.;
, Another glow party staple is the glow stick. This accessory which can come as a plastic ""tube"" or as a flexible, wearable band, contains a mild chemical reaction which, when activated, provides hours of glow time. Try wearing normal glow sticks around your neck as pendants or wearing skinny, flexible glow sticks around your wrists as bracelets.


Glow sticks are quite cheap — a pack of 25 12 hour glow sticks can cost you as low as £10., To give your party a DIY feel, try making your own decorations from brightly-colored paper and pens. Construction paper that's specifically labeled as fluorescent will usually glow under a black light, while most standard ""neon""-style highlighters and markers will glow as well.


Both fluorescent paper and markers are cheap, costing only a few dollars per pack. To make sure that your decorations glow under a black light, you may want to bring a black light with you to the store to test them.

, Another great addition to your glow party are ordinary glowing light decorations. These usually come in the form of standard bulbs or LEDs. Today, LEDs are fairly cheap and can often be programmed to flash different colors or cycle smoothly through a range of color, making them a great choice for your party if you're buying new. However, this is also a great chance to use old Christmas or holiday decorations that have sat unused in your garage for months, so don't feel the need to buy fancy new LEDs if you have other glowing decorations handy.


The price of a string of Christmas-style lights usually varies based on its length. For instance, 100-light strings may cost $10 or less, while 300-light or longer strands can cost upwards of $20.

, If you're able to find them for a good price, brightly-colored plastic sunglasses, bracelets, rings, or other accessories make great party favors at a glow party. Cheapness is key here, however — you don't want to break the bank on supplies that may be dropped, lost, stepped on in the dark, so if you're going for this option, be sure to look for cheap plastic varieties.


As an example of what you might want to get, a pack of a dozen plastic 80s-style neon sunglasses (which look like Ray-Bans but have bright plastic sides) can sell for as low as $6 or $7 dollars.

, If you're looking to get really wild, you may want to consider painting yourself with glow paint or even offering it to your guests. Glow-in-the-dark body paint is often available from specialty stores like costume shops, Halloween supply stores, and online. It can be trickier to get your hands on than your average glow party gear, but, used correctly, it gives unbelievable results.


Though it's sometimes hard to find, glow-in-the-dark body paint isn't usually terribly expensive — a decent-sized multicolor set is usually $20 or less.

, Parties and music are like bread and butter — they go great together. If you're looking to recreate the look and feel of a ""rave"" at your glow party, you may want to go with classic house/techno or modern EDM (electronic dance music). However, it's possible to throw a great glow party with almost any sort of playlist, so as long as you've got great music (and a way to play it a reasonably high volume), you're set!


Try to have a playlist of music picked out before your party begins. It can be fun to get together with your friends and pick out songs for your party, and when you're done, you'll be able to simply set your playlist on shuffle during your party and forget about it.

, Any party needs something to eat and drink — guests who are dancing, talking, and having a good time will eventually work up an appetite and a thirst, so having a selection of food and drink available is always a good idea. For glow parties, you may want to stick to finger food, as it can be tricky to mess with a plate and silverware in the dark.


""Party platters"" loaded with snacks like cheese, cured meats, and crackers can usually be found pre-packaged at grocery stores. These can be quite convenient and usually cost $20 or less (depending on their size). However, your guests will also appreciate it if you prepare food for them, so it's up to you.
For your drinks, you'll want to use cheap plastic cups, rather than glasses or other ""nice"" cups. Cheap plastic cups don't have to be washed after the party and you don't have to worry about any of your rowdy guests breaking them, making them the obvious choice.

, After you decide to have a glow party, you'll want to invite your guests fairly soon — the earlier you invite people, the more likely they'll be not to have a schedule conflict, so getting a jump on your invitations is a great idea. If you're having an intimate get-together, you may want to send individual invitations to your guests in the mail, but if you're throwing a big party, making an event on social media and inviting your friends that way is usually the quickest, easiest option.


It can be a smart idea to ask your guests to RSVP ahead of time. Doing this allows you to get an approximate head count, which will let you know how much food and drink and how many party favors to get.

, Depending on how extensive your decoration plans for your glow party are, you may want to start setting up anywhere from a week beforehand up to a few hours before your party. Regardless of how big your party is, it can be a smart idea to get a friend or two to help you set up. Having other people handy shortens your total set-up time and gives you the advantage of having multiple perspectives when it comes to making decorating decisions. For example, your friend may think of a really ingenious way to set up your LED lights, like stringing them overhead as a mock ""ceiling"".

, For a glow party, it's important to make sure that a minimum of light is able to make it into the main party area where you have most of your glowing decorations set up. In other words, the party area with most of the glowing decorations should be as close to pitch-black as possible. If this area is in the basement or attic, you may have very little work to do. However, if there are windows, you'll want to cover them to prevent any outside light from getting in.


Black plastic garbage bags make a great low-cost solution for covering your windows.

, Next, set up your glowing decorations. The exact way that you set up your decorations is up to you, but, generally, you'll want to set up your black lights in the ""blacked out"" party area so that people in this area will light up with a fluorescent glow. You may also want to decorate the outside of your building with lights to welcome your guests inside and put up glowing decorations in other parts of your house as well.

, For parties with a few friends, you usually don't have to worry about getting in serious trouble — even if you're too loud for your neighbors, most people will feel comfortable coming over and asking you to keep things down if your party is small and well-behaved. On the other hand, if you're throwing an enormous block party and you haven't gotten permission from your neighbors, there's a reasonable possibility that the police may show up. To avoid this, be sure to talk to all of your neighbors beforehand. Let them know the date and time of the party, give them your number so they can contact you if things get too loud, and let them voice any concerns they have.


In addition, if you're throwing a big party, you may want to get a noise permit to legally protect yourself. The rules surrounding noise permits vary from locality to locality. For instance, in some locations, noise permits are required for parties with more than a certain number of people., Try to have your food and drinks ready by the time your first guests arrive (no later than the stated time that the party will start, which is generally when the earliest guests may show up). Having your food and drink ready to serve ahead of time means that you'll have something to offer when the very first guests show up (which can be an awkward time, since it's just you and them). It also means that you won't have to rush to finish any last-minute food or drink preparations once guests begin to arrive in earnest, which frees you up to welcome people, start conversations, and be a great host!

, Once your guests start to arrive, they'll usually start to talk to each other naturally and you won't have to supervise them to make sure that everyone has a good time. However, if things seem awkward or the party is getting a little ""slow"", it can be a great idea to start some glow party games to help get things rolling. For instance, basic kid's games like tag, hide-and-seek, and charades can take strange new terms in glowing, blacked-out garages. You may also want to try a few racy ice breakers like truth or dare, spin the bottle, or ""Never Have I Ever"" — it's all up to you.

, Once enough guests have arrived that most of the guests are talking to each other without your help, you'll probably want to start your music. The volume you'll want to play it at will vary depending on the sort of party you're throwing. For instance, if your glow party is more of a casual get-together than a serious dance party, you may want to keep it somewhat subdued so that it can serve as background music. On the other hand, if you're trying to get people out on the dance floor, crank it!


Unless you've got a designated DJ, you'll probably want to keep your playlist on shuffle. Having the music stop after every song while you try to pick a new one can make things awkward for your dancers.

, If your party is packed with guests (and especially if there's dancing), you'll want to make sure that your guests know how and where to get some fresh air. The cramped, sweaty confines of a crowded house party are the last place someone wants to be after an hour of dancing, so make sure your guests have access to a porch, patio, or other outside area to gather and cool off as needed.

, For big, active parties with lots of dancing, hydration is a must. Make sure that your guests have easy access to clean, clear water in addition to whatever other refreshments you're offering and encourage them to drink after they've been dancing for a while. Dehydration can cause people to overheat and faint, which, at a crowded party, can seriously endanger them (not to mention put a damper on the festivities).


Access to water is especially important for party-goers who have taken ecstasy (MDMA/""Molly"") or another party drug. In addition to the inherent legal and physical dangers of using these types of drugs (which are well-documented), they can also easily lead to deadly cases of dehydration and exhaustion, so it's important to offer lots of water and rest opportunities if this is occurring at your party. Even publications written by drug aficionados will recommend this., As noted above, injury or death resulting from exhaustion is no laughing matter. If you're throwing a party with lots of dancing (and especially the possibility of drug use), it's very important to be able to identify the signs of serious exhaustion so that you can keep your guests safe, happy, and healthy. If you think one of your guests is suffering from exhaustion, move them to a cool area, give them water (not alcohol) to drink, and, if they don't get better, call an ambulance. It's better to be safe than to risk the possibility of your guest dying. Knowing the following symptoms of exhaustion may help you save a life:Confusion
Dizziness/vertigo
Weakness
Fainting
Headache
Cramps
Pale skin
Nausea

, You are going to want to send out your invitations about a week or two before the day of the party. If it is a last minute party, get them out as quick as you can! You can make homemade invitations, or you can buy some from a party store.

, Since Katy Perry lives in a Candyland, make a candy buffet. Katy Perry has grown up a little bit for her latest album Prism, so if you would like to go for that side of her, then buy some animal print things, and gold things (mostly representing Roar, and Dark Horse). Also remember you can hang pictures of Katy, and anything else you can think of for more decorations!

, If you are going to go with the candy buffet, then that's probably all you need for food, but Katy also symbolizes cupcakes, so you can also have cupcakes (you can also buy Katy Perry cupcake toppers on Google). If you are not doing the candy buffet, you can get a cake and some pizza.

, This is always an important part of parties; you don't want your guests bored, do you? No! Some fun game ideas are:


Pin the lollipop to the Katy: Just like pin the tail on the donkey. Get a big picture of Katy, put it on your wall. Print out a lollipop picture, put tape on the back of it and try to tape the lollipop to Katy's hand (get a picture of Katy where a hand is visible).
Katy's truth or dare: It's just truth or dare, but make it kitty-lisious by putting her name in front!
Katy charades: Play charades, but with a twist. Have you and your guest act out a Katy Perry song. Put Katy Perry songs on little papers and put them in a bowl, have some one pick and then everyone else has to try to guess the song. Make sure they are common Katy Perry songs, so everyone knows the song. You can also watch the Katy Perry movie! How fun!

, Go to a party store and ask if they have red carpet props. If they don't, ask if they know where to get one.


If you cannot find a pre-made red carpet anywhere, make one out of fabric. Simply purchase red fabric and have the fabric store cut it to the length you need. Alternatively, visit a local thrift store and have a rummage. You might be lucky and find red fabric, a red sheet or even a red rug that you can transform. Even a few old white sheets can work; just dye them red and lay them down to serve as the red carpet.

, Stretch out the carpet as long as possible so that your guests can do many poses as they walk down. If possible, have the red carpet leading up to the room where the award show will be in.


Arrange it so that you come down the carpet last.
If you can, have someone videotaping or taking pictures.

, This is where people will accept awards, sit around to eat the party food and where you can play party games. Hang gold balloons up, throw around fancy streamers and make the room appear as glamorous as possible. Use chic tablecloths and elegant centerpieces for tables in the room.

, Aim for chic and cute food, and plenty of it. Everyone may be dressed as movie stars but they don't want to starve like one! Have plenty of candies if you're planning a sleepover as well and some tasty breakfast food too.


The cake can take on a Hollywood theme. Choose one that represents Hollywood for you, such as a mini Hollywood sign on a cake or an edible print cake topping featuring a favorite actor.

, No big Hollywood event would be complete without interviews! Have someone bring a video camera and have at least one camera operator, one interviewer, and one celebrity.


Take turns! Create an entire red carpet show pre-awards show! Start out with something like: ""Here comes Miss (last name) coming down the red carpet! Miss (last name), may I have an interview?"" or: ""Oh my gosh! Here comes (first and last name)! I hope I can interview her! Miss (last name), may I have an interview?""

,
Did you have fun making it?
How does it feel to be nominated for an award tonight?
What plans do you have right now?
Is it true that you and -insert celebrity here- are now a couple?
And of course the obligatory, ""What are you wearing tonight? Who is the designer?"".

, After the interviews, ask each guest to perform either a dance or song.


When the guests RSVP, have them tell you what song they will dance to or what song they will sing to.
A good place to get your music is AOL Music (http://www.aolmusic.com ) because all the music is completely free and you don't need an account. If you will not be able to access the music in the awards room, then ask them to provide the music unless you have the CD that the music is on.
If you don't have the music and your guest doesn't, then they will have to probably change the song unless you or the guest can somehow get a hold of it before the party.
If someone is going to dance, make sure there is a clear space for them. You might have to go outside if they need a big space.
Try to tape the performances so that everyone can watch them at the VIP party.

, This is a very important part of the party because this is what the guests have been invited to. Think of a name for your show. You can use the original names, such as Grammies, Oscars, Academy Awards, Golden Globes, etc. Or you can make up your own names, anything you want.


Ask your parent and/or siblings for name ideas.
For the award prizes or trophies, buy little statues from a party store or a catalog If you don't want statues, you can make certificates. You could even spray paint old dolls to make them look like Oscar statuettes. Look in thrift stores for unwanted dolls.

, The VIP party is the really fun part of the party. Here you will dance, watch movies, talk, stay up all night, etc. If you taped the main part of the party, you can watch that. Or, watch a movie, or do both. A great party always includes dancing, so dance the night away! If you can, tape you and your guests dancing. That will be very fun to watch in a couple of years,.or in a couple of hours!

, Do makeovers to each other, or you can have older siblings, older neighbors, or your mom do your makeovers. A cool thing to do is to get spray-on hair dye so if people want their hair a different color. Get the kind that comes off in the shower though. After you finish the make-overs, take tons of pictures! You can also video tape too. Make sure it is ok with all the parents first, though, in case their parents aren't comfortable with it.

, The more things you have scheduled, the more tiring and challenging the party gets. Just let the party queen take her course and leave things alone. Do try to capture moments of the VIP party with a camera, though.

Decorate the room.",How to Throw a Hunger Games Party (Girls)," Send it to either 24 girls (2 per district) or 12 girls (1 per district). Make it seem cool, and like it's actually from the Capitol. Look below for the list of items you will need.;
, If you will have 2 per district make sure you pair up girls randomly. Your partner will be paired randomly as well. This way, things will seem more fair and no one will complain about how they didn't get paired with their friend because almost everyone else didn't get paired with their friends, too. You can get pins and put each person's district on it, and if you do, make sure they wear it from arrival to the end of the games. This way people won't be confused and ask each other something like, ""Wait, are you from District 4 again?""

, You will need 4 different rooms:


Dining Hall: fancy dining room your guests will be at right at arrival, dinner, and breakfast.
Training Center: where your guests will prepare for the games.
Arena: where your guests will play the Hunger Games.
Sleeping room: where your guests will be sleeping.
You may want to add additional rooms. The next sections will show you how to set up your rooms.

, The Dining Hall is a long table for all the tributes to eat at and a very important room at the party. Use a dining room as the Dining Hall (if you have one), as it would be best for use.

, Put luxurious things like sofas and plush chairs, again, for that Capitol feel. You can leave an open area (where the guests arrive at) so it's easier to get in. However, if there is another section that leaves to the kitchen, living room, etc, add curtains/close the door.

, It could be a buffet, or you could give them a menu and they can order. This way someone can chow down on something they like instead of nibble on something they think is absolutely gross. Be sure to also have desserts, like cupcakes or ice cream. You could have a glass bowl with peppermints in them, because after a yummy meal, your breath could get a little stinky, and enforce a rule to eat one. Make the decorations very formal and fancy, and to spice it up, serve drinks in a glass (or plastic look-alike) and add lemon to the water.

, This room must be a little bigger than usual. Most people use their garages because of their size and their look. If you are using your garage, be sure to clear out the cars. Get a teacher to train your guests on how to use a Nerf gun, water gun (only use on warm summer nights so the guests won't get cold), tag ball (soft ball that must touch someone in order to get them out, not counting the beholder of the tag ball) and flashlight. You may practice using your water/Nerf gun on targets, and your flashlight or tag ball.

, It is best to do it in your backyard or around your block so anyone can go inside and treat any injuries they get, if they get them. If your backyard is small, ask one of your friends with a large backyard if they could use it.

, Around the Cornucopia, place different backpacks with supplies such as Nerf guns, water guns, tag balls, binoculars, camouflage capes, and bigger flashlights. Be sure to get a bucket filled with water, in case someone needs to refill their water gun.

, The traps will ""kill"" a tribute (unless they somehow escape) and they can be any type of trap you want, just nothing that could actually hurt them. You can also set up treasure, such as putting a box by a tree and placing something valuable in it (something the tributes couldn't get in Cornucopia.)

, Get tons of bottles sealed with a cork, get a piece of tape or something to put on it, and write ""Medicine."" Write it a little sloppily, and slightly dirty the bottle. There will be from 1-5 stickers on the inside. Each sticker will represent an extra life they have, thanks to the medicine. You will need at least 10 bottles, and the max is 30. Have the trainer in the Training Center explain everything about the medicine to people.

, Make some silver paper parachutes with a bit of weight on the end. Have a box with each district number on it. Have each of your guests take it in turns to throw a sponsor parachute at and whichever box it lands in or around, gets the sponsor. Each tribute can have 3 to 4 turns. The district with the most sponsors wins a prize.,


Be sure to include a bathroom in the sleeping room, so people can use the bathroom if they need to, wash their hands, and take showers without having to run upstairs to use the restroom.

, Even if you provide juice and soda, be sure to have water too.


Make Cornucopia snacks. Take some wafer ice cream cones and fill them with small fruit pieces and candies. Lay out on a large plate.
Make Night lock pie. Make one pie for each tribute. Fill all but one with strawberry or raspberry or apple filling, fill the one with blueberry filling (pretending it's night lock). Whomever gets the night lock pie has to pretend to die.

, You can decorate it however you want.

Provide cold drinks on a side table, or the main table if no side table is available.,
Decorate the table (optional).,
Make seating available elsewhere (optional).",How to Set a Table for a Tea Party," Most people hosting a ""tea party"" think of an afternoon event that takes place between mealtimes and provides small snacks, such as small sandwiches or scones. These can be ""buffet style"" and require no place settings at all, or they may be sit-down affairs with a limited selection of tableware and utensils, as a full meal is not served. If you are hosting a formal evening event, you will likely need several more implements depending on what type of food is served. Either way, be sure to read the steps below carefully so you can determine what is necessary for your tea party.


The evening meal is properly referred to as ""high tea,"" although the term is frequently misused to mean any type of tea.;
, For a sit-down tea party, the table or tables must be able to seat every guest at once. For most tea parties, the food should all fit in the center of the table. If you are serving a full meal in the evening, generally referred to as a ""high tea"" rather than an afternoon tea party, you only need enough room for one course at a time.

, Unless you are serving a full meal with more than one course, the guests are typically provided with one plate only. Ideally, this should be a luncheon plate 9 to 9.5 inches (23–24 cm) across, but you may use plates of other sizes if necessary., Fold each napkin into a rectangle, square, or triangle, then place to the left of the plate with the open edge on the right side.However, if you need to save space at your table, you may place each napkin on the center of a plate.

, You may only need to provide one or two utensils per guest, depending on what food is served. At minimum, place a small spoon on the right of each plate for stirring tea. If you are serving sticky cakes or messy foods, also provide a small fork on the left of each plate, and one or more knives between the plate and the spoon, with the blades facing the plate.Provide steak knives if meat is served.
Provide butter knives for each guest when serving jams or other spreads, located to the right of the steak knife if present. Note that each spread should still have its own serving spoon.
If serving a full evening meal with multiple courses, provide appropriate utensils for each course, arranged so the guests begin with the utensils furthest from the plate, and end with those nearest.

, Each guest should have a teacup resting on a saucer. Place each teacup to the right of the spoon(s) at that place setting.

, Waste bowls are typically the smallest piece of tableware, placed on the left of each place setting, above the napkin or fork.Guests place used tea leaves or lemon wedges in the waste bowl.


Because the waste bowl is one of the most specialized components of the tea service, only the most formal guests are likely to be surprised if you do not own any.

, Provide water glasses for each guest above the knives, or above the teacup if no knives are present. If serving additional refreshments such as lemonade or champagne, select appropriate additional glasses to position to the right of the water glass.

, Include a small dessert plate or dessert bowl if a special dessert is being served, such as birthday cake. Center this above the main plate and include a small dessert fork and/or spoon as appropriate, placed horizontally between the two plates.This is not required for small, sweet snacks provided for the guests to help themselves.

, The table should be large enough to fit the tea service, tableware, and food. If it is not large enough to also seat the guests, remove the chairs and host a buffet-style tea party where the guests help themselves. This is less formal than a seated tea party, and is most suitable for a light afternoon tea rather than an evening meal.


Use your judgement when placing a buffet-style table: if space is a concern, move it against a wall. If you have plenty of room, consider placing it so the table is accessible from both sides, allowing more guests to access the food at one time.

, Using a clean, attractive tablecloth increases the sense of elegance and attention to detail. White linen is traditional, but you may use a tablecloth of any color or pattern.For a formal tea party, select napkins that match the tablecloth.

, Brew tea in several varieties for your guests, including at minimum one caffeinated black tea and one non-caffeinated herbal tea. Each variety of tea should be in its own teapot, preferably with the tea leaves removed or within a strainer so guests do not end up with tea leaves in their cups. You do not need to use a matching tea service or silver tray if you do not own them, but don't forget to provide all the essential tea additions:


A creamer, or small pitcher, containing milk
A bowl of sugar containing sugar cubes and sugar tongs, or granulated white sugar and a small spoon
A pitcher of hot water for people who prefer to dilute their teaA tray of lemon slices for floating in tea, or thicker lemon wedges covered in gauze or other material to prevent spurting when squeezed, Unless you have a small number of guests, you may wish to set up two stations for guests to serve themselves hot beverages. Coffee or hot cocoa is appreciated by some guests who do not enjoy tea, but if you know your guests are all tea-drinkers, you may simply provide a variety of tea options instead.


Provide all the necessary tea additions on both ends of the table. If serving coffee, only sugar and cream are necessary at the coffee station.

, If you are hosting a sit-down tea party, see the section on formal place settings. For a buffet style party, stack these neatly at both ends of the table, or at one end if space is limited. You will need at minimum one small plate, one teacup, and one small stirring spoon for each guest. It's a good idea to include extras in case of accidents, mislaid plates, or unexpected guests.


If you do not own enough tea cups, consider borrowing them from neighbors or hosting a casual ""bring your own teacup or coffee cup"" party. Many inveterate tea or coffee drinkers have favorite cups at home, but be prepared to provide a few extras for guests who do not bring one., If serving food that cannot be eaten by hand, include forks and knives next to the other cutlery. Soup requires small bowls and soup spoons, whereas pudding and other soft desserts require smaller dessert spoons. Small dishes of jam, clotted cream, or other additions to toast or scones should each have their own small serving spoon.


If you are not certain which foods to serve, see the suggestions below. Typically, an afternoon tea party does not serve food that requires cutlery. This makes it easier for guests to serve themselves at the table, and to walk around and talk while holding a plate of food.

, Small sandwiches with the crusts cut off are the most common savory food at afternoon tea parties, but deviled eggs are also common in some areas such as the American South.Provide at least one tray or large plate with a tidy assortment of these or similar small, savory foods. On another area of the table, place trays or plates of sweet foods, such as English-style biscuits (cookies), small cakes, and/or scones.


If using three-tiered cake stands instead of trays, the traditional arrangement is to place scones on the top tier, tea sandwiches and savory snacks on the middle tier, and sweet food on the bottom tier., If you have a side table, set it up far enough from the main table that guests can reach one without blocking access to the other. This is a good place to provide cold drinks such as lemonade or iced tea. Alcohol is not typically served during small afternoon teas, but larger or more celebratory occasions may call for champagne, white wine, sherry, or port.


Another tray of snacks may be provided on this side table if desired.

, Decorations are typically bright and cheery to match the afternoon setting, but you may provide any decorations you wish. Flowers are a common decoration, but try to avoid strong-scented bouquets that could bother guests or set off allergies. Instead, strew a few rose petals around or place a small vase of unscented or lightly scented flowers.


Make sure not to block access to the food or overcrowd the table with large or unwieldy decorations. Decorating after you've placed the food and drinks on the table allows you to adjust to the remaining space on the table.

, Most afternoon teas serve only ""finger food"" such as scones, sandwiches, and biscuits. Because these are easy to eat while standing or seated away from a table, setting a formal dining table is not required. If you have enough room to seat every guest, you may provide chairs or couches in a living room or garden.


One option for large tea parties is to set up smaller coffee tables with a few chairs at each one. Cover each table with a matching tablecloth if possible.

, Advise your guests to bring plastic containers to take their cookies home to share. It is also a good idea to ask your guest to bring duplicates of their recipes in case other guest are interested.

, Be sure to store them in an air-tight container until the day of your party. Avoid the temptation to devour your cookies before the cookie exchange party.

, Be sure to have a decorative tablecloth. Place pens and place cards on the table. This way, everyone knows what kind of cookies they are and who baked them. Be sure that the cook provides information about whether or not cookies contain peanuts and dairy, for some guest may be allergic.

Consider these quick tips for making your surprise party memorable and fun.",How to Plan a Surprise Birthday Party," The list of things you can do is limited only by your imagination. Don't worry about execution just yet. Ask yourself the following questions and consider the answers when planning the party.



Hobbies. Does the person have any hobbies they're passionate about? Would it be feasible and fun to make the surprise party revolve around this hobby? Planning a football surprise party is a lot easier than planning a skydive surprise party.

Likes/Dislikes. Keep in mind the things that the surprise likes and dislikes. Pack the surprise party with things the surprise likes and your party will be a hit. Load it with things the surprise dislikes and someone else will be responsible for heading the planning committee next year.

Personality. Is the person intensely shy, making a surprise party of more than a dozen people simply a bad idea? Or is the person more outgoing, letting you think about inviting even people that the surprise doesn't yet know.

Timing. Is there a good balance you can find between picking a time when the surprise will be totally baffled and letting everyone, including the person being feted, enjoy themselves? Picking a Tuesday afternoon would certainly surprise them, but it might not offer everyone enough time to relax and enjoy themselves.;
, As mentioned earlier, there are tons of different kinds of surprise parties. Here are some ideas for surprise parties that might get your creative juices flowing.


Throw a surprise party at home. Find someone who will occupy the surprise somewhere else for the time it takes to set up; text to stay in communication with your conspirator, making sure your surprisee doesn't come home sooner than expected.
Throw a surprise party in the great outdoors. The woods or the beach would be a great location for a surprise. You could have a Survivor-themed party in the woods, or a luau-themed party at the beach. Outdoor games are especially fun at these events.
Throw a holi(birth)day surprise. If the surprise's birthday happens to fall in between the holidays, they'll often be forced combine a birthday celebration with a holiday celebration — with half the presents. Throw a birthday party for the surprise during the holidays, and the surprisee will thank God that someone finally recognized their perilous bad luck.
Throw a double-surprise party. Surprise the person once, all while another group of their friends are off in another room. After the shock of the first surprise has died off, surprise them again with the second group of people!

, A chaperone is really vital to the surprise. If you don't have a minder along with the surprisee, the surprisee could come and ambush the party before it's adequately set up.


Typically, a best friend or spouse acts as a chaperone. This is because the surprisee feels comfortable with them, and won't feel any social anxiety, causing him or her leave unexpectedly.
If you're planning the surprise party at home, have the chaperone take the surprisee shopping, to a movie, or on a hike. Plant a firm time commitment in their minds. Give the organizers at least two hours to set up. If the surprisee only expects to be out of the house for a short time, they'll catch on when the chaperone keeps deflecting and delaying.
Have the chaperone do something fun with the surprisee. A boring outing will make the surprisee want to go home sooner. Plus, wouldn't the surprise be even more memorable if the surprisee and chaperone had a blast on their own before they went to a legendary surprise party?

, Right after the chaperone leads the surprisee away from the house, start decorating your party. Ask a few good friends who will attend the party to come and help set up the decoration before the rest of the guests arrive.


Pick decorations that have his or her favorite colors, or decorations that share a theme with the party's activity or the surprise's hobby. Even if the decorations are tacky, the surprisee will appreciate the effort.
Think about whether it's possible and/or appropriate to have balloons, streamers, tassels, candles, centerpieces, or a bar at your surprise party. Keep in mind whether it's going to involve primarily kids, primarily adults, or a mix of both.
Decorate the main areas first. If you have time, put a little attention into beautifying the bathroom/s, the kitchen, and the den. Each new decorated room will be a surprise of its own.

, No party is complete without at least snacks. If you expect the party to last for more than three hours, or if the party overlaps with lunch or dinner, plan to offer more filling food to the guests.


Pick out a birthday cake or pie. If you want to bake a cake or pie yourself, try doing it at a friend's house. Plan on having cake that the surprise will want to eat, both during the celebration and as leftovers.
Choose snack foods that don't take too long to make. Pigs in a blanket; various dips (guacamole, sour-cream, salsa, hummus) along with breads, chips and vegetables; small wraps or sandwiches; or skewers all make good snacks.
If you're planning on going all-out, cook one main dish to go along with some snacks. You can roast a turkey or a ham; make meatloaf (very 50s); bake pizzas; or cook paella or fish tacos. Obviously, the surprisee's favorite dish is always a good bet.
Find out if anyone is allergic to anything, so you can plan your menu accordingly. You don't want people getting anaphylaxis when they eat the paella. Not a good recipe for a party.
Plan out low-fat, vegetarian options for guests, if possible. It's a little extra work, but you want everyone to enjoy eating at your party, especially if there are drinks: People who skimp on food will feel the effects of alcohol more, and could cause a stir.

, Depending on who the surprise party is for, you'll want to serve a variety of drinks so that everyone can get something they enjoy.


Consider setting up a bar or hiring a bartender if your party is mostly adults. It's a little more expensive, but hiring a bartender relieves you of the duty to serve drinks all night.
Think about setting up a punchbowl for alcohol — rum punch, caipirinha, or Prosecco punch, to name a few. Round out the alcoholic offerings with beer and red and white wine.
If the party is mainly for kids, think about setting up non-sugary drinks in addition to the cola, root-beer, and lemonade. After so much sweet stuff, water is a really welcome sign. Water and non-alcoholic drinks should be plentiful for adult-only parties as well.

, Obviously, if the surprisee hates jazz, it's not a good idea to have even Miles Davis trumpeting in the background. Try to find music that is interesting without being obtrusive.

, Invite the very close friends of the surprisee. For an intimate surprise party, it's best not to invite any acquaintances or coworkers unless you think the surprisee would very much want to see them.


Keep the guest-list small. It's easier to manage set-up and set-down, and you lower the risk of someone accidentally blabbing.
Ask your guests to bring either a present for the surprisee or something that will help you set up the party (food or drink). Don't ask the guests to bring both. If you're throwing the party, take responsibility for it and practice good etiquette.

, This checklist will help make sure the party stays a surprise for the person being feted. It's not the worst thing in the world if the surprisee knows, but you want to try to keep everything under wraps.


Make sure that guests' cars are parked far enough away. The surprisee could catch on if a bunch of cars are parked outside their otherwise lonely house.
Make sure everyone knows it's a surprise party. Stress it a couple times. People should fully understand that it's a surprise party so that they don't casually leak information to the surprise.
Make sure that lights are turned out if it's nighttime and no one is supposed to be home.
Have all the food/drinks/decorations already set up. You want to be able to surprise the person and then immediately jump into the party. Have one person be responsible for music, one person responsible for uncorking champagne, etc.

, You'll need a pretty good excuse to either get the surprisee out of the house or lure them over to where the party is going to be. Here are some suggestions.


Have an old friend ask the surprisee over for drinks. The old friend shouldn't stir any suspicion for the surprisee. Plan the party at the friend's place or use the friend as a distraction while you set up at home.
Accidentally “forget” something important at your house (while you're out with the surprisee) and go back to fetch it.
Ask the surprisee to do a favor or errand you know they'll do. If the surprisee is expecting to something not-fun, and is eventually surprised with something fun, the party will feel a whole lot nicer.
Ask the surprisee to help plan a surprise party for someone else. This is a bait and switch. Actually, the surprisee doesn't know that the surprise party is for them. Put them in a different room from everyone else, and then just surprise them.

, Finally, consider some other things about the party that you might have missed when planning.


Make sure the surprisee doesn’t have any plans of his/her own. You don't want them going off to another party when they're supposed to be at their own.
It’s better if the surprise party is a few days before/after the birthday. Otherwise the surprisee might guess what's going on.
Only enlist people who want to help out. If you're twisting peoples' arms to help out, they're not going to their job with much enthusiasm.
Don't worry if the surprise turns out to be not so much of a surprise. It's truly the effort that counts. Your friend/family member/spouse will love you for simply putting the surprise together.

Have backwards karaoke.",How to Throw a Backwards Birthday Party," You can do this with blank cards from your local department store. Start writing on what would normally be the back. On the inside of the invite, begin the text on the left page. Continue writing on the right page., Of course, you don't want to turn a fun invitation into a chore for you or your reader. However, you could spell key words or abbreviations, such as “birthday” or “R.S.V.P.,” in reverse. Alternatively, you could write the entire invite with backwards sentences and lettering. Add a header telling your reader to hold up the invite to a mirror.You could use ideas like:


You're invited to Susie's YTRAP YADHTRIB!
We need to know how much DOOF and SKNIRD to serve. P.V.S.R. to jsmith@emailaddress.com.
“Mirror, mirror and some light! Help me read this backward invite.” From here, you could start with the R.S.V.P. section, putting the letters, words, and sentences in reverse.

, If backwards writing isn't for you, try working backwards in time. “Thank” your invitees for attending the party. Make sure you include details that wouldn't normally go in a thank-you card. This includes the date, time, place, R.S.V.P. info, etc.You could say:


Thank you for coming to Susie's backwards birthday party on June 1, 2018. We hope you enjoyed spending time at the local skating rink located at 123 Yellow Brick Road from 12:00pm to 3:00pm. We really appreciate everyone who informed us they couldn't make it by emailing jsmith@emailaddress.com. This gave us a better idea of how much food to order.

, Tell them to wear their clothes backwards and talk backwards. (A few words and phrases are okay.) Ask them to write backwards on the card and to-and-from tags on the gifts they buy. You could also ask them to wrap the gifts with the wrong side facing outward., Tell your guests to enter through the back door and exit through the front door. Ask them to walk backwards as they come in and walk out. Have them say, “Goodbye” as they come in and “Hello” as they leave.If you're throwing the party at a public place like a skating rink, you might not be able to reverse the entrance and exit for safety reasons. Work with the owner or manager for improvisation ideas.

, If you have individual banner letters, hang them from right to left. For a single banner, you could use stencils placed backwards or create a backwards banner with design software. If you're using balloons, blow them up and fasten them off with a string. Hang them from the ceiling by taping the string to the ceiling., Set the chairs aside or stash them in a closet for the party. Lay the tablecloth on the floor under the table and arrange the place settings around the perimeter. Have everyone sit on pillows or directly on the floor when the food is served., You can do this with free websites or software like iMovie. Upload the movie and follow the instructions for reversal. Alternatively, you could play a movie backwards in Quicktime by advancing the movie to the end and pressing the “Reverse” button. The only drawback is that the Quicktime option doesn't produce sound.

, Don't make your guests wait for the cake or cupcakes. Make it the main course! To make the meal even more interesting, have everyone eat their cake slices starting with the wider end. If you're serving cupcakes, try having them start at the unfrosted end., Use savory ingredients in a dish that looks sweet. You could make meatloaf (or lentil loaf) “cupcakes.” In this dish, the loaf stands in as the cake. Spread mashed potatoes over the top as a savory “frosting.”, Cut each slice of bread into halves or quarters. Do the same with the deli slices you plan to use. Place the deli slices and lettuce on the outside of the bread. Smear the spread on the opposite side of the main ingredients. Then, place the other slice of bread on top of the spread and continue loading the lettuce and deli slices on the other side. Hold everything together with a large toothpick., This game flips the rules of hot potato. Have the guests pass around an object while a backmasked song plays in the background. When the music stops, the person holding the object wins a prize., Blindfold each player and have them work with a picture of a donkey, as you would in the regular game. You can do this two different ways. The first is to have your guests try to pin a nose on the donkey and give a prize to the one who gets closest. The other option is to give the prize to the person who pins the tail farthest away from the backside of the donkey., This game is a reversal of hide-and-seek. One player hides while the rest try to find them. As each player finds the person hiding, they hide in that same spot. The game ends when all but one person is hiding. That person gets to hide first if you decide to play Round 2., Start by backmasking instrumental versions of the birthday person's favorite songs. Then, transcribe the lyrics backwards by hand or with word processing software. Print enough copies for everyone.

Allow the flavors time to mix.,
Done!",How to Make Tzatziki1," Peel the cucumbers, cut them into three or four parts, and then use an apple corer to remove the seed section in the middle.;
, With the flat side on the cucumber chunk on a large grater, roughly grate the cucumber. The chunks do not need to be too small.

, Place the shredded cucumber in a sieve and drain the liquid into a cup. Press the cucumber in the sieve to encourage more of the moisture out. Set aside both the drippings and the cucumbers.

, Very finely dice garlic or run the garlic through a high quality garlic press. Then, mix the garlic together with a little olive oil and a half tablespoon of salt, preferably with a mortar and pestle but a bowl and fork/small potato masher can work okay.

, Line a sieve with coffee filters and then pour in your yogurt. Drain for about 15 minutes, stir carefully (do not disturb the filters) and allow to drain for another 15 minutes.

, Mix the container of yogurt, the drained cucumbers, and the garlic mixture together in a glass or stainless steel mixing bowl.

, Now, there are different schools of thought here. Different areas of Greece tend to use different spices, and tzatziki is prepared with non-traditional spices elsewhere in the world. You can choose which best suits you, or combine 2: lemon juice, wine vinegar, 1 tbsp fresh oregano, 1 tbsp fresh dill, or 1 tsp mint. Ground black pepper to taste is pretty standard, however.

, Cover with plastic wrap and set in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Twelve hours will produce a better tasting final product. The cucumber juice can be used to get a more sauce-like texture for use on salads or as a dressing on meat, or just a small amount can be added to get a stronger cucumber flavor.

, Enjoy your authentic Greek tzatziki! Traditionally it is served in a bowl with dipping bread, and topped with a light drizzle of olive oil, a few whole kalamata olives, and a sprig of oregano or other fresh herbs.

If you can’t locate Cracker Jack, just pick up a tub of some other caramel corn.You could buy a big box and dump the Cracker Jack in a central bowl for everyone to share, or you could provide smaller, individual bags for your guests.;
, Popcorn is a salty, buttery treat available at most baseball games. You could make popcorn from microwaveable bags or from loose kernels dropped in an air popper or on the stovetop using hot oil. To beautify your popcorn presentation, obtain a few sturdy plastic popcorn containers – the sort with four tall sides and ridges along the top edge.For a healthier alternative, lightly salt and butter your popcorn, or don’t add any at all.

, Babe Ruth was a famous baseball player in the early 20th century. A popular candy bar was named after him. Your baseball-themed party will truly be complete when you “invite” Babe to join you and your friends., Unshelled peanuts are a common snack at the ballpark. Provide a bowl of peanuts for you and your friends to munch on and an extra bowl to dispose of the shells., Bake a regular vanilla or chocolate cupcake of any size. Top them with a thin veneer of icing of your choice, then gently roll the iced top around in white nonpareils. Finally, use a fine-tipped tube of red frosting to add some baseball “stitching” in the form of two inward-bending semi-arcs., Instead of serving beverages in cups, set the table with squirt bottles of the variety used by professional baseball players. If you or your guests are partial to a particular team, you might choose to obtain squirt bottles emblazoned with the logo of that team., Obtain some mini baseball helmets (available at your local novelty store) and turn them upside down. Using the helmet as a small bowl, place a scoop of ice cream in it. Provide several bowls of toppings like nuts, cherries, sprinkles, chocolate nibs, and so on. Encourage partygoers to decorate their sundae as they see fit."

Encourage partygoers to knock over stacked cans.,
Set up a series of hoops as targets.",How to Throw a Baseball Themed Party3," If your baseball-themed party is held at or near a baseball diamond, you might wish to play baseball with your friends.

Bring extra equipment, too, for those who don’t have their own.If no baseball diamond is within reach, you can still play baseball safely using a wiffle ball – a lightweight plastic ball that will not shatter windows should it come in contact with them.

, Instead of regular baseball, add new rules that require everyone to run around the bases backwards or throw pitches underhanded only. These new rules will put a fun twist on a classic game., Movies like The Sandlot, Bad News Bears, or Field of Dreams will set the mood for your baseball-themed party. You might choose to conduct an informal survey of your guests before the party to discover their favorite baseball-themed films, and show one of them., Print out 20-30 images of popular baseball players. Hold an image before the assembled party guests. Award a point to the person who correctly identifies the player first. Put the image down and then show the assembled guests the next image.Instead of printing the images out, you could load them on a flash drive and plug it into a TV equipped with a USB port.
You could add bonus questions for each image. For instance, after a party guest correctly identifies the player in the image, you might ask a bonus question like, “What college team did this player play for?”

, Hang a sheet painted with a bullseye in front of a fence. Encourage partygoers to hit the center of the bullseye, which should be just slightly larger than the diameter of the baseball. Allow players three chances to hit the center.If a player hits the center of the bullseye, they win.
If you wish, you could assign each ring of the baseball a point value, with the zones closer to the center progressively higher point values. This would allow two or more players to compete against each other for the high score.
Ensure nothing breakable is nearby.

, Arrange some empty aluminum cans on a small table in a triangle shape. For instance, you might place three cans on the bottom row, then balance two cans on the first row, then balance a fifth can between the two cans on the second row. Invite partygoers to toss a baseball at the cans arranged on the table. Whoever knocks over the most cans wins., Set a hula hoop about 20 paces away. Encourage partygoers to throw a baseball through it. If they get it through, move the hoop another 10 paces away. Continue in this way to discover which partygoer has the strongest and most accurate throwing arm."

, Once the eggplant is in the blender, add 1 ½ cups (355 ml) of unsweetened almond milk, 2 to 3 tablespoons (16 to 24 g) of nutritional yeast, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of finely minced fresh garlic, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of cumin, 1 teaspoon (3 g) of chili powder, and 2 teaspoons (3 g) of cornstarch to it. Blend the mixture on high until it is smooth and creamy.You can also blend the dip together in a food processor.
If the dip mixture is too thick, you can add in a little more almond milk to thin it out.
Taste the dip mixture after you’re finished blending it. You may want to add more salt or nutritional yeast to deepen the cheesy flavor.

, After you’ve blended the dip together, transfer it to a small saucepan. Heat it over medium to medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and begins to bubble.The longer you heat the dip mixture, the thicker it will become.
If the mixture isn’t as thick as you’d like even after heating it for 5 minutes or more, mix 1 teaspoon (3 g) of cornstarch with a teaspoon (5 ml) of almond milk and 2 to 3 tablespoons (18 to 26 g) of the dip mixture. Whisk well and then add it back to the pot with the dip. It should thicken up.

, After the dip has thickened, remove the pan from the heat. Add ¼ cup (65 g) of chunky medium salsa and mix well to ensure that it’s fully incorporated.You can substitute ¼ of a 10-ounce (283 g) can of diced tomatoes and green chilies for the salsa if you prefer.
If the salsa is watery, drain the excess moisture before mixing it into the dip or you may thin it out.

, After you’ve finished mixing in the salsa, pour the dip into a serving bowl. Serve it with veggies, chips, or crackers.You can garnish the dip with some smoked paprika and hot sauce for flavor and color.
Cover any leftover dip and refrigerate it. It should keep for 3 to 5 days, but it’s best when fresh.

Pick your dippers.,
Serve the dip hot.,
Store any leftovers.",How to Make Slow Cooker Artichoke Dip," Slow cooker artichoke dip is generally considered a pretty simple recipe, but there are a few preparatory steps you need to take before putting everything in the cooker. Get your spinach ready by draining or washing it as necessary, then roughly chopping it.Thaw and drain your frozen spinach, if using frozen. Squeeze it until dry.
Wash your spinach with cold water in a vegetable strainer or salad spinner if using fresh.;
, Cut your artichoke hearts and onions to your desired size, and mince the garlic. The smaller the pieces, the smoother the dip. You can also chill the cream cheese to make it easier to mix.

Chill your cream cheese until firm, then cut into one inch cubes.
Crush your garlic using the blade of your knife, then chop finely.

, You can place the fresh spinach directly into the crock pot, or you have the option to cook it down first. To cook down the spinach, add two tablespoons of oil or butter to a skillet, and then add spinach and cook on a medium heat until leaves are bright green and slightly wilted.Cooking down the spinach enhances its flavor.
To get the most from cooking the spinach, cook the minced garlic with it and sprinkle on some salt and pepper.

, In the bowl of your slow cooker, put in all of your ingredients. Use a wooden spoon or another broad, semi-flat kitchen utensil to gently mix together your ingredients and ensure even distribution around the crock.Do not mix too vigorously. The ingredients should be distributed throughout the slow cooker, but you don’t need a smooth, creamy mixture yet.
Decide if you want to add additional ingredients such as sausage or herbs before you start cooking.

, You can cook your dip on low if you’re looking to focus on other things for a while, or you can cook it on high if you want it ready faster. Cook the dip on low for three and a half to four hours, or for two hours on high.If cooking on high, check the dip every 30 minutes or so and give it a gentle stir to keep it from sticking to your slow cooker. There is no need to check the dip before serving if you are cooking on low.

, Set your slow cooker to warm and allow the dip to stand around ten minutes if you cooked on low or fifteen minutes if you cooked on high. Stir the dip thoroughly so that all the ingredients are well combined before serving.To get an extra creamy dip, you can transfer dip to a bowl and use an immersion blender to mix the dip and break up big chunks.

, Decide what foods you want to serve with your dip. The possibilities are endless, and there really is no right or wrong answer. Popular choices often include fresh cut vegetables, small slices of crusty bread, pita chips, tortilla chips, and assorted crackers.Cut a baguette into ½ in thick slices, brush the bread with a bit of melted butter or olive oil, and toast on a cookie sheet at 400° F (200° C) to make crostini for your dip.
Try cracker flavors such as sea salt and cracked black pepper or asiago to compliment the flavors already present in the dip.
Warm pita in the oven on your lowest setting for ten to fifteen minutes and serve hot and chewy.

, Artichoke dip is best served warm, as this keep the dip from congealing or losing flavor. Set your slow cooker to warm and serve the dip directly from the cooker, or transfer the dip to a microwave-safe ceramic or glass serving dish.If you can’t serve the dip from your slow cooker, make sure to microwave the serving dish every half hour or so for 45 seconds to a minute and stir the dip to keep it warm.

, If you have any leftover dip, store it in an airtight container with the lid fully sealed. Keep the container in the refrigerator, where it will be good for up to three days.

Reheat the leftover dip in the microwave before serving.If you have more dip than you think you can consume in three days, take the extra dip and freeze it in an airtight container. Reheat in the microwave or in your slow cooker on low before serving.

, Open 16-oz (450-g) can of refried beans and spread the beans evenly over the cream cheese layer in your serving dish.


Spread the beans lightly. The key is to create two distinct layers, rather than mixing the beans and cream cheese into a single combined layer.

You may omit any toppings you do not enjoy. Similarly, you can also substitute or add other vegetable toppings as desired. Popular optional additions might include diced bell pepper or diced chile pepper.

Once the meat fat start to liquify and gather in the bottom of the pan, spread out the onions so they sit and cook in the fat. Continue cooking the onions until they look slightly translucent and become more aromatic.
When the meat and onions are ready, drain off any excess fat before continuing.

, Add the salsa, cream cheese, and shredded cheddar cheese to the skillet. Cook, stirring frequently, until the ingredients are evenly combined and the cheddar cheese has melted.For a slightly lower calorie version of this dish, use reduced-fat cream cheese instead of full-fat cream cheese.
The cream cheese does not need to be softened to room temperature prior to adding it, but you should consider cutting the block into three or four chunks before adding it to the pan. Doing so will allow the cream cheese to melt and spread more quickly.

, Place the ground beef or turkey in a large skillet and top it with the chopped onion. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the meat is evenly browned and the onion is soft.


Use a flat spatula or wooden spoon to break apart the meat as it cooks.
Once fat starts pooling in the bottom of the skillet, stir the chopped onion into the liquid fat and continue cooking it until the onion turns slightly translucent.

, Sprinkle the taco seasoning over the contents of the skillet, mixing well to combine. Add the black beans, as well, and continue cooking.


When using canned black beans, drain and rinse the can of beans prior to adding them to the skillet.

, While the meat mixture simmers, combine the cream cheese and salsa in a medium to large mixing bowl. Beat the two together with an electric mixer.


Note that the cream cheese must be softened to room temperature before you begin; otherwise, it might be difficult to beat smoothly. Use reduced-fat cream cheese for a slightly lower calorie version of this dip, if desired.
You'll need to beat the two ingredients together for 1 or 2 minutes at medium-high speed. Ideally, the resulting mixture should be consistent in color and free of lumps.

, Spoon the cream cheese mixture into the baking dish previously set out, smoothing it out into an even layer.

, Spoon the warmed meat mixture directly over the cream cheese layer, spreading it out as evenly as possible.


Use a light touch when spreading the meat mixture. The idea is to leave the cream cheese and meat layers separate, rather than mixing them together.

, Evenly garnish the top of the taco dip with shredded cheddar cheese.

, Place the dish of dip into the preheated oven and cook it until the shredded cheese completely melts.


You should also notice some slight bubbling around the edges of the dish. This indicates that the contents of the dish have heated through.

You can add other vegetable garnishes to the top of the dish, as well. Consider options like shredded lettuce, chopped green onions, chopped chile peppers, and sliced black olives.

, Serve the taco dip while it's still hot, enjoying it alongside prepared tortilla chips or corn chips.


If you have leftovers, let them cool to room temperature before covering the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerating it. Leftovers can stay good for up to 3 or 4 days.

",How to Make Pico De Gallo," The best tomatoes for pico de gallo are plum tomatoes. They have great flavor, a meaty texture, and contain less liquid than other types of tomatoes.Look for plum tomatoes that are bright red and firm to the touch. Do not use overly ripe tomatoes as they contain a lot of liquid and will water down the pico de gallo.
If plum tomatoes aren’t available at your grocery store, dry-farmed tomatoes are another good option.Use a sharp knife to dice the tomatoes into small cubes.;
, Use a sharp knife to cut the onion into very fine pieces.


Most Mexican cooks use white onions in salsas, as white onions have a sharper taste than red or yellow onions. The sharp taste balances out nicely with the tomatoes in the pico de gallo.If you can only find red or green onions, feel free to use them instead.
Place the diced onions in a bowl and add the juice of half the lime to them. The acid in the lime will tame some of the sharpness in the onions.

, Use a sharp knife to finely chop up the garlic clove. Add the garlic to the bowl with the onions.


You can also use a garlic press, if available.
Not all pico de gallo recipes use garlic, so if you don’t like the taste of raw garlic, feel free to leave this ingredient out.

, Remove the leaves from the stems and chop them into fine pieces.


Cilantro is not everyone’s favorite herb. But it is a key element of a good pico de gallo, so be sure to add at least a little cilantro to the dish. If cilantro is not your thing, start with half the amount of cilantro called for and substitute the rest with parsley., It’s important to remove the seeds from the peppers as they can be very hot.


Depending on the spiciness of the pepper, you can add as little as two peppers or as many as four peppers.
Keep in mind Serrano peppers are spicier than Jalapeno peppers.

, Then, add to the bowl with the garlic, onions, and lime juice. Mix all the ingredients together gently with a wooden spoon.

, Taste the pico de gallo and add salt, cilantro, or lime juice, if needed.

, The pico de gallo tastes best if the ingredients sit for a few hours in a cool place.If possible, use the salsa fresca on tacos, tostadas, or as a dip with chips on the day it is made.
The pico de gallo will last up to 5 days refrigerated in a covered container.,"

",How to Make Nacho Dip," Start by gathering everything you’ll need to make the dip. This basic nacho dip recipe calls for 1 package of cream cheese, 1-2 cups of sour cream, 1 jar of salsa, 1 large tomato, onion, and green bell pepper (to suit tastes), and about a cup of freshly shredded cheese. Dice and mix the vegetables together, then set them aside so they’ll be ready to add in later.


To make the recipe big enough to fill up a crowd, simply double the amounts of the primary ingredients.;
, Allow the package of cream cheese to soften and come to room temperature. This will promote spreadability and allow it to mix with the thinner sour cream. Drain any separated liquid from the cream cheese container.


Most culinary guidelines will tell you to leave a package of cream cheese out overnight in order to soften in, but the process can be sped up considerably by first cutting the cream cheese into small cubes., Combine the whole package of cream cheese with 1 cup of sour cream in a large mixing bowl. Mix the two thoroughly using an electric beater or spatula. Continue mixing until the consistency is the same throughout. The cream cheese and sour cream together will provide the creamy base for the dip.Start with one cup of sour cream. If the mixture is still too thick to easily blend, increase the amount of sour cream up to one additional cup. Remember, the dip will thicken once it’s refrigerated.
If you’re mixing the cream cheese and sour cream by hand, use scooping circular motions with the spatula to “fold” the mixture in on itself.

, Take one small packet of taco seasoning and add it to the cream cheese/sour cream mixture. Mix again until the seasoning is blended in.As an alternative to packaged taco seasoning, you might use chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and/or cumin., Open a jar of salsa and begin adding it gradually to the dip base. The salsa should be added to taste and stirred in until the mixture becomes a light pink color. Make sure not to add too much at once, as this can overpower the dairy elements and reduce the creaminess of the dip.Choose a thick salsa instead of thinner types like pico de gallo to avoid making the dip watery.
Just to be on the safe side, use mild salsa. If you want to spice the dip up later, you’ll have more control using fresh peppers and other seasonings.

, Sprinkle roughly a cup’s worth of shredded cheese over the top of the cream cheese/sour cream/salsa mixture. Cover the entire dish so that the cheese is distributed evenly throughout the dip. Add more cheese to taste.


The sharper notes of cheeses with distinct flavors, like cheddar and jack, will stand out nicely in your dip., Take the tomatoes, onions and green bell peppers you diced earlier and add them into the dip. Mix the entire entire concoction together so that each ingredient is spread through the dip—ideally, each bite will contain a little bit of everything.


Looking for other vegetables to build up your nacho dip? Try minced garlic, black beans or mild Anaheim or poblano peppers.

, Place the bowl containing the mixed ingredients in the refrigerator and allow it to sit for thirty minutes to an hour until the dip “sets up.” The cream cheese/sour cream mixture will thicken as it cools, and the flavors of the taco seasoning, cheese and vegetables will have time to come together. At the sixty minute mark, or whenever you’re ready to serve it, take the dip out, transfer it to the intended serving dish and arrange tortilla chips around the dip. You’re ready to eat!Leave the dip in the refrigerator until you’re ready to bring it out for your guests.

, For a heartier, more savory dip, pour a can or two of Hormel chili into the mixture right after you add the salsa. Chili will lend the nacho dip a thick and meaty flavor and make it more filling; you could even serve this variation of the dip as the main course!If canned chili still isn’t substantial enough for you, brown a few ounces of lean ground beef and use it to supplement your heavy-duty dip.

, If you want to kick things up a notch, incorporate fresh or pickled jalapeno slices into the dip, or make a second batch specifically for spice lovers. Jalapenos pair well with the rest of the ingredients used in the dip, and the piquancy of the peppers will be offset nicely by the cool creaminess of the cream cheese.Remove as many seeds as you can when cooking with fresh jalapenos—that’s where most of the spice comes from. You want the flavor, not just the heat.

, If you’re in a crunch for time or just want to make the cooking process as hands-free as possible, use a couple cans of Rotel instead of dealing with washing, prepping and cutting fresh vegetables. Rotel contains tomatoes and mild green chiles, making it perfect for Mexican and Southwest-inspired dishes and dips. You can even mix and match, if you prefer, using Rotel in place of the tomatoes and green bell pepper while adding fresh onion and whatever other veggies you desire.Drain the Rotel can of all excess liquid before adding it to your dip.

, While most cream cheese-based dips are made to be served at cool temperatures, you can also modify the cooking process to make a hot, delicious and extra creamy dip. This will require you to heat the cream cheese/sour cream mixture slowly, while gradually adding the other ingredients. Cut the cream cheese into small cubes before combining it with the other ingredients and bake the dip in a casserole dish at a low heat to prevent the cream cheese from scorching or clumping. When you’re ready to serve, sprinkle a little more shredded cheese over the top for a nice melted finished.Cream cheese is excellent for making rich, creamy sauces and dips, but it has to be heated correctly. Soften the cream cheese to room temperature first, then melt it over low heat gradually. Add a few ounces of milk if the cream cheese looks like it’s curdling or getting thick.Smooth, easily-melted cheeses and cheese products like Velveeta will work well for hot dips.

You can roast the peppers yourself, or you can buy roasted red peppers in a jar. If you use the ones in a jar, use ¾ cup. If you roast them yourself, you need two whole red bell peppers.To roast the peppers, turn the oven to broil. Cut the peppers into long pieces, then put them on a baking sheet with the skin-side up.

Choose completely ripe avocados.,
Peel and pit the avocados.,
Mash the avocado with lime juice and spices.,
Stir in the chopped onion, tomato and pepper.,
Serve with tortilla chips.",How to Make Avocado Dip1," Avocados taste best when they are at their ripe peak. They're too hard to work with when they're underripe, and they lose their good flavor when they're overripe. Make sure you choose avocados that give just a little when you press the skin with your finger.The skin should be deep green in color, with no black spots.
If only underripe avocados are available, set them on the counter to ripen for a few days before making dip.;
, Take a sharp knife and insert it near the tip of the avocado. Press it in until you reach the pit, and slice all around the pit to divide the avocado into two length-wise halves. Separate the halves, remove the pit, and use a spoon to scoop the avocado meat into a bowl. Repeat with the remaining avocados.


If the avocados are ripe, this process should be easy. The skin and pit will fall away from the meat, so you can make quick work of scooping it into the bowl.
For less ripe avocados, you may need to use a knife to cut the avocado meat away from the pit.

, Pour the lime juice over the avocado. Sprinkle on the salt and garlic. Use a fork or a potato masher to mash the avocado with the lime juice and spices until they are blended.


Mash until you achieve the texture you want. Some people like their avocado dip chunky, while others like it smooth.
Add extra spices if desired. Try 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper and 1/2 teaspoon cumin powder for a spicier dip.

, Sprinkle these ingredients into the bowl and use a spoon to combine them with the avocado. Top with chopped cilantro (or leave if out if you don't like the taste).

, Guacamole is typically served with tortilla chips or alongside tacos, burritos and fajitas. Serve with salsa and sour cream if desired. Store extra dip covered in the refrigerator for up to two days.

Insert a sharp knife near the tip of an avocado and push until you hit the pit. Slice around the pit to separate the avocado into halves. Remove the pit and scoop the flesh into a food processing container. Repeat with the remaining avocados.


If you have underripe avocados, it's best to wait until they ripen to make this dip. Underripe avocados will not process into a smooth dip.
If your avocados are overripe, cut away the brown spots and use only bright green avocado meat in your dip.

, Squeeze the lime juice into the food processing container and spoon the yogurt on top. Process the mixture until smooth.You can use low-fat yogurt in place of full-fat yogurt if you desire.
Or try replacing the yogurt with sour cream for a different flavor.
Lemon juice can be used as a substitute for the lime juice.

, Place the onion, pepper, salt and garlic in the food processing container. Process the ingredients until everything is smooth and well incorporated into the dip.


If you prefer an element of crunch in your dip, you can skip the step of processing these ingredients. Instead, spoon the dip into a bowl and stir in the onion, pepper, salt and garlic separately.
For a spicier dip, add 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper and 1/2 teaspoon cumin to the mix.

, Spoon the dip into a serving dish and sprinkle it with cilantro. Serve with pita chips or crackers. Store extra dip covered in the refrigerator for up to two days.

Slice the avocado meat into small chunks.


Try to keep the avocado meat intact when you scoop it out, so you'll be able to slice it into even chunks.
This recipe is easier to make with avocados that are very slightly underripe, since the avocado pieces will hold their shape instead of getting smashed in the dip.

, After peeling and chopping the mango and tomatoes, place them in a bowl with the avocado. Use a spoon to toss the ingredients together to mix them.

, Squeeze the lime juice over the mixture and sprinkle the chopped green onions and salt on top. Use a spoon to toss the mixture so the avocado, mango and tomatoes get fully coated with lime juice and seasonings.Do not over mix the dip, since the avocado will begin to break down and get smashed if you handle it too much.
For a spicier dip, try adding 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper and 1/2 teaspoon cumin.

Optional other ingredients include: Fresh, sweet finely chopped onions, fresh finely chopped skinned and seeded tomatoes, or fresh cilantro leaves - any combination of these or other ingredients according to your taste. Try different combinations, play around.







, This is definitely the best way to do it, as it's mighty fresh. Have the other ingredients chopped and ready. Cut limes/lemons in half.


When all of the other ingredients are ready, peel the avocados and cut in half by using a sharp knife and going around the pit in a straight line. Take out the large center seed. (one way of removing the pit/seed, is to take a very sharp knife and rap the seed sharply with it, burying the knife just enough to be able to grab hold of and twist the seed, lifting it out.)







, Using a fork or a potato masher (the latter being much faster and easier), mash the avocados into a lumpy paste.

, Then season as desired (taste first before adding anything, and taste again after each addition). When it's the flavor you want, add the other fresh ingredients.

Flatten the mound until it is 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wide.,
Continue making similar mounds on your baking sheet.,
Sprinkle the freshly ground black pepper on top of the mounds.,
Bake the crisps in the center rack of the oven for 3 to 5 minutes.,
Allow the crisps to cool on the baking sheet before removing them with a thin, metal spatula.If the crisps are too oily, set them down onto a sheet of paper towel so that they can drain.Once the crisps have cooled to room temperature, you can serve them.

",How to Make Parmesan Crisps1," You can also use a silicone baking sheet instead., Try to use coarsely-grated Parmesan cheese; it will look more like shredded Parmesan. Avoid using the powdery, finely-grated Parmesan cheese. It will melt, but it won't create that pretty, lacey design., Gently press the back of a spoon against the mound, and swirl it around until the cheese flattens and spreads. Be careful not to great an indentation; you want it to be the same thickness all around.Don't worry if you see some gaps in your cheese. The cheese will melt together, and create a pretty, lacy design.

, Each mound needs to be about 2 to 4 inches (5.08 to 10.16 centimeters) apart.You will have enough cheese to make about 8 to 10 such mounds.

, This is completely optional, but many people find that it gives the crisps extra flavor. If black pepper does not suit your fancy, consider using some of these other tasty seasonings:Cayenne
Finely chopped basil, rosemary, or thyme
Garlic powder
Smoked paprika

, The crisps are ready when they turn golden.If the crisps are not crunchy or golden enough for you, back them for 1 to 3 minutes more.,"

Place them on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to slice off the stems, then slice them in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds from the halves using a spoon or your fingers.


If you're sensitive to hot pepper oils, use gloves when handling jalapenos.For extra spicy poppers, leave some of the seeds in the jalapeno halves.;
, Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the 2 tablespoons of flour until the mixture thickens. Add the milk and stir thoroughly. When the milk gets warm, add the grated cheese and salt. Stir the mixture until the cheese has melted, then remove it from heat.


The mixture should be thick and viscous. If it seems too runny, add another tablespoon of flour.
You can add 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper to take the spice level up another notch.

, Spoon about a tablespoon of the cheese mixture into each half. Add more or less depending on how much it takes to fill the jalapeno without it overflowing.

, Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them lightly. Pour the flour into a separate bowl, and pour the bread crumbs into a third bowl. Line a plate with paper towels so you can place the breaded poppers there.

, Take a jalapeno half and carefully dredge it in the flour, being careful not to spill any cheese. Sprinkle some flour on top as well. Next submerge it in the egg mixture. Finally, coat the bottom of the jalapeno with breadcrumbs, then use a spoon to coat the top as well. Place the breaded jalapeno on the paper towel-lined plate. Continue this process until all of the poppers have been breaded.


For an extra thick and crunchy coating, dip the poppers in the egg mixture, the bread crumbs, then back into the egg mixture and the bread crumbs a second time.
You can use Panko or crushed crackers in place of the bread crumbs.

, Pour the oil into a heavy dutch oven or a large pot. Place the pot on a burner and turn the heat to medium high. Heat the oil until it's hot enough to fry. Test it with a wooden spoon; when you see bubbles flowing from the spoon, the oil is ready.

, Use a spider or tongs to lower the poppers into the hot oil. Fry them until they turn golden brown, which should take about 5 minutes. Remove the poppers from the oil and place them on paper towels to drain and cool.

, Place the cooled poppers on a platter and serve them with a side of sour cream, or enjoy them plain.

, If you can try to use coarsely-grated Parmesan cheese and not the finely-grated, powdery kind. The finely-grated, powdery kind of Parmesan cheese will melt, but it won't create that pretty, lacey design.

, Avoid making the mound too thick, or it will be too chewy and not crispy enough once it bakes.You can do this using your fingers or the back of a spoon. Make sure that it is the same thickness throughout.

, You have enough cheese to make more mounds, but it would be a better idea to bake them in small batches. Once you take them out of the oven, you will have to work quickly in order to shape them into baskets. If you make them all at once, half of the crisps will become too hard to work with by the time you get to them., They are ready when they turn bubbly and a light, golden color., They should still be warm and pliable, but not so hot that you can't handle them., Use your fingers to gently press the crisps over the top and sides of the mold. Don't worry if the edges become ruffles; that is part of the design! You can use anything that is small and cylindrical as a mold, such as:Upturned shot glasses
Upturned egg cartons
Upturned mini muffin tins
Wine corks

, While your current batch is cooling, you can work on baking your next batch.

, You can fill them with just about anything that pairs well with Parmesan cheese, including mini meatballs, goat cheese, cherry tomatoes, and so forth! Step up the presentation with a small garnish, such as a basil leaf or parsley leaf.

Go to another counter, open the can of refried beans and get a tablespoon.,
Know that if you're adding ground beef, this is where you do it.,
Take your shredded or crumbled cheese.,
Finish the ground beef if you've got any left on top of the second refried beans layer.,
Take a tortilla, scoop a generous amount of bean dip onto it.",How to Make Bean Dip," This recipe is including the optional items. If you're not including ground beef, then skip to step 3. If you are including it, then continue reading.;
, Cook the ground beef in a pan on the stove set on medium-high heat, breaking it into little pieces with your spatula, until all brown. Add taco seasoning; pour a small amount of water over the meat to help spread the seasoning. Turn the heat down to very low to keep the meat warm.

, This is the fun part. Spoon half of the can of refried beans into the 9x13 casserole dish and spread it around, making a fairly even layer. Add more where necessary, but make sure to save roughly half a can of beans.

, Spread a layer of ground beef over the refried beans, possibly saving enough beef to make a second layer later. It depends on your tastes and how much beef you have.

, Apply liberally. Seriously, don't skimp on the cheese - you'll use most of a full bag for just this layer of cheese, and there's a second one later. On top of the cheese, spread a layer of salsa using a spoon. Be generous with it. Add to next layer the rest of the refried beans. It's a little difficult putting a layer of dense refried beans over a layer of not-as-dense salsa, but it's not impossible, and it's okay if they mix. And they will mix. It all goes to the same place anyway.

, Add some more cheese and the black olives. These can be put on together - the layers have a tendency to mix anyway. Take the whole mixture, and put it in the oven for five minutes. After those five minutes have passed, check on it - if it looks like the cheese needs to melt a little more, then pop it back in there. If you're making burritos out of this (which is a really good idea), then take a plate large enough to hold a tortilla and two paper towels. Wet both paper towels and squeeze them out so they're damp. Place one damp paper towel on the plate, place the tortillas in a stack on the paper towel, and put the other paper towel on top of the tortillas. Microwave for about 45 seconds. When the microwave beeps, your bean dip should be done as well.

, If you want to add lettuce, sour cream, more salsa, or a packet or two of Taco Bell sauce, do it now. Then fold the burrito. You may want to use a fork to eat it. If you're using it as a chip dip: Scoop some onto a plate with a pile of tortilla chips. If you're using this for a party, maybe array the chips nicely around the casserole dish. If you're just eating it on its own: Just put a dollop on your plate, get a fork, and dig in!

Set them aside., Leave your butter and cheese on the counter for a few hours to soften them. Once they are softened, put them in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and cheese together until they look like cream cheese. This should take about 15-30 minutes.


This is easiest if you have a standing mixer. This allows you to leave the mixture to beat instead of holding a hand mixer.

, Sift 3 cups of flour with the salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder. Add the seasoned flour to the cheese mixture one large spoonful at a time. Beat every time you add more flour. Add the remaining flour to the mixture until it is somewhat stiff but still pliable.


You may not need to use all of the flour. If the mixture gets to this point before you use the whole cup, stop adding the flour.

, Pull off enough dough to make 1 inch (2.5 cm) balls. Roll them into a long strip. Flatten them into the shape of a straw with a fork, making long stripes down the side of them with the fork. Place them on the baking sheets until you have used all the dough.


If you have a cookie press, attach the star tip. Put part of the dough into the cookie press. Push out long strips of the dough onto each of the baking sheets until they are filled and the dough is gone.
This recipe yields 4 dozen. If you want to make less, cut the recipe in half to make 2 dozen.

Spoon the hummus into an airtight container.,
Leave room for the hummus to expand.,
Drizzle olive oil over the top of the hummus.,
Freeze hummus in small batches.,
Label and date the hummus containers.,
Consume the hummus within 6–8 months.,
Place the frozen hummus in your refrigerator for 24 hours.,
Expect a slight change in taste and texture.,
Enhance the hummus’ taste with spices.",How to Freeze Hummus," Regardless of whether your hummus is homemade or from a store, you’ll need to freeze it in an airtight container.Use a spoon or a spatula to scrape all of the hummus from the bowl or package that it’s in. Press the hummus down into the corners of the airtight container to maximize the amount of hummus you can store.


Most types of Tupperware will seal airtight, as will generic brands of plastic food-storage containers.
Avoid freezing your hummus in a plastic bag (i.e. a Ziploc), as the hummus could be crushed or jostled. Also avoid freezing hummus in a glass jar, as this could shatter if dropped from the freezer.;
, Don’t completely pack the hummus to the top of the container you’ll be freezing it in. Due to the water content in the hummus, as it freezes, the dip will expand.If you were to fill each container completely, the freezing hummus would lift the lid off.


For example, if you have enough hummus to completely fill two large plastic Tupperware, instead use three of the containers and leave an inch of space at the top of each., A thin coating of olive oil over the top of your hummus will help the dip retain its moisture and not dry out during freezing. You can pour the olive oil straight from the bottle. Alternately, if you’re concerned about pouring too much, you could pour from a measuring cup. You don’t need to measure the olive oil though, just pour enough for a thin layer of oil to form over the hummus.If your hummus were to dry out in the freezer, its consistency would become grainy and the hummus would taste badly freezer-burned.

, In order to avoid wasting any hummus, freeze the hummus in small batches. This will also make it easier to defrost the hummus when you need it; you’ll be able to defrost an appropriate amount, rather than thawing a large container of hummus all at once.To freeze in small batches, opt for smaller plastic containers to store the hummus in.

, Whatever containers you end up freezing your hummus in, you’ll need to use a permanent marker to label the containers. Be sure to write the word “hummus” and also the date, month, and year on which you placed it in the freezer. This will help you keep track of how long the hummus has been frozen, and how much longer you can leave it in the freezer.If you have stored your hummus in a plastic container, but would like to be able to reuse the container once the hummus has been eaten, you can place a strip of scotch tape along the top of the container. Write the label on the tape, and once you’ve eaten the hummus, tear the tape off and discard it.

, If you leave the hummus in the freezer for over a month, it may become freezer-burned or lose the majority of its taste. Plan to eat all of the frozen hummus before 6 months run out. Otherwise, you’ll likely end up throwing some away.If you doubt that you’ll be able to eat all of your frozen hummus within 6–8 months, ask friends and family members if they’d like any. Also plan better in the future by not buying or making more hummus than you can eat in 6 months.

, This will let the hummus thaw slowly and evenly, rather than the quick, uneven defrosting that would result from the use of a microwave. Giving your hummus time to thaw in the fridge will allow it soften slowly and to mostly retain its natural flavor and texture.Once the hummus has fully thawed, you’ll need to stir it with a spoon in case the texture isn’t even throughout. There may also still be some olive oil on top of the hummus.

, Due to the water in the hummus expanding when it freezes, you may notice that your hummus is slightly grainier after having been frozen. The taste and overall consistency of the hummus can also change as a result of having been frozen.The longer that you leave your hummus in the freezer, the more pronounced the changes in consistency and taste will become.

, If you find that the new taste of the thawed hummus is slightly disagreeable (or just not as pleasant as the taste prior to freezing), you can add new flavors with spices. Try sprinkling some paprika, cumin, or black pepper over the top of your hummus to add fresh flavor.You can also finely chop an onion, a bell pepper, or even a clove of garlic and add these flavorful ingredients to your thawed hummus.
All of these spices will be available at your local grocery store. You can also check a health-food store or a shop that specializes in spices for more variety, and for fresher spices.

Press out air bubbles, then choose a method below.,
Wrap in plastic wrap.,
Cover with a layer of water.,
Leave in the avocado pit.",How to Keep Guacamole Green1," Guacamole turns brown when exposed to air, even air mixed in during stirring. Press the guacamole with the back of a spoon to compress out some of the air. Apart from this minor starting step, you only need to choose one method to prevent browning.;
, Don't just cover the bowl. Press the plastic wrap on top of the guacamole.Press out air bubbles, then seal it around the bowl's edge. For best results, check the type of plastic on the triangular recycling symbol:Of the common options, PVDC provides the best defense against air, followed by LDPE.
EVOH cling wrap provides an excellent air seal, but only when dry. Cover the bowl without touching the guacamole. Select a container that barely fits the guacamole, to keep the amount of air low.

, Place the guacamole in a container with a tight-fitting lid. Pour on just enough water to cover it, then close the lid. This is an effective method for smooth guacamole, which can keep green in the fridge for 24–72 hours. Before eating, pour the water out slowly while holding back the guacamole with a spoon. Stir before serving to mix in the last few drops of water.


This may be unpleasant in chunky guacamole, made with avocado slices instead of mashed avocado. One test with whole avocados failed within four hours.The more mashed and stirred your guac is, the better this will go.

, Some chefs swear by this, but there's no evidence that the pit has any special anti-browning chemicals. Most experts agree that this only protects the guacamole directly under the pit, by blocking the air. Any food-safe object could be used for the same purpose — but the pit is conveniently at hand."

Increase the amount of lemon or lime juice.,
Cover with chunks of onion.,
Try different avocado varieties.",How to Keep Guacamole Green2," In theory, plenty of citric acid should slow down the enzymes that react with air to cause browning.This doesn't seem to work for everyone, but it's worth a try if you enjoy extra-tangy guacamole.Vinegar and tomatoes are similar acidic options.These are less powerful than lemon juice, but don't change the taste quite as much.

, This is another quick home fix that guacamole fans won't object to. It's unclear how effective this is, however. Plus, the onion itself may also react with air, becoming bitter and pungent.

, One study shows different rates of browning between avocados taken from different groves!The effect isn't so huge that this will solve all your browning problems. Still, buying in-season avocados  will lead to a better taste and a longer window of ripeness, so you don't have to use avocados that are already turning grey."

, This will make it easier to spread the sour cream on top—and scrape the sour cream off later.

, Keep adding the sour cream until you can't see the guacamole anymore. The sour cream will create a ""seal"" between the guacamole the air and keep it from turning brown., Smooth it out until it is pressed flat against the sour cream. Wrap the excess plastic wrap against the sides of the bowl to improve the seal. This will help keep the sour cream itself fresh.

, You can use the bowl of a spoon or a spatula. Make sure that there are no bumps, ridges, or ripples.

, Don't worry, the water won't soak into the guacamole. Avocadoes have a very high fat content, which helps them repel water., The guacamole will be good for up to three days.

Add general accompaniments.,
Pick a drink to go with it.,
Relax and enjoy.",How to Put Together a Cheese Plate," Ask your cheesemonger for suggestions if you have no idea where to start. For a cheese platter, you should get a variety of different types of cheeses. You should have at least one familiar type of cheese, such as Brie or aged cheddar. Pick one each from the following categories:









Aged Cheeses: Aged cheddar, goat Gouda, Swiss, etc.
Soft Cheeses: Brie, Camembert, Constant Bliss, etc.
Firm Cheeses: Gruyere, Jarlsberg, Monterey Jack, Provolone, etc.
Blue Cheeses: Stilton, Gorgonzola, etc.
Alternatively, pick one cheese from each type of milk - goat, sheep, and cow - to ensure that several different flavors are present on your platter.;
, You will want to have a variety of crackers or breads. You should also have a few fruits out to eat along with the cheeses.









Serve flavored crackers with mild cheeses. The cheese will accentuate the flavor in the cracker.
Serve seedy crackers with cheeses such as goat's cheese. .
Slices of baguette work well with soft, easily spreadable cheeses such as brie.
Edamame, maple syrup, and honey are interesting and delicious accompaniments to soft, fresh cheeses such as feta.
Try serving praline bacon or nut brittle with your blue cheeses.
Serve hard cheeses with slightly spicy foods such as cranberry-beet horseradish or apple mustard.
Apple slices pair well with Brie and Camembert, as do sun-dried tomatoes and warm pistachios.
Thinly-sliced onions are an excellent complement to blues or pungent double/triple cream cheeses like Taleggio or St. Andre.

, Will it be served as a course or as an hors d’oeuvre? You will need much less cheese – 1 oz-1.5 oz per person of each type – if you are going to serve cheese as a dessert course. If it is an appetizer, served buffet style, consider your guests and their appetites. Two to three ounces per cheese per person will work if you are serving a light meal.









Keep your numbers odd. Cheese plates should have an odd number of cheeses – 3, 5, 7, etc. – rather than even. This is a guideline; you could serve 4 or 6 if you like, but the balance of odd numbers is visually pleasing and is reflected in other arts, particularly Ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arrangement.

, Place the rest of the cheeses – mildest to strongest – clockwise, down and around. Your mildest cheese will end up next to your strongest cheese, if you have a sizable cheese plate. Blues are almost always the strongest cheeses on the plate, followed by washed rind cheeses. Keep your cheeses within the rim of the plate, or the plate will look messy.








, Other foods can intensify and even change the flavor of cheese. Serve cheeses with a variety of accompaniments like toasted nuts, quince paste (membrillo), slices of pear or apple, dried fruits, wine jelly, Italian mostarda, fig cake, or date cake (and any number of other treats available today).








, Water is nice, but wine is finer. If you are serving cheese at the end of the meal, the last wine you serve with the entrée can be served with dessert if you don’t want to fuss too much. You can also choose a wine to pair with your cheese course, if you really want to create a dazzler (ask your cheesemonger for advice if you have a broad range of cheeses). With strong blues, nothing beats dessert wines like Port, Tawny Port, Muscat, late harvest Zin, Sauternes, etc. Milder cheeses can be overwhelmed by syrupy dessert wines, so avoid them if you are not serving strong cheeses.








, Cheese courses should be fun and eye-opening. Don’t stress. If you don’t want to do the work, your cheesemonger will be more than happy to help you out.

Try some veggies, such as broccoli or carrots, or pita chips, instead of the less-healthy (but tasty) potato chips if you really want this to be a low-fat option. You can make this a day in advance, as long as you cover it well and keep it in the fridge.

Stir or toss the ingredients to thoroughly combine them and then turn the heat to low and cook for about 10-12 minutes, continuing to stir as you cook. Here's what else you should do:









After cooking over low heat for 10-12 minutes, sprinkle 1/4-1/2 tsp. of salt onto the mixture and keep cooking for another 15-25 minutes, or until the onions are amber in color and begin to get translucent.
Add 6-8 cloves of garlic in the last 5 minutes or so. If you add them sooner, they may burn a bit.
You can even add 1/2 a teaspoon of brown or white sugar at the midway cooking point if you want to sweeten them up a bit.

, You can turn on your oven while you caramelize your onions since it will take some time for it to heat up.








, Use either an ordinary pie plate or an 8 x 8"" pan for the cream cheese, Gruyere, Parmesan, and the caramelized onions. If you're not a big Gruyere fan, you can substitute it with regular Swiss cheese. You can also combine the ingredients in a bowl first and then place them on the pie plate if that's easier.








, Bake the ingredients until the dish is hot in the middle and golden on top. Check on it every few minutes to make sure that you haven't burned the onions.








, Serve this tasty baked French onion dip with tortilla chips, sourdough bread, or a sliced baguette.

Reheat for later.",How to Make Gougeres (French Cheese Puffs)," Wait to preheat the oven until you are ready to begin preparing the ingredients. Turn the oven to 425°F (225°C). The oven should be ready by the time you have prepared the ingredients and shaped the dough., Depending on the amount of and size of gougères you’re making, you may need more than one baking sheet. Consider how much room you have in the oven, how many pans you have, and how many people you will be serving. Line the baking tray with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat., Put the 1/2 cup (118.3 ml) of water, 1 stick (14.8 ml) of unsalted butter, 1/2 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of salt, and 1/2 cup (118.3 ml) of whole milk into a two or four quart saucepan. Stir the ingredients together and bring them to a rolling boil.You can also choose to add a ½ teaspoon (2.47 ml) of dry mustard powder to the mix.

, Remove the saucepan immediately and add one cup (236.6) of flour once the ingredients have been brought to a boil and melted,. Stir the mixture together until the mixture looks something like mash potatoes., Once the mixture has been stirred and formed, return the pan to the stove on medium-low heat. You are doing this to dry out the dough. Cook the dough until it begins to look shiny and can hold a spoon upright on its own.It’s okay if you notice some starch buildup at the bottom of the pan.

, Break the five, large eggs into the pan. Stir in between each egg added. Mix the eggs into the dough by hand with a stiff spatula, with a hand mixer, or with a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. The dough should turn into a smooth, creamy batter.Though the dough is smooth and creamy, it should still be thick enough to stand.

, Put cheese into the mixture after the eggs have been added. A sharp cheese is ideal, like gruyére or cheddar, but you can also use a cheese like comté. The cheese should already be grated at this point. Pour it into the mixture and combine., You can use an ice scream scoop, two spoons, or piping bag with a round trip to form the balls of dough. Tablespoon-sized drops of dough are typical, but you can make the balls as big or as small as you want. Space the dough about an inch apart on the pan and press down any bumps to form smooth, round balls., Put the pan into the oven and bake for five minutes. After five minutes, lower the heat to 375°F (190°C) and bake for 20 to 25 more minutes. The finished puffs should be golden brown.


You can rotate the pans when you lower the heat if you wish.

, Don’t take the gougères out of the oven immediately. Turn the heat off when they are done baking and allow them to sit in the oven for about fifteen minutes so that the insides can dry out. After that, you can remove the pan(s) and allow them to cool for a few more minutes., Gougères arguably taste best when they are still hot and steaming on the inside. They still taste good, however, at room temperature. How they are served is a matter of preference., If the puffs won’t be eaten immediately, store them in airtight bags. Put the airtight bags in the freezer. The frozen puffs can stored for up to two months., The gougères still taste good reheated even after being frozen. You should probably allow at least fifteen minutes for the puffs to defrost before putting them in the oven. To reheat, put the puffs in the oven for three to five minutes at 350°F (176.7°C)."

Introduce ripe, diced tomatoes into the guacamole (optional).,
Add sweetness with diced mango or pomegranate seeds.,
Add a smoky element to your guacamole with roasted tomatillos or pumpkin seeds.,
Play around with other unique additions.,
Garnish the guacamole.",How to Make Guacamole," Avocados oxidize quickly. Cutting them at the absolute last moment ensures that they stay fresh and green. Start by cutting an onion in half. Halve again until you have one quarter. Dice the onion with a sharp knife. Set aside in a small bowl.









If you want onion with a less acidic bite, wash your diced onion under cold water in a colander and drain. Water will help remove some of the sulfuric acid in onions (the same sulfuric acid that makes you cry when you cut an onion).;
, Mince your serrano or jalapeno pepper and combine in the same bowl with the onion.


If you want less spicy guacamole, remove the seeds and veins from the pepper before you mince it. Seeds and veins are especially hot.

, Bunch the cilantro together with one hand. Carefully chop it with a sharp knife and combine with onions and peppers.









If you want, feel free to cut the cilantro stem along with the leaf. Unlike parsley, which has a fibrous and unappetizing stem, cilantro stems are pleasing additions to guacamole.

, Guacamole doesn't need garlic, but many consider garlic an essential ingredient. If you do plan to use garlic in your recipe, mince a small clove and combine in bowl with onions, peppers, and cilantro.

, In order to get the best possible flavor, consider spending some extra time mashing the onions, cilantro, and serrano chili pepper with a fork so that they release their oils. This isn't absolutely essential if you're in a hurry, but it makes a big difference in the end.


If you happen to have a mortar and pestle (or traditional molcajete), now's the time to gently grind the onion, pepper, and cilantro together.

, Take a sharp knife and slice the avocados in half lengthwise. Pull the seed out from the avocado half and make sure no seed bits remain in your avocado.









It's better to use an avocado that's too soft than too hard. Since this is the main ingredient in guacamole, it's important to choose nice avocados whose flavors will highlight your dish.
It might help to twist the avocado halves as you're pulling them apart.

, Cut a grid-like pattern in the avocado halves. Don't cut through the skin.

, Take a spoon and scoop the cubed avocados from the peel into the bowl with your onions, peppers, and cilantro.








, If you like chunkier guacamole, use your spoon to gently break up the avocados until the onions, peppers, and cilantro are evenly distributed but the avocado isn't completely smooth. If you like smoother guacamole, mash the avocados until the avocado is creamy.









If you'd like to, add lime to your guacamole while you break up the avocados.
Be sure to salt your guacamole, too. Sea salt adds a nice crunch to guacamole that table salt doesn't give.

, If you have less-ripe tomatoes, combine them before you break up the avocados. If you have ripe tomatoes, introduce them now; ripe tomatoes are delicate and are worth highlighting.








, Fresh mango adds a tangy sweetness to your rich guacamole. If you enjoy sweet flavors in your dips, try out a Mayan salsa called xec. Pomegranate seeds make your guacamole visually appealing as well as slightly sweet.

, Roasted tomatillos or toasted pumpkin seeds give your guacamole a whole new depth of flavor.

, Don't be afraid to make your own additions. It's hard to mess up guacamole and easy to create your own unique version. Drizzle olive oil on top. Include the zest of a lime or Meyer lemon. Try adding a small amount of grated queso fresco cheese.

, Sprinkle cilantro over the top and serve immediately. Other options for garnish include:


Thinly sliced radish
Oven-roasted corn
Chips or tortillas arranged around the side of the guacamole bowl

Refrigerate your dip.,
Serve the dip with veggies.,
Use the dip with chicken wings.",How to Make Blue Cheese Dip," Scoop both ingredients into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Start stirring them into each other using a large spoon or a rubber spatula. It may be hard to tell when they’re fully blended, so just give it a good stir for about 20 seconds., As soon as the mayonnaise and sour cream are mixed up, you’re ready to add in the key ingredient. Pour the blue cheese crumbles into the mixing bowl and give it a good stir. Once everything seems blended, squeeze the lemon half over the mixing bowl. Stir the juices into the mixture., You can use any hot pepper sauce you enjoy – many people have a favorite or a go-to brand. The amount you add totally depends on your personal spice preference. A few drops will give your dip a kick, and a pour will really bring the heat. To be safe, you can add a little bit and then give it a taste test and see if it needs more. Add pepper to the mixture as well., These ingredients are the perfect finishing touches to your dip. Aside from taste, these ingredients will give your dip a bit of color and the scallions will give it a bit of crunch. Together, they will make your dip look appetizing and simply gourmet. Make sure to mix everything thoroughly., You can serve the dip immediately after mixing it up, but refrigerating it will let the flavors meld together deliciously. Pop the covered mixing bowl into the refrigerator for an hour or two. Spoon it into a serving dish once you’re ready to eat it., For a healthy-ish appetizer or snack, serve this blue cheese with some crispy veggies. Place it next to a colorful plate of celery, carrot sticks, pepper slices, and so on. This is a great party food for vegetarian guests, and everyone can keep coming back to this snack guilt-free., Blue cheese dipping sauces are ideal with crispy, spicy chicken wings. The warmth of the chicken wings paired with the cool creaminess of this blue cheese dip is a match made in heaven. Serve this dip with a plate of chicken wings and you will be glad you did."

Depending on the size of the party, you may want to plan a few months ahead of time. You should plan at least one month ahead of time in order to let people know about the party and have time for preparations. Consider the date and amount of people you want to invite to the party..


Try to pick a date when people are more likely to be free. You may get less of a turn out if you pick Memorial Day weekend or a holiday when people often travel.;
, You won’t need to make preparations for the date if you plan to have the party at your home. If you really want to go for the western theme, renting a barn or ranch would be fun and authentic. Any event space will do, however, if you plan on renting out a space.Consider the size of the space where you’d like to have the party. A house with a small backyard may not easily fit a large group of people. On the other hand, it might not be worth it to rent out a large event space for a small amount of people.

, Is this party for adults or children? If it’s for adults, you can play up the Wild West outlaw theme. If it’s a party for children, keep it light and cartoonish. Also, you can specialize the party for a girl or boy’s birthday party. Choose the western theme for your party so that you can make the invitations accordingly., Make your own invitations with things like cowboy boots and hats and wanted posters on them. Personalize any invitation by burning the edges of the invitation and using specific language. For example, you can address the person as “Cowgirl Annie” or “Bandit Tim,” and use language such as “The showdown starts at 6 p.m.”If personalizing invitations isn’t your thing, you can find western themed invitations online or at stores that carry invitations.

, Once you have the invitations made up, send them out. You should give your guests plenty of time before the party to make plans to come. Sending out the invitations at least one month before the party is ideal. If you think the invitations won’t be sent out in enough time, you can send a text or email to people you’re planning to invite about the party., Burlap is easy to decorate with, and it aligns with the western theme. You can use burlap for placemats, seat covers, or you can wrap mason jars with bands of burlap. You can buy a bag of burlap and cut it up to use it for creative ideas you’d like to try.Burlap is also great for a girl’s party because you can find burlap with lace attached to it that can be used for decoration on the mason jars.
You can also make table runners, utensil holders, and flower pot covers., Cow print is very commonly used for western themed birthday parties. Instead of burlap, you can use the cow print for placemats. You can also use it for things like trays, plates, napkins, title cards, and banners., Mason jars are fairly cheap and easy to find. You can find them at many supermarkets and arts and crafts stores. Buy enough mason jars for every person at the party plus a few extras just in case a few get broken. You can use them for drinks, but you can also use them for trail mix and party favors.You can put a name on each of the mason jars if you would like the guests to take them home.

, Hay bales are better for outside parties because they can be quite messy. Hay bales can be used as seating, pure decoration, or can be used for games. If they will be used for seating, make sure to cover them with something like burlap or cotton for comfort.You can ask about purchasing hay bales at farms and ranches.
Cover the hay bales with trash bags if you expect rain.

, Wanted posters are a classic part of the western theme. They can be found at some party and arts and crafts stores, but they are even more fun when they are personalized. Look for downloadable wanted posters online. Fill in the picture poster of the wanted poster with pictures of your guests.You can customize the text portion of the posters to specify “crimes” of your own choosing.

, You can set out real or fake cowboy boots as decorations. You can put things in the boots, like flowers, or use them to put party favors or wrapped silverware into. Use the bandanas to wrap the silverware in, or just use them as decoration.You can also use the cowboy boots as centerpieces, or to direct people to their table. For example, you can attach a button that has a “5” on it for table number five.
You can hand out bandanas to each of the party goers for them to put on.

, Use title cards to rename common snacks into western themed food. For example, rename chocolate cookies as “cow pies.” Or, rename rice crispy treats as “haystacks.”You can also use the title cards to name foods without changing their name.

, A buffet style is less formal and gives everyone the chance to grab whatever food they’d like. You can put out one long table with food, or you can have several smaller tables with certain types of food on them—like a table for appetizers, main courses, and dessert. Some foods that you can put out are pulled pork, corn muffins, vegetables, and baked beans., Trail mix is an easy thing to put out, and it fits well with the western theme. You can set out a bowl of trail mix, or you can put together bags of trail mix that the guests can eat there or take home. You can customize the ingredients for whatever guests you may have. Kids may not like nuts as much, so you can choose to use granola for them., The types of drinks you put of depends on the ages of the guests you will have. If you’re having adults, you can set out alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks on the table. For a party with kids, you can set out only nonalcoholic drinks like root beer, lemonade, and sweet tea. If the party will have a mix of kids and adults, consider putting the nonalcoholic drinks on one table and alcoholic drinks on another table that won’t be as easily accessible for kids., Make cupcakes follow the western theme by using toppers. You can also use toppers on cakes instead of cupcakes. You can find toppers in the shape of horses and cowboy hats. One idea is to make chocolate cupcakes, use green sprinkles to look like grass, and then use a horse topper., Put out life-size cuts outs of cowboy and cowgirls with the face cut out of them. You can put out larger and smaller ones to accommodate guests of all sizes. Your guests can use to them to take pictures with as they please., Horseshoes is a fun and easy game that both children and adults can play. For adults, you can use regular horseshoes. For children, it would be easier to use stuffed or lightweight horseshoes., Musical chairs is a game that works for parties of any type, but you can customize the game to fit the western theme. If your party is outside, use hay bales as the chairs. Put on country and/or western music to play the game.

, You don’t have to purchase nice, expensive cowboy hats. You can buy several cowboy hats made of plastic or straw. Sheriff badges can also be found fairly easily at party stores. You can choose to give them out as is, or customize them with the names of your guests.You can use a sticker or a marker to write the names of your guests on the badges.

, You can fill the bags with items like cowboy erasers, pencils, or small toys. Or, you can have your guests make their own goodie bags filled with food like popcorn, pretzels, and chocolate candies. Put out bags or mason jars for each party goer to grab. Lay out several boxes of the treats that they can fill their bags or jars with."

Be sure on the timing.,
Do it.",How to Plan an Anniversary Celebration," Another way to add to the success, is to find something meaningful to your partner, a special place, or thing. Such as the place you first kissed, even play ""your song"" to add to the romance. No one can tell you exactly what your partner likes or wants, because they don't know them. It's up to you to get their favourite flowers or chocolates etc.;
, This is the foundation for the surprise, without it, no other steps to ensure a good anniversary will work, after all, you can't build without a foundation, otherwise the building will crumble, that building is your anniversary. Let's cut to the chase; Plan days or even weeks in advance depending on the circumstances of the anniversary surprise/gift and the scale of it, this can vary from a card with chocolates and a present, to a dinner at the best restaurant in town, with a nice table, champagne, you can even hire a person to play a violin. Make the arrangements of your surprise in advance, so that you get the perfect day for your partner. For example book a restaurant seat a few days or even a few weeks before you arrive, do this with everything for the set date, that way, you won't forget, it's done, its arranged, you just wait.

, Telling your partner anything of the arrangements can ruin the surprise, making the delivery less loving, and meaningful, however go ahead and tell them if they don't like surprises of course. Make sure receipts, returned calls...anything is hidden. You can even play dumb on the day, and walk them to the restaurant ""pretending"" to be last minute and get the total WOW factor.

, Being too expensive can lead your partner to ""occasionally"" believe that you may have to improve on the performance, putting you in a tough spot if you tried your best on your first anniversary, they may expect something even bigger the next time, gradually work your way up with expenses. This is all optional of course, because your partner may not be like that, or because you're not too bothered. But either way, to save time and money, don't go crazy straight off the bat.

, Timing can in some circumstances be everything, make sure it is all arranged according to your plans. For instance, you don't want a violinist to start playing music when you have ""your song"" playing in the background, this sounds although it can be tied with planning, true enough, you can avoid this step if you're an expert planner, but this is a reminder, don't let your ""appointments"" clash.

, Execution is the final step, this is meaningful, it can mean anything from blindfolds, to people jumping out to say surprise. The meaning is a wide as that, you must deliver your anniversary gift, with precision, with skill and finesse, with timing and with emotion and love. Make sure you execute it in a meaningful and special way, that adds to the surprise, your aim is to WOW your partner, you want to see a surprised expression of amazement or even, tears...tears of joy, that shows that you cared enough to go through the length to make that anniversary special, to remind your partner, you still care and always have done.

, If you live with somebody else, such as your parents, friends, or significant others, you might want to ask them before planning a party at your place. They need their privacy, too, and if they're not keen about the idea, host it somewhere else. Respect their decision.

, Be sure to put your name on the invitation, whether it is just you alone or a group.
What. Description of party: something that fits the theme, but cleverly sneaks in information at the same time. Set the tone of the party. Tell them a little of what you will be doing, what they should bring, and if the event is formal or informal. If necessary, give advice about specific clothing. For example, if your party includes some social events that might get clothing dirty, include that information.
Where. Location of the party is crucial for those with transportation needs. Include address, directions, and even offer rides or suggest bus/subway routes.
When. Include the time and date in your invitations.
Why. If desired, include additional, personal information about your party. Be specific and give a strong reason, or multiple reasons, why you're hosting a party.

, Hand make these or use a computer. Figure out a theme, if any, for your miniature party, and use the appropriate wording, pictures, font, background, etc. For example, if your theme is the supernatural, include a Werewolf or a Vampire on the front. Use a Gothic print if your computer has it, such as ""Vivaldi"", or something with an old English look. Your background may be ghosts or something rather. The tone would be mysterious, and possibly dark. Make the invitees feel like that picture on the wall is watching them.

, Go out with your invitations to your closest friends, or those who you feel you need to get to know better. The maximum limit is six. This is a small party.

, Make sure you have food and beverages everybody can enjoy. Simple treats such as cakes, biscuits, cookies, and tea are always good choices. Know your guests' dietary needs ahead of time. For example, if one or more guests are vegetarians, don't put meat on all of your party appetizers.

, For smaller parties, focus on inexpensive entertainment. Design your own games, projects, activities, or events. Only use a DJ or professional entertainers if they are friends, and only if they can also enjoy the small party without performing the entire time.

This typically means bright colored dresses and hats for women, and slacks, button-down shirt, and blazer or suit jacket for men., You may use store-bought cards, make your own, or simply phone your guests for less formal events. If your guests are close friends or live nearby, consider delivering a small bouquet of garden flowers with the party details attached. Gives guests at least a week of notice if possible.


You may want to delay sending out invitations until you plan the menu and see how much everything will cost. This allows you to reduce the number of guests if you need to save money on refreshments.

, As the host, it is up to you whether to allow smoking, pets, or young children.Communicate your decisions clearly on the invitation. Let your guests know whether to expect a full meal or light refreshments. If you are not sure what food to provide, advice is provided below.


Keep in mind that some guests may be allergic to pets or bothered by smoke. You may wish to designate another room to keep pets in, and ask smokers to step outside.

, If you have a nice tablecloth and tea service, plan on using them. Three-tiered cake stands are traditional, but not mandatory. Small plates and teacups with floral patterns produce a good atmosphere, but don't feel that the teacups have to match unless you are entertaining formal guests or business contacts. Make sure you have a teapot or nice-looking kettle that can hold enough hot water for your guests.


Consider a vase of flowers as a centerpiece.
Place a single fork on the left and a knife and spoon on the right of each plate.Even if you are not serving food, provide small spoons for stirring sugar and milk into the tea.

, You'll need at least one black tea such as Earl Grey or Darjeeling; at least one non-caffeinated tea such as decaf black or chamomile; a small pitcher of milk or cream; and a container of sugar or sugar cubes. If you are not familiar with brewing loose leaf tea, you may provide a teapot of boiling water and a selection of teabags for guests to add. Arrange these all on the side of the table where you will be sitting or standing as you pour tea for your guests, or place on tray on either end of the table if you are hosting a large group.


Be prepared to ask each guest how he would like his tea. Many people are picky about how much sugar and milk to add (or whether to add any at all), so follow their instructions exactly.
Optionally, you may provide honey and/or lemon slices.

, Some people prefer coffee to tea, while others dislike any type of hot drink. Prepare for these scenarios by providing water at minimum, and preferably other drinks such as ginger beer or lemonade as well. Alcohol is not typically served at tea parties, but you may choose to serve small amounts of champagne or a light wine., There are three traditional ways to provide food at a tea party, mostly determined by the time of day. If you are serving tea in the mid-afternoon (between mealtimes), you may either serve an ""afternoon tea"" or ""low tea"" with a few sweet and savory snacks, or a less formal ""cream tea"" that serves only scones, clotted cream, and jam. Teas served during evening mealtimes (traditionally 5–7pm) are called ""high teas"" and usually provide more substantial food, such as meat pies, quiche, or any filling, savory dishes. A light soup and salad are sometimes served at formal high teas before the main meal.


While you may follow the links above to find recipes for common dishes, it is completely acceptable to serve store-bought foods.
Note that the term ""high tea"" is now often used to refer to any type of tea. If you are invited to a tea party in the afternoon, do not expect a full meal regardless of the name used in the invitation.

, Tea sandwiches are not mandatory, especially if you are serving a ""cream tea"" focused on scones, but they are high on the list of what your guests will expect regardless of whether they have attended a tea before. Traditionally, the sandwiches are made with white bread, then cut into small triangles or squares without crusts. Provide two or more varieties of sandwich, selected from these common choices or using other light ingredients:


Butter or cream cheese can be used as the only ingredient or added to sandwiches with vegetables or smoked salmon
Cucumber slices, watercress, or thinly sliced radish
Smoked salmon
Ham and mustard
Egg salad

Coronation Chicken salad, invented for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

, If you have a large party or a small table, you may arrange the food buffet-style and have the guests stand or sit in your living room or garden. If you have space to seat your guests around the table, place the food in the center of the table, or divide each dish among multiple serving platters to make it easy for everyone to reach.


If using a three-tiered tray and serving a traditional afternoon tea, the proper etiquette is to place scones on the top tray, sandwiches on the middle, and sweets such as small cakes or candies on the lower."

Get a permit or written permission for holding such an event if you are told you need one.;
, Pick a location for your event that will have plenty of space for the guests and the quantity of balloons. Choose an area as free of obstructions like tree branches, buildings, or power lines, as possible; a large open field would be ideal. You can even do the release indoors in a high-ceilinged venue to avoid harmful environmental impact and lessen cleanup.


Make sure that you have the proper permission to rent or reserve the space for a balloon-reelease event if you need it.
Avoid holding the event by a lake or other body of water, or within 500 miles upwind of the sea.While this might seem ideal for its open space, it will be too difficult or impossible to retrieve the fallen balloons after the release, and leaving them in the water is both littering and a threat to the wildlife in that body of water., Send out invitations or whatever form you want to notify guests of the event, its location, and what you will be doing. Warn guests that anyone with latex allergies should not participate.

, Decide if you want each guest at the event to hold and release one balloon or several, depending on how many are attending, what you want the effect to be, any local restrictions, and the fact that you will later need to clean up whatever number of balloons you release.

, Go to a party supply store or a general retailer that sells balloons. Purchase the number of balloons you decided on for your guests. Keep in mind any restrictions that your city and county has on the number allowed, and remember that you will need to pick up all of the balloons after the release.


Ask party supply staff if you have any questions about balloons or blowing them up to the proper inflation.

, Purchase only latex balloons, as latex is made from the sap of a tree and may biodegrade after 24-36 months, in the event that any remain loose in the environment., Ask staff at the party store how to fill your balloons with helium, either doing it yourself or having them do it for you. Blow up balloons as close to the time of your event as possible to avoid any deflation.


Note that there are risks associated with using helium. It causes balloons to fly far away where they can’t easily be cleaned up, and it depletes helium, which is a finite resource used for many other essential applications in medicine, engineering, and countless other areas.Try blowing up balloons with just your breath or an air pump, and tossing them into the air instead.

, Close your balloons by making a knot in the end of the balloon itself, without using clips, string, ribbon, valves, or other material to tie it off.If you use string or ribbon to hold the balloons for the balloon release, you must have a way of retrieving every balloon after the release. Strings and ribbons can choke or entangle wildlife if not collected and disposed of.

, Find an easy way to store the balloons, like placing them in large plastic bags or nets, and recruit people to help transport them carefully. Fill vehicles with the bags of balloons, weighing down the bags to keep them from escaping truck or trailer beds if needed.

, Before the big release, do a test by releasing a few balloons to see which way they will be carried by the wind, so you can prevent them from getting stuck during the main event and know approximately where they will end up for cleanup.

, If you can, try to pass out the balloons to guests while indoors or a contained environment so you don’t lose them to the wind. Don’t release balloons tied in bunches., Count down out loud with your group of guests so that everyone releases their balloons at the same moment. You can send up a cheer, a prayer, or observe a moment of silence, depending on what the situation calls for.

, Wait for the balloons to rise up high, burst, and fall back down to the ground. Then have your planners or all of the guests fan out to retrieve the fallen balloons to the best of their ability. Bear in mind that helium-filled latex balloons often travel for hundreds of miles. You can use the same trash bags or whatever you used to transport the balloons to collect the waste. Dispose of the trash properly when you’re done.

Choose a theme.,
Decide on a location.,
Invite guests.,
Dress up.,
Make sure you have enough plates and cups.,
Decorate the table or room.,
Find some drinks to serve.,
Make sandwiches.,

Consider whether your guests need more food.,
Figure out what to do for entertainment.",How to Plan a Tea Party2," Maybe you picture a traditional British tea party, with fancy sandwiches and doilies. Or maybe the guests want to dress up as princesses, pretend to be fairies, or decorate a room as though it were winter, or underwater. Finding out what the guests are excited about will help you make it more fun for them.


Keep in mind that some themes require more work than others. If you're looking for a quick and simple theme, pick a single color and decorate a room or table with flowers, objects, napkins, and dishes in that color from around the house.

, If the weather is sunny, you could host a tea party in your garden or take a picnic to a nearby park. Throwing a tea party indoors is also fun, though, and gives you the option of hanging up decorations.

, Give cards to your friends inviting them to your tea party, but make sure to check with everyone in your house first to see how many people you can bring over. Remember to let your friends and family know what day and time the tea party are. You can plan a tea party weeks in advance, or throw one spontaneously with your brothers and sisters. Whatever makes you happy!


Ask your friends to bring their favorite doll or stuffed animal.
Tea parties don't have to be all-girl or all-boy. Invite anyone who makes you happy.

, For some people, the best part of a tea party is getting to dress up. If you don't have any fancy clothes or costumes to put on, try making your own silly costumes by asking family members if you can put on their hat, makeup, or scarves. It's a good idea to keep a few extra objects like this around for guests who show up without a costume.


Princess costumes can be as simple as the kid's favorite dress and a paper crown.
If you are willing to spend extra time on costumes, sew them from patterns, use face paint, or track down pre-made costumes online or at Halloween shops.
If you and the other kids and parents involved want to throw a super special tea party, have each kid pick a character from their favorite book, or from a single popular book such as Alice in Wonderland or Harry Potter.

, A fancy tea party might have tea pots, teacups, and saucers, but you can host a tea party using any dishes. Just make sure there's at least one plate and one cup for each person. Silverware is optional if you are only going to be serving finger food, such as sandwiches and cookies.

, If you are holding a tea party indoors, you might want to hang up colorful cloths or flags, or put stuffed animals and art projects around the room. Flowers at the center of the table or picnic blanket can give people something pretty to look at.


Hold a faerie tea party in a garden or park, using toy mushrooms, flowers, and moss covered rocks to make a faerie circle.
Create a winter wonderland theme with paper snowflakes, hanging white cloths, and hot cocoa (or iced tea if you are holding it in summer).

, Many kids don't like black tea, or it might make them hyper or make it hard for them to sleep. Fortunately, there are plenty of other teas such as peppermint, lemon, or rooibos (red tea). Since not everyone likes tea, it's a good idea to have lemonade, juice, or milk around to serve as well.


Ask an adult to help you make the tea if you aren't supposed to boil water on your own.
If your guests don't like tea or you don't want to serve hot drinks, put juice in a teapot instead.

, For a real tea party feel, make sandwiches out of cream cheese, cucumber, or just butter. Have an adult help you cut them into triangles or small pieces, and arrange them on a plate in a pyramid or other shapes.


Use a cookie cutter on the sandwich to create sandwiches in different shapes.This works best with squishy bread that holds together well.

, American cookies or British biscuits make great finger food for a tea party, as do scones or small cakes. You can buy these from a store or make them yourself with adult supervision.

, Most tea parties don't serve a full meal, just some drinks and snacks. But if your guests will be staying during lunchtime or dinnertime, you might need to feed them pasta or some other bigger meal. Be sure to let your guests know whether or not you'll be feeding them a full meal or whether they should eat at home before coming.

, Decide what games and activities you want to plan for the party, and gather any items you need before the party starts. You could play games, make art projects, or just have fun pretending to be English royalty.


For example, make a faerie house or garden, decorate with homemade pinwheels, or make a fun dessert with your guests.

If you have friends who are in relationships, they're probably doing something romantic on Valentine's Day. Instead of inviting couple friends, invite your single friends who may feel lonely or left out on Valentine's Day.However, you may have some couple friends who don't celebrate Valentine's Day or who are in long distance relationships. They may want to attend the festivities as well.;
, When you're planning to host an anti-Valentine's Day party, get the theme going with the invitations. Send out invitations online or physical invitations that express some animosity towards Valentine's Day.For example, you can send an e-vite saying something like, ""Let's celebrate Singles Awareness Day!"" You can also send out physical cards that say something like ""R.I.P. Valentine's Day"" on them.
Make sure to include basic information like the location, date, and time on your cards.

, Instead of playing sappy love songs, compile a playlist made up of anti-love songs. You can use songs to set a particular ambiance. You can go for anti-love songs or fun songs about enjoying life and being single.If you want anti-love songs, you can include songs like ""Love Stinks"" and ""You Give Love a Bad Name.""
You can also include songs like ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" to express appreciation for the single life.

, You can stop by a candy store and look for specially molded chocolate. You can also buy chocolate online. Instead of getting heart shapes, go for shapes like skulls. This can reflect a ""Death to Valentine's Day"" theme., Most drugstores, department stores, and grocery stores sell decorations around Valentine's Day. Stop by one of these stores and pick up some conventional decorations. Then, you can take them home and alter them with negative messages.For example, you can use spray paint to paint X's over hearts on Valentine's Day signs.
Try using markers and write the words ""stinks"" under words like ""love"" and ""Valentine's Day.""

, Candles are often thought of as romantic. However, if you're throwing an anti-Valentine's Day party, use them to cultivate a dark mood. Instead of lighting pink or red candles, opt for black candles.If you have any sinister candle holders, use them on Valentine's Day. For example, use skull-shaped candleholders from Halloween to decorate.

, Valentine's Day is often associated with refined food, such as champagne and strawberries. To work against this, go for messy food. As many people will be kissing on Valentine's Day, they may avoid strong smelling food. As you're throwing an anti-Valentine's Day party, opt for food with a strong odor.For example, serve something like messy nachos with onions and garlic.
Get pizza with extra cheese and loaded with extra toppings, especially strong smelling toppings.

, Make basic cut out cookies shaped like hearts and frost them. Then, use icing sarcastic, anti-love messages on them.For example, write things like ""You Wish,"" ""Go Away,"" and ""Love Stinks"" on the cookies.

, If you're serving cocktails, go for darker colors. Opt for drinks made from dark liquors, like bourbons and rums, over lighter options like vodka.You can also add dark pieces of fruit to glasses of champagne or sparkling wine. For example, add a few blackberries or cherries to a glass of Prosecco.

, This is a game in which guests bid farewell to failed relationships. Give everyone a pen and paper. Let everyone spend 15 to 20 minutes jotting down everything they hated about their last relationship. Then, you can do something to destroy the notes.If you can safely burn the notes, do so. If you have a fireplace, for example, burn them there. You can also start a bonfire outside.
If you can't safely burn the cards, you can destroy them or get rid of them in other ways. For example, everyone can rip their cards up at the same time.
For a twist on the game, have everyone inflate a balloon and write down negative things on it. Then, everyone can pop their balloons at the same time.

, Board games can be a fun way to pass the time. Go for board games with a darker twist to stay away from cheesy love themes. For example, play a war game such as Risk or Settlers of Catan., Instead of decorating cookies before the party, just make a batch of cut out cookies. Then, provide things like icing, sprinkles, and frosting. Allow your guests to decorate their own anti-love cookies., Instead of watching love movies, opt for things like horror movies, comedies, or documentaries. You can also watch very cheesy love movies and make fun of them.You can also try watching movies about how relationships are complex and can end easily, as these may feel like anti-love movies. For example, watch something like Annie Hall or 500 Days of Summer.

When picking a date for your pool party you will want to consider the weather. You want a warm day, with no rain in the forecast. It is also best to host your pool party on the weekend, so more people are able to attend.In case you have to cancel due to poor weather, you may want to schedule a rain date. This is especially important if you live in a rainy area and are hosting outside.
If you are planning your pool party to celebrate an event, such as a birthday, you may want to pick a date close to the event.;
, The most important component of a pool party is having a pool for you and your guests to use. There are a variety of options for finding a pool for your party.Using your own pool or a friend or family members' pool: If you have a pool, hosting at your own house is convenient and provides a private location for your party.
Many communities have pools that are open for use by the public. There is often a small fee to use community pools, but they are very reasonably priced.
Some hotels with pools and swim attractions will allow you to purchase day passes to use the facilities without staying at the hotel. There are indoor and outdoor options of both hotel pools and water parks., If you don’t have your own pool to use, you will want to compare your options to find the best fit for your party. When picking your location you will want to consider a few different factors, such as, price, size of pool, location, rules and regulations, availability, and other amenities.Pick a pool that fits your budget. For example, going to a hotel or water park will be a more expensive option.
Some hotels and water parks have party packages that include extra services to help cater to your party.

, When deciding on your guest list keep in mind the size of the party space and pool. You want to have a manageable number of guests that will fit the space.If you are planning a kids pool party, you should also take into account parents that may want to attend with their child.

, You should first decide on the type of invitation you want to send. There are a few options to consider: evites, mailed invites, or handout invites. You could also invite guests via social media outlets, such as a facebook event page., Make sure your invitations include the important party details. You want your invitations to be informative and clear. They should include:The date and time of the party.
The location of the party.
A list of items guests should bring to the party, such as, a bathing suit, a towel, sunscreen, change of clothes, sandals/footwear, lawn-chair, and if they are required to bring any food or beverages.
The theme of your party.
RSVP and contact information, so your guests can confirm their attendance.
A scheduled rain date and information on how party cancellation will be communicated.

, Send out your invitations two to three weeks in advance of your party. This will ensure that more people will be available to attend, as it is less likely that they are already busy that date. It also gives guests more time to respond and plan to attend., Once you have heard back from all of your invited guests, you should tally how many people will be attending. This is important for organizing other aspects of your party, such as, food, drinks, games, seating, supervision, and safety.

, It is a good idea to provide some snacks and drinks at a pool party because guest will get hungry from swimming and playing in the water. Setting out light snacks and finger foods is easy and will keep party goers happy. You could serve some of the following snacks and drinks:A fruit and vegetable tray.
Chips and dip or corn chips and salsa.
Popsicles.
Crackers and cheese.
Water, lemonade, iced tea, pop, juice, punch, etc.
Alcoholic beverages for adults.

, Pool parties often last close to a full day or afternoon, so it may be necessary to provide more food than just snacks. Options for meals can include:Having a potluck: You can have each guest bring a dish to share with everyone at the party.
Grilling or barbecuing: If you are hosting in a backyard and/or have access to a barbecue you could cook hamburgers, hotdogs, grilled veggies, etc.Ordering food: If you don’t want to cook, or you have a large number of guests, you may want to order food, such as, pizza or other takeout food.

, When serving food or drinks at your party, you will need supplies such as, serving trays, bowls, cups, cutlery, plates, napkins, ice, coolers, etc. Make sure you have enough supplies for the number of guests that you are serving. Also, it is a good idea to serve food on paper or plastic plates, so you don’t have breakable dishes near the pool area.

, Depending on the type of party and location, you may want to have some games, toys, or activities available to entertain your guests.Some games include: Marco polo, treasure hunt, sharks and minnows, octopus, volleyball, etc.
You could also provide water toys, such as beach balls, pool noodles, floating devices, rings and retrieval objects, water balloons, squirt guns, etc., Music will help create a great party atmosphere. You can create your own playlist or find one on a music streaming site, such as Spotify. When preparing music also consider, a portable and waterproof speaker to play your music at the pool area.If your party has a theme, you can have your music match. For example, play Caribbean music at a tropical themed party.

, Some popular pool party decorations include, tiki torches, lanterns, flowers, balloons, signs for food and drink stations, colourful tablecloths, etc.If you are throwing a birthday pool party, you might want to have birthday decorations, such as balloons, streamers, and banners.
Alternatively, if your pool party has a specific theme, you will want your decorations to match the theme.
If you are hosting your party at a public pool or hotel, you may have to check with them to see if you are allowed to bring decorations.

Events that involve alcohol may need to take place at local restaurants, bars, hotels or historical sites.

, You must give people who live out of town advance warning to make travel plans. Once the date, time, location and ticket information is planned, email and mail cards with an RSVP email address and phone number.

, The following are necessary steps for a successful event.


Submit the necessary paperwork for all the events. If you plan to serve alcohol, you will need to get a liquor license for the day of the event. If you plan on using school or public grounds, you may need a use permit.
Get insurance for large events. Liability insurance protects you from lawsuits in case of accidents. The school may suggest or provide this insurance.
Hire a graphic designer to do a poster and other promotions for the event. Print your invitations, posters, flyers well in advance. Set up a website, if necessary.

Could you have it at your house or a friend’s house? Did you have a venue in mind, like a specific restaurant, bowling alley, movie theater, or park? Make sure your location is suitable for the activities you may have planned.


If you plan on having quite a few guests and can’t do it at home, you may want to make reservations at your venue beforehand to make sure they can accommodate you. It’s best to call at least a week in advance to give yourself the best odds of getting the okay. Make sure to set a date on the invitation on when to RSVP, if the don't respond by then call them.;
, If it’s a birthday party, most people try to have the party on that date. Otherwise, any weekend evening or night is generally best so you and your guests don’t have school or work in the morning. Most parties are after dinner, but a brunch or afternoon party works, too. Sleepover parties are also great fun but involve more thorough planning and entertainment.


Also, make sure to pick a date when most of your guests are free. Do you know of another party happening or a community event or holiday that has everyone booked? You may have to do some asking around beforehand to figure out if this is the case.You may also want to have a duration of time for your party. That way when it hits midnight, your guests know that they don’t have to go home, but they can’t stay with you (or at the venue that’s closing). It also helps people not have to worry about an unscheduled departure.

, Will it be for an occasion? If so, think what will please the guest of honor. Otherwise, try to come up a theme that might get everyone excited or intrigued. Here are some tips:Do something that’s accessible, especially if the party this weekend. An all black party is easy; a 1940s party is not (unless you give everyone adequate prep time).
Do something that’s not clothing related. A sandwich party (where everyone brings a different sandwich) could be quite the hit. Not to mention the classic wine or beer tasting party, too. Chocolate tasting is also seriously fun.
Do something with a broader theme, like a “golf” or “owl” themed party. You could then have “par”faiths or chicken wings, and other themed fare.
Or don’t have a theme at all. Sometimes it’s just nice for friends to get together and enjoy each others’ company.

, This will be partly determined by where you’re having the party – how many people can the venue tolerate? What’s more, who do you want there and who would enjoy the party? Do you know anyone who isn’t free? Make sure that your venue is large enough to fit all of your guests in.


Not everyone wants to dance and not everyone wants to listen to the music; some people want to talk and relax. If your party is one kind or the other, take that into account with your guest list. However, if you can, try to accommodate for different interests and levels of social comfort with space planning if it is possible, and, if applicable, account for different age groups.
Also determine whether you want your friends to bring friends or not. That could seriously change how many heads you have to plan for and mouths you have to feed.

, If this is your party, you’ll likely have to front most of the cost. You may also have to decorate even if you don’t have it at your home. How much are you willing to spend? If it’s not a ton, ask a few friends if they can chip in. They want to party too, don’t they?


A good way to deflect the costs of a party is to have a potluck. This way everyone chips in and is a part of the fun and you don’t have to pay for all the food. You could also specifically instruct certain people to bring drinks, ice, plates, napkins, and cutlery.

, No party will be a party if your guests don’t know to come. You can talk to guests in person about the upcoming party or just call or text them.Insert non-formatted text here Aim to first start the talking about two weeks in advance so they don’t make plans, and remind them once or twice before the party, too. The day before the party, it's a good idea to confirm with them if they're coming or not.You could also make invitations or buy them. Pass them out within a reasonable time frame of notice. If you plan on instructing your invitees to bring friends, don't send out the invitations too soon or you could end up with a bigger party population than you can handle. If you are allowing friends bring friends, put a limit on the amount of friends they may bring, otherwise you may be overwhelmed with the swarm of people you don't know when they arrive.

, Your food choice packs a big punch in your party. If you don't know what to get, ask around to see what your future party-attendees would like. Safe bets are finger foods, like chips, veggies, cookies and cupcakes, mini sandwiches, pretzels, popcorn, cheese and crackers, and bites of fruit.


Do not neglect drinks, ice, cups, napkins, plates, forks, and knives, too. You’ll also need some method of chilled storage (like a large cooler) to keep the drinks cold as well.
If you’re of age, be sure to offer non-alcoholic drinks if you are offering an array of alcoholic drinks – not everyone wants to or can consume alcohol. What’s more, you don’t want a bunch of drunk guests trashing the area and no sober drivers to get them home.
Always make sure that none of your guests have allergies or serious diet restrictions; if they do, make sure there is food for them to enjoy, too.

, What's a party without music? Pick music that you think will be most agreeable to the spirit of your party and your guests. It's a good idea to have an iTunes window open on your computer so you can download tunes or play videos that guests suggest.


If you don't have a lot of your own tunes, ask your guests to bring their own. You could also play an internet radio station that has whatever is hot, and jam away.

, If you want to have an energetic dance environment, have music, strobe lights, lasers, a fog machine and maybe some video synchronized with your music. If you want a classy wine-tasting party, skip the strobe lights and light some candles instead. It all depends on how you envision the party in your mind.


As for decorations, this bit is completely up to you. Are you going to literally roll out a red carpet for your red carpet party? Go old school with streamers? Make it look like Christmas threw up in your house? Generally your theme will dictate the decorations. And none is fine, too, if that’s how you roll.

, If the party will be held in your home, make sure to pick an area for the guests to sit, chat, and eat. Clean the area beforehand and tidy up to ensure that the guests are comfortable and won't be touching any of your personal items (for example children's graded quizzes, private photos, mobile phones, children's toys, or anything that your children, spouse, or you aren't comfortable having other people see).


It's a good idea to have some cleaning stuff around, like a stain stick just in case someone spills on themselves or your furniture.Make sure there is enough toilet paper, too. It may sound weird, but you don't want the only memory of your party to be an empty tube, and you really don't want someone you may not know using your hand towels.

, This does not mean what it used to with pin the tail on the donkey or spin the bottle (though it can if you’re doing a throwback party). Nowadays it means video games, gossip games, and getting a little crazier.


Rock Band is a good game to have going on in the background for parties. This game is available on multiple game systems with the objective of playing as members of a band with the use of the guitar, microphone and drum kit included with the game.
The Guitar Hero series is another good one. This can be a one or two player game depending on which edition you choose. Like Rock Band, it uses its own controllers of the guitar nature to play through the game's levels.
Dance Dance Revolution rounds out this trio. It can be one or two player depending on what controllers you have available. Step to the music as directed by the arrows on the screen. Even if only a few people play this game, depending on which edition you choose, can provide some great music.

, If the party is at your home, you may want to brief everyone on the setup. Throw the coats in the bedroom, and the basement is off-limits, for example. If you're feeling sick, there's a second bathroom off the first bedroom – don't get sick in the kitchen sink. Oh, and the toilet takes a second to flush.


If you're at a venue, you may need to remind everyone to act responsibly. If they get loud and disorderly, you could either be kicked out or asked to never return.
If drinking is happening at your home, you need to decide how you want to run it. Are there minors present, too? Will you watch and care for your guests if they become too drunk? We'll address more details in the next section.

, Odds are you’re going to want to remember this party and brag about it on Facebook, Twitter, and whatever other social media platforms you use, in addition to remembering it for years to come. So start taking pictures! Whether they’re of the table-full of macaroni n’ cheeses (at a mac n’ cheese tasting, of course), you and your friends all dressed up, or your sweet disco ball, it’s all good. In fact, take pictures of everything.


If you're going all out, set up a ""photo booth"" – an area of the room set up specifically for taking photos. Place a piece of fabric on the backdrop, decorate it as you see fit, and keep a basket of props handy for people to use to take funny photos. It's also a good activity for bored guests.

, You probably have a whole bunch of people at your party that don’t know each other super well. In that case, you’ll have to be the link between them, bridging the gap. To make everyone feel a little bit more comfortable (especially toward the beginning), be a butterfly, flitting around from group to group, introducing everyone and diffusing the tension. When the fun really gets started, you’ll see people making new friends thanks to you.


If this an issue, consider getting a game together that involves everyone. Charades, Heads Up, and even games like Truth or Dare can be classic hits.

, Parties get messy and they get messy fast. What’s more, people are notorious for not being polite and clean in a party environment, especially when it’s not in their house. Whether you’re in your house or at a public venue, it may be up to you to keep the area relatively neat and tidy. It doesn’t have to be spotless, but you definitely don’t want a tower of garbage accumulating on your drinks table, you know?


Be sure to keep the trash and recycling in an open area. If it gets full, people will likely keep piling it up until its unmanageable, so get at it as soon as possible to avoid it spilling everywhere later in the night.

, The party’s at your house and there’s alcohol? Then your guests are your responsibility. Take their keys at the beginning of the party, hide them all in a bowl somewhere, and only give them back if they’re sober at the end of the night.


You could also designate someone as the key keeper, so you’re not dealing with all the responsibilities. If you know someone isn’t drinking of their own accord, ask them if they could do this for you – you already have to deal with everything else!

, Whether it’s leftover food, a cupcake, or a party favor, it’s nice to have something for your guests to leave the party with – and it’s less clutter for you to worry about. That way everyone leaves with a piece of the party, feeling like they were involved and had a good time.


Make sure to tag everyone in all your photos, too, when all is said and done. People will be reminded of how fun your party was and be looking forward to your next one. What will the next party's theme be?

Decide the theme of your party.,
Figure out where the party will happen.,
Create your guest list.,
Work out the menu, and go potluck.,
Find a good source of music.,
Send out invitations.,
As party time approaches, make and buy decorations.,
Party time!",How to Plan a Party on a Budget," Maybe it's a birthday party, or a holiday party, or an I'm-having-a-party-because-I-can party. No matter what the occasion, even if you don't have one, it's good to clarify on a theme. However, If you don't want a theme, then you can skip this step entirely. If you DO want a theme, make sure that you pick something original and interesting.;
, If you're on a tight budget, then your house would be your best bet. If you can stretch the dough a little, try having it at a club or rent out a restaurant. But, for the people who feel better close to home, then good news! You just saved tons of cash!

, Since you are on a budget, it would be best not to invite any more than 15 people. Remember, you have to feed and entertain everyone! Avoid inviting people who are too high-maintenance or bossy. They will try to take over the show that YOU worked so hard on, start talking badly about another guest, make you do everything he/she says because ""I'm the guest!"", etc. Do yourself and everyone else a favor and don't invite them.

, Seeing that you don't have that much money to spare, it would be a good idea to ask a couple of trustworthy friends if they could bring some small food items. Ask your friend who loves to bake to make some cookies, and ask your helpful but cooking-challenged friend to pick up some chips and dip. If you play your cards right, you will wind up paying for half or less of the total amount of food.

, You might also try games, movies, or something else for entertainment! You obviously don't want to go out and buy all the new CDs, so it would be best to maybe blast your iPod on a specific playlist at your party. Even better? Ask a friend who is music-crazy to burn you a CD of all of their favorite songs and spontaneously play them at the party. Make sure that you have different types of music that will appeal to everybody.

, If you plan on saving money on a stamp and personally delivering it to them, be discreet about it. The last thing you need is for someone you hate to walk over, look at the invitation, and say, ""I'll be there!"" before you can explain yourself.

, Streamers and posters are fairly easy to make. Visit the dollar store since they have cheap party supplies like balloons, paper cups, and disposable utensils.

, Hopefully your guests love the party and can't tell that it cost you about $20. Heck, YOU probably won't be able to tell! Let loose and have fun at your awesome party!

, Keep in mind that money spent on food may detract from other areas of your party. It's important to stay balanced with your budget, especially if it is limited. If you are on a tight budget, consider choosing simple dishes, like chicken nuggets and pizza, rather than expensive complicated dishes like Penne Vodka or Chicken Parmesan from a costly restaurant.

, If your Sweet Sixteen's theme is the outdoors, then consider choosing a menu that would resemble that of a picnic. Or, if your Sweet Sixteen's theme is beachy, you may want to serve seafood.

, It's important to stay within the boundaries that your parents set for you, in terms of cost and availability.

, Although you should aim to please yourself as for food options at your sweet sixteen, it's also best to keep in mind your guest;s preferences. For example, if the majority of your friends do not like seafood, do not order seafood.

, Never forget to make available food for those of your friends that need special dishes. Try to choose allergen-free dishes that are similar to your menu otherwise.

For this method you'll need the following items:


A dozen eggs, hard-boiled or hallowed out
Heatproof bowl, cup, or jar
4 teaspoons white vinegar
1 cup hot water
Food coloring
Tongs;
,
Protect your work area with paper towels, newspaper, or plastic sheeting.,
Decide whether you want to use hardboiled eggs or hollowed out eggs.,
Make your dye mixture.,
Dip your eggs.,
Dry the eggs completely.",How to Make Easter Eggs1,", You may want to protect your clothing with an apron. Dyes can stain tabletops, counters, and clothing.

, For hardboiled eggs, simply boil you eggs as you normally would. If you'd like a longer lasting solution, try hollowing out your eggs.









With a pin, poke a small hole through the top of an uncooked egg.
Poke another hole in the bottom of the egg. Use the pin to make the hole slightly larger.
Use an unfolded paper clip to pierce the yolk of the egg.
Blow out the insides of the egg using an egg-blowing tool (available at craft stores), or with a rubber ear syringe (available at drug stores).
When all of the egg contents have been blown out, fill the tool or ear syringe with warm water and rinse out the inside of the egg., For every color you wish to use, fill a heatproof bowl, cup, or jar with 1 cup of hot water, 4 teaspoons of vinegar, and 20 drops of food coloring.









When dyeing eggs, vinegar is almost always added to the dye. Vinegar contains acetic acid, a weak acid that is known for its sour taste and strong smell. When it comes into contact with an eggshell (made primarily of calcium carbonate), the weak acid in the vinegar softens the shell and allows the color to penetrate the shell more deeply. The result? More vibrant eggs., Gently lower your eggs into the mixture and allow them to absorb the dye. Varying the time you leave the eggs in the dye changes the color intensity.









Try dipping eggs for less than 5 minutes for lighter, pastel shades.
For bolder, brighter colors, leave the eggs in the dye for more than 10 minutes.
For a two-toned egg, first place the egg in a lighter dye. Let it dry completely (approximately 15 minutes) before placing half of it into a darker color.

Stand mixer and paddle attachment, or a large mixing bowl and a hand mixer
Rubber spatula or wooden spoon
Small bowl
Baking sheet
Plastic wrap or parchment paper
Double boiler (small saucepan and a medium glass bowl)
Toothpicks
Potato or large piece of Styrofoam;
, To make the egg filling for the cream egg, add the four ingredients to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Cream the ingredients on medium low speed until combined.You can also add 3 drops orange blossom water to the mixture to give the eggs a hint of citrus.
If you don’t have a stand mixer, combine the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and beat them with a hand mixer or whisk.

, Reduce the speed to low and add the sugar 1 cup (125 g) at a time. Once all the sugar has been added, continue beating the mixture until the sugar has been fully incorporated.Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure all the ingredients get mixed.

, Remove about one-third of the egg filling mixture and transfer it to a small bowl. Add the yellow food coloring and stir with a spoon to fully incorporate the dye into the filling.

The yellow filling will be used to create the egg yolk, which will be suspended in the white egg filling.

, Cover the two bowls of filling with plastic wrap. Transfer the bowls to the freezer and let them rest for at least half an hour, and up to four hours.Chilling the filling will make it easier to work with, but you don’t want it to actually freeze.

, Remove the yellow filling from the freezer. Take a half-teaspoon of filling and use your hands to roll it into a ball. Repeat until you’ve used all the yellow filling to make small yolk balls.

When the yolks have all been made, transfer them to a baking sheet. Cover them with a sheet of plastic wrap or parchment paper, and return them to the freezer.

, Remove the bowl with the white filling from the freezer. Take a tablespoon of the filling and roll it into a ball with your hands. Gently press the ball in between your hands to flatten it slightly, then press your thumb into the center of the ball to create an indent for the yolk.Repeat until you have made egg white filling balls with all the white filling.
You should have the same number of yolks and whites. If you don’t, make some of the whites larger or smaller to accommodate the number of yolks you have.
If the filling becomes too soft and sticky at any point while you're working with it, put it back into the freezer to chill for a few minutes.

, Remove the yolks from the freezer. Take one ball of egg white filling and place a yolk ball into the indent. Now use your hands to shape the egg white around the yolk so that the yellow is completely covered by white filling.Roll the combined filling into a ball, then gently shape it into an oval to create an egg shape.
Continue combining the yolks and whites in this way until you have made all the egg fillings.
Return the eggs to the baking sheet, cover them with plastic or parchment, and return them to the freezer.

, Place the chocolate into a medium glass bowl. Fill a small saucepan with an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place the glass bowl on top of the saucepan, and heat it over medium heat.

Whisk the chocolate regularly as it melts.
When all the chocolate has melted, give the whole thing a vigorous whisking until the chocolate becomes glossy.
Turn the heat to low so it’s warm enough to keep the chocolate liquid.

, Remove one ball of egg filling from the freezer. Pierce the bottom with a toothpick so you can dip the entire egg in chocolate. Dip the filling in the melted chocolate. Remove the egg from the chocolate, and hold it over the bowl to allow the excess to drip off.Stick the other end of the toothpick into your potato or Styrofoam to secure the egg. Place the egg and the potato into the fridge for 10 minutes. This will give the chocolate time to set.
Repeat until you’ve covered all the egg filling balls in chocolate.

, When the chocolate has set on the eggs, remove them from the fridge and pull them out of the potato. Carefully remove the toothpicks.

Use a small spoon to drizzle a bit of melted chocolate into the hole where the toothpick was.
Place the eggs on the baking sheet and return them to the fridge. Let them chill for about two hours before serving."

So no one except the people who baked each food knows who baked what, you know, so it's fair, use more paper to make labels with numbers and put them in front of each food. Then, the people can write down numbers.

, But try not to have anyone see who writes what.

, Then, announce the winner. It doesn't matter if it is a tie, because you should make sure that all participants in the party get a prize so no one feels bad. But the winners get credit. Give them the same prize so no one feels jealous.

Food processor
Large mixing bowl
Mixing spoon
Parchment-lined baking sheet
Cookie dough scoop, coffee scoop, or ice cream scoop
Lollipop sticks or paper straws
Three small glass bowls

, Place two-inch (5-cm) cubes of cake into the food processor and pulse until the cake is broken up into fine crumbs. Transfer the crumbs to a mixing bowl. Add a dollop of frosting and stir to completely combine the cake and frosting. Stir in another dollop of frosting as necessary, until the dough becomes the consistency of clay.If you don’t have a food processor, place the chunks of cake into a mixing bowl and mash them with a fork or break them up with your hands.

, Transfer the dough to an airtight container and transfer it to the fridge to chill overnight. This will make the dough easier to work with and form into cake balls.If you don’t have that much time, place the cake dough into a container and transfer it to the freezer for about an hour.

, When the dough has had time to chill, remove it from the fridge or freezer. Use your cookie dough scoop to portion out a scoop of dough. Roll the dough around between your hands to work it into an egg shape. Transfer the cake egg to the baking sheet.

Repeat with the remaining dough until you have formed all the cake into cake eggs.
Set the eggs aside for about 30 minutes and allow them to warm to room temperature., Transfer each color of candy melt to a separate glass bowl. Fill three saucepans with an inch (2.5 cm) of water and place the glass bowls on top. Heat each saucepan over medium heat, stirring regularly, until the melts have melted. Turn the heat on all the saucepans to low to keep the melts liquid.

Alternatively, you can also melt the candy melts in the microwave. Heat the candy melts in the microwave in 30-second bursts, stirring in between, until the candy melts have completely melted.
The microwave method is faster, but the candy melts will start to harden faster, and you'll have to work quickly.

, To turn your cake eggs into cake pop eggs, insert the final half-inch (1.3 cm) of a lollipop stick into the yellow candy melt colors. Then insert that end into the fat end of the egg, pushing it about halfway into the egg.Push the opposite end of the lollipop stick into a piece of Styrofoam or a cake pop stand.
Repeat until all the cake eggs have sticks inserted.

, Take each cake pop egg and dip the entire ball of cake into the blue candy melt. Pull the cake pop out at a 45-degree angle, twist it 90-degrees, and tap the stick against the side of the bowl to remove excess.

Set the cake pops back into their places in the Styrofoam or cake pop stand and transfer them to the fridge for five minutes to set.
If you want to mix up the order of the egg coloring, don’t dip all the cake eggs into the blue. Dip one-third into the blue, one-third into the pink, and one third into the yellow.

, When the blue candy melt has set, remove the cake pops from the fridge. Now dip the top two-thirds of each cake pop into the pink candy melt. Pull the cake pop out at an angle, twist it, and tap it to remove excess.

When you’ve dipped all the pops into the pink, transfer them to the fridge again to set for another five minutes.
If you divided the base color of your cake pops, make sure you dip each set of cake pops into a different color this time.

, Finally, dip the top third of each cake pop into the yellow. When you’ve removed the excess, return the cake pops to the fridge and let them set for another five minutes before serving.

For divided cake pop colors, dip each cake pop into the color you haven't yet decorated it with.

If your party has a theme, work with it.,
Account for your audience.,
Plan on a budget.,
Plan your contents.,
Choose and fill your bag.",How to Put Together a Goodie Bag1," Are you having a pirate-themed party? A Christmas party? A black and white party? Whatever it is, start thinking about your goodie bag in terms of your party's theme. How does it fit in with the rest of your shindig?


Think about when you're planning on giving out your goodie bag. If it's toward the end, you could include things that will remind your guests of the good time they had. Or you could leave room in the bag for them to insert a few things from the party that they enjoyed (crafts, candies, decorations, etc.).;
, If the recipients are 10 year old boys, you probably don't want to fill those bags up with inkwell pens and small bottles of Courvoisier. And if your audience is a group of middle-aged women, you're not gonna be giving them bags full of beef jerky and Pokémon cards (and hopefully not having a jerky-themed, Pokémon party). What would your audience enjoy?


The younger your audience, the more you should shy away from things that will be messed with for 5 seconds, broken, and then shoved in a drawer. You'd be better off with mostly candies or things that can actually be used, like pens or hair barrettes.

, If you are inviting 10 people, you can afford to splash out more than if you are inviting 30. These goodie bags are out of the kindness of your heart, so don't feel pressure to break the bank on them. How much money would you like to spend? Once you pick that number (and stick to it!), the contents will fall into place.


A few dollars per bag is plenty. You want to aim for a number of filler items and just a few tokens that have actual value.

, Most goodie bags contain food or candy and tiny knick-knacks such as small toys, pencils, and stickers -- probably 3 to 5 of each. For example, if you were going with the pirate theme, you could include a shop-bought eye patch, some fake gold pirate's booty, and some themed sweets. You could even make homemade ones to save on the expense and make it even more personal.


You could also use tissue paper or pretty cellophane grass (the basket filler stuff) to give your bags some volume. Not all of it has to be gifts!
Throw in some tootsie rolls, mints, tiny chocolates, or other pre-wrapped candies you can buy in bulk to add to the goodie bag while cutting down on your expenses.
Visit your local dollar store to get to stuffing your bags on the cheap!

, Adults will be content with a basic gift bag, but children may prefer a more sophisticated bag with splotches of color or with themed designs. Anything from a cellophane gift bag to ironed tissue paper tied with a ribbon will look perfect.


Consider adding ribbon, string, or a bow to add more flair to your bag -- or to add a way to tie on a tag where you can write the recipient's name. The more personalized it is, the more your guest will be touched!

"
"
Choose your bag template.,
Add some edibles.,
Stash a souvenir.,
Get to pampering.,
Be your guests' tour guide.,
Make it personal.,
Include a thank you.",How to Put Together a Goodie Bag2," As a general rule of thumb, you have three standard choices: the gift bag, the tote, or the box. With technology nowadays, they're all good contenders -- anything can be personalized, jazzed up, and made impressive. It's just a matter of taste!


The only real thing to take into consideration is that your goodie bag should match your theme. Get creative! Are you at the beach? Use a pail! Does your wedding have a vintage-y feel? Use an antique-y box. Stay consistent -- this goodie bag is one of the first things you have at your disposal to set the tone.

, Because everyone loves food -- especially if they just got in from a long trip full of peanuts and sips of watered-down coffee. Little munchies are best, and they're even better if they're from the area the wedding is taking place or your hometown. Get local! What springs to mind when you think of where you are?


Whatever isn't available in the minibar is good -- fresh fruit is a great, cheap addition. But sweets are also always, always, always welcome. Think granola bars, chocolate, or even homemade baked goods!

, You want something you can give your guests that they can remember forever. What's more perfect than a souvenir? Not necessarily of your wedding, but of the entire trip your guests are making. If you're having it in your hometown, have it be along the lines of your wedding's theme. If you're having a destination wedding, have it be indicative of the destination. In Paris? A little Eiffel Tower. In Texas? A star, of course.


If you have a few children in attendance, you may want to opt for a toy trinket in lieu of a souvenir -- or in addition to! A mini plane, yo-yo, just a simple gadget that says you're thinking of the entire family.

, This is a long weekend for your guests, too. They're exhausted from the traveling and mingling and probably staying up all night. Have some sort of ""recovery"" aid in your goodie bag for your guests that are going to greet the sunrise. Here are some ideas:


Advil/Tylenol
A sleep mask
Lotion/bath salts/soap, etc.
Water/coffee/juice or other morning goodies

, Your guests who have traveled all the way here are probably looking to do more than just attend your wedding. Get them going on their excuse-for-a-vacation by offering them some things in their goodie bag that will make their trip that much easier. Here's a list to get you thinking:


A map (with dots or stickers indicating places to check out)
An itinerary for the wedding weekend
Disposable camera
Coupons
Postcard
Brochures
List of local gems (with reviews)

, At the end of the day, this is your wedding -- not some corporate event you're sponsoring. So get to personalizing your welcome bags! Get the outside of your tote designed, have water bottle labels made, and start scouring the Internet for labels for your goodies.


If it's something they can keep forever, try to avoid having something like ""CHAN AND JAN 4EVER"" plastered on the side. Stick to a symbol and the date, maybe your initials, when you're dealing with the tote or the box -- something that's utilitarian in the future. You don't want them to throw it out in two weeks, you know?

, Because without your guests, your wedding would not go how you want it to go. They've spent money and time making sure your day is special, so thank them! Include a nice little note in the bag saying how much you appreciate that they're there.

"
"
Have the basics set up well in advance.,
Contact related companies for samples.,
Put your brand on the bag.,
Plan the contents.",How to Put Together a Goodie Bag3," You probably have months notice when it comes to this event, so start early. What's your budget? How many recipients will there be? What does the boss have in mind? You're putting together quite a few pieces -- sometimes these things take time, so leave yourself some wiggle room to avoid missing the deadline.


Do you know the demographic you're dealing with? Men and women, young and old, will enjoy different things. What do you know about who you're working for?

, If you're having a convention or holding any sort of event, you'll want to contact companies that sell products related to the topic at hand. There are things to consider here:


Contact companies that have offers of free samples on their website. You may only be able to get your hands on a few, but who said the goodie bags had to all be the same?
Email companies asking for free samples. It's marketing! They do it all the time. Tell them how many people you have (that could be potential clients), what and when your event is, and what kind of samples you're looking for. Just give them enough advanced notice!

, While you may be proffering other companies' goods, you want your own name to be seen, too. Have your company's name on the goodie bag itself so everyone knows where these free gifts are coming from. You're trying to bank brownie points here, not just promote other companies.


Pick out your bag after you know what the contents are -- you want neither a bag that's empty nor a bag that's overflowing. And if the bag doesn't have your company's name on it, put it on there. A tag, a sticker, heck, paint it on there if you have to. It's a goodie bag and it's art! Impressive.

, You've contacted your companies, you have the goods from the ones who actually responded, now what? You'll need to throw in a few pens, maybe a notepad or a key chain, but is that enough? Nope! Just because your goodie bag is for business doesn't mean you can't make it fun, too.


Don't be afraid to add in some decorative things and some food, too. If your company has a color scheme, add in a few tokens that match. And as for food, some pre-wrapped candies or mints will go along away -- and they're usually pretty cheap.

Select classic or seasonal beverages.,

Post recommended recipes at the station.,
Provide different types of alcohol.,
Always offer a non-alcoholic beverage option.,
Label everything clearly.,
Provide the appropriate serving equipment.,
Include measuring equipment.,
Ensure the proper temperature.,
Use equipment that will make self-service easier.,
Tell guests about the station upon arrival.,
Clean the station periodically.,
Check the stock periodically.",How to Set Up a DIY Drink Station at a Party," If you already have a classic or custom type of drink in mind, go for it. However, if you’re wondering what types of drinks to feature at your party, the season can be great source of inspiration. Maybe you want to make hot buttered cider for a winter dinner party. On the other hand, maybe you’re hosting a summer lawn party, and want to set up a DIY lemonade station.


Be sure to choose something that will allow for you and your guests' creativity. Following the lemonade example, your station could feature freshly juiced lemonade, some other juices or flavored seltzer waters to add, and garnishing like fresh berries, mint leaves, and lavender petals.;
, This includes both liquid ingredients as well as add-ins. Once you’ve selected the type of drink station you want to set up, think about all of the specific ingredients you want to provide. Look online for further information, by searching for different recipes of the drink you’re thinking about.


Don’t forget about fruit and fresh herbs, as they can add visual appeal and the aroma they offer can make a great drink even better.
Note that many different types of drinks can be made with or without alcohol. Allowing your guests to make that choice themselves ensures that their drinks are just what they were hoping for.

, Many drink recipes call for specific ingredients to be juiced or cut into sizes appropriate for garnishing. For instance, many cocktails call for lime juice and/or a lime slice. Be sure prepare any ingredients that require dangerous or significant preparation beforehand.Be sure to prepare enough! It's best to avoid using knives or blenders during a party.
Whenever you’re using a recipe that calls for juice of any type, consider juicing fresh fruits the day of the party for the best flavor.

, So, you’ve decided on a Bloody Mary bar. You plan to offer a few different types of tomato juice and pre-made Bloody Mary mixes, a few different types of liquor, a plethora of vegetables and other add-ins, and a fridge door’s worth of different hot sauce. Your guests have plenty to work with and will undoubtedly wind up making some great drinks. That said, some guests may appreciate a bit of guidance.For instance, write down your recommended recipe and make a sign that says something like “Sarah’s Sassy Bloody Maria: 2 oz tequila, 2 stalks of pickled asparagus, 2 pearl onions, in a glass rimmed with powdered beef jerky and filled to the brim with McClure’s Bloody Mary Mix.”

, Even if you specify a classic cocktail drink station, you’ll want to offer some variety in terms of the main ingredient. For instance, maybe you’ll focus on offering specialty ingredients for the finest martinis in town, with a few choice bottles of vodka and gin in particular. You might as well put out a bottle of bourbon and another of tequila as well.Don’t forget liquors. Depending on the types of drink you want to offer, vermouths and certain cordials will be vital. Bitters are great too, and come in all sorts of flavors.
Further, not everyone who drinks alcohol likes to drink liquor. If you want to make sure there are options for everyone, it’s worth putting out an ice bucket with some beers and a bottle of champagne.

, Even when you’re hosting an adult party and expect the booze to be flowing, you should always make sure guests can find a non-alcoholic option when they’re ready to slow down for the evening. If nothing else, a water pitcher is always a good idea.Another great option to set out is carbonated water. Many people enjoy drinking sparkling water on its own, while others will likely use to it spritz drinks of all sorts.

, Whatever you use to hold your different ingredients, make sure they’re labeled clearly and correctly. This is important for several reasons, including notifying those who may be allergic to certain items. If you’re using squeeze bottles, simply add a piece of masking tape and write the contents on the tape in permanent marker.If you have bowls of a bunch of dry ingredients, especially spices, make mini signs you can attach to toothpicks or skewers and stick into the bowl as well.

, Several factors should be considered to determine what type of cups or glassware you’ll want to set out at your drink station. For instance, if you’ve made a large batch of hot chocolate, you’ll likely want to keep it in a vessel that will preserve its warmth. A ladle can then be used to dole out single portions into mugs, and guests can add liqueur, marshmallows, etc. as they wish.


Aside from temperature, other factors to consider are the age of your guests. For instance, if children will be using the drink station, you may want to use plastic cups and utensils.

, Especially if your drink station will include alcohol, it’s important to provide something to help people determine portions of certain ingredients. For instance, put out a shot glass or tablespoon and mention it specifically in your posted recipes. For instance, “Start with 1 shot glass of whichever liquor you have…”, One of the most important components of a drink station is making sure the drinks you offer can be made at the proper temperature. Most of the time, this will simply mean providing lots of ice. An ice bucket can work, but a cooler with a scoop is even better. Be sure to have some backup ice in your freezer too.On the other hand, you may need to keep drinks warm. In this case, keep the base liquid - such as hot apple cider - in a crock pot. Turn the crock pot on and set it to ""low"" or ""keep warm.""

, One of the most common types of containers that bartenders use, for instance, are squeeze bottles. These soft plastic bottles with conical spouts can help facilitate easy drink mixing. Further, the top on a squeeze bottle can stay on throughout the party, reducing the risk of spills and protecting each ingredient from contamination.Use squeeze bottles to hold popular, common ingredients like lime juice or simple syrup.
Other equipment that can make self-service simpler includes items like stirring utensils and drink strainers.
Don't forget a scoop for the ice, and a container to hold the scoop when it isn't being used.

, As guests arrive, be sure to point out both the location and theme of the drink station. Even better, let guests know about your plans to have a drink station when you invite them, and encourage them to bring whatever ingredients they may favor as well.


For instance, include something in your invitation along the lines of, “We’ll have a make-your-own-mojito station set up with the necessities, but feel free to bring your own secret ingredients to share.”

, Throughout the party, try to keep an eye on the station or ask someone to help you do so. Most importantly, you’ll want to swing through and tidy up from every hour or so. In particular, make sure to wipe up any spills each time you check the station.


Make sure napkins or paper towel are still in good supply during each check.
Be sure to have clearly labeled trash cans and recycling containers nearby for guests’ use.

, There are a few things you need to make sure your drink station has throughout the party. Keep a close eye on your base ingredients and main additions, especially if people seem to be enjoying a particular offering. Have backups of everything you don’t want to run out of ready to serve.Make sure that no one over-serves themselves. One good way to do this is by only putting out a certain amount of booze at a time. Each time you check the station, you can provide more as needed.
You likely already have back up ice and extra sliced limes. There are other items you may need to replenish as well. During planning, think about everything you may need more of - such as cups and silverware - and have back ups ready.

Use candles for an intimate dinner party. If this is an occasion with just a few people that will take place at night, keep the lights low.
Plan on lanterns or solar lights for parties that you are hosting outdoors.
Expect to use many different kinds of lighting if you are planning a large party, such as a wedding reception. You will need lights for the dance floor and the dinner tables.;
, This will depend on what kind of lighting you need.


Buy items such as candles, hanging strings of lights, lanterns and chandeliers.
Rent equipment that is too expensive to buy or will be used just for this party. Examples include gobos, strobe lights or spotlights.

, If you have major lighting to set up that has been rented from a company, that company will probably want to install it themselves.


Give the installers enough time to get the lighting set up and tested before your party begins. Leave some extra time for troubleshooting and repairs.

, Places where guests will eat, drink and mingle should have enough lighting that people can see what they are doing.


Illuminate any walkways if the party is outside at night.
Keep lights on in the bathroom so your guests know where to go, and do not have to fumble for a light switch. Use a nightlight if you do not want to keep the overhead light on.

, If your party is in a formal ballroom or a rented hall, make sure any interesting lighting is used such as a chandelier or sconces on the walls. If your party is in your home and you have a view of a city skyline, keep the drapes open and the nighttime lights exposed.

, Test all of your light fixtures and accents before the party starts. Do this at least 2 hours before your guests arrive so you have time to make adjustments or replace bulbs.

, Find out, for instance if they like sea turtles; get some sea turtle napkins, and paper plates. Maybe play pin the tail on the turtle? Or custom make a turtle cake.

, It's good to set a date with everyone you're inviting beforehand. That way they can check to see if they can go, and be able to make sure that they can go and set the date in stone.

, A couple hours before they get back home, invite the friends over. Have them help you decorate their house with you. Set things up, and maybe if they can bring a few extra things or props.

, No party is good without some chips, soda, cake and music! You should find out their favorite song to play when they walk in too.

, Just be casual and when you see them come in tell everyone to hide, and make sure one person is in charge of playing the music when they walk in.

, It should be really fun. You could even have a sleep over at their house, or invite everyone over to your own.

Purchase enough tiles to make 1 set of 4 coasters for each recipient.;
,


Select a decorative paper stock at your art supply store. Look for paper that matches your party theme.
Purchase a clear craft glue. The glue should be viscous enough to brush onto a surface.
Shop for pre-cut felt squares. This fabric will cover the back surface of each tile coaster to prevent furniture scratches. Purchase enough felt to adhere onto the backs of each tile square.
Buy a bottle of clear spray-paint to act as a protective finish for the top of each tile.

, Using either soap and water or a paper towel soaked in alcohol, remove all dust and fingerprints from each tile. This ensures the image will adhere to the surface. Allow each tile to dry completely before proceeding.

Congrats!",How to Plan an April Showers Themed Party," Preparation is key when planning your precipitation themed party! Start at least 1 month before your event so you're not rushing at the last minute.;
, When deciding when you want your party, keep your guests in mind. This doesn't mean planning your entire event around one person, but in general, try to be considerate about other people's plans.

, Whether you're hosting the event at your home, a friend's house, or renting a space, make sure you have enough room for all your guests. Also, if you're having the party at a rented space, ask the employees if you can hang things like signs and décor.

, The amount of guests you have all depends on the size of your soiree. If you want a small get-together, 5-10 people is appropriate. However, if it's a larger party, you should expand the list to 10 or more. Just make sure its filled with people you enjoy and that there's enough food and room to keep everyone happy!

, Your guests first impression is very important, so be sure to make the invites interesting by incorporating whimsical aspects like umbrellas, rain boots, and puffy little clouds. Also, include the date, time, location, dress code, and an RSVP. There are several websites such as Shutterfly and TinyPrints where you can make your own custom invitations. If you prefer to make them yourself you can create great looking cards on Microsoft Publisher. However, if you choose to do this avoid using plain printer paper (it looks cheap) and use proper cardstock instead.

, This is the best part of any party! Music is essential for getting everyone dancing, laughing, and having a good time. If you want to blend rain into the music, throw in some shower focused songs here and there. Be sure to sprinkle, not downpour these tunes throughout the night or the novelty will get old.


Here are some suggestions:

Rain- The Beatles
Sunday Morning- Maroon 5
Purple Rain- Prince
Coming Clean- Hillary Duff
Brown Eyed Girl- Jimmy Buffet
It's Raining Men- The Weather Girls
Umbrella- Rihanna



, Ok, THIS is the best part of any party. Make sure you have MORE than enough food for everyone. The rule of thumb is you want people to be able to walk away with leftovers. Some great themed food items are cloud cupcakes and umbrella-shaped cookies. After baking the cupcakes, freeze them. This way, you won't have to worry about making them on the day of your party and you can simply whip-up the frosting. For non-desserts try easy appetizers like lettuce wraps, wings, and fried wontons. Finally, buy the ingredients ahead of time, it will make things easier on the day of the party.

, Drinks are another very important part of your party. To put a dewy-themed spin on your refreshments, make a blue cocktail and top it off with some fresh fruit.*For non-alcoholic options try this recipe for Blue Punch (serves 20).


1 package of unsweetened blueberry drink mix
1 liter (0.3 US gal) bottle of Sprite (or any other lemon-lime flavored soft drink)
1 bottle of cranberry juice
1 cup of white sugar

, décor is crucial in establishing the mood of a party and creating an experience. Here is where your April Showers Party really comes to life. Utilize DIY projects to sprinkle a bit of kitschiness throughout your event. One idea is to fill children's' rain boots with flowers for a table centerpiece. Another is making three dimensional hanging clouds out of wire and polyester filling. The possibilities are endless if you think out of the box (and take advantage of creative ideas on the internet!). For timing, start crafting at least 3-5 days ahead of time. The night before the party, start putting out all the decorations, including setting the table. To avoid dust that may fall overnight, lay down a light tablecloth over the table.

, So today's the big day. Try to wake up relatively early in the morning to give yourself a good start. Begin preparing your food by taking the cupcakes out of the freezer, and a little later on start the icing. You may want to recruit some friends over before the festivities start to help you with the overall set-up. Another thing to remember is parking. Depending on how many people show, you may have to warn your neighbors that there will be more cars than usual on the street. Finally, start the music a little before the guests come over. This will help you get excited and also make it feel like the party has already started when the guests walk in.

, You made it. Remember during the party to relax and have fun. Try not to get bogged down in what might go wrong, enjoy the moment, and have fun!

You can decorate your string lights with flowers and other embellishments.You can set up candles around your party to create soft lighting.You can even set up torches around the space.
Consider lighting a path to and from the party.

, Choose around 3-4 colors to use for your party color scheme. You can use bright, festive colors like pink and orange or darker colors like blue and green. You will want your decorations, tableware, lights, and any other accessories at your party to coordinate with the color scheme., Have tables and chairs set up in your space before the party. You can bring out any tables and chairs you have inside or use outdoor patio furniture. If you don’t have enough tables and chairs, you can rent them from party or event stores. Set up enough chairs for all of your guests.


Alternatively you can lay out blankets and pillows and make your garden party picnic style., Choose table cloths and place settings that match your color scheme. You can use any fabric for a tablecloth by cutting it and hemming it. Coordinate your placemats and table cloth by pulling together one central color in the designs.


You will also want centerpieces for your garden party. You can make elaborate centerpieces or you can do something simple like vases of flowers or flowers in distilled water., No matter how much delicious food, good music, and fun games you have planned, it won’t stop bugs from annoying your guests.

When planning a guest list, make sure that if you are sending out invitations, you politely ask your guests not to discuss the party with others unless they know that they're invited.,

Give you're guests an adequate sense of autonomy..",How to Make Sure Your Party Guests Have a Good Time," Nobody wants to have someone rub it in their face that they weren't invited.;
, Having an every-minute filled party will bore your guests, and when having teens around 12-14, they will become restless and not want to listen.

, Space them out, and if you can, get small prizes for winners. This way, you will give your guests time to mingle and talk, but not enough to get bored. ""Fruit Salad,"" ""Charades,"" and silly dance songs are always good ways of getting people involved.

, Good parties can still throw out couple of snacks, dinner, and some sweets for dessert. Don't set out a table full of chips, candy, pop, etc.

, To branch out on dinner, also try making hot dogs, or putting out hamburgers, and all the toppings. Sandwiches, sausage rolls, a cheese platter, and pasta salad are also good alternatives.

, Most teens do not get enough water, but they'll love flavoured water. Try putting out some bottles of flavoured water and normal spring water, and also try a pitcher of cold water with sliced oranges, limes, and lemons in it. Don't forget some pop, though. You don't need to be everyone's mother and make them all health nuts. To be extra special, make virgin cocktails with fruit juices, pop, and grenadine. Much more civilized.

, Put chips in a bowl, and put paper or plastic cups next to the drinks. Make sure to have food out for when your guests come. Put pop out and iced tea or other snacks first, then after dinner put out water. Also, little bowls of nuts or chocolates are nice nibbles while people are talking.

, Talk to them. If you're too busy organizing things, you a) weren't very prepared and b) your guests will feel pretty ignored and unimportant. Your guests came to your party, not someone else's. They came to see you.

, Say goodbye politely to your guest when the time has come, and walk them to the door or car. Wait until they start to drive before you go back to the party, as just saying ""bye"" and letting them go to the front and walk out alone is pretty rude. If you want to give your guests a thank you gift, try something small and not too pricey. However, some exclusive homemade party favors can truly be the memories which you would cherish for long. You can make your guests happy with these delightful homemade gifts as a send-off presents and the best part is that it won’t cut your pocket as well. You already spent a bit on the rest.

, If you notice someone has been alone all party, talk to them, and introduce them.

, For adults, some old, nostalgic party music as well as a few ""Couples"" songs will get people smiling. For teens, get loud, silly party music that everyone can recognize. Rap and hip-hop doesn't work very well unless you've got a very large crowd of die-hard dancers. I know its corny, but the YMCA, Hokey Pokey, Macarena, and Footloose get people on the dance floor.

, Especially some of the quiet ones or look like they need to wake up. Get one of them to open and pour the wine, or help with other food preparations. Ask someone to be the DJ. You don't have to do all the work yourself when others will love to be able to help!

, That's how the party will go on. Make sure you have fun, too, with your guests, and your party will be a memorable one.

, It's okay to set up some guidelines, but your guests won't appreciate it if you limit the tacos they can eat! Set up limits, but don't make them too easy to reach.

",How to Make a Personalized Tile2," Trim the image with scissors or a craft knife so that the paper edges are at least .25 inch (.635 cm) away from the tile's edges.

, This prevents tiles from sticking to the table after you apply glue.

,, Press firmly on the paper with your thumbs, beginning in the center and working your way to the edges.

, Work fast since craft glue dries rapidly.


Ensure the edges are completely tacked down or the image will not adhere.

, Allow the glue to dry at least 15 minutes.

, Brushing in one direction only, paint around the edges and along the sides of the tile.


Use the softest paintbrush you can find. Your brushstrokes will appear when the glue dries.

, Add another layer, but paint it on using brush strokes in the opposite direction. This gives a textured appearance on the surface.


Reapply another coating after each previous layer dries. The amount of layers depends on your personal preference; more layers will create a heavier, textured effect.
Wait for your craft glue coating to dry. Check the bottle for drying times.

, Spray a light coat of clear finish over each tile. Allow to dry based on the product's drying times.

, Measure the felt so each piece covers the back of a tile.


Apply the felt to the back of each tile using glue from a hot glue gun.
Place each tile upside down. Wait until dry before handling.

Talk to your friends, and see who is interested in helping. This will make things a lot easier on you. Consider the following:


Who has what responsibilities. Try to spread the responsibilities out based on who is good at doing what.
Who gets the cash. If it’s your home, you should probably get the largest cut of the cash. Consider this and talk to your friends ahead of time so everyone knows what they’re going to get out of the whole affair.
Who has money and other supplies to bring to the table. You might want to include a friend who has a band or a good sound system in the party planning. Also consider people who have party planning experience and might have kegs or other important supplies.
If you've got roommates, consider asking them to share the responsibilities of holding a ""rent party."" Then, you'll all work toward the common goal of making enough money for rent that month.;
, With house parties, location is everything. After all, the main function of the event is to gather a lot of people. You’ll need to consider a few things to make sure you’ve got a good location:


How big is your house? Do you have enough space for the number of guests you’ll be entertaining.
Do you have an appropriate “main party” area. This could be a basement, a large living room, or a back yard.
Do you have the permission of other relevant individuals (family, roommates, landlords) to have a large party at your home., While the home is the most important part of throwing a house party, there are a number of important accessories that will help make your party. Remember, your party is all about making sure your guests are occupied and entertained. You don’t want anyone being bored or leaving. A boring party that lacks proper accessories could undermine your ability to have other parties later.


A good stereo system. You’ll need a system that can fill your home or backyard with sound. Don’t go overboard, though. You don’t want your neighbors calling the cops and you don’t want to completely drown out conversation.
A beer pong table and cups. Beer pong is one of the best ways to entertain your guests. Make sure you have all of the appropriate supplies.
A poke table, cards, and chips, for more sophisticated crowds.
A pool table or some trivia games.
The money to buy or rent a beer keg and other alcohol. You won’t make any money if people have to bring their own alcohol. Because of this, you’ll want to make sure you have the money to pay for alcohol in advance of the party., Figuring out how many people you can accommodate is extremely important in the whole planning process. You don’t want to go ahead and plan a party for 500 people if your house and backyard can really only accommodate 100. Consider:


Seating. A small portion of people will be sitting at any given time. So don’t plan for more than 20% of your guests to be sitting at a given moment.
Parking. Parking is extremely important, as most of your guests will probably arrive by car. Make sure you’ve got enough parking for the number of people you plan on hosting.
Space. Take stock of the sorts of rooms and outside space you have to entertain. Can you fit 20 people comfortably into a living room? How many people can be standing around your pool in your backyard?, Before you move forward, you need to put together a preliminary budget and make sure you have the money to lay down in advance of the party. Don’t cheap out here. You have to have all of the supplies to entertain your guests, especially if they’re going to be paying to get you’re your party. Consider paying for:


Alcohol.
Renting equipment (kegs, a sound system, or more).
Contingency money if anything is broken at your home. This might just come out of your profits.

, Let your neighbors know that you’ll be throwing a big party. Having your neighbors on board, or at least in the know, will make your party experience much better and will eliminate a few potential problems. Ask them:


If there is a particular weekend that would be better for them.
If they’re also planning on having an event on the weekend you’re planning on.
If they’d like to come and join the party., When planning a party, you might get wrapped up with the big things like booking a band or picking a beer selection and easily forget about small things that will make your party a seamless experience for everyone. Don’t forget about things that seem small, but are critical. Remember to:


Provide plenty of garbage cans.
Have lots of coolers with ice.
Provide ashtrays for cigarette butts., Before you hold your party, make sure you know local ordinances when it comes to noise. After all, you don’t want to get shut down by the cops for having your music too loud. Consider the following:


Know if there are ordinances that restrict noise levels on certain days and times in residential neighborhoods.
Communication with your neighbors is key. Even if there are ordinances, you’ll most likely be able to party on if you talk to your neighbors ahead of time and let them know what you’re doing. The best bet is to promise to turn the music down at midnight, and disperse the party by 2 A.M.
Invite your neighbors as a way of heading off alienating. They might even want to contribute.
Call your local police department to see if there have been any noise-related disturbances reported recently., Advertising will be key to having a large party that makes you some profit. After all, you want to maximize your profit and get as many people as you can fit into your house at one time. There are a number of ways to get the word out about your house party:


Social media. Consider social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat to get the word out. Create an event page, and invite all of your friends and have them invite all of your friends. Make sure you include specifics and warn people that you’ll be charging.
Word of mouth. Tell all of your friends and have them tell their friends. Talk to people in your classes and at work and invite them. Tell everyone that they are welcome to bring as many friends as they want.
Flyers. Put up some flyers around campus or in your community advertising your party. Be careful with this though, as you might have some people come and try to take advantage of you or your guests., After you’ve made sure you have a good house and other supplies and advertised, you’ll need to prep your space. You need to make sure that the house is ready for your party and that spaces you want closed off are indeed closed off, and spaces you want people to hang out in are inviting.


Remove valuables that can be easily stolen and lock them in a closed off bedroom.
Move furniture out of the way in larger rooms so that people can walk around.
Find some extra chairs and make sure you’ve got enough seating for your 20%.
Setup a bar and snack area. If you can, do this in at least two different locations so you don’t have everyone hanging around one area., In order to have a really good party, you’ve got to make sure that the cops don’t shut your party down because of underage drinking. Because of this, you need to take precautions to avoid supplying alcohol to underage guests. This doesn’t mean you have to exclude people under 21, just don’t supply alcohol to them.


Make sure you know the laws in your area.
Don’t supply alcohol to minors.
Post signs that say no underage drinking., At house parties, entertainment and music is key. You need to make sure your guests are entertained and are entertained with quality music that they’re into. Hiring a band or a DJ might be something that makes your party more appealing to people who are on the fence about coming.


Consider hiring a local band that people around your town know and love. This might lure people to the party.
Get a friend to have their band play. It doesn’t have to be for the whole time, but just for an hour or less.
Find a DJ or a friend who enjoys playing DJ. This way, you’ll have someone dedicated to making sure the music is spot on for your guests., If you’re planning on having a large party with people you don’t know, you should consider hiring someone to manage security at your home. Most of the time, just the presence of an intimidating person in a “security” shirt might ward off potential problems., The best house parties are parties where people don’t just get trashed, but enjoy drinking drinks that they like in a fun atmosphere. To achieve this, make sure you supply drinks people actually want to drink. Consider the following:


Prepare a signature mixed drink. This might even be hunch punch.
Supply jello shots.
Pick a solid middle-of-the-road beer that everyone will like. If you want, you can pair a solid beer keg with a really cheap one and give people the choice., One way of raising money for your party might be to invite investors beforehand by using crowd sourcing websites like Kickstarter and Crowdtilt. This way, you can get people to either donate or invest funds before you've even had the party. This will help reduce the amount of your own money you will need to use to buy party supplies and secure entertainment.


Ask people to contribute as a ""donation"" via crowd sourcing.
Ask people to contribute as investors via crowd sourcing. You can pay back upfront investments later with funds obtained at the party.
Ask people to sponsor a specific aspect of the party, like hiring a band or buying a keg.

, Consider holding a couple raffles with the winning prize being a good bottle of liquor. This is one way to get people to pay you a little money for the hopes of a huge reward. It might also add excitement and entertainment value to your party, as you could market it to your guests as a main event.


If you’ve got a DJ, have them announce the raffle and then announce the winner.
Take a bottle of Grey Goose and try to sell 100 tickets for $1 each. The balance between cost and the tickets you sell is your profit.
Check with local laws about raffling alcohol., If you’ve got a DJ, a band, or are just playing songs yourself, consider getting your guests to pay for requests. You could ask them to pay as little as $1 a song. Over the course of a 3 or 4 hour party, you could potentially make some decent money just off of song requests.

, Make sure all of your party supplies – snacks and alcohol – are purchased as inexpensively as you can. Don’t settle for the closest liquor store or supermarket. Actively seek out places where you can buy your supplies for little money.


If you’re in a city, county, or state, that levies high taxes on alcohol, consider traveling to a nearby/neighboring place that has lower taxes. This could be substantial depending on where you are.
Call suppliers. If you’re planning a party for 300 people, chances are you’ll need a few kegs. Call suppliers and liquor stores and try to get the lowest prices.
Buy cheap, but don’t cheap out. Don’t buy the cheapest brand of beer and liquor. Some people won’t like it, and won’t come back next time. Instead, find a “middle” beer/liquor that appeals to the most people possible., Charging for admission, at the door, is one of the easiest ways to make your party pay. However, there are a few pitfalls in this approach. The likelihood is that people will be coming and going in and out of your house and backyard all night. You can’t really expect to stop them each time they go in and out. Consider:


Giving out wristbands to people who have paid. This way, you’ll be able to identify people who have paid and people who have not.
Making sure alcohol is supervised. If you’ve given out wristbands, and you’ve got someone pouring drinks, you’ll easily be able to stop people from freeloading off of your liquor who have not paid. This approach also has the added bonus of weeding out underage drinkers.
Providing food in addition to alcohol and other drinks. If you charge for admission, make sure that admission is worth it (otherwise people won’t pay). Relatively inexpensive hotdogs and hamburgers could go a long way in enticing people to pay up to get in.
Know the laws in your area. Charging for admission to a house party might create liability for yourself., Let your friends and other guests know that the goal of the party is to raise money for your rent that month. This is a good way to getting people to volunteer donations, as they'll not just be funding their own fun for the night, but they'll be helping you out in general.


Pass around a jug or bowl at the party for donations.
Ask friends to chip in whatever they can for the cost of the party.
Make sure that the party is worth it, as some of your friends might be in hard times of their own, and won't take kindly to be asked for money if you have not supplied alcohol, food, and entertainment.

, Charging for alcohol is at house parties is illegal in many places in the United States unless you have a license that allows you to do so. One way around this (in many areas) is to ask for donations for alcohol. This has advantages and disadvantages. It will help you with some people might not want to pay for a party they might not stay at. However, you’ll also run into people who won’t want to donate, and you could lose money.


Know the laws in your area.
People might circumvent you and bring their own alcohol – then you won’t make any money.
You’ll need someone always standing by the alcohol to collect donation money., One way to try to turn a profit from your house party is to hold a tournament and charge for playing. Entice your guests with a substantial prize, like a bottle of liquor or tickets to a concert if they win. Whatever money is left after you pay for the prize will be profit. Consider:


Beer pong.
Poker.
Pool.
Trivia., Perhaps most importantly, your party should be a good time for you and your guests. While profit might be your priority, why have a party if you’re not going to have fun? Enjoy the part, enjoy the moment, and enjoy the fact that you are making all of this fun possible for other people. And in the end, your party might help pay your rent next month!"

However, if you want to do makeup and style your hair, you will need as much time as you can get. If you’re on a time crunch, try to do some things ahead of time. For example:


Plan your outfit the day before.
Do your hair before you go to work or school.
If you dye your hair, touch up your roots a few days in advance.;
, A large part of looking great is being clean. While you shower, complete any other grooming activities, such as shaving your legs, exfoliating your skin, or touching up your roots with hair dye. Remember to apply deodorant after showering. Other shower grooming activities include:


Conditioning your hair to give it a silky shine
Taking a bath to help you relax for the party
Scrubbing your skin with a loofah to rub away dead skin

, After showering, cover your skin with moisturizer to make your skin glow and repair any damaged skin cells. This step is especially important if you like taking hot showers or if you have recently exfoliated your skin. Additionally, wait thirty minutes after moisturizing to apply any makeup or it may slide off.


If you’ve shaved your legs, moisturize with baby oil to give them a glamorous shine.If your face is oily, use a special moisturizer for acne-prone skin.
For special occasions, consider using a tinted or shimmering moisturizer.

, If you have long hair, you may need to blow dry it before styling it. If you have short hair, you can let it air dry. If you don’t know how to style your hair, there are many helpful YouTube videos that will teach you how. Alternatively, if you’re attending an especially formal event, consider getting your hair styled professionally.


To straighten your hair, you will need a blow dryer, a brush, a straightening iron, and soft styling spray.
If you want to curl your hair, you will need curlers or a curling iron and some setting hairspray.
Men can style their hair with pomade or gel for a finished look.

, If you’re planning on wearing makeup, apply it after your hair is styled. When doing your makeup, apply the foundation first, seal it with a layer of powder, and then add any enhancements such as blush or mascara. You can also enhance particular features on your face. For example:


To highlight your eyes, wear liquid eyeliner.
If you want to enhance your lips, wear a bold lipstick.
To emphasize smooth skin, wear a high-quality foundation., Everyone looks better with clean nails. If you want to keep it simple, clean the dirt from under your nails with soap and water. Next, trim your nails and file the sharp edge off the ends. If you like using nail polish, choose a bold color that will compliment your makeup and outfit.


You can paint your nails at home or visit a nail salon.

, If you’re attending a formal party, the invitation will tell you what attire is appropriate. Additionally, the attire of the party will vary based on the location. For example, if you’re attending an outdoor party, you may need to bring a coat in cold weather. Other examples include:


Bringing a swim suit and a towel to a pool party
Wearing a formal dress to a black-tie event

Choosing nice slacks and a button-up shirt to wear to a business casual event

Wearing a fashionable outfit to a party with friends, Depending on your body type, you may look best in certain kinds of clothing. For example, women with an hourglass figure should wear clothing that cinches in at the waist.


Women with a pear body shape should accentuate their upper bodies with flowing tops.
Men with an inverted triangle body shape should wear tailored clothing that shows off their shoulders.
Women with a rectangle body shape should wear heels and short skirts to accentuate their legs.

, The colors in your skin tone will determine what colors you look good wearing. There are three basic skin tone groups: cool, warm, and neutral. First, look at the veins in your arm. If they appear blue, you have a cool skin tone. If they appear green, you have a warm skin tone. If they seem to be some color in between, you may have a neutral skin tone.Cool skin tones can wear cooler toned blue, greens, silver, and purple well.
Warm skin tones look best in earthy colors such as brown, deep yellow, gold, and red.
Neutral skin tones look good in both cool and warm colors.

, Studies show that your outfit can affect your emotional state.Therefore, if you want to have a good time at a party, wear something that makes you feel comfortable and attractive. Avoid wearing anything that makes you feel awkward. Otherwise, you may come across as awkward at the party.


For example, if your shirt rides up every few minutes, it may be hard to wear comfortably at a party.
If your shoes hurt when you try them on, they will only get worse once you get to the party. Instead, choose shoes that are comfortable to stand in.
If the dress you’re wearing is cute but makes you feel weird, wear something else. You won’t look comfortable in your own skin if you wear it.

, If you’re planning on wearing makeup to the party, bring some extra makeup in a small bag for touch-ups. Touch-ups can include fixing smeared mascara, applying powder, reapplying lipstick. Additionally, if you’re attending a pool party, consider bringing enough makeup to reapply everything after swimming. Common “touch up bags” include:


Makeup removal pads
Powder and a powder brush
Mascara
Blotting papers (to remove excess skin oil), If you eat these foods, you risk ruining your shirt or dress for the rest of the night. Additionally, some foods may leave a faint stain on your teeth and lips. Combat these stains by brushing your teeth or rinsing your mouth out with water. Stain-prone foods include:


Dark berries
Coffee
Dark wine
Pasta sauce, Most people find confidence attractive. The more relaxed you are, the more confident and you will look. If you’re having trouble relaxing at a party, try focusing on different things in your environment. This will draw your attention away from yourself and help you relax. For example:


Think about the color of the furniture.
Examine the pictures on the walls.
Force yourself to focus on a conversation."

Turkeys that have been frozen for a long time, have been sitting out in the display for awhile, or have been treated with preservatives won't taste as good or cook as well as fresh, untreated turkeys. Keep these pointers in mind when you're picking one out:


Try to get a fresh turkey from a butcher, rather than from the meat display at the grocery store. Butcher shops tend to have meat that is more fresh.
Look for a turkey that has not been injected with salt. This gives the turkey meat an artificial taste.Pick a turkey large enough for the number of people you're feeding. A small 12-14 pound turkey will feed about 10 people, a medium 15 - 17 pound turkey will feed up to 16, and a large 18-21 pound turkey can feed 20 or more people.;
, If you happen to choose a frozen turkey for your Thanksgiving, it's very important to take it out of the freezer ahead of time to allow the turkey to fully defrost and thaw prior to cooking. It should be thawed in its original wrapping in a deep tray at the bottom of the refrigerator. The wrapping open to allow it to set to room temperature a few hours prior to preparation.

, Remove giblets from the inside cavity. They often come in a little bag that is easily discarded (although some people like to save them for soup and other recipes). You may also find a neck in the cavity; either save it or discard it.

, Afterward, pat dry with a clean dish rag or paper towels. It's important for the turkey to be dry before you put it in the oven; if it's wet, the turkey will steam, and it's skin won't get brown and crispy.

, Prepare the stuffing of your choice - or dressing, as it's called in the southern areas of the United States - and spoon it into the turkey's empty cavity. Fill the cavity completely, then fold the loose flap of skin over the cavity to keep it contained.


Some cooks believe that stuffing a turkey draws moisture from the meat as it cooks, causing the turkey to dry out. There's no need to stuff your turkey if you'd prefer not to.

, Brining is the very simple and inexpensive process of rubbing the bird in a salt solution infused with aromatic herbs, spices, fruits and vegetables. The salting process encourages very deep, cellular moisture penetration, which basically means less drying out during roasting, resulting in a moister bird.


Chefs differ with regard to whether brining a turkey is really necessary. If you love the taste of salty turkey meat, you might want to give it a try; if you'd prefer to avoid eating a lot of salt, your turkey will still come out tasting delicious.
If you bought a Kosher turkey, definitely skip the brining step. Kosher turkeys are treated with salt in the processing facility, so there's no need to brine them twice.

,, Use two sheets of heavy duty aluminum foil. One sheet should go length-wise and the next sheet the other way. Make sure the sheets are large enough to fully wrap over and around the whole entire turkey to form a loose sealed tent to cook in. This keeps in moisture, and doesn't allow the turkey to burn or dry out.

, The average cooking time is 20 minutes per pound of the whole turkey, including the stuffing.

,, Everyone likes their turkey meat to taste a certain way. Here are a few ideas for seasoning the turkey:


If you didn't brine your turkey, you may want to sprinkle the skin with salt and pepper. This step is unnecessary if your turkey has been brined.
Rub the turkey with butter or olive oil for a richer taste and dark brown skin.
Rub ground herbs and spices, such as sage or rosemary, over the turkey.
Place garlic cloves in the turkey's cavity.,,, Open the oven, carefully unfold the foil, and use a turkey baster or a spoon to pour the turkey's juices from the bottom of the roasting pan over the skin of the turkey.

, During the last 30 minutes of cooking, remove the foil over the breast and thighs. The skin will become brown and crispy.

, When you're estimated cooking time is finished (depending on the weight of your turkey), use a meat thermometer to check if the turkey is ready to come out. Place the thermometer in the inside thigh. The turkey is done when the temperature reaches 165 degrees., Tilt the pan so that the juices collect at one end. Lift the turkey and foil from the pan and place it on a large cutting board. Tent the foil over the turkey and let it rest for 30 minutes. This ensures that the turkey will be moist and tender.


While the turkey is resting, use the juices to make gravy.
If you stuffed the turkey, use a spoon to move the stuffing from the turkey to a serving dish.

, Turkeys are carved using the same technique as chickens. Using a sharp knife, carve the meat from the legs, the breasts, and the wings. Place the white meat and the dark meat in separate areas on a platter.


Don't forget to remove the wishbone, so you can make a wish!
Leftover turkey meat is delicious in turkey soup, turkey sandwiches, and turkey casserole.

",How to Cook a Thanksgiving Turkey," Frozen turkeys must be kept frozen until you're ready to use them. A few days before cooking your meal, you can start thawing out the turkey using a poultry-safe method that will prevent the growth and spread of bacteria. You cannot safely thaw turkey at room temperature for more than two hours.To refrigerator thaw the turkey, you will need about 24 hours per five pounds of turkey. Simply place the turkey in the refrigerator a few days before you plan to cook it. Once thawed, the turkey can stay in the fridge for another two days. Make sure you place a protective sheet or plate under the bird to catch any liquid.
If you don’t have as much time, you can also thaw the turkey in cold water, and this will only require about 30 minutes per pound. Place the turkey in a sealable plastic bag and submerge it in cold water. Change the water every 30 minutes. Cook the thawed turkey immediately.;
, To give the brine the best flavor, prepare it three days before you plan to cook the turkey. Then store it in the refrigerator until you're ready to brine the turkey the night before cooking.


In a large saucepan, combine the salt, brown sugar, stock, peppercorns, allspice berries, and ginger. Heat the brine over medium–high heat, stirring occasionally. Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer until the sugar and salt have dissolved.Remove the mixture from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Transfer to a food storage container and refrigerate.
This amount of brine is suitable for a turkey up to 16 pounds.

, The purpose of brining is to make the meat juicier and the skin crispier.The night before you plan to cook the turkey, remove the neck and giblets from the turkey cavity and place the turkey breast-down into a large stockpot.Add the ice water and brine solution to cover the turkey.
If the turkey is floating and not submerged in the brine solution, weigh it down with a plate. Cover the pot with foil or a lid.
Place the pot in the refrigerator for anywhere from 12 to 24 hours. Turn the turkey halfway through the brining process.

, Discard the brine and rinse the turkey inside and out. Move the turkey to a roasting rack and pat it dry.After patting the turkey dry, let it air dry for another hour before cooking it to ensure the crispiest skin possible.
Always make sure you wash your hands, cooking surfaces, and dishes well with hot, soapy water when dealing with raw poultry., If you didn’t brine the turkey and haven't emptied out the neck cavity, do so now. You can either discard the giblets or keep them for making broth or gravy.To find the giblets, you must first locate the head of the turkey. Look at the orientation of the legs, because they will always point toward the back of the bird, meaning the head is opposite.At the head of the bird, there will be a flap of skin that covers the neck cavity, and the giblets will be located in here. Pull up the flap, place your hand in the cavity, and pull out the giblets.
You may also have to remove the neck, which will likely be located in the cavity between the legs at the back of the bird. You may also find a premade gravy pouch in either of the cavities, which you can either use or discard.

, Put the onion, apple, and cinnamon stick into a small saucepan. Cover with the water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Once simmering, allow to boil for five minutes. Remove from the heat, strain the water, and allow to cool enough to handle.You don’t have to boil the aromatics first, but it will help release the flavors of the onion, apple, and cinnamon, which will help to give the turkey some subtle flavors and keep the meat moist.

, Place the strained and cooled onion, apple, and cinnamon stick inside the bird’s large cavity. You can also fill the cavity with other or additional ingredients, such as:


Apple slices
Orange slices
Crushed garlic
Fresh or dried herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, and sage

, This will be rubbed on the skin of the turkey to make it crispy, tasty, and golden brown. In a food processor, whiz together the butter, herbs, salt, and pepper.Using your hands or a basting brush, spread the herb butter all over the turkey’s skin.

, For a turkey that’s under 20 pounds, use the middle rack. For a turkey that’s over 20 pounds, move the rack to the level below. This will ensure that the bird cooks evenly without overcooking or taking too long.You will most likely have to remove additional racks from the oven to make enough room for the roasting pan. Make sure you position and remove the racks before you turn the oven on to preheat.

, Set the oven to 475 F (246 C). While it’s heating up, gather your supplies. You will need:Roasting rack (if your turkey isn't already on one)
Roasting pan designed for the rack you're using

, Set the turkey breast-up onto the roasting rack, and place the rack into the roasting pan. Pour the broth into the bottom of the pan, but don’t pour it over the turkey itself.


Place the uncovered turkey in the oven and roast for 20 minutes., After 20 minutes, reduce the oven temperature to 350 F (177 C). Don't open the door, as this will let out too much heat.


This process of cooking the turkey on high then reducing the temperature will help make the skin crispy and seal in the juices.
Continue cooking the turkey at this temperature until it’s done. The general rule of thumb is that you need to cook turkey for 13 minutes per pound. If you're working with a 15-pound turkey, you'll need to cook it for about 195 minutes, or three hours and 15 minutes.

, The 13 minutes per pound rule is a good guideline, but actual cooking time will vary based on whether you stuffed, trussed, or brined the turkey. Always use a thermometer to determine when the turkey is done.


About halfway into the estimated cooking time, start checking the internal temperature of the turkey regularly. It’s fully cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 165 F (74 C).Check the temperature in three separate places: the breast, inner thigh, and outer thigh., When the turkey is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest, uncovered, for about 20 minutes.


When your ready to carve the turkey, remove the roasting rack from the pan and transfer the turkey to a cutting board.
Resting meat before cutting it will help keep the juices inside the meat, preventing it from drying out., Transfer the liquid in the roasting pan to a large saucepan. Add 1 cup (240 ml) of stock or broth to the drippings, and heat over medium heat.


In a bowl, whisk together ¼ cup (37.5 g) of flour and 1 cup (240 ml) of broth. Whisk this in to the stock and drippings and continue heating the gravy until it thickens.You can also leave the drippings in the roasting pan and make the gravy in that, as long as you have a roasting pan that’s durable enough to withstand direct heat from an element.

Grease the parchment paper with olive oil or cooking oil to make sure the cake won't stick.In order to make a log roll, the cake must be baked in a large, shallow pan, rather than a stout pan. A cookie sheet with 1-inch high sides should do the trick.
Don't skimp on greasing the parchment paper. It's important for the cake to stay intact when you lift it from the pan.;
, Place the yolks in a large mixing bowl, and use either a whisk or a hand mixture to beat them well, until they're light and yellow. Add 1/2 cup of the sugar and the pumpkin, and continue beating until the mixture is smooth and the sugar has dissolved.

, Place the egg whites in a separate mixing bowl. Beat them until soft peaks begin to form. Add the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar and continue beating until the egg whites become stiffer and glossy.


Be sure the beaters or whisk you use to beat the whites are clean and dry, or you won't be able to get peaks to form.
Add the sugar gradually as you beat, rather than pouring it in all at once, to achieve a glossy texture.

, Fold the egg white mixture into the egg yolk mixture with a spatula. In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt, then pour it into the wet mixture. Use the spatula to gently stir the ingredients until the batter comes together.

, Pour the batter into the baking pan. Use the spatula to smooth it evenly across the pan, all the way to the sides and into the corners. Place the pan in the oven and bake the cake for about 15 minutes. Remove it from the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes.


Check the cake by touching it with the back of a spoon. If it springs back, it's finished.
Don't overbake the cake, or it will get crumbly. Remove it from the oven when it is just finished.
Don't let the cake cool completely before moving to the next step.

, You can dust the parchment paper with powdered sugar to ensure the cake won't stick to the paper. Carefully turn the baking sheet over and turn the cake upside down over the paper. Use a spatula to help dislodge it from the pan if necessary. Remove the parchment paper from the cake.

, The cake should finish cooling in a rolled-up shape, so that it doesn't fall apart when you finish assembling it later. Lay a clean dishcloth over the cake. Gently begin rolling the cake, starting with one of the short sides, until the entire cake is in the form of a jelly roll. Let the cake finish cooling while you mix up the filling., Place the cream cheese in a mixing bowl and beat it until it becomes light and fluffy in texture. Add the butter and continue beating until the ingredients are fully incorporated.

, Place the powdered sugar in the bowl and keep beating. Taste the mixture and add more sugar if you desire.

, Pour in the vanilla and keep beating the filling until it has a smooth, spreadable consistency. Add more vanilla if you need to thin it out.

, Carefully roll the cake in the opposite direction so that it lays flat again. Remove the dishcloth.

, Scoop some of the filling into the center of the cake and use a knife or spatula to spread it over the surface of the cake, stopping about 1/2 in from the edges. Add as much or as little filling as you'd like.

, Roll the cake back up in the same direction it was rolled before. Place it in the freezer to let it firm up for an hour.

, Place the cake on a cake plate or platter for serving. Dust the cake with more powdered sugar, or make a sugar glaze to pour over the top. Serve with whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Let the turkey sit 20 minutes.",How to Make Turkey Stuffing," Set it to 275ºF (135ºC).;
, Cut the bread into cubes roughly ¾ inches (1.9 centimeters) wide. If using unsliced bread, slice lengthwise down the loaf first, then cut through the stacked slices.A typical stuffing uses high quality sliced white bread, challah, or bagels. For more unusual flavors and textures, try sourdough or cornbread.Avoid crusty, airy bread, which tends to become mush.An electric bread knife makes this much easier.

, Once the oven has preheated, arrange the bread cubes on a baking tray. Bake until dry, about ten to fifteen minutes.


You can skip this step if the bread is already hard and stale, or if using cornbread.
Optionally, toast a couple handfuls of pine nuts or roughly chopped walnuts on a separate tray. If using pine nuts, remove after 5–7 minutes to prevent burning., Dice the celery, onions, and garlic, plus the parsley and sage if using fresh leaves. Chop the mushrooms roughly, for a texture similar to ground meat.

, Melt a third of the butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot until it stops foaming, but before it browns.Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 7 minutes. Wait until they start to sizzle and turn golden brown.


You can save time by cooking the mushrooms with the other ingredients, but this method adds a stronger mushroom flavor.

, Melt the remaining butter, leaving the mushrooms in the pan. Add all the vegetables and herbs you just chopped, plus thyme, salt, and pepper. Cover and let cook until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Some of the vegetables should still be crunchy, especially the celery.


Stuffing uses more butter than regular sautéed vegetables, as it needs to be moist to stick together.

, Add the toasted bread cubes to the vegetable mixture in the same pan or a large bowl. Mix thoroughly.

, Heat chicken stock on the stove or in the microwave until steaming. Gradually add the stock while stirring, until all the bread is moist. If you plan to cook the stuffing inside the bird, just use ¾ of your stock, so it can still absorb turkey juices.


If the stuffing refuses to clump together, beat one or two large eggs, then stir it into the mixture. Wait until just before you stuff the turkey.
If you have the time, you can make your own turkey stock in advance. Place the turkey giblets in a small pot of water and let simmer one hour., Cooking the stuffing inside the turkey adds more flavor, but carries a significant risk of bacterial infection. The FDA and other food safety experts highly recommend the use of a food thermometer that can reach the center of the stuffing.If you do not have one, cook the stuffing separately.


Never stuff a turkey that you plan to grill, smoke, fry, or microwave.
Cooking the stuffing separately also saves about 15–30 minutes of cooking time.

, Cover in foil and cook for 30 minutes in a 325ºF (160ºC) oven. Uncover and cook an additional 10 minutes for a brown, crispy top.


Optionally, sprinkle with chopped nuts, crumbled goat cheese, or parmesan when you remove the foil.

, If you've decided to stuff your bird, do so while the stuffing is still hot. If you made the stuffing in advance, keep it in the refrigerator, then warm in a large pan.

, If packed too tightly, the stuffing may become rubbery and fail to reach safe temperatures. Add about ¾ cup stuffing for every pound of turkey (360 mL per kg).If you can fit your entire hand in the turkey, the stuffing has enough room to expand as it absorbs juice.If you have extra stuffing, cut open the skin at the thigh joints and over the breast and push the stuffing under. Additional leftovers can be baked separately, as described above.

, Immediately after stuffing, place the turkey in the oven and set it to 325ºF (160ºC). Before removing the turkey from the oven, check that its internal temperature has reached 165ºF (74ºC). Measure the temperature at the center of the stuffing, the thickest part of the breast, and the innermost part of the thigh and wing.A stuffed, 8-pound (3.6 kg) turkey takes about 3 hours to roast, while a stuffed 22-pound (10 kg) turkey takes about 5 hours.If the turkey is done cooking but the stuffing isn't, remove the stuffing and cook it in a greased casserole dish until finished.
An instant read thermometer takes about 15 seconds to read the temperature. A normal food thermometer must be left in for 5 minutes., Remove the turkey from the oven. Wait 20 minutes before carving or removing the stuffing. During this time, the turkey will finish cooking, and the juices will redistribute throughout the meat for a more tender meal.

, Start with firm, shiny chestnuts. Discard chestnuts with cracks or holes in the shell.


It's not too uncommon to see white ""worms"" (larvae) inside some of the chestnuts. Throw these away if you notice them while cutting or peeling.

, Rinse them to remove any dust on the chestnuts. Many people like to pat the chestnuts dry, but this may not be necessary.

, Find a very sharp paring knife if possible, or use the heel of a larger, sharper chef's knife. Cut a ½ inch (1.25cm) X into the flatter side of the chestnut. Make sure to cut through the entire shell. If you don't do this, the chestnuts can explode from trapped heat and steam.


Chestnuts have hard shells. Try starting with the tip of the knife, and watch your fingers.

, A loose wrapping can help keep the chestnuts moist, but makes them more difficult to peel. If you decide to do this, pile the chestnuts onto a large piece of aluminum foil, with the X on top. Wrap loosely, leaving a large hole at the top of the foil.

, If you aren't using foil, just spread the chestnuts out in a single layer, with the X on top.

, Place the baking sheet in the oven. Starting at about 20 minutes, begin testing the chestnuts to see if they're done. Here are a few signs:


You can easily stick a toothpick through the center of the X, and crumbs are on the toothpick when it withdraws.
The flaps left from the X-shaped incision have curled back or burst open.
Chestnut flesh is golden brown.

, Remove the chestnuts from the oven. Let them cool for 10–15 minutes, then peel before they cool completely. Salt them before eating, or fry the peeled chestnuts in butter until golden brown.

Spread the cashews evenly across the baking tray.,
Consider adding oil.,
Roast the cashews in the oven on the middle rack for five minutes.,
Return to the oven and roast, stirring frequently, until done.,
Drizzle additional oil and add salt.,
Cool before serving.",How to Roast Cashews1," Grab a large baking tray for your cashews, but do not add any grease to the tray. If you’re concerned about the nuts sticking, however, you can line the tray with parchment paper.


If roasting a small amount of cashews, consider using a cake pan instead, which you can shake frequently during cooking to toss the oils.Cashews can be oil roasted or dry roasted. If you dry roast the cashews and wish to add salt without adding any oil, try coating or spraying your cashews with brine or salt-water solution, then letting them dry, before roasting them. This helps the salt adhere to the nuts.;
, Try to keep the cashews in a single, even layer to promote even roasting. If working with large batches, it would be preferable to use multiple trays rather than piling the cashews into one.

, Roasting cashews with a little oil is recommended, but not strictly necessary. Drizzle between 1 and 2 tsp (5 and 10 mL) of oil over the cashews. Stir and toss the cashews gently on the baking tray to coat evenly with oil.


Roasting the nuts in oil will enhance the flavor and texture, but it will increase the overall oiliness of the finished product. If you're using them for baking purposes (e.g., adding them to cookies or brownies), omit the oil and skip this step. If you're eating them on their own or using them as a garnish, however, roast the cashews in oil.Less is more in this step. You can add more oil later, as needed, after your cashews have started roasting.
You can use a nut oil, like almond oil or walnut oil, or opt for another healthy oil, like grapeseed oil, olive oil, or coconut oil.

, After five minutes, remove them from the oven and stir using a spoon or spatula. This helps apply a new layer of oil to the cashews and reduces the risk of burning.

, Return the cashews to the oven and continue roasting them in three to five minute intervals, stirring well after each interval concludes. Cashews should only need between 8 and 15 minutes of total roasting time before being ready.


When ready, the nuts should release a strong yet pleasing odor and look several shades darker. You may even hear some crackling if you cooked them in oil.
Cashews can burn quickly, so it's important that you check and stir frequently to minimize this risk.

, Remove the cashews from the oven. If desired, drizzle another 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 mL) of oil over the cashews, then sprinkle them with about 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of salt, adding more or less depending on personal taste.


If adding the roasted cashews to baked goods, you may wish to skip the oil and salt.
You could also use other seasonings as desired during this step. Examples of seasonings that complement the flavor of cashews include cinnamon, sugar, paprika, cayenne, cloves, and nutmeg.
If you soaked the nuts in brine or salt water before roasting them, do not add any additional seasoning here. The initial salt in the solution should be enough.

, Transfer the cashews onto a plate and let them cool for 15 minutes before serving. Transferring them prevents the hot baking tray or cake pan from scorching the nuts.


Once cooled, you can serve or use the cashews immediately. You may also store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two weeks."

Since the honey coating is so sticky, honey-roasted cashews are likely to stick to the baking tray if you leave it unlined. Nonstick foil or parchment paper is strongly recommended.

, Combine the honey, maple syrup, and melted butter in a large mixing bowl, then stir in the salt, vanilla, and cinnamon until all glaze ingredients are well-combined.


For an even simpler version, you can stick with only honey, butter, and cinnamon.The maple syrup, salt, and vanilla all enhance the flavor of the cashews, but are not strictly necessary.

, Add the cashews to the bowl of honey glaze. Toss and stir the cashew and honey mixture using a large spoon or spatula to coat the nuts as evenly as possible.


When thoroughly coated, spread the cashews evenly on the baking tray to form one layer.

You do not need to line or coat the baking sheet in this method; however, if you’re concerned about the cashews sticking, you can line it with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil. Avoid using oil or nonstick cooking spray since these may impact the cooking process and final flavor.

, A single, even layer will promote even cooking. Try to avoid piling the cashews in multiple layers since they may roast unevenly.

, Remove them from the oven, then stir to distribute the heat evenly.


Depending on your desired level of doneness, you can either stop here or continue roasting the cashews for another 8 to 10 minutes, stopping to stir after four minute intervals.Roasting the cashews for only five minutes will warm them up without impacting the taste and texture much; roasting them for a total of 12 to 15 minutes will give the nuts a more traditional roasted flavor and crunch.

, While the cashews roast, combine the rosemary, cayenne, sugar, salt, and butter in a large bowl. Set the bowl aside for now.


You may skip the cayenne if you’d prefer roasted nuts without a kick of heat.

, Once the cashews are roasted to your desired level of doneness, remove them from the oven. Toss them in the rosemary-butter mixture until all nuts are evenly coated.

Stir and toss the cashews in the honey and cayenne mixture to coat them evenly, then transfer the coated cashews to your prepared baking tray.


Make sure to spread the cashews evenly across the baking tray to form one layer. Otherwise, your cashews will not roast evenly; some may burn while others remain too raw.

, Remove the cashews after this time and stir using a large spoon or spatula. This coats your cashews evenly with the sweet and spicy mixture, and promotes even cooking.

, The nuts should smell pleasantly strong and look slightly darkened when finished.


Make sure that you stir the cashews every three to five minutes as they finish cooking. If you cook them without stirring, they’ll be more likely to burn or cook unevenly.

If you can’t put the nuts on the pan in a single layer because there are too many, use two sheet pans or do the nuts in batches.Overlapping your almonds will cause them to heat unevenly and may make removing the skins more difficult.

, Place the nuts in the oven and toast them for up to 15 minutes. Look through the oven glass for any areas that become overly dark, as this can make your nuts bitter. If you notice overbrowning, remove your almonds. It can help to shake the pan every five minutes while toasting to keep the nuts from burning.The nuts are ready when the exteriors turn golden brown.

, Using an oven mitt to protect your hand, remove the sheet pan from the oven. Cool your almonds until they are no longer hot, but still warm to the touch. It’s best to cool the pan on your stove or another heat-safe area away from pets and children., Pour the almonds into a tea towel on the counter. Using another tea towel, rub the almonds vigorously from the top to loosen the skins. The friction created by both towels will cause the now-flaky exteriors of the almonds to come off.

Use a baking sheet.,
Arrange the nuts on the pan.,
Create a buttery spray.",How to Roast Macadamia Nuts2," A standard baking sheet should be suitable for roasting macadamia nuts. A baking sheet is a long flat sheet that has edges to keep anything, such as nuts, from rolling or dripping off the sheet. They generally measure about 17 x 12 inches (43 x 30 centimeters) with a one inch high rim., Be sure to use nuts of relatively similar size. This will protect the smaller nuts from burning while the larger ones continue to roast. If you’re unsure, turn the nuts over several times while roasting to prevent burning. It is not necessary to season the nuts, as the flavor of the nuts themselves are delicious without any additives.


Do not have more than one layer of nuts, to prevent burning and uneven roasting.

, Salt and butter will enhance the flavor of the nuts and is a simple mixture you can make at home. Mix water, salt, and melted butter together and pour into a spray bottle. The proportion of each ingredient can be up to you. For example, if you enjoy the taste of butter, you can melt more butter and use less water. Spray your mixture over the macadamia nuts.To melt butter, place a small sauce pan on the stovetop and turn the heat to medium low.
Place the butter in the pan and wait a few minutes for the better to melt.
You can also microwave butter to make it melt. You shouldn’t need to microwave it for more than thirty seconds, as butter melts quickly.

",How to Roast Squash Seeds," Generally, to preheat your oven to 300°F (148.9°C), it should take about 15 minutes, though this time might vary depending on your oven. It's a good idea to start preheating first and foremost. This way you can prepare your squash seeds while the oven heats., Take a sharp knife and cut the squash so that you have access to the innards in the bulb of the gourd. The shape of your squash will dictate the best cut. In most cases, halving the gourd down or across the center will be sufficient. Then:Use a spoon or your hand to tear out the seeds of the squash. These will likely be slimy with gourd guts. Place the seeds in your colander.
Once you have removed as many seeds from the squash as you desire, run cool water over the seeds in the colander to clean them.
Use your fingers to remove any remaining gourd innards from the seeds. Then shake the colander firmly over a sink or drain to remove excess water., Many kinds of gourd seeds, including squash, cook faster on the inside of the seed than the outside. This can cause your seeds to blacken on the inside and negatively impact their flavor. Boiling will help your seeds cook evenly.


After goo and pulp have been removed from your seeds, boil them in salted water for 10 minutes.
While the seeds boil, clean your colander of any pulp or squash innards. When the seeds finish boiling, strain the water from the seeds with your cleaned colander., Lay out enough paper towel to accommodate your seeds on a flat, clean surface of your counter. Then, take your colander and carefully upend the seeds on the paper towel. After that:


Take some more paper towel and pat the seeds dry. Some seeds may stick to the paper towel. Pick or knock these free with your fingers or a utensil.
You can prevent seeds or seasoning from dirtying your baking sheet by lining the bottom of your baking pan with either aluminum foil or parchment paper., Once your seeds are dry, take a ¾ measuring cup and count how many of these are filled by your squash seeds. Remember this number, as you'll soon be using it to calculate the amount of oil you need., Now that you've measured how many seeds you'll be making, you're ready to season them. For every ¾ cup of seeds, add 1 teaspoon of oil and several pinches of salt to the seeds.If you prefer your squash seeds to be on the saltier side, you may want to use as much as half a teaspoon of salt in your seasoning.Those who dislike strong, salty flavors may want to only use a single pinch of salt to season the seeds.

, Much like you would toss a salad to evenly distribute its ingredients, so too should you mix your seeds so the seasoning is evenly spread throughout. Once the seeds are mixed:


Use your hands or a utensil, like a spatula, to spread the seeds in a single layer on the pan.
Seeds that are stacked or overlap may emerge from the roasting process slightly under cooked. , At this point, your oven should be preheated and ready to roast your seeds. Take the sheet and insert it into your oven. You'll need to watch your seeds as they cook. Ideally, just as the seeds begin to brown, they should be removed from the oven.


For most ovens, it will take about 20 to 25 minutes for the seeds to start browning. However, hot weather or an overheated kitchen can decrease this time.
To ensure a consistent roasting of your seeds, take your spatula and stir the seeds after 10 minutes have passed., Right after you remove the seeds from your oven, they'll be extremely hot. Use an oven mitt or pot holder to take hold of the baking sheet and remove it from the oven. Once the seeds are cool, they're ready to eat or be stored for later consumption.


After removing your baking sheet from the oven, be sure to put it on a heat resistant surface, like a pot holder or your stove top, to prevent heat damage to your counter top.
Store roasted seeds in an airtight container for an increased seed shelf life. In a refrigerator, these can last up to 2 months, though at room temperature, your seeds will begin spoiling at about a week., This variation will require a layer of parchment paper along the bottom of your baking sheet. Where you would normally add salt when preparing your roasted seeds, add little to no salt instead. Otherwise, roast your seeds in the traditional fashion previously described. After the seeds have roasted:


Allow the seeds to cool. When the seeds have cooled enough to be touched with your hand, add a small amount of brown sugar or maple syrup to the seeds.
Add other spices to create a dynamic taste. Sweetened seeds are great with spices like cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, or a combination of these.
Mix the seeds to evenly distribute your sweetener and any other spices you've added. After that, roast the seeds for another 10 minutes or so, until the sugar starts to melt., This variation follows the same process as the sweetened squash seeds. All you need to do is swap some ingredients. Layer the bottom of your baking sheet with parchment paper, skip or drastically reduce the salt you add, roast your seeds and then:


Wait for the seeds to cool to the point you can touch them. After that, add a little bit of honey and small amount of sriracha or chili flakes.
Spice your seeds to bring out the flavor. Spices like cumin or curry powder will add more spiciness to your seeds.Mix the seeds to evenly distribute the seasonings and spices throughout them. Lastly, roast the seeds for another 10 minutes or so, until the honey starts to glaze., Line the bottom of your baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent herbs and spices from sticking to your baking pan. Skip or drastically reduce the salt you add, and then, before you roast the seeds:


Add oil, herbs, and/or spices, like chopped rosemary, dried oregano, smoked paprika, chili powder, and cumin.
Season and spice the seeds sparingly. Especially if you're using many herbs and spices, these can easily become overpowering.
Mix the seeds so that your seasonings and spices are spread evenly throughout them.
Watch the seeds carefully while they roast. Sometimes, the herbs and spices will brown too quickly. In this case, you'll want to reduce the heat of your oven.,"

Give spiced nuts as a tasty gift.",How to Make Slow Cooker Spiced Nuts," Spiced nuts are traditionally prepared using almonds and pecans, but you could also make room in your recipe for cashew halves, walnuts, peanuts or even macadamias. Any type of nut that’s tender and easy to snack on will work. It’s all a matter of personal preference.


Avoid using overly hard nuts or those with tough, fibrous shells.
A basic jar of mixed nuts is the perfect thing for whipping up a quick and convenient batch of spiced nuts.;
, Place the nuts at the bottom of a large mixing bowl. In a separate measuring cup, separate the whites from 2 large eggs and combine them with 3 tablespoons of melted butter and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Stir the mixture until it becomes frothy, then slowly pour it over the top of the nuts, covering as much surface area as you can.The blended liquid ingredients will give the dry spices something to stick to.
Adding the wet and dry components separately is easier than trying to do it all at the same time, as combining the dry spices with the egg, butter and vanilla extract will form a paste that’s hard to spread or pour.

, Take another small container and add the sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, orange zest, salt and cayenne pepper. Shake or stir the dry ingredients together to evenly distribute them. Then, sprinkle the sugar and spices over the nuts and toss them until they’re thoroughly coated.You have total freedom over any other spices you wish to add at this point, including ground ginger, cloves, allspice or paprika.
For slightly different flavor notes, ¼ cup of maple syrup may be used in place of granulated sugar., Flatten the foil against the bottom and sides of the cooker. Spray the foil lightly with cooking spray. This will help keep the nuts from burning while they cook and also prevent them from sticking to the inside of the cooker.If you prefer, you can also grease the foil with butter, shortening or coconut oil.
Whatever you do, don’t skip this step—if you do, you can expect to spend an hour or two scraping rock-hard dried glaze off the sides of your slow cooker later.

, Pour the spiced nuts into the bottom of the lined and greased slow cooker. Turn on the cooker and crank up the temperature. The high heat will caramelize the sugar and other dry ingredients, forming a syrupy glaze and infusing the nuts with sweet, pungent flavor.Make sure the nuts are spread evenly over the bottom surface of the cooker.
Unlike the oven or stovetop, cooking your spiced nuts in a slow cooker or crock pot will ensure that they get perfectly done without turning into scorched mess.

, Place the lid on the slow cooker. For their first phase, the nuts will need to cook for about an hour. Set a timer to let you know when you should come back and check on them.Keeping the lid on the cooker will stop moisture from escaping. If the nuts happen to get too dry (the glaze will appear thick and glue-like), add a tablespoon or two of warm water to thin out the glaze.

, After the initial hour is up, remove the lid from the cooker and stir the nuts. Turn the heat down to the lowest setting and continue simmering the nuts for another hour. Come back and stir them every 20 minutes or so as the glaze begins to solidify.The intense heat will cause the candy coating to melt and pool at the bottom of the cooker, so stirring will help recoat the nuts.
By the time the nuts are finished cooking, the glaze should have reduced enough to stick to them.

, Turn off the slow cooker. Remove the lid to let the heat escape so the nuts can begin cooling and setting up. After a few minutes, scrape the spiced nuts onto a baking sheet covered with wax paper, spooning any remaining glaze over the top. In 1-2 hours, the glaze will dry and the nuts will be ready to eat!Make sure to cool the nuts on a nonstick surface, as they’ll be very sticky when they first come out of the slow cooker.
Once dry, the nuts will have a crisp, sugary exterior and a tender crunch inside.

, Once the nuts have had time to dry completely, transfer them to a tupperware container and place them in the refrigerator or pantry until you’re hungry for a bite. They’ll usually stay good for up to a week or even a little longer, but they’re best enjoyed while they’re fresh.You won’t have to worry about spiced nuts going bad, since none of the ingredients used to make them actually spoil, but they may lose some of their crunch after a while.
If you plan on serving the nuts right away instead, arrange them on a serving tray with sliced cheese and crackers, or set a bowlful out on the kitchen counter and watch them disappear.

, Play around with your spiced nut recipe until you arrive at one that suits your own personal tastes. Those with a sweet tooth, for instance, can finish with a sprinkle of powdered sugar, while others may prefer an additional shake of salt, ginger or cayenne for a more savory snack. You can even experiment with different combinations of nuts to alter the subtle flavors of the confection.Vary the amounts of individual spices to satisfy picky eaters.
Every time you make a batch of spiced nuts, you’ll get a little closer to finding the perfect proportions of each spice.

, Spiced nuts make a great grab-and-go finger food any time of day. Pack them in with your lunch for the day, use them to take the edge off your hunger while you’re waiting on dinner to be served or savor a handful with a hot cup of tea before bedtime. There’s no wrong way to enjoy the scrumptious crunch of spiced nuts!A pinch of spiced nuts will pair well with oatmeal, yogurt or fresh fruit.
Be careful not to spoil your appetite—all that sugar makes them awfully filling!

, Pour small portions of nuts into cellophane gift bags or miniature mason jars, then tie ribbons around them and hand them out to friends, family and coworkers. Spiced nuts make a unique, addictive offering that’s guaranteed to have the lucky recipients asking for more. They’re perfect around the holidays, but are right at home at any event or time of year.Spiced nuts fresh from your kitchen would make a wonderful housewarming, graduation or engagement gift.
Make spiced nuts in large batches and mail them to loved ones who live far away.

Place the baking sheet in the oven.,
Remove the chips from the oven.",How to Make Pita Chips1," Choose either white or whole wheat pita, available at most grocery stores. Buy plain pita bread or bread made with seeds, herbs and spices.

Making pita chips is a great way to use up stale pita, so go ahead and use that half-full bag of pita that's been sitting in your pantry. Just make sure it doesn't have any mold on it.
Delicious pita chips can be made from freshly-baked pita bread bought from Greek or other Mediterranean restaurants.;
, You can make plain pita chips to dip in hummus, tzatziki or salsa, but you could also flavor the chips as they're cooking and eat them without dip. Mix up one of these flavor combinations, or create your own:


Rosemary garlic. Use fresh or dried chopped rosemary and freshly minced or dried garlic granules to create this classic flavor.
Chili cayenne. A little cayenne pepper and chili powder goes a long way. This spicy combination would taste great with ranch dip or another cool pairing.
Cinnamon brown sugar. Pita is usually used in savory dishes, but tastes just as good when it's sweet.

, Get out a baking sheet and some olive oil.

, Lay the bread on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to slice it into the shape of chips. Make them as small or large as you like them.

For crispier chips, separate the two pita layers so you have two thin chips instead of one thick one.
For chips that will stand up to thick dips, leave the two layers intact.

, Brush them with olive oil with a basting brush and use your fingers to sprinkle them liberally with your spice mix.

If you're making savory pita chips, sprinkle them with a little salt.
If you want the chips to be extra spicy, turn them over and brush the other side with olive oil, then sprinkle more spices over them.
Don't overlap the chips, since this will cause them to cook unevenly and they may not turn out crispy.

, Let the pita slices cook for 5 minutes, then check to see if they've crisped up into chips.

For extra crispy chips, leave them in for a few minutes longer.
If you don't like chips that have browned, take them out on the early side.

, Place them in a bowl and serve alone or with a dip."

Make pita chips.",How to Make Pita Chips2," Sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir until it dissolves.


Use a large metal bowl that can contain all of the ingredients.
The yeast should start to foam as it reacts with the water. If it doesn't, you may need a new packet of yeast.

, Stir the mixture as you add flour, always in the same direction. Continue stirring for one minute to activate the gluten in the flour. Let the mixture rest for at least 15 minutes.

, Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it for 10 minutes. Place it in an oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise until it has doubled in size.


The bread should be elastic and smooth when you are finished kneading it. If it's still sticky, keep kneading.






Place the bowl in a warm spot in your kitchen to let it rise. It will rise much more slowly if it's kept too cool.

, Divide the dough into 14 equal parts. Form the dough pieces into balls and place them on a floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll them into flat pita shapes.


If you want larger or smaller pitas, divide the dough into either more or fewer parts.
If you don't want to make so many pitas at once, you can store the unused dough in the refrigerator for up to a week, and use it whenever you want fresh pitas.

, Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius). Place a two stacked baking sheets on the bottom rack of the oven and allow it to heat completely.


You can also use a baking stone to make pitas. Place the stone on the bottom rack and allow it to heat.
If you don't have two baking sheets to stack, you can use one. The pitas won't cook quite as evenly but they will still taste delicious.

, Open the oven and place two to four pitas on the baking sheet, depending on the size you made them. Close the oven and allow them to bake for about four minutes, until they puff up. Remove them from the oven and allow them to cool.


If your pitas don't puff, that's okay. They'll still make great pita chips.






Baking too many pitas at once will prevent them from cooking quickly enough, so don't overfill the oven.
Take care to remove the pitas after four minutes, or they will burn.

, Now that you have fresh pita, make pita chips with the bread you don't use for wraps. Follow these steps for making pita chips:

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius).






Slice the fresh pitas into chip-sized triangles.






Place them on a baking sheet, brush them with olive oil, and season them with the spices of your choice.






Bake the pita slices for five or so minutes, until they crisp up into chips.






Serve hot or store in airtight food storage containers for later use.

It's up to you whether or not you cut off the crust. Judge it by how nice the crust looks on the bread you're using.;
, There is a bit of a trick to this, in that you need to let the petals slightly overlap the edges of the sandwiches in order for them to be seen by guests.


It's also a good idea to vary the colours being added if you have a variety of colours. The colour theme is up to you though.

, The petals should show from every edge of the sandwich.
