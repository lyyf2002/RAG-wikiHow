Store the leftover seeds.",How to Make Pumpkin Seeds in the Oven," It’s common for people to extract and roast the seeds from their Halloween pumpkins. While this is a fine option, there are pumpkins designed for consumption and commonly referred to as “cooking pumpkins.” These pumpkins are smaller than the large carving pumpkins used for Halloween decorations, and you may notice a minor difference in consistency and taste between the cooking and carving pumpkin seeds.
, Place the pumpkin on a durable cutting board and, using a sharp kitchen knife—such as a carving knife—cut the top off of the pumpkin. This will give you access to the pulpy middle of the gourd, which contains the seeds., Once you’ve removed the top, use your carving knife to slice the pumpkin into four evenly sized quarters. Do this by setting the pumpkin upright (with the place where the stem would’ve been pointing upwards), and cutting straight down through the pumpkin. Once it’s halved, repeat the process and cut each of the halves in half.If you’re removing the seeds from a large carving pumpkin, you may not need to quarter the gourd. Carving pumpkins often have a large enough opening at the top to extract the pulp and seeds from.

, Once the pumpkin has been quartered, grab a sturdy kitchen spoon and use it to scrape the stringy pulp (which contains the seeds) into a colander. You’ll be able to tell where the pulp ends and the pumpkin wall begins, as the wall of the gourd is much sturdier than the pulp and does not contain any seeds.If you don’t have a spoon sturdy enough for scooping out the pumpkin seeds, you can use an ice cream scoop.

, You’ll need to use your fingers for this: reach into the colander and remove the pumpkin seeds from the thick, sticky pumpkin pulp. You can discard the pumpkin pulp, and leave the seeds themselves in the colander.You should be able to extract about 1 cup (236 mL) of seeds from a pumpkin weighing 10–14 pounds (4.5–6.3 kg).

, Once you’ve removed as much of the pulp as possible and are left with only seeds, take the colander to your sink and thoroughly rinse the seeds in cold water. This will remove lingering strings of pulp., Using your hands or a spoon and spatula, transfer the pumpkin seeds from the colander onto a clean baking sheet. Spread them out evenly so that as few seeds as possible are touching one another., Using a measuring spoon, pour about 1 teaspoon of olive oil over the pumpkin seeds. The oil will add flavor and allow seasonings to stick better to the seeds. If you’d rather not add additional flavorings to the seeds, you can place them in the oven at this point.If you’d like to flavor your pumpkin seeds, try one of the recipes given below.

, This is one of the simpler methods to flavor your pumpkin seeds. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of sea salt over your pumpkin seeds while they’re on the baking sheet. Then pour 2–3 tablespoons of a balsamic vinegar over the seeds.The vinegar should all evaporate while the seeds bake, so that the roasted seeds will not be soggy or sitting in a puddle of vinegar.

, If you’d like a more complex flavor than salt and vinegar, consider ranch. To achieve this, you’ll need to add a handful of ingredients to your seeds while they’re on the baking sheet and before they’re placed in the oven. Top the seeds with 1–2 tablespoons of minced chives, 2 tablespoons of minced parsley, ¼ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper.If possible, purchase fresh chives and parsley to mince; these will add a better flavor to your pumpkin seeds. If you don’t have access to fresh ingredients, you can use dried chives and parsley.

, If you’d prefer a subtler flavor, you can create a sesame ginger flavored batch of pumpkin seeds by adding four ingredients. Pour 1 teaspoon of sesame oil over the seeds, followed by 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of sugar, and 1 teaspoon of ground ginger.Once you’ve added the listed ingredients, stir your pumpkin seeds with your hands or a spoon so that the seeds are all evenly coated.

, Do this this while you’re placing ingredients and flavors onto the pumpkin seeds. This will give the oven time to heat sufficiently before you place the seeds inside., Leave the seeds in the oven for the first 15 minutes, then inspect their progress: the seeds should be a golden color, but not yet turning dark brown or blackening around the edges.If the seeds still look uncooked and haven’t begun to brown after 15 minutes in the oven, place them back in the oven for 5 more minutes.

, The seeds will be quite hot when you remove them from the oven, so don’t dig in immediately.Let the seeds cool for at least 5 minutes before you grab a handful.

In order to allow the seeds to cool more rapidly, and to prevent them from cooking further while still on the hot cooking sheet, use a spoon or spatula to transfer the seeds into a bowl or serving dish.

, If you have leftover roasted pumpkin seeds, you can place them in an airtight container, such as a Tupperware or a small plastic bag. Place the seeds in the refrigerator. They will stay edible in the fridge for up to 6 months.If you’d rather store the seeds for longer than 6 months, or if you made a large amount of pumpkin seeds, you could store the seeds in the freezer. There, they’ll last for up to a year.

Make thin bread slices.Begin with a loaf of your favourite sandwich bread.,
Cut crusts off of bread slices.Although some people already prefer sandwiches without the crust, removing them is a necessity when making pinwheel sandwiches.,
Flatten the bread with a rolling pin.Sandwich bread tends to be light and fluffy when cut off a loaf.,
Moisten the bread with butter.,
Layer your bread with a spread.Cream cheese, mayonnaise, and jam are all great choices for a sandwich spread.,
Add wafer-thin ingredients on top of the bread.,
Roll up the bread like a burrito.,
Roll into plastic wrap.After making the sandwiches, immediately roll each wrapped sandwich in plastic wrap.,
Refrigerate for half an hour.,
Cut each roll into bite-size pieces.,
Slice off excess pieces.If you've sufficiently loaded your sandwiches, there's a good chance there will be ingredients that are protruding from the bread once you've rolled it up.,
Secure your pinwheel pieces with a toothpick.,
Serve on a party platter.,
Pack in school lunches.,
Choose a different type of bread.,
Use a creative spread.,
Choose savory fillings.,
Try sweet fillings.,
Make a vegetarian sandwich.",How to Make Pinwheel Sandwiches," Cut thin slices lengthwise across the loaf. The thinner you make the slices, the easier it will be to roll them into wheels. As you cut, make an effort to keep the slices at a consistent thickness.


Cutting your loaf lengthwise will allow you to make longer pinwheel sandwiches.;
, Take a knife and slice out whatever crust is around the slice. Try to cut as little of the soft bread away as you can.


Unlike a regular sandwich, only one slice of bread will be used for each sandwich.

, Flatten it down with a rolling pin to spread out the bread and compress the slice. On top of increasing the surface you'll be able to layer, flattened bread is also easier for rolling.

, Take a knife and spread butter on the side of the bread you'll be putting ingredients on. This will help keep the bread moist and enable easier rolling when it comes time to shape the sandwich.


You may butter the bread on both sides if you're concerned the roll won't be moist enough.

, Once you have a layer of butter, lay down a spread, covering the surface of the bread evenly. Once you have the bread covered to your satisfaction, you can use the knife to even out the spread a little more.


Layering your sandwiches with multiple spreads can be a good idea, although certain spreads may not compliment each other.

, Remember that you'll need to roll your sandwich so you need to avoid overfilling the bread. Ham and salami are great choices because they're usually cut very thin by default and roll up easily. Although ingredients like sliced ham won't add much height on their own, you should be wary of the fact you'll want to ultimately roll up the bread when you're done., When all of the ingredients are set on the bread, take one side and begin to roll the bread over itself, as you might when preparing a burrito. If you cut your slices to be long by default, roll it up from one short side to the other.The rolling and subsequent cutting of pinwheel sandwiches bears a lot in common with sushi., Flatten out a piece of plastic wrap and roll the plastic along the sides and edges so no air is getting to the sandwiches.


If you'd like to cut the sandwiches before refrigerating them, just make sure to wrap the platter of cut-sandwiches very well or they may dry out quickly.

, Although pinwheel sandwiches are good for eating immediately after cutting, wrapping and refrigerating them for half an hour will help them to keep their distinctive shape.If you're serving sandwiches on a hot day or the fillings of the sandwich are cold (like cream cheese), you may want to refrigerate them a little longer. Sandwiches can be refrigerated from 30 minutes up to one day.

, When you have rolled your bread slices up, you should have one or more burrito shaped rolls. In order to make them into pinwheel sandwiches, take a knife and hew them into evenly-sized chunks. Cut them into bite-sized chunks that are similar in size to bites of sushi.


If you want a proper measurement, cut the pieces in one inch segments.An inch length is a good bite-size for this type of sandwich.

, If there's anything sticking out from your roll, snip it off as close to the roll as you can.


If you're short and time and aren't trying to make perfect pinwheels, you don't necessarily have to trim the excess pieces. But doing so will make your pinwheels look more professional.

, Although pinwheel sandwiches do a reasonably good job of holding their shape, locking them down with a toothpick will make sure they don't unfurl before being eaten. Before you present them, impale them down the centre with one toothpick each.


If you're packing the sandwiches for children, it may be best for safety's sake to go without the toothpicks. The same applies to serving the very elderly.

, Pinwheel sandwiches are a perfect party food. Because they look great as a finger food, you should put some effort into the way you present them on a platter. The most common way to do this is to ring them around the perimeter of the platter, working your way in as you fill the tray.


Including a dipping sauce in the center of the platter will be a hit if you're serving a group.

, Pinwheel sandwiches are small enough to fit snugly into a kid's lunch box. Seal them in ziploc bags to preserve their freshness. Because of their small size, you should be able to pack three or four into one bag. If you're making them specifically for a child, you should fill them with his favourite ingredients.

, While dense white bread is the standard bread for pinwheel sandwiches, you can easily swap it out for a lighter or more interesting option. Tortillas (whole-wheat or flour) are a good choice for beginners since they're easy to roll and don't have crusts to trim.You could also try Hawaiian bread, pita bread, brioche or naan. Just be sure to roll the breads so they're flat before you make your sandwich.

, If you want to keep your pinwheel sandwich simple and classic, spread the bread with butter, mayonnaise or mustard. This can be a good idea if you're making a lot of sandwiches for a crowd. But if you're feeling more adventurous, consider using:


Hummus
Refried beans
Salsa
Pesto
Pizza sauce

, Create a variety of savory pinwheel sandwiches so people can choose what they like. Make a few simple options like a ham and cheese or shredded chicken pinwheel sandwich. You should also play around with other combinations of meats, eggs, tofu, and seasonings.Think about some of your favorite meals and try to recreate those flavors in a sandwich. For example, you might make a pizza-style, southwestern, or Thai pinwheel sandwich.

, Pinwheel sandwiches can also make great desserts if you use sweet fillings. Or, you could make a salty-sweet flavor combination by combining a savory meat (like turkey) with a sweet filling (like cranberry sauce). Examples of sweet fillings include:Flavored yogurt
Sweetened cream cheese
Chocolate spread
Peanut butter
Honey
Cranberry sauce
Thin slices of apple, pear, banana or strawberry

, There are a lot of options for a vegetarian sandwich (which also make great additions to meat sandwiches too). Select several vegetables, but keep in mind that they should be sliced thin so they roll easily and are easy to eat. If using a vegetable with high water content (like cucumber or tomato) make sure to apply a spread to prevent the bread from becoming soggy. Good vegetable options include:Tomato
Fresh spinach leaves
Lettuce
Shredded carrots
Strips of bell pepper

Get permission.,
Set a budget for the party.,
Choose a date for the party.,
Decide whether you want to hold a church ceremony.,
Choose a location for your Quince.,
Set the start and end times for your party.",How to Plan a Quinceañera Party1," Discuss the idea of a Quinceañera with your parent(s) or legal guardian. You will need their approval, and you may need to plan out a budget for the party’s finances. Try to start planning your Quinceañera (or Quince, for short) as far as 6 months or a year in advance – make sure that you have enough time to take care of all the social and budgetary logistics., This is completely dependent on how much your family has available to spend on a Quinceañera. If you have plenty of disposable income, and the birthday girl wants a blowout, feel free to plan a huge, festive party. If you're strapped for cash, there is nothing wrong with a simple, homey party. Consider whether your family will need to plan a Quinceañera for any other girls within the next few years; if so, make sure that you don't blow all of your savings on the first party!, Many girls plan their Quinceañera around the time of their birthday. Consider the pros and cons of a certain time or season: will people be in town? Will you be able to have your party outside? Will any other holidays, vacations, or obligations conflict with your party? Your friends will probably not be able to attend if they are out of town or otherwise occupied.If your birthday is on a weekday, consider planning your Quince the Saturday before or after your birthday. It is common to plan a Quince on a Saturday., It is traditional (but optional) to have a ceremony or Mass at church before the actual party. This is called the Misa de acción de gracias: the mass of giving thanks for the end of childhood.Consider the following parts of the tradition:


The festejada, the birthday girl, sits at the foot of the altar. She is wearing a formal pink or white dress. Her godparents give her gifts – often jewelry to wear with the dress.
The festejada is surrounded by her damas (maids of honor) and chambelanes (escorts). These are usually siblings, relatives, or family friends. They are arranged by age to signify the phases through which the festejada has passed
The mass is a thoughtful ritual, much like baptism, which welcomes the festejada to adulthood. The mass celebrates the challenges and joys that face the festejada as an adult.
After the mass, the festejada leaves flowers for the Virgen de Guadalupe. Her female friends and relatives hand out bolos—memorabilia—to everyone attending the mass.

, You can rent out a space, set up in a park, or even just host the party at home. Consider using a reception hall – similar to the buildings used for weddings, anniversary parties, and sweet sixteens. Work out your price range for the reception hall, and cross-check your guest list with how many people the hall can accommodate. If you are planning the party yourself, ask your parents for help with budgeting and arranging a venue.


If you want a more modern and intimate party, consider going out for a fancy dinner with a few good friends, then hosting a slumber party afterward. This way, the party is truly just about the birthday girl and her friends.
If you want to involve the whole family and community, it may be more important to honor the church portion of the tradition. Consider having the reception (after-church party) at a large, convenient venue like a park or a reception hall. If your house is big enough, you can just host the party there., If you are having a church ceremony, consider starting your Quinceañera in the late morning and continuing through the afternoon/evening; if not, feel free to start the party in the afternoon or the evening. It can be hard to set an ending time: once the party starts, it may be so fun that you never want it to end. In fact, many Quinceañeras do not have a designated end time – the duration of the party depends on a variety of things, including: how long the church ceremony takes, what time people leave the party, what time the cake is cut, and how early the party starts. Keep these things in mind as you choose your party’s time and date!

Choose an escort.,
Consider the Court of Honor.,
Feel free to have fewer than 15 couples, or to forego the couple traditional altogether.,
Choreograph and practice the dances.,
Consider the outfits for the fourteen couples and the birthday girl.,
Hire a photographer!",How to Plan a Quinceañera Party2," The ""escort"" is a boy whose job is to escort the birthday girl—the festejada—throughout her night. Ask a friend, or someone that you fancy – whichever makes you feel most comfortable.

, The Court of Honor traditionally comprises 15 couples, including the birthday girl and her escort. The Court is made up of the birthday girl's closest friends, her brothers, sisters, and cousins – the important people in her life with whom she wants to share the spotlight. These friends will pair off into couples for several choreographed dances throughout the Quinceañera, as well as a surprise dance. The Quinceañera's Court of Honor can be comprised of all girls (called Dama), all boys (called Chambelán, Escorte, or Galán) or a combination of both.


If you plan on having the couples, you will need to ensure that everyone’s parents approve. Make sure that the members of the Court are not busy that weekend; make sure that they will be able to attend most of the dance rehearsals.
Make it clear that the couples will be paying for the cost of their own dress/suit, shoes, jewelry, etc. However, it is customary to give every individual person who makes up the couples a small present to thank them for helping you in your Quinceañera.

, The birthday girl should feel at ease with the proceedings. If you are uncomfortable with arranging couples and choreographing dances, you absolutely do not need to do it. Perhaps you want a smaller, more intimate party; perhaps you just want to choose another theme, like a pool party, a bowling party, or a beach party. Try to balance tradition with what you actually want., It is traditional for the 15 couples to rehearse two or three dances. Start practicing at least two months before the Quinceañera. Consider hiring someone from a local dance studio to help you learn the routine for the first four to six weeks. After that, you and the other fourteen couples will be practicing the dances on your own.There is also traditionally a father and daughter dance. If a father is not present, consider sharing this dance with your godfather, grandfather, uncle, older brother – whoever is the most important male authority figure in your life. Feel free to skip this dance if it doesn't make sense for your situation.
Practice the dance in heels, if you will be wearing heels at the Quinceañera. Dancing in heels is very different than dancing in regular shoes.

, The Quinceanera traditionally wears a ballgown. The couples of the Court dress in tuxedos and gowns. If the ceremony has religious overtones, the birthday girl often wears or receives a few of the following accessories for her ceremony: a tiara, a cross or medal, a bible and rosary, and a scepter.Different cultures have different traditions – for instance, in Puerto Rico, the birthday girl wears a white dress, similar to a wedding dress.Depending on where you live, you may need to buy the dress for the birthday girl as early as six months in advance; it may take a while to make all of the necessary adjustments.


Take down everyone’s measurements, heights, sizes and shoe sizes – this way, you can rent or buy all of the outfits together to ensure that they match.

, If you want pictures of the event, it may be worth your money to splurge on professional photos. This party may be a day that you remember for years to come, so consider whether you want more professional photos than a smartphone camera can take.

Prepare la ultima muñeca.,
Cover the decorations and music.,
Plan out the food and drinks.,
Send out the invitations.,
Send a reply card with each invitation.,
Send thank you notes after the party.,
Have fun!",How to Plan a Quinceañera Party3," La ultima muñeca is traditionally the last doll that a girl receives. The doll is usually made from porcelain and designed to look like the Quinceañera – although you can use any material that is convenient. You can commission the doll from a store, or you can ask someone in the family to hand-make it. After turning fifteen, so the tradition goes, the birthday girl will be too old to play with dolls anymore. As part of the ritual, she passes the doll on to a sister or other younger family member., Consider giving your Quinceañera a theme such as ""masquerade"" or ""renaissance""; in this case, choose decorations to match that theme. Even if your party is not specifically themed, make sure that the decorations do not clash with the colors of the dresses and outfits. Decorations can be as simple as table center decorations, and as extravagant as balloons, streamers, and lights.


Choose music according to personal taste, but avoid music with profanity or cursing if there will be young children and elderly people at the party. Consider hiring a DJ to play music, announce the birthday girl’s entrance, and generally keep the party lively.

, If you are planning your own Quinceañera party, ask your parents for help with arranging traditional and appropriate refreshments. The food can include anything that you like, although a more formal celebration will nod to traditional by preparing classic cultural delicacies. Your parents may be very useful for knowing what is commonly served, what will be popular, what the right portions are, etc. Ask your parents about whether or not alcoholic drinks will be served.


Consider the dietary needs of your guests. Make a list of special diets: take into account whether anyone is vegetarian or vegan; allergic to anything; diabetic; or forbidden from certain foods for religious reasons.

, Your invitations can be traditional or modern so long as you include the who, what, when, where, and why of the party. Consider including a schedule of the night; the names of the fourteen couples, as well as the names of the godparents and other people who helped make the party possible; and a few words dedicated to someone dearly departed. Make or order the invitations 3-4 months ahead of the actual party date. The quicker you have those cards in hand, the quicker the outer envelope can be addressed. Send out invitations six-eight weeks before the Quinceañera (to those close by) and around ten weeks (for those guests not so close by).


Keep the invitations consistent: try to make or order all of the stationary from the same place, around the same time.
Invitations now often consist of pictures of the birthday girl, sometimes in her Quinceañera dress. Consider taking these photos, but do not feel the need to conform to the norm.

, Reply cards usually include a box or space where each guest can indicate how many people they are bringing. It is considered rude to set a ""due date"" for the return of the reply card. If you want to reduce paper waste or you feel that a reply card is too much work, simply write “RSVP to ” at the end of the invitation.

, The birthday girl should write the notes by hand. To add a fun twist, send a picture card including a memorable picture from the Quinceañera. Send out thank you notes within a month after the Quinceañera – any longer may seem rude or unappreciative.

, This is your day to shine! Whatever happens on the day of the Quinceañera, don't let it distract you from having a fantastic fifteenth birthday party.

Put Harry Potter references on your door and on the walls.",How to Plan a Harry Potter Party1," You may want to throw your Harry Potter party at your place, but it may also be easier to have it at a venue or someone else's house. Additionally, you'll need to consider what the best time is to throw the party based on who is going to be attending.Before deciding who to invite, you'll want to know how much space you have to work with. You don't want to invite so many people that can't fit them inside a tiny apartment.
Timing is everything when it comes to parties. You'll want to choose the best time that will get many people to come, even if they have other plans during the day you are having the party.;
, Planning and throwing a party can be expensive, especially if you're using thematic decor. If you have a small budget, you'll want to make different choices than if you have a large or unlimited budget.If you have a small budget, try making more of the decorations or food yourself. Harry Potter themed decorations and food are plentiful, but this can be more expensive than making your own homemade decorations and food.
You'll also want to limit the guest list if you have a small budget. More people invited means more food, space, and decorations.

, This is especially important when planning food and beverage choices, music, and entertainment.If you're throwing a kid's party, you'll also want the time and location to be different than if it's for adults.Kids parties will need to start earlier and probably be smaller in number and scope. Too many kids at once can be crazy, but also too much to handle as the party planner.
If you're having adults over for Harry Potter party, it should be later in the day and probably on a weekend. Additionally, you may want to include alcoholic beverages as part of your menu.

, Be sure to include extra information on the invitations such as whether or not it is a costume party and if guests are welcome to bring along other people to the party. People should be excited about the prospect of a Potter party based on your invite.Make the invites even more like Harry Potter by making them like the acceptance letters. You can make the invitations say that guests have been accepted into Hogwarts and when they have to come to the party locations.
While you may be able to buy acceptance letter invitations, you can easily make them. Include a return envelope so you can get RSVPs from your guests., There are a wide variety of a decorations you can use for your Harry Potter party. For wall hangings and Potter-themed trinkets, you should be able to find them on the Internet, local department stores, and book stores.Harry Potter accessories are popular and available just about anywhere. Check at party stores and book stores. You can also find plenty of Harry Potter themed party accessories online.
If you are looking to get creative with the decorations while saving money, making your own could be a good option. Making your own decorations can be as simple as cutting out Golden Snitch and sorting hat shapes out of poster board. You can also place starry-looking fabric over the windows, and finding old brooms to create flying broomsticks. Collect some sticks and distribute them between the guests to pretend they are wands.

, Since the dorms are linked to the various “houses” in Harry Potter, it will be a fun way to introduce your guests to the party’s theme.As people come in, you can ask them a couple of questions to ""sort"" them.If you want to “sort” your guest, you’ll need to get a sorting hat that tells each guest which house they belong to. The sorting hat speaks in rhymes, so try to write out a script for different houses or guests.For each house, you’ll want to use the house colors. In Gryffindor, you’ll use red and gold; for Hufflepuff, yellow and black; for Ravenclaw, blue and bronze; and for Slytherin, green and silver. You can do this with the curtains, interior decorations, or general color scheme., If you don't want to theme your home as dorm rooms, you can use a variety of different themes throughout. There are many different places in Harry Potter, so it can be fun to try to recreate them in your own home.


Olivander's Wand Shop can be a fun room. You can create the hanging sign, as well as various ""wands"" set up throughout the room.While your home is likely not big enough to have a great hall to eat in, you can set up your dining room to look like the dining hall. You can rent long tables and set up the room so the tables go the length of the room like in the movies., The Harry Potter world is very rich with all kinds of references. You can decorate your walls or door to draw your guests into the Harry Potter world.


On your door, you can try a variety of different signs. A 9 3/4 sign on the door can be fun, as could enchanted dragon eggs. You may even hang a portrait on the front door and a ask for a password you mentioned in the invitations.You can also put signs on your walls from the books or movies. Educational Decrees can be a fun way to put things on your wall throughout your place.

Plan your menu.,
Make homemade butter beer.,
Try some Harry Potter themed desserts.",How to Plan a Harry Potter Party2," Whether you're going to have a sit-down meal or a buffet with little snacks and a snack table, you have tons of options as to what to make. The Harry Potter world is full of fun and interesting foods that you can both purchase or create. You can try buying Ferrero Rochers and tape some wings to the gold foil, while taking of the stickers, for snitches.


There are several Harry Potter brand snacks on the market today. Some include: Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Wizard Cards, Cockroach Clusters, Jelly Slugs, Blood Pops, and Acid Pops. You can place these candies into a wooden bowl for everyone to share or put them in individual take-home bags can make for a fun treat.
It may also be fun to make your own food from the Harry Potter world. For example, you could make Harry’s 11th birthday cake from Hagrid.For drinks, make the classic party punch with lime green sherbet and Sprite. You can also place an orange colored juice into goblet-style containers for a ""goblet of pumpkin juice"" effect.

, Butterbeer is served at The Three Broomsticks and The Hog’s Head in Hogsmeade. You can make it easily at home by following a simple recipe.If you want to make butterbeer that’s closest to the one served at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, you can combine brown sugar, water butter, salt, cider vinegar, heavy cream, rum abstract, and cream soda. You’ll boil the ingredients together and top off with cream soda.
Butterbeer is served in steins, so you’ll want to have fun glasses to serve it in. You can buy official steins with “Butterbeer” on them, but you can also just use your own frosted steins.
For adult parties, you can spike the butterbeer. Including vanilla vodka or butterscotch schnapps can maintain the butterbeer flavor while making it alcoholic., For dessert, you could create or buy pastries and place them on a cart or side table to re-create the feel of snacks on the Hogwarts Express train. Any British inspired entrée or decadent dessert would create the feel of a Hogwarts feast.Harry Potter desserts come in all shapes and sizes. You can make a Gryffindor Fruit Trifle, as well as a Hermione’s chocolate toads.
Using a cart to bring out the desserts can be a fun way to replicate the Hogwarts Express train. If you want to make more traditional pastries and desserts, this can be a way to theme them to fit your party.

Plan an activity where you care for magical creatures.",How to Plan a Harry Potter Party3," If you wish for a simple way to add more of a Harry Potter feel to your party, filling the air with the proper sounds can be effective. Try purchasing the movie soundtracks on the internet or in your local music store. In a pinch, play the movies on a low volume on the television.


There are plenty of craft ideas on Youtube.
The music soundtracks can be a good way to set the mood. The Harry Potter soundtracks are great and really put you the right mood for wizarding fun.
Wizard Rock can also be great background music. Wizard Rock bands include: Draco and the Malfoys, Harry and the Potters, The Parselmouths, Ministry of Magic, The Mudbloods, The Butterbeer Experience, and The Remus Lupins.

, If the weather allows, plan a muggle quidditch tournament. You can also have a prize for the winning house.


You'll want to have rules readily available for the players. Even if they don't know all the rules to Quidditch at first, you should be able to teach them pretty quickly. Since your guests obviously can't fly, you'll want to adjust the game for muggles and have the appropriate equipment. People can run with a broom between their legs while chasing someone designated as a ""snitch"" with a tennis ball., If you scan the internet looking for news on the Harry Potter, you will likely find that the internet is filled with Harry Potter trivia games. You can use these questions or make your own to create a Harry Potter trivia tournament.


Be sure to offer prizes such as Harry Potter bookmarks or pencils to the winners. You can even tailor well-known party games such as hangman, Pictionary, or charades to fit your Potter theme.
Another idea would be to hold a contest to see shows up in the best costume. They can also win a prize that is Harry Potter themed.
Be sure to start planning plenty of time in advance in order to create special events such as a trivia tournament.

, This way people can search through them and talk about their favorite parts. You can also use them as references to check for correct answers during trivia games.


You can consider offering a reading from the Potter books at different points throughout the night. Comb through the books for passages that would be great to introduce the various foods, decorations, and games that you bring out.
Since it's a party, only leave out Harry Potter books that you don't mind getting dirty. The books are quite popular, so it may be a good idea to find used copies at a second-hand store.

, Harry Potter is fun of magic, but you can try to recreate some of its magic through science experiments. Kids will be amazed and interested at how the magic of Harry Potter can be recreated.You can make a crystal ball using dry ice to ""tell the future"" for kids. The crystal ball will look cool and kids will be fascinated at your powers.A magic class can also be fun for kids. You can use water gel and three cup monte as a way to show kids how the properties of water can be magical.

, Magical creatures are a big party of the Harry Potter world. Including them in your Harry Potter party for kids can be great fun.


You can have a scavenger hunt for kids where they track down rubber snakes and spiders and put them back in their cages. If you make it a race, kids will have a great time trying to be first to finish the scavenger hunt.
Kids can also be put into teams to complete the scavenger hunt. This may be a better idea if you have fewer magical creatures or not a lot of space at your party.

",How to Plan a Girly Party (for Teens)," Enlist some friends, family, neighbors or anyone else that can help. Get one or two people and get them to help you plan it. That way, you have everyone's opinion, and they could tell you something you didn't think of. Think like a teen.;
, It may sound a little like you are a professional party planner, but it really does help! If you have things like guests and things needed all on a page where you can see it, it makes it much easier.

, Pretend that you are a professional (see above) party planner. Write down the budget, what things you need, etc. Put as much effort into it as you can, because it will all pay off in the end.

, Okay, sometimes your parents can be incredibly annoying. But they can help you a lot!

, Now that you know what you're allowed and what's out of the question, look up stuff like themes, cool places, teen games, etc. If you are really bored, you can make invites ahead of time, but just make sure to leave time to have fun so you're not stressed.

, If you can't think of one, or don't like the idea of 'Hawaiian paradise' or 'pretty in pink', then pick 2 or 3 of your favorite colors and make that the theme. You could also pick a place to base it upon - Italy, Spain, England, France, etc. Have food from that place, get pictures, music, and more. Don't pick something that is aimed towards only a few friends. If you know a few of your friends hate make-overs and doing nails, stay clear of a spa party. Most of all, be creative. People will get more excited if the theme is something new that they haven't been to before.


Can't pick just one? Than have an international party! Get your guests to bring something from their own heritage or let them choose whichever one they like. You can have games and name the teams stuff like: The Paris People, The English Muffins, The French Fries, The Italian Ice Cubes... Whatever you like!

, You can have your party at a hotel, the local community center, your backyard, or even your basement. To have a party at a hotel would be cost a bit of money, but a lot of the time they will love the idea of tons of people coming and seeing what a great hotel it is.

, If you want to kill a bunch of birds with one stone, as they say, try some activities out with neighbors and siblings. Make sure they are appropriate, though. That way, the people who look up to you will get to spend some time with you, parents will be grateful, and you get some game testers for free! Same thing for food, make small portions to try to then you can serve them to little kids, your neighbors, or your parents.

, If you are having it in a location that you can't get to beforehand like a hotel, take some pictures of the hotel room from the net and blow them up to a big size. Post them up on a board and plan where things will go, where you will put decorations, etc. It will help with the last-minute rush. If you are having the party at your house, do the same thing. Most people in your family won't appreciate their things being moved around a week beforehand.

, Is your mom's best friend an amazing hairstylist? Is your dad a great cook? Is your cousin the best makeup artist in the world? Talk to these people about their talents. Ask your mom's best friend to do your guests' hair. Keep in mind that they might want to get a paid a small sum or that they might not be interested. If that's the case, than don't worry about it. You can always order food, do each other's hair and make-up, and much more.

, Get one good friend or even your mom. Get the decorations, invites, food, and everything else you need while you're out. You can go to places like the dollar store for great deals on decorations and even get some fun party favors.


Have a scavenger hunt in the mall. Make people take pictures of craziest outfit, hottest boy they encounter, highest heels, etc.

Decide upon the budget.,
Do or hire some successful coordinating people.,
Pick the location.,
Choose some games and activities.,
Keep the kids busy by making bookmarks.,
Keep all the family members happy.",How to Plan a Reunion Party," The first and foremost thing to decide is the budget. Before getting started decide how much you want to put into the celebration. According to this budget, you can see how many members you want to invite. Location you will be selecting...etc. If you want, you can ask your guests to pool in some amount. Of course, only if you are comfortable doing that.;
, How about Uncle Sam, who is everyone's 'favorite' and loves to manage things. Asking him to become a coordinator and spare some time for the management of the reunion celebration should not be a bad idea. It is better idea to designate 2 people, so that all the blame does not get on his shoulders. You can hope this blaming situation never arises. And what are these coordinators supposed to do. They will be coordinating with all the members and will be fixing the date and time. They will be also handing other small things, like deciding upon the menu...etc.

, This is a very important thing and here the budget needs to be kept in mind. For a family reunion a perfect place would be a famous theme park or may be at the old family homestead. Whatever it may be, see to it that it is convenient for everybody.

, This is the success mantra. No one would like to attend a dull party where elders are just chit chatting because they have nothing else to do and kids are playing some game to pass their time. Some activities are a must. Signing family T-shirts is an all time favorite. For this, you will need some white T-shirts and markers. Mark each T-shirt with reunion year and then ask everyone to sign each other's T-shirts, Everyone will love it and take it home as a favor.

, Gift each of the family members with these handmade bookmarks. For this you will need ribbons, cardboard, colored pens and some glitters, etc.

, Greet them well by making sure they receive the best of delicacies and food is served promptly. The accommodations should be comfortable. Take plenty of photos and make your family reunion memorable. Create a scrapbook. Shoot a video. Share old albums.

Arrange live entertainment for the party.",How to Plan a Fall‐Themed Birthday Party," Begin by creating a guest list for the party. Having a set guest list will help you get a sense of how big the location needs to be as well as how much party supplies you will need. You can write the invited guests on a piece of paper or in a spreadsheet. If you are inviting a lot of people to the party, a spreadsheet may be the way to go.You may base the number of people you invite on your budget for the party. If you have a large budget for the party, you may invite a lot of people. A small budget may mean a smaller guest list.
When you make the guest list, be sure to consider any spouses, children, or plus ones in your total tally for the party.
If you are planning the fall themed birthday party for someone else, ask them who they would like to invite.;
, An indoor space may be a good option if you want the party to feel intimate and cozy, especially if it’s going to be a bit nippy outside. You may host the party in your home or rent an indoor space. Look for an indoor space that has a lot of natural light and big windows so guests can admire the fall colors outside.If you have a smaller guest list, an indoor space may be ideal. If you have a lot of people on the guest list, make sure the indoor space can accommodate them all.

, An outdoor space may be ideal if you know the weather is going to be crisp and fall-like outside on the date of the party. You may host the party in your backyard or rent an outdoor space. Having the party in your yard can give it a casual, friendly atmosphere.If you decide to use an outdoor space, make sure you have a plan B in case the weather is bad. Your plan B may be moving the party to the following weekend when the weather is better or having it indoors at your house instead.

, Make the party feel festive by getting plates, cups, and bowls that have fall images like leaves, pumpkins, and hay bales. Go for plastic cutlery in fall colors or wrap metal cutlery in fall themed napkins.You can also be extra crafty and use halved pumpkins as bowls for the party. Get a large pumpkin, cut it open, and remove the seeds. Then, line it with napkins or use a small plastic bowl and fill it with snacks.

, A welcome table in fall colors can be a great way to greet guests as they walk into the party. Get small and large pumpkins for the table as well as fresh flowers in fall colors. You can also add acorns, leaves, and tree branches to the table.Create a birthday garland to drape over the table, spelling out “Happy Birthday” in fall colors.
If you are planning to have a guest book for guests to sign to wish the person happy birthday, put it on the welcome table. Pick a guestbook in fall colors.

, If you are having food tables at the party, make centerpieces for them. Put fresh flowers in mason jars or tin cans. Use flowers in reds, oranges, and greens to add to the fall theme. You can also include small pumpkins and gourds as part of the centerpieces.To make the centerpieces more personal, include a funny photograph of the birthday guest of honor.
For a children's party, put toys on the tables as part of the centerpieces.

, Hay bales add just the right amount of fall flair to a party. Place hay bales at the welcome table as well as at the food tables. Use hay bales at any activity or game stations at the party.If you are short on chairs, you can cover hay bales with blankets and use them as seats.

, If you are going to have food or drinks at the party, determine if you are going to prepare them yourself or hire a catering company. You may hire a bartender to run the bar and ask them to prepare fall-themed cocktails. You can also work with the caterer to come up with a fall themed food menu.Possible food ideas for the party include berry pies, cinnamon donuts, and fried chicken. Drink ideas include apple cider, hot toddies, and cinnamon hot chocolate.
For a children's birthday, you may have fall-themed cupcakes and kid-friendly snacks like chips, mini pizzas, and pigs-in-a-blanket. Make sure you also have kid-friendly drinks like juice, soda, and water.

, Make sure you decorate the party space a few hours before the party is set to begin. Ask friends and family to help you set up the supplies and decorations. Assign each person a task so the decorating can get done quickly and efficiently.You may prepare items like the table centerpieces ahead of time so you can just put them out the day of the party.

, If you are serving food and drinks at the party, create stations with tables so guests can access the food and drinks easily. You may have a long food table with plates where guests can serve themselves, family style. You can also have a main bar area where guests can order drinks.


If you have a lot of people at the party, you may have more than one food or drink station set up so guests do not have to wait in long lines.
If you are having a fall themed birthday cake for the party, you may set up a separate cake table to showcase the cake.

, Have apples in large buckets of water setup for apple bobbing. Put out a craft table for fall themed crafts like leave stenciling or decorating acorns. Have a games table with board games or outdoor games like soccer, badminton, or crochet.You can also arrange sack races or three-legged races, especially if there are going to be kids in attendance.

, Another good entertainment for the party could be a live band. Maybe you get a cover band of the birthday guest of honor’s favorite band. Or you may find a fun local band and ask them to play the party.If you can’t afford to hire live entertainment, an iPod or a good playlist on your computer is always a good option. Set up speakers so the music can be heard throughout the party, creating a festive vibe.

,
Design a fantastic spectacle food called a ""soltetie"" to present to your guests.,
Allow a lot of time for your feast.,
Follow your feast with music and dancing.",How to Make a Medieval Feast," Large dinners in the middle ages consisted of many courses.


Begin with soup, broth, fruits and greens. These foods are digested easily and were often served at the start of the feast. ""Sallad"" or salad was a popular first course. Scallions, boiled carrots, lettuce, turnips, nuts, herbs, vinegar and oil could be used to make a salad. Breads were also served.
Cheese was often served both at the beginning and end of the meal. Many people considered cheese necessary for good digestion.
Follow the soup course with green vegetables and light meat courses consisting of poultry, lean meat, or fish. Frequently these meats where served with sauces.
Serve the heaviest, richest foods in smaller portions. These were served in the middle of the meal. Roasted meats were often served on the spit.
Sweets were served at the end of the meal, as we still do today. Fruits, cakes and puddings are desserts you could serve at your medieval dinner. As mentioned earlier, a last course of cheese can also be offered.;
, Non-alcoholic fruit juices and ciders can also be served. The important thing is to never let your guests go thirsty.

, Servers also brought in basins of perfumed water and napkins so guests could wash their hands.

, Try to make your table rich and elaborate with other historically-appropriate decorations. The medieval feast should always be colorful and visually exciting.


Use elaborate silver and gold candlesticks. Lots of candles were used to illuminate dark halls.
Plates were made of silver and gold for the wealthiest diners, but ordinary guests used pewter or even wood platters.
Try to find a large saltcellar to display at the right hand of the ""master of the house."" Salt was a precious commodity used to both season and preserve food. It was stored in a special container and given pride of place.
Spoons and knives were the chief utensils used at a feast during the middle ages. Forks were rare. It was normal for guests to simply use their fingers to pick up their food.
Drinking vessels were usually made of pewter or wood. Glass was rare but was used more often as the middle ages progressed. Very wealthy people used silver and gold.

,, These were usually crafted of sugar and made to look like something fanciful. Disguised food was also very popular. For instance a cake would be made to look like a pig's head or a fish.

, Don't rush the meal or festivities. Medieval feasts historically went on for hours.

, People in the middle ages loved to dance and then, as today, used dancing as a way to meet people of the opposite sex.

Serve food afterwards.",How to Host a Wine Tasting Party," One of the most important parts of hosting a wine tasting is deciding what kind of wines you want to try. There's no right answer that will please all your guests or lead to a perfect party, but here are some suggestions:Sample different wines from one region, such as Napa Valley, Santa Barbara wine country, Willamette Valley, Rioja, New Zealand, the South of France, or whatever you like.Taste varietals produced in different parts of the world, such as drinking only the Cabernet Sauvignon produced in Napa Valley, France, or Argentina.
Do a horizontal tasting. Taste only 2012 Chardonnays produced all over the world. This may be tricky to find, though.
Do a tasting by one winemaker. If you really like Robert Mondavi, Cake bread, Stag's Leap, or Duckhorn wine, for example, try several different wines from this one winemaker.
Sample only reds, whites, sparkling wines, or dessert wines. Just remember that dessert wines tend to be sweeter and may be more difficult to taste.;
, You shouldn't be eating during the wine tasting, other than the bread or crackers that will be needed to cleanse your palate. So, you should decide whether you want to give your guests a light meal before the tasting, serve dinner after the tasting, or serve appetizers or dessert after the tasting. Ideally, some sort of food should be provided so your guests don't get wine drunk without anything to absorb the alcohol.


You can tell your guests what the situation is when you invite them, so they know if they should come with a full stomach, or if they should prepare to eat.

, It's not realistic that you'll be able to give each of your guests a new wine glass before every new tasting. Realistically, just one glass per guest will do, or one longer, less oval-shaped glass for whites and a rounder, larger glass for reds, if you're feeling up to it.


The glasses should have stems so the guests don't warm the wine with their hands.
The glasses should be clear so the guests can see the color of the wine.

, There are a number of supplies you'll need to host a wine-tasting party in addition to the wine glasses. Here are some to get you started:Obviously, the wine. Pick your wines based on the theme you'll be going for. In general, it's good to have wines in different price ranges, from pretty cheap to more expensive, if you can afford it. Make sure that you have enough wine for your guests -- a bottle of wine can pour 5 regular glasses of wine, or enough for 6-10 people to taste the wine.
Back-up corkscrews in case yours break.
A wine opener.
A spittoon. This can either come in the form of a large bowl in the center of the table or as small paper cups for each guest.
An ice bucket for chilling white wine. This will keep you from running to the fridge.
A white tablecloth or white napkins. This will help your guests see the color profiles of the wines.
A tasting grid. This can help your guests identify the flavors of the wine and jot down their impressions. You can find some great ones online.An aerator or decanter for the wine. This can help bring out the flavors in a red wine.
Bread or crackers to taste in between wines.
Cups of ice water for your guests as well as a pitcher of water for the table.

, The ideal number of guests you should invite to a wine tasting should be between 6-12 people. If you have a nice big dining room table, invite enough people so that they can comfortably stand around it. You don't want any extra people leaning over the group and making everyone feel uncomfortable. If you really want to be formal and fancy about it, you can send out nice invitations or e-vites.


You should try to invite people who have a similar knowledge about wine. If everyone knows almost nothing, then that's fine, but you want to avoid the awkwardness of having just one person who knows absolutely nothing, or that one guy who is Mr. Wine Expert and tries to educate everyone else at great length.

, You can host a wine tasting party any time of the year. If you want to keep it thematic, though, you can taste white wines during the summer and taste red wines during the winter. Additionally, since you shouldn't really be eating during the tasting because it will ruin the flavor of the wine, so you should invite your guests over at around 4 PM, when they don't want dinner yet, or after they've eaten, at 9 PM or so, though that may be a little late.

, Put your wines out on the table so the guests can see what they're going to taste and get even more excited for the night. If the table's not big enough, arrange the wines on a visible counter. Arrange the glasses, water, napkins, crackers, bread, and paper cups or spittoons for your guests.


Don't put out any flowers or scented candles. This strong aroma can make it more difficult to recognize the flavors of the wine. Opt for a bowl of grapes instead.

, It doesn't take much to taste wine and look like an expert. Just tell your guests what they're going to drink, have them hold the glass and swirl it around for a few seconds to let the wine ""breathe,"" and then make them smell the wine to get a better sense of the flavor. After that, your guests should take a small sip of the wine, swirl it around their mouths for several seconds, and then either swallow it or spit it out.

, The order does matter when it comes to tasting wines. You should start from the lightest wine to the darkest, so work your way from a light white to a dark, flavorful red wine. If you have dessert wine on the menu, you should taste it last, even if it's a lighter color than some of the red wines.


Wines that are similar, like the same varietal of wine for 2011 and 2012, should be tasted one after the other.

, Let people write down their impressions and give them time to think about it. People may be a little shy about their impressions because they don't feel like experts, so make sure to make them feel comfortable. Giving everyone a minute to think will also keep people from getting affected by the opinions of others. Here are some things to look for as you take notes:Aromas and flavors. Any flavor or aroma that comes to mind should be written down, whether it's blackberry, honey, lemon, chocolate, pear, earth, or pomegranate.
Texture and weight. See if the wine is light and crisp, full-bodied, rough, or smooth.
Balance. Does the wine have a smooth mixture of flavors, or does one flavor, such as oak or tannins, dominate the beverage?
The finish. See if the wine lingers on your palate or if it disappears the second you swallow it. A good wine should linger.

, If you want to host a classy wine tasting party, then you'll need to provide your guests with an air of calm, competence, and comfort. If you're tripping all over yourself or not making any sense, then the guests won't take the party seriously and may stop paying attention to you. Instead, spit out more wine than you drink and wait until after the wine tasting is over to really go for the wine, if that's your game plan.

, If you want to kick your wine tasting party up a notch, play a fun game where you put the wine bottles in brown paper bags and pour the wine for your guests without telling them which wine it is. The winner could get a prize, or just the satisfaction of knowing that he is an expert wine taster.

, If you want to keep your guests at your place and to make sure they don't get completely drunk, then it's important to serve them some food. You can serve more dessert-style foods if it's the right time.(If the guests are really hungry during the tasting, of course, then it's best to give them something to keep them happy and not too drunk than to wait.) Here is some food that goes well with fine wine:


Prosciutto wrapped around melon
Cheese
A light pear salad
Chocolate
Fruit compote
Flan

Find the perfect space.,
Get loads of people.,
Buy a lot of beer or age appropriate drinks.,
Build a huge fire.,
Have fun!",How to Make a Killer Beach Party," Beach parties are typically on the ocean, but if you don't live anywhere near coast, you can use lakes or rivers. If you don't live near any sort of natural water, good luck holding a beach party. try to find a spot with lots of places to sit, such as logs, rocks, etc. Of there is none, bring camping chairs.;
, You can have a good time with just a few people, but with beach parties it is better to have as many people as you can wrangle up. Don't invite complete strangers, though. Try to keep it with just people that you trust, but be careful, as you can't control who goes to the beach.

, Beer is a very convenient drink for outside parties such as these, so I suggest you buy a lot. You could tell people to buy their own, but you should at least have some backups for you and your buddies. You can also drink other bottled/canned drinks, such as ciders, or pre-mixed, I definitely do not recommend hard bar, because it can be inconvenient to have a big bottle, if you want to shoot it, or mix it. If you simply have to, try using pop or water bottles to carry it in. Don't forget the food!!

, Fires are essential to beach parties. Without a bonfire, all you've got is a bunch of people hanging out on the dark beach. Build it in a place that is away from flammable objects, like trees, bushes, grass. Find a safe place for it. Ask somebody where you could put the fire if you don't know. Ask your fire department if there are any fire restrictions in your area, also.

, Forget about your stresses or anything that might bother you, just let loose and have a good time.

Pirate Party Ideas For a Fancy Dress Outfit


With this party it’s a great excuse for fancy dress, it will add to the theme and help to create a great atmosphere.,
Arriving at the party is your first opportunity to create an impression, so let’s go all out!,
Pirate Party ideas for Outside Decorations


If you have a drive or approach of any kind to your home (even if it’s just from the street to the door) then with a few creative pirate party ideas you can create a really exciting arrival for your guests.,
If the weathers good then out in the garden can be a great setting for a pirate party and with a few well chosen decorating ideas you can transform your outside area into a desert island or pirate’s secret hide away.,
For Pirate party ideas for treasure chest contents try some of these...




Have some tinsel and backing foil spilling out
A little bit of junk jewellery
Metallic cups and fancy looking vases
Silver & Gold plates
Silky scarves and bright and glittery material



,
Once you start to look around your home at all the things that could look like treasure you’ll be surprised at what you will find.,
Pirate Party Ideas for Inside Decorations


Not everyone lives where the weather will allow outside parties but a pirate party can easily be transferred inside.",How to Host a Pirate Themed Party,";
, They can be created using pattern card or decorate them as you please. Create a good silhouette of your choice and then maybe just add details.

,,, Pirate costumes are so easy to put together, here’s a few ideas for you:

Old pairs of trousers can be tucked into wellies / boots or into long socks. Or you can cut them off at the knees and make them ragged or tie them around the leg just under the knee.
An old shirt or t-shirt can be used and if you don’t mind then again a few well placed tears help with the look.


If you have an old waistcoat then these look great over the shirts. I have even used an old striped pillowcase:

Cut across the bottom of the open end and remove the flap.
Cut up the centre of one side and then near the top of the closed end cut outwards to the left and right creating a V shape for the neck.
Cut out sleeve holes on both sides.


It doesn’t have to be perfect, once all the other elements are added you’ll be surprised just how great it will look.

Next a couple of belts are needed, these can be fastened on the last holes and then placed over the shoulders, one left one right so that they cross over the chest.
If there are no hats available then a bandannas create a classic pirate look.
A bright piece of material or scarf can be tied around the waist and fastened to the side like a sash, the pirates sword can be secured here.
A bit of costume junk Jewellery looks good hanging out of pockets or just placed around the neck, the pirate’s ill gotten gains...


Pirate party ideas for those nice little touches that turn a good costume into great:

a rolled up map
a parrot
a sword
a small treasure chest
an eye patch
Face paint can add a great touch, scars and battle wounds, black marks, black eyes and teeth.



,


Great pirate party ideas for the children arriving might be one or more than the following ideas:

Eye patch
A pirate name badge with a specially created pirate name for each child:

Tommy the terrible
Black eyed Joe
Captain Jack


Face paint a scar
A make-believe sword



,

Place old fashions looking signs made out of cardboard pointing in the direction the party goes must go. The wording can go something like this:

Pirate Joe's party this way
Treasure Island Adventures
Only really terrible pirate allowed
Dead man swamp
A skull and crossbones flag made out of an odd piece of material.





,


Great pirate party ideas are the simplest:

Cardboard boxes from the supermarket can be spray painted gold or silver or even paint them brown like wood, now you have your pirate treasure chests. Pile these up and they can look very convincing.



,, It doesn’t have to be perfect but the overall effect will be great.

, I find here that having your party inside, lends itself to the theme of a ‘Secret Pirates Cave.’ Here are a few pirate party ideas for indoors...

Use coloured lighting - remove the usual light bulbs and replace with red and green light bulbs these seem to work the best. If you can place some in lamps too, that helps. Make some rooms green and some red, when you mix two colours in one room they seem to lose their effect a little.
Use bright, silky and sparkly material to drape over doorways so that other rooms remain hidden until you go through.
Drape sheets and materials over tables and chairs and then pile on top your treasure chests and pirate loot. Loosely spread around odd bits, metallic cups, vases, costume jewellery, beads that look like jewels.
Place signs on doors either inviting them in or barring the way...

""Dead man's chest""
""Tricky man's tavern""
""Only the foolhardy enter""
A skull and crossbones


Place a couple of palm trees painted on large sections of cardboard around the garden. Again you can get these from local super markets.
Paint and cut out simple shapes of barrels that would be found around a harbour.
Print pictures of brightly coloured parrots out and glue on the cardboard and place these around the garden, maybe perch them up in trees.
Draw an old looking treasure map maybe base it on the garden, later it can be used in a treasure hunt game.
You could use a tent and decorate the inside as a cave and place the treasure inside. If you’re indoors maybe you could select one room for this purpose, keeping the lighting low to add mystery.

Have all your guests gather once the murderer has been revealed and the prize or prizes have been awarded.",How to Host a Murder Mystery Party," Most kits contain the script, the rules of the game, ideas for costumes, and recipe ideas. Therefore, you should try to include these elements in your own design.


If you decide to create your own game, make sure the story is somewhat believable, scary, and interesting.
Divide your story up into scenes which can be acted out as the evening progresses.
Give each character his or her own backstorythat's not only unique, but that also fits in with the clues.
Make sure that it is possible to discover the villain by taking note of the clues, asking questions of the other protagonists, and piecing it all together. Although there will be several suspects, of course, only the guilty person should fit the bill.;
, Don’t be afraid to experiment with offbeat ideas, such as a mystery within a high fantasy theme or apocalyptic wasteland. Obviously, if you go with a ready-made kit, you’ll be limited by what themes are available, but even so, you can still find one that is adaptable to your needs.

, For smaller gatherings of no more than eight to 10 people, your home should suffice. However, for larger groups,a dining hall or other public location would be better.


Another consideration for the location is the time of year. Unless you live in a temperate climate such as California, you’re not going to want to hold your party outdoors during the winter.

, Your theme will determine what kinds of objects you’ll need to create the setting for your mystery. You can often make use of items you have around the house, like old shoes for making footprints or knives for the murder weapon. Otherwise, thrift shops and garage sales are good places to find props, and are relatively inexpensive, too.

, Some people decide to give out one prize to the person who solves the murder, while others decide to give out prizes for other accomplishments, as well. Giving one prize works best to bring out the guests’ competitive instincts, while multiple prizes encourage more wheeling and dealing.


Multiple prize ideas include things like best costume, best performance, wealthiest player, and more.

, Murder mystery parties are better when they include a buffet meal or a potluck rather than a full course meal. The main reason for this is that it frees the host up to concentrate on the action, knowing that the food is prepared and ready.


Plan as many courses as you have scenes in your murder mystery.
If you decide to have a full course meal, then either have help with the party or play a lesser character so you won't be overwhelmed.

, Check with your friends ahead of time to get a feel for when they will be available before you set a date. This is especially true if you want to hold your party during a busy time of year, such as over the Christmas holidays.

, Only invite people who are going to become really involved in the fun. Everyone present needs to play their parts enthusiastically. They don’t have to be wonderful actors, just willing to forget their inhibitions and pretend to be somebody else for a few hours.


You will know which of your guests will relish playing a character who has quite a bit to say and do, and which would prefer a smaller, insignificant role.
The best way to make sure that everyone has a good time is to ask your friends who is interested in participating. Let their responses be your guide.

, Give them out at least three to six weeksprior to the event. If you’re holding your party during a busy season, you may want to send them out earlier. The more time you allow, the easier it is on you and the guests.


Arrange for the cast to arrive at the location earlier than the other guests so that they can get ready for when the others get there.
Tell your cast members to keep their characters a secret, even from partners or spouses! It really gets the party off to a great start if nobody knows who anybody else is until the last minute.

, If you’re holding the party at your home, you can decorate the day before. If you’re having it somewhere else, get there early in the day to decorate and get everything ready.

, Arrange more intimate place settings rather than having everyone gather around a single, long table. Your guests need to be able to share ideas among themselves as the plot moves along.


Consider adding candlesto the table or tables to enhance the ambiance.

, Since most of the action will take place around the dining table or wherever you choose to have everyone gather, good places to plant clues include under your guest’s plates, underneath the sofa cushions, or under your guest’s chairs.If you're going to have your guests roaming around, you can put clues in other spots, like bookshelves or in desk drawers.

, If you’re having a full course meal rather than a potluck or buffet style dinner, try to get as much of the cooking done early. You want to be free to mingle with your guests and to participate in the game yourself, as well.

, Offer them drinks and appetizers. Ideally, have them gather in one area so that the mystery may commence as soon as everyone shows up.

, Allow them to get to know who everybody is by circulating and asking questions. It’s a great icebreaker and helps to get everyone into the story.

, Don't rush through the meal. Let your guests linger over their food and chat with each other about who they think the murderer might be.


Be mindful that your guests' conversations don't stray to other subjects. It's normal for conversations to wander, but try to keep it to a minimum.

, You can allow cast members to mingle with your guests in between scenes, and depending on their roles, they can either give helpful clues or clues that misdirect. Don't let anyone become too sure they've solved the murder!

, Not only will the right musicenhance the mood, it will also cover up any lulls in the conversation. Having an Mp3 player or CD changer set to continuous shuffle is a great way to keep the music playing.

, It is always fun for your guests to sit around and start revealing some of their secrets, or the schemes they had going on.


Everyone will be amazed at how much was going on under their noses the whole time!

You could decorate the invitations with palm trees, hula girls, or surfers. You could also choose invitations with beach themes, flowers, or ocean scenes., It won’t be much of a stretch to ask your guests to wear their swimsuits, sundresses, or shorts. Hawaiian-style (flower printed or ""island"" themed) shirts, board shorts, or skirts are easy to find during the summer. Ask your guests to wear sandals, or provide them with inexpensive flip-flops decorated with fake flowers., If you are planning to make real flower leis, you can make them the night before the party. If not, paper leis are great as well. Place one over the head of each guest as they arrive to get them in the spirit of the party., Hawaii is green, lush, and filled with tropical flowers. Emulate the Hawaiian landscape by decorating your space with bright colors. Choose tablecloths in bright colors like red or blue or prints such as flowers or tiki masks. Add accents in complementary colors., You could fill vases or bowls with fresh flowers, such as plumeria, hibiscus, or bird of paradise to give your tables a Hawaiian feel. Another idea is to fill small buckets with sand and place shells, flowers, or even tea lights in the sand. You could even hollow out a pineapple and fill it with flowers or tiny paper umbrellas., Not only is bamboo biodegradable and compostable, it will also help set the stage for your Hawaiian party. Pick up plates, forks, knives, and spoons made from bamboo at a party store, or order them online. Pair them with festive cloth napkins., Tiki torches are reminiscent of Hawaiian beach parties. Grab some from a party supply store or garden store, and firmly stake them around your yard. Depending where you live, tiki torches may be hard to find. You can substitute them with any kind of outside light such as lanterns.Keep a fire extinguisher handy in case of any accidents.

, Choose candles in scents like coconut, lime, plumeria, or ocean air. Set them around your space to give off tropical scents and set the mood., Using greenery to decorate your space will be sure to put your guests in a Hawaiian mood. Check your local garden store for greenery to decorate with. Put potted plants around your space, or decorate your table with a grass skirt. You can even line your serving trays with banana or palm leaves., Stock up on inflatable items, from beach balls to palm trees and sharks. These would be perfect for a pool party, but can also be placed around your yard or home. You could use a small inflatable pool as your cooler; simply fill it with ice and add drinks., Nothing says Hawaii quite like a delicious seafood dish. Grill mahi mahi or salmon, or serve sushi. You could also set out cocktail shrimp for an appetizer, or make seafood kabobs., Ham and pineapple are the traditional toppings for a Hawaiian pizza. Create a station so guests can make their own pizzas, or make them ahead of time. You can even order pizza if you don’t want to spend your time cooking., Though a hamburger may not be traditional Hawaiian fare, it’s perfect for a Hawaiian-themed party happening stateside. Offer a couple varieties, like veggie burgers, cheeseburgers, or burgers stuffed with bacon or onions. Set out a variety of toppings as well, like lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard., Poi is a traditional Hawaiian dish made from taro root. To make your own, simply peel and steam taro root. Mash the taro with a stone pestle or a “poi pounder.” Add water until the poi is smooth and sticky. Then serve it to your guests for an authentic Hawaiian meal., Pineapple, guava, papaya, lychee, and coconut are perfect for a Hawaiian party. You could also add dragon fruit, bananas, starfruit, and raspberries. Serve them separately, or slice them up and make a big fruit salad for your guests., Something spicy will be perfect for your Hawaiian party. Scoop out the inside of jalapenos, and stuff them with cheese, bacon, or shrimp. Then, simply toss them on the grill., Cocktails such as a Blue Hawaii or a Mai Tai would be perfect for your adult guests. For children, offer tropical juice, like pineapple, or water infused with fruit. Garnish the drinks with fruit or paper umbrellas. You can even serve them in coconut halves to take your theme all the way.

, Pineapple upside down cake is a perfect dish for this party. Make your own, or buy one from the market, and serve it to your guests for a refreshing and delicious dessert., Playing a movie based in Hawaii is a great way to set the mood for your event. Consider movies such as Blue Hawaii, 50 First Dates, or Blue Crush for adults, and Moana or Lilo and Stitch for children., Make a beach or Hawaiian-themed Bingo board for your guests. Use words associated with Hawaii, such as luau, hula, and island. Call out the terms and have your guests mark them down if they have them on their card. Choose a winner based on the first person to get a row or column, or even their entire board marked off., Get a CD of Hawaiian music or download Hawaiian .mp3s from the internet. For relaxing moods, you could play Kapena or Israel Kamakawiwo'ole. Or, choose upbeat music like Three Plus or Ten Feet. Research local artists, such as Pepper and Jack Johnson.Another option is to hire Polynesian drummers or Hawaiian musicians for your party., Grass skirts are traditional Hawaiian apparel. You can make or buy the grass skirts ahead of time, or make them as a group activity. It would be extra fun if you can find someone who can teach you all a few hula moves. Play the music and dance the night away.

, The limbo is a fun activity for your Hawaiian party. Get a bamboo pole from your local hardware store to use as the pole and see how low you can go! Set aside a pretty lei for the winner, or award them with sunblock or a Hawaiian shirt., Get several hula hoops for your guests to use. Lay them out around the yard for people to use as they like. You could also hold a contest, such as seeing who can hula hoop the longest, or who can do the most loops in 2 minutes., If you have the space, and the budget, consider hiring fire dancers for your party. Hawaiian fire dancing is a tradition dating back to ancient times, originating after volcanoes erupted and spread lava over the islands. Hiring Hawaiian fire dancers will give your party an authentic island feel."

Plan activities for plus-ones and guests.",How to Plan a High School Reunion," High school reunions involve a lot of coordination. There are venues to reserve, catering to organize, and dates to save. To ensure that you leave yourself enough time to plan a great reunion, begin to organize your committee at least 12 months prior to your reunion date. You do not want to have to rush or slap together a reunion at the last minute.Keep in mind that high school graduates can disperse quite widely. Your committee members might live in other states or even other countries. Some classmates might have changed their names. The earlier you begin assembling your committee, the more time you will have to reach out to the appropriate people.;
, Many high schools have an alumni office. If the alumni office handles reunions, they might be able to assist you with the reunion planning. If they do not typically handle reunions, they might be able to assist you in other ways, such as by providing contact information for your classmates or suggesting local venues. Before making any official decisions, talk to your high school administrators about how other class reunions were handled and about whether there are any class gifts you can use to help fund your reunion., Some high schools appoint a reunion committee prior to high school graduation. For example, many high schools ask their Class President or Student Council Members to take on the role of reunion planning. If your high school has already appointed a reunion committee, you will simply have to get in touch with the right people. Write them an email or begin a phone chain to get the ball rolling on your reunion plan.


If you have lost touch with other members of your reunion committee, contact an administrator at your old high school. Many high schools maintain an alumni contact list.

, Some high schools do not appoint a reunion committee prior to graduation. And sometimes pre-designated reunion committee members are unable to fulfill their roles. In this case, you will have to formulate your own high school reunion committee. Send an email to your high school class list or use a Facebook group to ask for volunteers who can help with this important task. Remember that the best planning committee members will have the following traits:


Planning committee members should be able to devote at least 5-10 hours per month on reunion tasks during the 12 months leading up to the reunion.
Members should be able to devote significantly more time during the final 4-6 weeks before the reunion.
A planning committee should be diverse and represent students with a variety of interests.You do not want your planning committee to be cliquish or exclusive: a high school reunion is for everyone.
A committee should be large enough to allow tasks to be delegated to several members but small enough to be manageable. A committee size of 3-12 members is ideal, depending on high school class size. Having one committee member for every 25 class members is a good rule of thumb.Committee members should be organized people who can multitask effectively.

, A high school reunion involves a lot of moving parts. A single person cannot handle all these roles in addition to their other responsibilities in life. Use task delegation in order to make sure that everybody on the committee is pulling his or her weight.Try to divide tasks fairly evenly. You should try to stick to your designated tasks as much as possible, while remaining flexible in case a task proves to be particularly difficult or time-consuming for your committee member. Your committee will likely need to appoint specific members to handle the following tasks:A committee chair who helps keep committee meetings on track.
A secretary who takes and communicates meeting notes and maintains a meeting calendar
A communications team that gathers contact information for classmates and sets up a website, Facebook group, and email list to notify classmates of the reunion
An events team to scout possible venues and research vendors (caterers, bartenders, DJs, photographers, hotels, etc.)
A financial subcommittee who manages the budget and handles registration, ticket sales, and donations
A decorating committee who helps set up, decorate, and clean up the reunion space
A welcome committee who staffs the reunion event itself, greets attendees, and manages volunteers who help staff the event
An activities coordinator who helps plan entertainment surrounding the reunion, such as a class softball game, outing, or other events

, One of your committee members should be in charge of setting a meeting schedule to keep everyone on the same page. Decide to meet at predetermined intervals and put them in your calendar right away. Aim to meet twice a month while you are in the early stages of the planning process (2-12 months before the reunion) and once a week in the final two months before the reunion.


If your committee members live in other cities or states, use video chats or conference calls to keep one another updated appropriately., Some tasks are more important than others, and some tasks have to be done before other tasks can be completed. It is therefore important that your committee develops a sensible timeline to allow your reunion planning to run smoothly.Every reunion is different, but the following timeline is a good starting point:


12+ months in advance: organize planning committee, create tentative budget, open a bank account, gather classmate names and contact information, begin to narrow down a reunion date, contact your high school, propose several venue options6-12 months in advance: finalize event date, finalize budget, book venue and key vendors (caterer, photographer, etc.), promote event to classmates, determine ticket pricing, look for missing classmate contact information2-6 months in advance: sell tickets and gather RSVPs, continue promoting the event, order any special decorations or souvenirs, gather supplies for the event, recruit volunteers to help assist with the eventFinal two months: finalize guest list, provide final counts to your vendors, assemble decorations and other supplies (such as nametags), confirm your vendors, email reminders to your guests, finalize a registration procedure, decorate the space, provide specific schedule of the reunion day to your volunteers and guests, You will be gathering a lot of information from a lot of people. It will be important for you to keep everything organized so that your invitations get sent to the correct parties. Create a spreadsheet that you can continue to update as you gather names, addresses, and email addresses. The following categories should be included in your spreadsheet:


Current name of the classmate
Former name of the classmate (if relevant)
Classmate's spouse or domestic partner
Classmate's address
Classmate's email address
Classmate's phone number
Classmate's social media contact information

, Most high schools maintain a detailed list of their graduates, including name changes and updated contact information. Your first step to developing a thorough invite list is to gather a list of all your class members from your school. This will likely provide the bulk of the names, email addresses, and addresses you will require.

, It is possible that your school's alumni office will leave off a few names for members of your class. Compare the list from the alumni office to your old yearbooks. Note any discrepancies between the two lists, and add names from the yearbook to your contact list.

, Facebook is a great way to keep track of former classmates as they move and change names.Set up a Facebook group early on and invite as many of your former classmates as you can find. Encourage group members to track down their friends and acquaintances from your class. Hopefully word will spread that a reunion is imminent.


The Facebook group is a way to assemble an invite list as well as update class members about how the reunion planning is going. Be sure to send the group relevant updates in order to boost excitement.

, At this point, you might have a spotty contact list for your classmates. You might have the addresses for some classmates and nothing but a Facebook update from others. Fill in the gaps by taking the time to confirm the contact information for all your classmates. Use the information you have to get in direct touch with them: call the classmates whose phone numbers you have, email the classmates whose email addresses you have, send Facebook messages to group members, and send letters to classmates whose physical addresses you have. Ask them to confirm all of their contact information with you. You can also ask them how they prefer to be contacted and note that in your spreadsheet.

, After you have filled in your contact list, go ahead and have your communications team put together an email listserv for your high school class. You can use the email list to notify classmates of important reunion updates and to gather information from them as necessary.

, There are usually a few people who are hard to track down after graduation. They might move abroad, change their names, or lose touch with their high school friends. Create a list of these ""missing classmates"" whom you are unable to contact. Use the Facebook group and email listserv to ask about these missing classmates. Perhaps another classmate might know how to get in touch with them.

, Drum up excitement and attendance for the reunion by posting frequently to the email listserv and Facebook group. Let people know when you have settled on a venue, and let them know why they should be excited to attend.

, Unfortunately, sometimes high school classmates pass away over the years. If you find that one of your classmates has passed away, create an ""In Memoriam"" list. This will allow you and your classmates to pay the proper tribute to them during the event. Perhaps the loved ones of your dead classmates might be willing to provide you with a photograph or other memento you can use to remember them at your reunion.

, Reunions can be funded through alumni donations, class gifts, alumni association dues, or ticket sales. No matter how you handle the finances of your reunion, you will want to keep meticulous records. This task will likely fall to your Class Treasurer or reunion committee member who will handle ticket sales. Make sure that any money you collect for the reunion is being spent responsibly and that you stick to your budget., Perhaps you already have funds available from class gifts or alumni association dues. Or perhaps the money from the event will have to come entirely from ticket sales. No matter what, you need to determine a total budget for the event. Make sure that you do not rely on high ticket sales or expensive tickets. You want the event to be manageable for everyone, and expensive tickets can hurt attendance. Make sure you keep room in your budget for:


Bartending and catering
Event space rental
Party supply rental (tables, chairs, cups, a/v equipment, etc.)
Decorations
Souvenirs (gift bags, special T-shirts, etc.)
Other vendors (photographers, clean-up crews, DJs, etc.)

, Ideally, a reunion will be on a weekend during the late spring or summer, when people are more able to travel freely. Your reunion could be a full weekend affair with many activities, or it can simply be a gathering on a Friday or Saturday evening. If you like, you can ask your classmates to vote on several possibilities for a reunion date. By using a Doodle poll or Google survey, you can encourage attendance amongst your guests.

, A vital part of the planning is considering exactly where you are going to hold the event. Be sure that the venue is appropriate for the size of your gathering, the tone you wish to set, and your budget. The venue should also be a short drive from your old high school to make it easy for classmates to attend. Some excellent venues to consider include:


Your old high school gym or auditorium
A local hotel ballroom
A banquet hall or restaurant
A community center
A park picnic site

, Use your contact list to send invitations to all your high school classmates. Be sure that you include their spouses or significant others on the invitations. If your reunion is a daytime, family-friendly event, tell your classmates that they are free to bring their children as well. (An evening event might not be child-appropriate, however.) The invitations can be digital invitations that you send out by email, or they can be paper invitations you send through the mail. No matter what, you will have to include the following information on your invitations:


Date and time of the event
Who is invited, including whether plus-ones, children, or friends are welcome
Location of the event
Dress code, if necessary (e.g. whether attendees should dress formally or casually)
The cost per person of attending. Will the event be free, or will attendees have to pay a small fee? Be sure you specify how exactly your guest should pay (by check, PayPal, etc.).
Activities attendees should prepare for. Will there be quiz games? Sports activities? Dancing? Will dinner be provided? Give your attendees some specific information about what they can expect from the reunion.
Other important logistical information. For example, if you are reserving nearby hotel rooms for guests or a transport bus, you should inform your attendees.
Instructions on how to RSVP and when they must RSVP by. Should attendees send you an email, fill out a Google poll, or mail in a reply card? Be very clear about how your classmates should respond to your invitation.

, The kind of vendors you hire will depend on the type of event you are hosting. Perhaps your event will be a simple drinks-only event, or perhaps it will be a sit-down dinner. No matter what, however, you will need to hire some vendors to take care of important event details. A high school reunion is likely too large an event for you to handle it all yourself. Vendors to consider include:


A licensed and insured bartender
A licensed and insured caterer
A DJ
A photographer
A bus driver (if your reunion takes place in two or more different places)

, Do you want your reunion to be formal and dressy? Casual and laid-back? Would you like there to be a theme for your reunion, such as one related to your high school mascot or a theme that is reminiscent of a high school dance? These are decisions that your committee should make early on in the planning process. Having a clear vision for your event will help you sort out all other subsequent decisions.

, Many reunion guests will want to relive their high school experiences. Having some details to remind guests of their high school days can help make them feel welcomed, and can help your guests interact successfully with one another. Some nostalgic details to include are the following:


Ask your DJ to play music that was popular during your high school days
Create a photo display (either in a digital slideshow or on bulletin boards) of important high school events, such as sports games, extra-curriculars, or school dancesMake photocopies of high school yearbooks and newspapers and spread them around around your venue
Create a quiz game about important events and pop culture from your high school days

, Especially for important reunions (like the 25th or 50th reunion), a reunion book or souvenir might be welcomed by your guests. A reunion book will include short biographies of your alumni and details about their lives.Not every reunion will require something this in-depth, but it can help provide your guests with special memories from your event.

, Remember that not everyone at a reunion will be an alum. Your guests will bring spouses, friends, partners, or even children who might be unfamiliar with your high school. Include a few activities that are generic enough for anybody to enjoy. These could include:


Dancing
Good food and drinks
Athletic activities (a softball game, three-legged races, kickball, etc.)
Party games such as Charades, Twister, or cornhole

"
Decide on a theme or ""hook."",
Compile a guest list.,
Have games or other specific things to do prepared.,
Have plenty of food and drink.,
Decorate to highlight your theme.",How to Plan a Fun Party," Choosing some unifying element will make your invitation stand out and give your guests something to get to know each other around. For example, you might do a wine or food tasting, a board game night, or an 80s party. For kids, a slumber party is always a popular choice, or you might have a Disney theme, pirates vs. ninjas, or a sports party.;
, Invite more than you have room for. Don't invite some people, and then add more once people start to RSVP ""no."" This will make those who weren't invited first feel bad, and it's awkward for everyone. You're unlikely to have everyone decide to come, so always invite a few more than you would want at the party. Try to invite people from different groups of friends so that one person or a few people don't feel left out. Be clear in the invitation whether friends are welcome. If you're concerned about having enough food or beverages, ask everyone to bring something. This can tie in with your theme. You might even consider a gift swap where everyone brings a small gift to trade.

, If everyone's happy with conversation, food, and drink, then you may not need them, but it's good to have something ready for a lull in conversation. This can be simple as darts, Twister, or a party board game like Apples to Apples. Kids might enjoy Truth or Dare, doing makeovers, or a cooking project.

, People can always take home leftovers, and it's better to have too much than too little. Think about foods that are easy to prepare and don't all require a lot of work right at once. If you are going to be doing some food prep during the party, make sure you have something easy to set out first, like party mix, cheese and crackers, fruit, or chips. Be sure to have non-alcoholic beverage options, and something with caffeine. If you're offering soda, have diet and regular options. For a kids' party, you might try making a fruit punch or non-alcoholic version of a cocktail for fun.

, If you really want to stick with a theme, the decorations should keep your guests in the mood. You can also have interactive elements like a special guest book or themed party games. For example, for a pirate party you could clear an area of floor space and surround the edges with cushions for toy sword fighting.

",How to Plan a Corporate Event," come up with your theme.


Whether you are doing a cocktail party, a workshop or the company picnic, setting a theme gives the tone of the event and gives you a starting point when picking your food, your music, your décor and more.
Make sure that your theme is appropriate to the crowd for which you are planning. You can find a large variety of theme ideas online to get you started.;
,,


Discuss room rental costs and what is included in those fees.
Determine what the hours are that you will have access to the room. If no one books it the night before, can you have access to get in and decorate or set up? Are they providing the service ware for the food, or do you need to bring in or rent your own linens, plates, napkins and silverware?
Does the food have to come from that location, or can you bring in an outside caterer?
If you can bring in your own caterer, start meeting with potential vendors to taste their food and determine their pricing.
Determine if your venue requires you to bring in outside security for your event. This not only protects you from liability, but this can help keep outsiders from crashing your party.
Look to hire a licensed bartender if your facility cannot provide one, and you choose to have alcohol at the event.
Find out if the venue can provide decorations or if you have to supply your own. Some facilities have a wide variety of items that you can use such as candles, mirrors to set on the table, glass jars, etc. So if you can take advantage of anything being provided for free, you can save quite a bit on your budget.

, Will it be a buffet or a sit-down, plated meal? Are you doing appetizers ahead of time, and/or are you considering a dessert bar later in the evening? Iron out the exact details and timing so that your guests don't go hungry at any point.

Decide on the tone of the party.",How to Plan a Bachelor Party1,"


The groom has picked you to be the best man because you know him the best. Think about his personality, what he likes and what he doesn’t like. Your list could include things such as golf, dinner, a night on the town, a camping trip, a trip to Las Vegas, a party at your apartment or a party in rented room, etc.;
,


Remember when making this decision, it is ultimately up to you to pull this off, so it must be something you can afford and something you can plan. It is also the groom’s night, so make sure it is everything he wants it to be and more.

,


Have a serious discussion with the groom before you start planning the bachelor party. Make sure you know what he is okay with and what he is not okay with. If he does not want a wild night that ends with a trip to the strip club, then it is your responsibility to make that clear to the guests.

Choose a date near the birthday that you intend to celebrate.In addition to choosing the date, you’ll also have to figure out what time you want to have the party. If you are planning a party for younger children, make sure that you pick a time that does not interfere with school or kids getting to bed on time. If it’s a party for older people, make sure that the time falls after when most people work.


In addition to considering people’s time, you’ll also have to think about lighting in your forest party and whether you have artificial lights that can keep things bright during the nighttime.
Most people, especially those in school or that work, prefer to attend parties over the weekend.
If close family and friends are attending the party, talk to them first to see what is the most convenient day for most people.;
, If you want to hold a forest themed party, you may want to hold your party in an actual forest. Look online for parks that allow you to rent an area for a time and see what the restrictions or costs are. See if any parks near you will rent out space for a private event.If you don’t want to hold your party in an actual forest, think of friends who may have a wooded backyard filled with trees or you can hold the party in your own backyard.


Some parks may offer free park space for picnics and events to those with a smaller guest list., If you are throwing a party for someone else, ask them who they would like to come. If it’s a surprise party, think of the person’s closest family and friends and invite them. If you are creating the guest list for your own party, think of people that you’d want to share time with and people who would get along with each other.If you are difficulty thinking of who to invite, look on social media to get a refresher of the people you know.

, Setting a budget for the woodland birthday party will help you only spend the money you have. Determine how much disposable money you have to spend on the party and keep a running tally of receipts as you purchase items for the party. Set separate budgets for food, decorations, and party favors, and don’t go over them.


If a product might make you go over budget, look for cheaper alternatives.

, Look for forest themed or woodland themed party invitations online. These invitations will usually have a brown, yellow, blue, and green color palette and can be customized for your specific event. If you’d rather create your own invitation, try to incorporate aspects of the forest such as woodland creatures, mountains, leaves, and trees.You can also send digital forest-themed invitations through email or social media.

, Many snacks and sweets can be converted to a forest theme with ingenuity. For example, Kit-Kat candy can be broken apart to look like logs, and trail mix can be put out to give a forest vibe. To further solidify your theme, put little signs made of paper in front of your snacks that remind people of the forest.


Sign examples include “bear poop” for bonbons, “woodland berries” for mixed fruit cups, and “twigs” for pretzel sticks.Other forest themed snack ideas include peanut caramel cookies, chocolate chip cookies, red toffee apples, pretzels, and dried fruit.Think of animal themed treats like ants on a log or porcupines made out of a watermelon., Have a custom cake created that invokes the feeling of the forest. Ideas include woodland creatures like owls, deer, or bears. Look for pre-made, cheaper cakes at bakeries that can be related to nature in some way. Other nature related cake decorations could include trees, leaves, or other depictions of nature.


You can also get custom cakes made in the shape of tree stumps, acorns, mushrooms, or forest foliage., Mix 1 gallon of green punch a 1.46 ounce can of pineapple juice and 1 liter of ginger ale together in a large bowl to create a light green colored punch. Using the same little signs or labels that you used for your snacks and label this mixture pond punch.A popular green punch is Green Berry Rush Hawaiian Punch.

, Wooden utensils evoke a feeling of nature and the forest. Purchase utensils made of wood and use them in your food or snack bowls to enhance the feeling of nature for your party. You can also replace your dishes and bowls with wooden variations if you already own them., Decorate your party tables with things found out in nature like pine cones, moss, acorns, or lumber. Instead of using traditional folding chairs, see if you can get logs for people to sit on.Think of purchasing other decor items that will add to the overall forest theme, such as birdhouses, traditional candlesticks, or hanging mason jars., Purchase or create packaging for party favors that have forest themes and put in the ingredients that you need to build smores. Line up chocolate, marshmallows, and graham crackers for people to eat at the party, or later when they go home. Not only will most people appreciate the gift, but it will also remind them of camping., This Latin American custom can be converted to suit your whimsical forest theme and is a fun activity for children. Look for a pinata that invokes the feeling of the forest. Ideas include pinatas shaped like mushrooms or pinatas shaped like owls.Other pinata ideas include foxes, turtles, raccoons, bears, or porcupines.

, Set up a simple scavenger hunt for children to find things like leaves, feathers, and stones.Create a list of things that participants must find to win the scavenger hunt and distribute it to the people who play. As they find things in the forest, they can mark off the items they already have. For younger children, try to keep the items easy to find so that they don’t get frustrated or discouraged.Other items you can have them find include fruits, berries, nuts, or special flowers.
You can buy something at the store to serve as the prize for the scavenger hunt.
If you don’t want kids picking things up off the ground, you can have them snap a photo of the item on their smartphone instead of physically carrying the scavenger hunt item.

, Convert games and activities by including mentions of the forest or woodland creatures. For example, pin the tail on the donkey can become pin the tail on the deer. Other games, like the bean bag toss, can be converted by swapping what you would normally use for the scoring hole, with an image of a woodland creature's mouth. Think of other creative conversions that you can make for the existing games that you have planned for your party.


You can also set up a craft area to create woodland animal masks or gingerbread log houses.
Setting up a drawing table with woodland creature photos is a great activity.

If you have enough people, ask the restaurant to create a set menu so that everyone knows the cost of the meal up front.

, Some bigger cities have party buses or party peddlers for rent. A limousine can also be rented for the evening.

Use naturally sweet spices.",How to Plan a Healthy Easter Meal," Things like ham, lamb, and beef are traditionally served at Easter.Instead of just serving red meat as a dish, serve red meat in dishes that have healthy additions to them. Mix in things like vegetables and legumes with traditional Easter meats.Use meat more for texture and added flavor than as a staple of the course. Ham, for example, has a strong flavor and is often served on Easter. Instead of serving ham, serve squash with diced ham as a main course.
Beef and lamb are also a popular Easter dish. Instead of serving beef and lamb on their own, serve beef and lamb as part of a healthy vegetable stew.;
, Fish and chicken are healthier meat choices than red meat. While red meats are generally more associated with Easter, consider making fish or chicken and giving it an Easter twist.Honey-glazed ham is a popular Easter dish. Try serving honey-glazed chicken instead, or even something like honey-glazed salmon., How you cook meat affects its nutritional benefits. When cooking meat for Easter dinner, make sure you use healthy methods. Frying meat is generally not as healthy as grilling or baking meat.You can bake or roast meat in the oven to prevent having to add unhealthy, fatty oils when frying meat.
If you saute meat, use heart-healthy oils like olive oil. Even a no-calorie cooking spray can be used when sauteeing meat. You can also add plenty of veggies when sauteeing meat for a stir fry.

, Watch portion size. If you're making plates for your guests yourself, give them small slices of meat. Fill the rest of the plate with things like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Simple portion control can go a long way in making a meal healthier., Brussels sprouts are an easy dish to serve as you can cook them in the oven. This cuts back on adding calories when sauteeing or frying vegetables in oil. Brussels sprouts can be baked on a lightly greased baking sheet at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) for 30 minutes.Spices, such as a garlic powder or a small amount of salt and pepper, can make brussels sprouts taste better.
You can drizzle maple syrup over brussels sprouts to add some flavor, but only use a small amount. You do not want to add too much sugar to an otherwise healthy dish.

, Casseroles are often a staple of Easter meals. Many casseroles call for bread crumbs to add texture or a topping. A simple way to increase the health of casseroles is to opt for whole wheat bread crumbs. This adds fiber to the dish and cuts back on empty calories.Most grocery stores sell whole wheat bread crumbs. You can find them where you would find regular breadcrumbs.

, Mashed potatoes are a staple of an easter meal, but they tend to have a lot of starch. To cut back on starchy foods, substitute mashed cauliflower for mashed potatoes. Steam or boil cauliflower florets for 12 to 15 minutes. Then, add ingredients like milk, butter, and garlic for texture and flavor. Use a fork to mash the cauliflower until it's smooth and creamy.You can also use a food processor to mash the cauliflower.

, Buns are often served as Easter meals. Instead of serving buns made with white flour, pick up some whole wheat buns. In addition to providing fiber, whole wheat buns are more filing. Guests will fill up faster and eat less overall., You do not have to neglect potatoes altogether for a healthy Easter meal. Instead of mashing them, which often requires a heavy amount of butter and milk, roast them. Roast them alongside other vegetables to provide more variety and nutrition.To roast potatoes, you cook them in the oven at 425 degrees Fahrenheit. You can flavor them with spices like lemon, rosemary, and garlic first.
Add other more nutritious vegetables, like artichoke heart, to the mix for a delicious Thanksgiving side.

, When a recipe calls for something like vegetable oil, substitute apple sauce. This is lower in calories and fat and will make baked goods healthier.In general, use the same amount of applesauce as oil. However, if the recipe calls for more than 1/4 cup of oil, you should not add more than a quarter cup of applesauce. This can prevent proper baking.If the recipe calls for more than 1/4 cup oil, add a quarter cup of applesauce and then the remaining amount of oil. For example, if a recipe calls for 1/2 cup of oil, add 1/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of oil.

, Fruit-based pies do not require as much sugar as fruit is sweet in and of itself. When making pies, opt for things like apple and cherry pie. Look for pie recipes that call for natural fruit over canned fruit.You can also reduce the sugar called for in fruit pies by about 25 to 30% without seriously affecting the recipe.

, In baked goods, try cutting back the sugar by about 25 to 30%.To make up for the reduced sugar, add sweetening extracts to sweeten your foods. Go for things like vanilla and almond extracts or fruit extracts like raspberry extract. Add the extract to taste after cutting back on the sugar., Instead of making sugary recipes, look for recipes sweetened with spices like cinnamon, cardamon, allspice, and nutmeg. These spices are naturally sweet and can add flavor to a dish without added sugar.Try serving natural fruits, like slices apples, sprinkled with cinnamon and other spices. Sprinkle a small amount of sugar over the dish for guests to enjoy.

Keep it secret!,
Plan a date to have the 'star of the party' come over to your house or wherever the party is!,
Do not set up any visible decorations!,
Get some party supplies and decorations!,
Get a guest list.,
Think of games and favors.,
Don't forget the dance music!

,
Hide and be quiet, here comes your unsuspecting person!",How to Organize a Surprise Party," Tell only invited guests and other needed people who will not let the guest of honor find out. One of the worst things to do before a surprise party is telling people. You can tell a few friends you trust so they can help you but no blabbermouths. Make sure when the person you are throwing the party for doesn't see any decorations beforehand. Keep it all top secret!;
, Make sure you keep the person as far away from the party location as possible until party time!

, When the person shows up at the party you don't want balloons outside or a sign that says 'HONK, TODAY IS _____'S _TH BIRTHDAY!' Make sure you keep the shades shut when the guest arrives....and don't forget to hide!

, What's a party without some balloons? Buy some balloons you can blow up yourself or get a whole bunch from the grocery store. Confetti is a must! Nothing better than having confetti thrown in your face as you walk inside your party! Also make sure you get enough banners, streamers, cake, punch/soda, ice cream. And make sure it's all according to color.

, What's a party without your friends or loved ones? Invite some people and in the invitations tell them to keep it a secret. Also if your guests are driving over to the party it wouldn't hurt to hide the cars or even walk over if you are close enough.

, A party is no fun without some games and party favors. It really depends on who you are throwing the party for. If it's a child , have some small toys as favors and some fun games like pin the tail on the donkey, if its affordable it wouldn't hurt to get a clown. For a teen/adult party a great favor would be a gift card to a store or restaurant.

Are you planning it to educate your community? Persuade potential donors for funds? To celebrate a specific individual or group of individuals? Get as narrow as possible. Whatever you're doing (be it educating, persuading, celebrating, etc.), why are you doing it?


Think of it as your mission statement. Your framework for success. When you know exactly what you want to do, it's a lot easier to do it!;
, What exactly do you want to accomplish? Not how many people do you want to show up, not the actual fact that the event is even happening -- what do you want to come out of this? 5 people to walk away a new part of your organization? $1,000 raised? Minds changed? People excited?


Think of the top three things you wish would happen as a result of this event and concentrate on them becoming a reality. Maybe one goal is financial, one is social, and one is personal. It's up to you!

, Good team members with different skills are a necessity. They can help with everything from preparing schedules and budgets, to making invites and posters, to welcoming in guests and doing the dirty work of cleaning up afterward. In other words, they can help you get things done. And if you can, get volunteers who you trust!


Make sure to keep team members and supervisors ""up to speed"" with your plans. Collaboration can make your job easier. When you ask them to help, be as complete as possible from the get-go about the expectations for them and their level of involvement.
If you aren't in a situation where finding volunteers is feasible, hire a crew! It all depends on the type of event you're organising. The venue may be able to provide you with one or you can go through a third-party staffing agency.

, All possible expenses, incomes, sponsors, and contingent expenses should be included. If you don't budget, you'll end up with a wad of receipts, an empty pocketbook, and no idea what the heck just happened. Be realistic from day one so no surprises are seen the day of!


Find ways to keep costs low. Can you get volunteers to work for free? Consider cheaper venues (like someone's home)? Remember: a small, simple gathering that goes well is always more impressive than a party thrown to the nines that's a flop.

, This is the most important thing when it comes to your event. What time and what place will make people say, ""Yeah, I'll go to that!""? You want a time when everyone will be free and a place that's a convenient location. And something you can afford to book!


Check your community's calendar and consider your audience. If you're working with a bunch of stay-at-home moms, during the day and in the neighborhood is your best bet (maybe with some babysitting offered, too?) If you're channeling students, do a weeknight downtown. If you can, go where they already are.
Of course, certain venues need booking. Contact the place you're thinking about using as soon as possible. They may be busier than you are!

, Logistics for everything. What will parking be like? What about handicap accessibility? What can you do with the size of your space? What equipment will you need? What extra items (drinking water for speakers, badges, brochures) will you need that will be extra expenses? How many people are needed to truly make it run smoothly?


It's important to sit down for a minute with yourself (and with your team) and consider all sides of the story. Is there any obstacle that can be foreseen and prevented? Any special guests that need to be accommodated? Any exceptions that need to be made?

, While you're on the roll that you are, prepare a draft poster. It should include the tentative date, time, venue, chief guest, name of the event, and a theme or tag-line for the event. Since it's so early, you can take your time on this -- but it's best to whip up a preliminary version now to see how it's all coming together!


Think about other ways to get the word out, too. E-mail blasts? Snail mail? Facebook, Twitter, the other two dozen event websites out there (more on that in a bit)? What do you need before the event to get people there and what do you need at the event to keep them?

, It's very possible you feel like a ferret with its head cut off right about now. Take a breath and open up Excel. Prepare a draft schedule of the activities in the event. Make a few spreadsheets to organize your thoughts. It may seem like needless paperwork now, but in two months you'll be profusely thanking your past self for looking out for you.


Prepare a time line (with deadlines) for each activity. Write down everyone's names and where they're needed when. That way you can organize yourself and field any future questions from others.

, Fix the date, venue, (chief guest), staff, name of the event and tag-line. Is there anything that could go wrong? Any last minute switch-ups that could present themselves? At this juncture, everything should be written in permanent ink.

, Get approval for your budget, schedule, etc., from team members as well as supervisors. Right now is a good time to get all the questions sussed out. Does everyone know their obligations? Are they comfortable with any and all issues?


Once again, meet with team members and volunteers to brainstorm any problems that might arise. This is also the perfect time to create an action plan.
Make sure the team does not have any internal problems. Stay in touch with all team leaders as well as team members and volunteers.

, If the event is a mega-event, let different people coordinate different activities, under the supervision of one person. The team leader should be trusted by the team members.


It's a good idea to have one or two people dedicating their time to meeting and greeting and talking up the event as people filter in and the event gets started. Basically they're a reception committee, boosting morale and letting people know they're in good hands.

, You're probably on Facebook and Twitter, but there's a ton of other websites you can use, too, that can help you get the word out. Eventbrite, Evite and Meetup If you haven't heard of these, do some surfing now! And if you're looking to sell tickets online, Ticketbudis pretty good.


And, of course, your website/blog/Facebook page, if you have one. You can send out reminders, set up pictures, and monitor RSVPs. The more active you are, the more your presence will be known. If you're doing an event based around gardening or home decor or anything else creative, you'll can also use Pinterest.

, There will be a lot of expenses being incurred in the upcoming weeks and you don't want them all to come out of your own pocket! Collect at least some of the money to cover the initial fees -- the venue, equipment, caterers, perhaps? Some of these people/places/things may require payment before the event even starts crawling.


Make sure to have a system for receipts, confirmations, invoices, and general paperwork. You'll need to keep everything and refer to it later, so the more organized you are from the beginning the better. Especially if a company you're working with gives you guff.

, Prepare brochures, release advertisements, inform the media, send mailings, make phone calls, send messages to e-groups, and visit potential participants or sponsors. How else will people know to come? Make sure the information you're putting out there is fully complete, leaving them with only a few questions -- they need some to be intrigued, after all!


Think about your target audience. If you're trying to reach senior citizens, you're not gonna be spending your time sending out well-timed Snapchats. Go to the places and use the tools your audience uses.

, These items might include medals, games, mementos, prizes, or certificates. There are a lot of small bits and doodads that might go unnoticed to the untrained eye, but you know every nook, cranny, and whatever fills it. And don't forget tables, chairs, sound equipment, signs, tablecloths, and all that important, big stuff!


This is another thing you should sit down and think about. Don't stop thinking about it until you've found 5 things you've forgotten about -- everything down to pens, a first-aid kit, batteries, ice, and extension cords. You want to know that whatever happens, you've got it covered.

, Make arrangements for photos and videos. Make arrangements for guests' transportation. Make arrangements for food for the clean-up crew. The list could go on and on, but then you'll never get to organizing your event!


Make arrangements for food and refreshments. This is also a good time to prepare for special accommodation such as for those who have disabilities etc. Check for participants who are vegetarian or have other specific dietary needs. Many event ticketing sites such as the ones listed have options for ""custom questions"" which will better help you gauge any special needs.
Make arrangements for chairs, tables, backdrops, microphones, speakers, computers, LCD projectors, podiums -- anything that needs to be set up at the venue.

, You'll need all relevant phone numbers, addresses and emails of team members. Also, make a similar contact list for VIPs and suppliers of any goods or services. When someone doesn't show up or is running late, this will be what you refer to.


Let's say the caterers aren't there on time. What do you do? You whip out your handy dandy sheet and give them a call. Oh, they thought you were going to pick up 200 pounds of pulled pork? Well, whatever. You hand the sheet to Stu and he grabs his truck and goes to the address listed on the paper. Crisis averted. And now you know to either never book with them again or be more explicit in your directions!

, Look around the place and evaluate parking, toilets, green rooms, arrangements, various entrances and exits. Look for nearby places where you can take photocopies, make phone calls, and buy any things in case of emergency. Basically, get to know your terrain like the back of your hand.


Talk to the contact person, too. They should have a knowledge of the venue better than anyone else. Are there any issues you should know about? Any time constraints? Doors being locked at certain times? God forbid, scheduled fire alarm checks?

, You got this. It's incredibly important to keep a level head and not get caught up in a mental sweat. You've been preparing for months! Everything will be fine. The calmer you are, the calmer your team will be, and the more smoothly the event will go. Besides, it'll all be over shortly!


Seriously. You got this. You've covered all your bases, you've thought of all the possible problems -- if anything goes wrong, you know how to handle it. And remember: no one's going to blame you. A rowdy guest, bad food -- people know that you don't have control over anything. So relax. You'll be okay.

, Make sure you communicate with everyone on how to reach the venue and the time. The last thing you want is your entire team calling you at once the day of the event wondering where the heck the back door is.


Even if no one is coming out and asking you questions, do your best to gauge their behavior. Does everyone seem okay with their job description? Are people getting along? If not, talk to them and see if you can work out the kinks. Maybe someone would be better suited to a different department or working with other people.

, Create a list of invitees in a spreadsheet and get a tally for heads. For most events, the number of people who RSVP will not represent the number of people who actually show. You could have 50 people who said they'll be there, but end up with 5 or 500. So while you should know this number, also be ready to handle either end of the spectrum!


Remind VIPs about the events while you're at it. You'd be surprised how many people will say, ""Oh, that's right. That's tomorrow, isn't it?"" With a simple phone call or text, that can be avoided.

, Is the room clean and available? Is all the electronic equipment set up and does it seem to be working? Can you pre-load any equipment, if need be? Do the staff seem reasonably prepared?


Check whether enough people are there to man the event. It's always best to have more than you need, of course. You may need someone to run off to do an emergency errand or take care of a guest or issue you didn't see coming. Or, you know, to fetch you coffee.

, This kit might include a bottle of water, a snack bar, note paper, a pen, a brochure and any information they may need. It is also a good idea to include small mementos. This is a nice touch that really convinces people that this is a well thought-out, organized event. And it makes them feel appreciated!


This can be for guests or it can be for your crew, or both! Who doesn't love a free granola bar and pen?

, This is a list of all the necessary information sorted by time and/or room. Prepare a minute-to-minute agenda for important activities. The format for this is up to you. Just try to keep the amount of information on it to a minimum so it's easy to read.


If you're really type A and super diligent, you may find it useful to make different types of running sheets. Speakers may want a list of other speakers and where they are and at what time. Your crew may just want a list of equipment, times, and clean-up protocol. If you have the time, this may be useful.

, How terrible would it be if you got there, everything's there, everyone is there, and you realize the only thing that's not are the 12000 cups you forgot at your house? Bummer. Now you've just ruined everything. So make your checklist, check it twice, and bring everything that needs to be brought!


If things are half a dozen places, assign people to each specific duty. That way, the day of, you're not spending 8 hours running around collecting everything and freaking out. Spreading the work makes for lighter hands...or however the saying goes.

, Check that everyone is there and all electronic equipment is in working order. Any last minute questions? If there's time, pass out the Mountain Dew, give a pep talk, and break! You got this. You're so prepared.


Make sure the organizers are wearing a distinct badge or some other noticeable implement so that participants can find help if needed. Sometimes khakis just aren't enough.

, Inside and outside. Do you need balloons on the mailbox? A posterboard on the corner? What about on the doors and through the hallway? If your guests have to wander through a veritable labyrinth, the more signs, the better.


Welcome banners and other info in front of the building will be especially useful. You want people to be able to see from the street that that's the place they should be. No questions about it!
Make a reception and registration counter. When guests walk in the door, they should see exactly what they need to do. Otherwise they'll be floating around unsure and ill at ease. And remember that reception committee we talked about? Have someone at the door to welcome them in and answer their questions.
Put on some music! It can kill any awkwardness that otherwise might be flitting about.

, If a speaker is running late, there needs to be stalling. If eating is taking longer than accounted for, they need to be alerted to the schedule changes. Very rarely do events go completely as planned -- so as you deviate from your course, make sure the lines of communication are open.

, You may want something to remember of your own. And seeing someone walking around with a camera can get people excited. Take note of the sponsor banners, your banner, the entrance, receptions, etc. Maybe you can use it for next year!


Have a friend or a professional photographer take care of this, if at all possible. You have enough on your plate! You'll need to be schmoozing and boozing your guests, so have someone else take care of the photo stuff.

, You probably planted something in your guests' heads and want them walking away either thinking something, wondering something, or looking to take action. So have a pamphlet or something they can take with them that they can personally do after the event.


Part of this could be a forum for feedback. Offer them a way to follow up and say what they thought, how would they might make improvements, and what they'd like to see next time. And, of course, how they can get involved!

, Check the electric meter, remove the banners, tables, etc. You want to leave the place as good as when you found it -- especially if you paid for the venue and want to ever come back. They may charge fees that could otherwise be avoided. Divvy up the jobs so it all goes as quick and painlessly as possible.


Check to make sure nothing valuable has been left behind, and if so, form a lost and found.
If you have damaged something, let the venue's contact person know. It's best to be honest and forthright.
Take care of the trash to the best of your ability. Maintenance will take care of everything from there.

, Depending on your event, this could range from absolutely nothing to a long-list of thank yous and receipts. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Thank the all team members, especially sponsors and volunteers. You couldn't have done it without them!
Finalize and settle the accounts. This should be done as quickly as possible. The fewer loose strings, the better.
Have a thank you party for those who helped. You want your crew to feel appreciated and donors to feel like they made a difference to a good cause.
Distribute any souvenirs or other publications to relevant people.
Deliver the receipts to sponsors and others.
Post the photos in your event website.

, After all is said and done, what would you have done differently? What worked and what didn't? Would you ever choose to organize an event like this again? What have you learned?


If you receive feedback, go over it. And if you're not getting it from your guests, ask your crew! What did they think? Did they at least enjoy themselves? It was the free granola bar and pen, wasn't it?

For example, use slides with strong arguments, such as: ""This ski trip will allow students to ski for the first time, or will allow the good skiers to improve their technique.""
At this point, convincing those who have the authority to authorize the trip should be your top priority, and you'll need to acknowledge that a lot of work is involved but that you're prepared to lead this.;
, As in all events, a date should have been selected by your student's office. Thus, you should make sure to ask the director of your college in order to select a date without many classes, in order to avoid problems with the teachers.

, Are you going to a nice ski resort? A cheap resort? Both? At this point, it would be a good idea to design and distribute a survey in your college. In this survey, write questions for which you don't know students' opinions yet, such as the price they are ready to spend for the ski trip. With the results, you can get a good idea of what kind of ski trip would be likely to satisfy all students.

, This is the most important part of your project. After you have selected the ski resort, call bus companies, hotels and the chalet manager at the ski resort to get quotes for transportation, renting chalets and the lift pass. Maybe your college can pay for a part of your trip. The better that you prepare and present your project, providing sufficient details and thorough research, the more financing you can obtain. If your event is cheap, more students will sign up.

, Once the college has authorized the trip and it's all tentatively arranged with the chalet and resort, decide how many places are available. Do not oversupply places, keep the group to a manageable size. Part of the draw will be the limited availability of places on the trip, which will encourage students to both sign up and pay early, enabling you to confirm everything well ahead of the trip. A group of six to ten would be very manageable for one person, while anything higher should involve you partnering with someone else to help to the organizing. Cap the amount of people going to the bus size, if you are planning on having a larger group attend. Any more than that and it starts to become very difficult to manage and it'll be hard to book accommodations, etc.


Ask for students to include dietary, medical, special needs and other information on the registration forms. This will help you to be able to tell the relevant persons that there are specific needs that must be catered for during the trip.

, Once you have received the registrations and payments, confirm the chalet/resort bookings, the bus bookings and any other relevant bookings.

, Once everything is firmed up, send out emails to all participants with the details about the trip and accommodations. Include details on what things to bring, the time and place of pickup and return time and place, as well as anything else of relevance. Let people know that they can ask you questions, if they have any.

, A ski trip is a good opportunity to enjoy yourself with your friends, and meet new students. And at the end of your ski trip, don't forget to create videos of fail compilations to convince other students to go the next year.

Before you start planning, make sure to stay organized.,
Pick a theme.,
Pick a date.,
Guest list.,
Venue.,
Invitations.,
Caterer.,
Decorations.,
Entertainment.,
Double check your organization and guest RSVPs.,
You may need to hire a shuttle service, or you can also alert taxi companies to come by your venue regularly.

,Call all vendors before event, call the caterer, linen rentals, decorator, florist, photo-booth, DJ or band and let them know you look forward to seeing them in a day or two

,
Set up.,
Sit back and Enjoy your Event.

",How to Organize a Large Event," have a folder or list on your computer to keep track of all the details.;
, Every event has a theme. A work Christmas party or a 50th Birthday party. You can choose to do a princess birthday party or a blue and silver Christmas party. You can pick anything... Christmas in Hawaii theme? Play around and have fun.

, Choose an appropriate date for the event.

, Make a guest list so you know approximately how many people will be invited to the event.

, When you are having 300 or more people to an event, it is very unlikely you will want to do it at your home. Choose a venue that will hold the amount of guests you need. Always take a look at the venue yourself. you want to make sure it really looks like the pictures say. Ask if they do their own catering.

, Once the venue is booked and you have the date and guest list, it is time to find invitations you like and send them out to all your guests.

, At this point you need to find a caterer if the venue doesn't supply the refreshments and meals required at your event. Choose a caterer with experience. Always go meet the caterer before you hire him/her and ask them questions, and make sure you try their food.

, This is the time when having a theme comes in handy. Think about centerpieces, tablecloth rentals, napkins, choose the colors. Hanging decorations, Do you want to have a photo-booth area? where is the dance floor going to be? the bar? do you want to have a banner relevant to your company or event theme? Are you going to do party favors on the tables?

, Getting a good DJ or band can make or break your event. Ask around look for someone who is highly recommended. If you plan to have a raffle, ask if they will raffle off the items for you. As far as DJ's go, you get what you pay for.

, You may need to reserve a block of rooms at a hotel, maybe your event is in a hotel, they should be giving you discounts for having the guests stay there and using their ballroom.

Melt enough white chocolate to fill one plastic egg.,
Melt a few coloured wafers (any colour you want, or rainbow) and drizzle into both parts of the plastic egg.,
Once both are swirled, make sure they are both completely full, and as quick as you can shut the egg.,
Now, place your egg into ice water to cool.,
After waiting for the egg to cool, (about 15 minutes in ice water, longer without ice water), Open the eggs.,
Now, melt a bit more of the coloured wafers (any colour, preferably matching the egg's swirls).,Now your eggs are ready for Easter!",How to Make Decorated Chocolate Easter Eggs," Let it sit for a few minutes to cool, but not harden. Then pour the chocolate into the plastic egg's two parts. Leave room for more chocolate to be added!
, Take your toothpick and swirl the chocolate to make a nice design., Make sure it snaps shut. (If your eggs don't snap shut and fall open easily, skip step 4.), Repeat these steps until you have your desired amount of chocolate eggs., This is the hard part, as it is often difficult to open them. I used steak knives to saw them a bit and then pry them open. There is usually an air bubble at one side of the egg, but I find that this indent is helpful to prevent eggs from rolling around., You can now personalize the eggs. You can write your kid's names, add stripes, polka dots, random swirls, what ever you want. I used toothpicks and Popsicle sticks for this.,"

, Leave it to cool.

, Add the yolks into the melted chocolate mixture and mix well after each egg yolk is added.

, Once firmed up, fold these into the chocolate and egg yolk mixture gently.

, Try to slice the tops off at an angle, so that you can have the mousse build up the missing part of the egg.


Have some spares available in case of accidents, as sometimes the egg may simply crack down the joins and you'll need to eat it and use another one instead!

, Bring the mousse up as high as the top edge of the egg at its highest point after cutting. Slip each egg into an egg cup or an egg carton that has had the lid removed from it.

, Leave the mousse to set for three hours.

, Just before serving, sprinkle some sprinkles or colored sugar over the top for an extra decorative effect, or stick a small solid chocolate egg in for another chocolate bonus.


Serve in individual egg cups. If you don't have these, use a small glass or a dipping bowl to hold up each egg and place in the middle of a large plate. You could also drizzle a chocolate or berry coulis around the plate.

Chill the coated eggs until they are set.",How to Make Chocolate Peanut Butter Eggs," To make the chocolate peanut butter eggs, you’ll need a large, rimmed baking sheet. Line the sheet with parchment paper to ensure that the eggs won’t stick to it.You can line the baking sheet with wax paper or a silicone baking mat if you prefer.;
, Add 1 cup (250 g) of creamy peanut butter, ¼ cup (57 g) unsalted butter softened to room temperature, ¼ cup (50 g) of packed, dark brown sugar, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of vanilla extract, and ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of salt to a medium saucepan. Stir the ingredients together so they’re slightly mixed.Be sure to use creamy peanut butter for the eggs. Crunchy peanut butter will give the eggs’ center a chunky texture.

, After you’ve combined the peanut butter mixture, place the pan on the stove. Heat the mixture on medium until it fully melts, which should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes.Stir the mixture constantly as you heat it to help it melt more quickly.

, Once the peanut butter mixture is melted, take the pot off the heat. Mix 1 ¼ cups (156 g) of powdered sugar into the pot, but add it ¼ cup (31 g) at a time and stir well after each addition to ensure that it’s fully incorporated.It may be easier to mix the powdered sugar into the peanut butter mixture if you use a handheld electric mixer.

, After the powdered sugar is completely incorporated into the peanut butter mixture, leave the filling in the pot to cool. Let it sit until the mixture comes to room temperature, which should take 15 to 20 minutes.It’s important to let the peanut butter filling cool because it will be too difficult to form eggs if the mixture is very soft. As it cools, it will set up a bit so it holds its shape more easily.

, When the filling mixture has cooled, use a large cookie scoop that holds approximately 3 tablespoons (62 g) to spoon out a rounded amount of the mixture. Transfer the filling to the prepared cookie sheet.If you don’t have a cookie scoop, you can use a regular tablespoon measuring spoon to scoop out the peanut butter filling.

, Once you’ve scooped the peanut butter filling onto the cookie sheet, use clean fingers to smooth it into an oval, egg-like shape. Repeat the process until you’ve used up all of the filling and the baking sheet is full.If you find that the filling is sticking to your fingers or is difficult to shape, you can place it in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes so it’s slightly firmer.

, When you’ve made peanut butter eggs from all of the filling, cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap. Place it in the freezer, and allow the eggs to chill until they are hard, which should take 15 to 30 minutes.If you don’t have room in your freezer to harden the eggs, you can place the cookie sheet in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours instead.

, When the peanut butter eggs are nearly finished chilling, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of canola oil and 1 ½ cup (220 g) of semi-sweet chocolate chips to microwave-safe measuring cup. Heat the mixture in the microwave on high in 30 second intervals, stirring after each, until the chocolate melts completely.You can substitute vegetable or coconut oil for the canola if you prefer.
You can substitute your favorite type of chocolate chips for the semi-sweet if you prefer, including milk, bittersweet, and white chocolate.
If you prefer, you can melt the chocolate and oil together in a double boiler on the stove top.

, Once the peanut butter eggs have hardened and the chocolate is melted, place the eggs on a fork and dip them into the chocolate one at a time to coat them. Allow the excess to drip back into the bowl so the coating is as smooth as possible.It may help to use a spoon to pour some chocolate over the eggs after you lift them out of the chocolate to ensure that they’re evenly coated.

, After you’ve evenly coated the peanut butter egg, place it on the lined baking sheet. Repeat the procedure until all of the peanut butter eggs are coated., Once you’ve coated all of the peanut butter eggs with chocolate, place the cookie sheet in the refrigerator. Allow the eggs to chill until the chocolate hardens, which should take about 30 minutes, before serving.You can also leave the coated eggs near a cool window to set.
If you want your peanut eggs to have a more decorative look, place some melted chocolate in a pastry bag and pipe it over them in stripes once the chocolate coating has hardened.
Store any leftover eggs in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They should keep for 2 to 3 weeks.

Thaw 1 full package (17.3 ounces or 490 g) of puff pastry according to the manufacturer's instructions.Ensure that the pastry is soft enough to handle, but not too warm. If the pastry is warm, it will be sticky and difficult to work with.;
, Sprinkle a little flour onto your work space and set one thawed piece of puff pastry on it. Unfold the pastry and use a rolling pin to roll the pastry into a large square. Get out three star cookie cutters in different sizes. Cut four star shapes using each cookie cutter. Repeat this with the other sheet of puff pastry.Keep in mind that to assemble the trees you'll have four large puff pastry stars, four medium-sized stars for the middles, and four smaller stars for the tops.

, Place the puff pastry stars on two baking sheets. Bake them in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. The stars should turn golden brown and puff up once they've finished baking. Carefully take the puff pastry stars out of the oven and transfer them to a wire rack to cool.You should have a total of 24 stars in three different sizes. This will give you eight finished puff pastry Christmas trees.

, Place eight large stars on your work space. Top each of them with 1 teaspoon of vanilla pudding or lemon curd. Set a medium star on top of the larger one so it sticks. Place another teaspoon of the filling on the middle star and top it with a small star. Do this for each of the trees.You'll need a total of 1/3 cup (76 g) of vanilla pudding or lemon curd.
Try to alternate the points of the stars as you stack them. This will make them look like tree branches.

, Warm up 1/3 cup (113 g) of honey in the microwave until it's thin. Drizzle each of the trees with some of the honey. Then you can sprinkle green decorating sugar over the trees. Top each of the Christmas trees with a fresh raspberry or maraschino cherry half.The honey will help the sugar stick. If you don't like the texture of the decorating sugar, you can omit it.

, Turn on the oven to 400 degrees F (200 C). Let 1 package (17.3 ounces or 490 g) of puff pastry defrost according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lay a sheet of parchment paper onto a baking sheet and set it aside.Ensure that the puff pastry is still cold when you start to work with it. If you let it get too warm, it will be sticky and hard to handle.

, Sprinkle your work surface with a little bit of flour. Use a rolling pin to evenly roll one sheet of thawed puff pastry. You should roll it into an 11x13-inch (28x33 cm) rectangle. Lay this one on the parchment lined baking sheet and roll out the other pastry sheet to the same size.Remember to turn the pastry as you're rolling it out. This will help keep it from sticking to your work surface.

, Spread 4 to 5 tablespoons of pesto or Nutella onto the puff pastry sheet that's on the parchment. Try to spread it in a large triangular shape that will be the size of the Christmas tree.Be creative with the fillings. You could also scatter cheese, spread lemon curd, or sprinkle chopped nuts over the pastry.

, Carefully lay the second sheet of puff pastry over the pastry with the filling. The rectangles should line up. Take a sharp knife and cut out a triangular Christmas tree. You can discard the excess pastry or cook the scraps to snack on.Remember to cut out a trunk shape at the bottom of the tree.

, Use your knife to cut individual branches on both sides of the tree. Leave about an inch (2.5 cm) of pastry running through the center of the tree. Use your hands to gather each branch and gently twist it onto itself a few times. Do this for all the branches of the tree.Try to twirl the branches in the same direction so the tree looks uniform.

, Beat one egg in a small bowl. Dip a pastry brush into the beaten egg and gently brush it all over the puff pastry Christmas tree. Bake the tree in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes. The tree should puff up and turn golden brown.Let the puff pastry Christmas tree cool for a few minutes before you transfer it to a serving tray.

Make the dough into a ball and cover with a little flour and place in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for an hour to chill or until the next day.;
, Roll out 1/4 of the dough on a floured surface until it's very thin. You may need to add flour to keep the dough from sticking as it gets thinner and thinner. Roll out the dough until it is so thin you can see the design of the cutting board or kitchen counter, through it.

, Cut the dough into small diamond strips, about 4"" x 2"". Cut a lengthwise slit in the middle of each strip. Pull the other end through the slit. It's not an Ausuki unless you tie this knot!

, It is best to use an electric frying pan so the temperature stays around 380 degrees. Brush off any extra flour from the ausuki before it goes in the oil. Test the oil by dropping a scrap of dough, it should sink to the bottom and immediately float to the top. When this happens the oil is ready. Fry for about 1-2 minutes, only a maximum of six at a time, so that the oil stays hot. When the ausuki appear light, light golden on the edges, flip them, fry for about 20 seconds more. They should puff up. Do not brown! Use a metal prongs to remove them and hold them over the oil to drain before placing on a paper towel to drain more.

Ice or frost the lamb cake.,

Add facial features to the lamb.,

Place a wreath, ribbon or collar with a medallion or cross around the lamb's neck.,

Arrange the lamb on a bed of grass.,
Serve.",How to Make a Lamb Cake," The supplies are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"".

See Tips for more information about the lamb cake mold. The traditional mold makes a whole sitting lamb, both sides. However, it is also acceptable to make a flat mold lamb cake; it's just not as realistic, that's all.

, This is very important because if the cake sticks, you will pull something off, like the lamb's head, when trying to unmold it. Spraying with cooking spray is easiest. If using butter or margarine, be sure to get into every nook and cranny of the mold; anything not covered has a potential for sticking.

Grease it even if your pan is non-stick! 3-D cakes are different from most cakes and errors are harder to fix.

, Choose a cake style suitable for the season, such as a cake with buttery, citrus and vanilla overtones. The lamb cake tends to be made with a basic white cake base, but flavoring it is okay too. Choose a cake with a thick texture because this helps to prevent the cake from oozing out of the cake pan, as well as being substantial enough to stay upright once baked. Just avoid darker cakes, like chocolate cake unless you're feeling contrary! Some cake suggestions for lamb cake include:

Butter cake
Vanilla and lemon butter cake
Pound cake
Greek lemon cake

Orange cake (this one is vegan)
White or vanilla cake mix if using a package cake.

, Scrape the batter off the sides of the mixing bowl into the mold using a cake spatula. The mold should fill up the lamb's body, head and ears., A lamb cake mold may have its own screws or clips to bring it together. If not, use string to tie it together, tightly.

According to Taste of Beirut, with the mold that closes, it helps if you place a Q-tip or bamboo skewer on the ears and press down a little, to prevent the ears from falling off after baking.
Be aware that some molds work better if the two halves are cooked separately and are then attached using frosting or icing after they have been baked.
If you're just using a one-sided lamb mold, it's ready to bake according to the cake instructions.

, The best position is middle rack, center of the oven. Also check the mold instructions for any additional requirements in relation to cooking time (if relevant)., It is cooked once a skewer inserted into it comes out clean but you can only do this if the mold has left a testing hole, located on the top mold half to avoid batter oozing out., Leave the mold intact for five minutes before removing., Use oven mitts to handle the cake pans and hold the cake when unmolding. It will be very hot. A solid lamb cake takes around three to four hours to completely cool down.

If the lamb cake doesn't sit flat, you can trim it to sit flat.

, If so, poke little holes here and there in the lamb, to ensure that the syrup sinks in better., The simplest method for decorating the lamb cake is to simply spread ordinary icing or frosting over the cake.
The lamb is usually decorated in white but a brown, black or a black and white lamb could be cool too, although potentially messier to make.






Pipe icing decorations on the lamb cake. Use a piping bag to build small peaks aligned regularly across the lamb's body to look like wool. Or make long waves of piped icing. See the images for more ideas.






A brown (chocolate) version).
Decorate with melted white chocolate. Use your favorite melted white chocolate recipe and pour over the lamb cake. Allow to set and attach decorations using new melted chocolate dabbed on the back of the decorative items.
Decorate with marshmallows. Ice as normal but stick marshmallows in a neat pattern across the areas of the lamb where there would be wool.











Decorate with coconut. Ice as normal with white icing/frosting and sprinkle desiccated or shredded coconut across the lamb's body.






Use piped whipped cream for the wool.
Use chocolate curls. Make small chocolate curls from white chocolate. Frost or ice the lamb and attach the white chocolate curls evenly across the lamb's body and head to form wool.






Or, if you're feeling inclined toward a more out-there cake, you could skip frosting or icing and just make a zombie lamb cake. Use a red velvet cake mix for this lamb cake.;
, Whatever way you decide to decorate the lamb's body, the lamb will need specially defined facial features. Here are some suggestions:

Use candies or candied fruit for eyes, nose and the little inner areas of the ears. Jelly beans, M&Ms, licorice strands, candied angelica, dried apricots, dried cranberries, glazed cherries, etc. are all useful choices.
Make fondant or marzipan eyes and nose shapes and attach.
Use raisins or currants to make the features.
Use food coloring for the features. Take care that it doesn't run everywhere though.

, This can be made from candy such as a twist of shoestring licorice or real plants that are edible, such as a strand of herbs. Or just use fabric or similar ribbon and tie in a neat bow., This could be candy grass, sprouts or anything else your imagination comes up with. Candies and small eggs can be arranged around artfully; really, it's whatever takes your fancy to finish off the whole look., Guests will love seeing the lamb cake. The real problem tends to be having the heart to start making slices from it!"

Enjoy your new home.",How to Host a Housewarming Party," You should start keeping a guest list before you start working on the invitation. Be sure you include any friends, family, and coworkers that you would like to invite into your new home.


Limit the guest list to the number of guests appropriate for the amount of space you have available.If you have a small space, consider hosting 2-3 smaller parties rather than one big one.
Remember that more people lead to a more expensive party; if your budget is tight, try limiting the guest list.;
, It is good to have people to your home soon after you move in, but not too soon. You should have time to unpack, decorate, and clean most of the house. Planning a party 2-3 weeks after you move in can give you enough time to prepare and unpack, but will give you an added incentive to get yourself settled., Invitations should be sent at least 2 weeks ahead of time for most parties. Shorter notice can be given if the party is more casual/informal.


Use social media or an electronic invitation service if you want to send electronic invites and cut down on party-related expenses.For a more formal gathering, consider sending paper invitations.
Be sure to include the date, start time, and end time on your invitation.
Request an RSVP so that you can plan for food and drinks appropriately.

, Most house-warming parties feature finger foodsthat people can munch on as they are mingling, seeing your new house, and drinking.


Consider the time of your party when planning for food. If your party takes place at a common mealtime, guests may expect to be fed. For example, a party that takes place from 4-9 should probably provide a full meal for dinner.
Be realistic about how much time you will have to prepare food. If you won’t have much prep time or if you have a limited budget, try keeping your food options simpler.A few easy party foods are: fresh fruits and vegetables with dips, cheese and cracker trays, chips or breads with savory dips, rolled deli meats, meats wrapped around other items such as vegetables or fruits, sandwich trays, and meatballs.
If you provide a hot meal for your guests, consider preparing in and serving from a slow cooker, so you do not have to do much cooking after your guests have arrived.
Be sure you have adequate plates, bowls, serving utensils, and eating utensils prior to your guests’ arrival.

, You can take some of the pressure off of your party planning by hiring a professional to cook the food for you. Just be sure you know how to serve the food properly and make arrangements to pick up the food or have it delivered on the day of your party.

, Check your guest list and decide what kinds of drinks to provide based on the preferences of your guests. If you plan to serve alcohol, be sure to also have a few nonalcoholic options available.


If serving alcohol, provide a variety of options, such as both red and white wine and two or three kinds of beer.
Consider making a specialty punch for the occasion. Many guests like trying new things, and a homemade punch (with or without alcohol) is often popular at parties.
Be sure to have clean water available for guests, either in a filtered pitcher or in water bottles.

, Be sure your home is ready for people to see it. If you do not have time to unpack every box, at least try to unpack the main areas that party guests will be in: your kitchen, dining room, living room, and guest bathroom.


Hide any unpacked boxes in closets or stack them discreetly in a corner.
Be aware that at a housewarming party, guests will likely want to look at every room in your house, so even the rooms that aren’t “finished” should look neat.

, Even though people understand that your home may not be 100% perfect when they come over, you should make an effort to have some décor hung.Completely bare walls often make a home look unwelcoming, so hanging pictures or décor can make the difference between an unfinished and a polished look for your new home.


Be practical when decorating your home. If you have several small children attending your party, you may not want to put breakable knick-knacks at low heights.
Be sure that furniture and wall hangings are secured properly so that no guests are injured in your new home.

, A few well-placed candles, a stocked powder room, and some quality music playing can make all the difference in your guests’ perception of your new home.


Be sure to provide plenty of toilet paper, tissues, and a hand towel or two in each restroom., While people will be looking mostly at your home, it’s important that when you host a party, you look nice yourself too. Dress in comfortable but flattering clothing. If you’re cooking, you may want to wear an apron to protect your clothing from food stains.

, While some pets are great around people, sometimes large groups of new people can be stressful for pets. Consider shutting your pet in a room (with food and fresh water) when guests begin to arrive. This can help keep your home cleaner, avoid problems with guests who have phobias or allergies, and will likely make your pet more comfortable.

, Though you may have a lot to do, it’s nice to greet and welcome each arriving guest into your home yourself, rather than having another guest let them in. This is their first impression of your new home, and greeting them yourself sets the best tone for the party.

, When each guest arrives, offer him a drink. Give an overview of the options and offer to pour a drink for him. If he declines initially, show him where the drinks are and encourage him to help himself whenever he is ready.

, You may want to wait until a small group has arrived so that you don’t have to give as many individual tours. Guests love to see all of the rooms of your new home, including closets and pantries.If you have any unfinished rooms, ask guests if they have any suggestions for how to use or organize the space. This will take the focus off of the fact that you’re not unpacked yet and give guests an opportunity to feel helpful.
Feel free to tell guests that they cannot go into certain rooms. It is your home, after all, and you do not have to show everyone every room in the house.

, You may want to put all the food out at once, but you can also put food out in waves. You could start with 2 or 3 food trays, then add to them or provide new things as the evening progresses. Encourage your guests to eat and ask them about any dietary restrictions or allergies as you direct them towards the different food options.


Consider keeping the food and drink areas separate to avoid crowding.
Providing two or more locations for food can also prevent crowding.

, Try not to spend too much time with any one party guest, but circulate around and speak with everyone. Be sure all your guests know each other, and if you are introducing two people who have never met, try to point out something that you think they may have in common.

, Remember that people may have different styles and visions for homes, and that some of your guests may not have the privilege of owning a nice home. Always be gracious and be genuinely grateful that your guests have come to see and celebrate your new home with you.

, If you plan to serve a sit-down meal, try to serve it at the appropriate time. Most of your guests should have arrived, but no one should have been there long enough that they feel ready to leave.

, Towards the end of the night, consider serving your guests coffee and dessert (if you did not have dessert trays out already). This will be a signal to your guests that the party is winding down, and providing coffee before guests drive home is a nice way to help keep them safe.Be sure to thank guests for coming before they leave.

, Sometimes conscientious party guests will help you clean up before they leave, but if they do not, you may have a rather large mess on your hands after the party. Try to clean at least one room before you go to bed, and clean the rest of the house the next day.

, You might want to thank any guest who attended your party, but you should definitely send a note to anyone who brought you a housewarming gift. Mailed notes are more formal, but even an email note shows a personal touch.


Be sure to thank them for any gifts and explain how/when you plan to use the gift.
Mention a specific moment from the party that you found particularly funny or touching to make the note more personal.
Make a suggestion for getting together again in the future to show that you enjoy the person’s company.

, One of the nice things about hosting a housewarming party is basking in the glow of the idea that everyone loved your new home. Take some time to enjoy the moment, and enjoy your new home. Remember that this party is going to be just one of many memories that will take place in the home.

Stick to your budget.,
Make your own food instead of getting it catered.,
Keep appetizers simple.,
Create your own decorations.,
Rent equipment that you don't have.",How to Host an Outdoor Party on a Budget1," Create a max for the amount of money that you can spend for the party and stick to it. Write down a list of all your expenses and see if it matches up with the amount of money you'd like to spend. If your expenses run higher than the budget that you set for yourself, take steps to reduce or eliminate costs for the party.For example, if you only have $100 dollars to spend on the party, but the libations, decorations, and food that you want for the party cost $300, you'll have to figure out a way to reduce your costs by $200.;
, Find less expensive alternatives to products at the supermarket and make the food for the party instead of scheduling a caterer. Try to cook most of the food the night before so that you only need to reheat it on day of the party.If you have a grill, you can make hamburgers and hot dogs for the party.
You can also make affordable french fries out of potatoes.
Other affordable dishes include kabobs, fried shrimp, or mini sandwiches.Think of dishes that you can make in large batches.
Purchasing ingredients in bulk will also save you money.

, Appetizers and hors d’oeuvres don't need to be elaborate and expensive. Instead, consider cheaper alternatives like fresh fruit, trail mix, popcorn, cookies, or potato chips.If you want to spend a little more, but still stay on your budget, frozen cocktail shrimp is an affordable option.

, Instead of going out and getting expensive party decorations, you can save some money by creating them yourself. Dyed Mason jars, wheelbarrows that act as ice coolers, and colored balloons are cheap ways that you can add a sense of rustic elegance to your party.You can also use freshly picked flowers from your yard as a centerpiece.
Multi-colored bandannas make for great table runners.

, Purchasing simple equipment like chairs, coolers, speakers, or tableware can become expensive. Instead of outright purchasing your party equipment, see if you can rent the equipment at a lower cost.Even things like folding chairs and serving bowls can be rented."

Focus on fruit.,
Use sugar-free chocolate for making chocolate eggs and molded figures.,
Use gel or jelly to make Easter treats.,
Find sugar-free or sugar-reduced baking recipes for cupcakes, cakes, muffins and cookies.,
Make cute things from real eggs.,
Make savory treats.,
Fill Easter egg containers and Easter baskets with healthy treats.",How to Make an Easter Treat Without Sugar," While fruit contains fructose, it is healthier than processed sugar products because fruit contains the roughage, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants in combinations that provide our body with what it needs for energy and good health. There are many fruit snacks and desserts that can be used at Easter time, including chocolate dipped fruit if you use low-sugar or sugar-free chocolate. Fruit can be turned into interesting creations, including:


A fruit bouquet
A fruit basket

Fruit kebabs––try drizzling dark sugar-free chocolate over the skewers for an Easter special
Fruit pops – either use fresh fruit on the end of a stick or make sugar-free dried fruit balls (rolled in coconut or dark cocoa) for a tasty treat

A watermelon basket fruit salad (where watermelon is available, such as some southern hemisphere countries)
A delicious fruit salad
Fruit sorbets.;
, There are two main types of sugar-free chocolate––one is very dark chocolate without sugar and the other is diabetic chocolate, which has a substitute sweetener. Very dark chocolate is quite bitter, so it's an acquired taste but it can be mellowed with the addition of fruit or other flavorings when baking or cooking with it. If you're okay with less sugar rather than no sugar, try dark chocolate around the 60 to 75 percent ranges which still has small amounts of sugar added but isn't too sugary or with added fats. If the chocolate is of high quality, a little bit will go a very long way.

, Gel or jelly formed into large or small animal shapes (using molds such as a rabbit), can be an excellent means for making a sugar-free sweet for the Easter table. Instead of using sugary commercial Jello packages though, make the gel or jelly from scratch, adding in berries or fruit pieces and sweetening with either apple juice or apple juice concentrate in place of sugar.


You can use either gelatin or agar agar to make gel or jelly. Only the latter is suitable for vegetarians and vegans.
Fruits to add include diced pear, chopped banana, raspberries or other berries (use frozen berries if you can't find any fresh at this time of year), etc.
Junket can be used for milky flavored gel desserts. Add fruit pieces as above if wished.
Make homemade marshmallow treats in the shapes of bunnies, chicks and eggs (peeps substitutes). Avoid adding sugar. Such treats can be coated in dark, sugar-free chocolate or cocoa, or coated in desiccated or shredded coconut.

, Use substitutes such as applesauce, apple juice, grape juice, spices, stevia, mashed fruit, etc. in place of sugar. Provided you're prepared to experiment with the recipe, you can make many of your traditional baking recipes reduced in sugar or sugar-free.


Look for sugar-free baking recipes. This is easier than having to guess changes in measurement yourself.
As a general rule, sugar can be reduced by half or even to a third of the amount suggested in a cake, flan or cookie recipe and still taste fine. However, the flavor will be less sweet, so you might need to find substitutes to make up for it.

, Boil an egg and transform it into many different cute and delicious things. Make bento style egg animals, turn peeled boiled eggs into animals, flowers, monsters, etc., or try carving boiled eggs in interesting ways. Dyed boiled eggs (using edible dyes) can be interesting meal additions.


Try making a hen egg salad.
Eggs and carrots are a great combination––eggs for the chicken symbol of Easter and carrots for the Easter bunny.

, Buy or make small crackers, pretzels and savory cookies and fill up small cellophane bags shaped to look like carrots. Tie the end with a green ribbon to look like a carrot top. Fill a basket with these bags for an Easter treat that both looks good (a bunch of ""carrots"") and tastes great.


Nuts and raisins can be added into the mix if desired.

, Think of different foods for adding to Easter baskets than the usual high sugar treats on sale. Some items that you could use instead include nuts, small amounts of dried fruit, trail mix, popcorn, homemade low-sugar cookies and homemade low- or no-sugar chocolate eggs.


Make up a basket of sugar-free commercial treats. There are candies and chocolates made with reduced or no sugar. If you find these, you can make up a basket with these, as well as some nuts, dried fruit and non-edible treats. Look for such candies as sugar-free jellybeans, sugar-free chocolates, sugar-free Easter eggs, etc.
It might be kinder to add just a few small, quality chocolate commercial eggs to a totally healthy, homemade mix for kids who would otherwise feel left out. However, for adults, especially for those watching their food intake or who cannot eat sugar for health reasons, changing the treats to healthier ones will often be appreciated, especially your thoughtful input into finding things they can eat.

Ask your friends to bring party equipment.,
Make the party a BYOB.,
Serve hors d’oeuvres instead of the main course.,
Reuse decorations from previous parties.,
Make the party a potluck.",How to Host an Outdoor Party on a Budget2," If you don't have the proper equipment like chairs, stereo equipment, bowls, or glasses, you can ask your friends to help you. Call friends that are coming to the party and ask them if they can bring party equipment with them. Make sure that they arrive early so that they can help you set everything up.You can also ask your neighbors if you can borrow some of their equipment for the party.

, One of the largest expenses for many parties is the cost of libations. Instead of putting the burden on yourself, let everyone know that the party will be BYOB and that they are expected to bring their own drinks. You can still buy some alcohol for people who don't bring anything, but you won't have to serve the entire party., Instead of a more formal sit-down dinner, consider passing around appetizers and hors d’oeuvres throughout the night. If you do make smaller dishes, ensure that you make enough of it so that people aren't left out at your party., If you've already thrown an outdoor party in the past, there's a good chance that you can reuse most of the decorations and equipment instead of renting or purchasing new stuff. Take stock of the party gear that you have, and create a plan to reuse it.

, Eliminate the cost of food or having to purchase ingredients by making your outdoor party a potluck. Tell people to bring their favorite cold dish, or dish that can be reheated on the grill. The more people that bring food, the fewer people you'll have to pay for."

Make it a dance party.,
Brainstorm other free games you can play.",How to Host an Outdoor Party on a Budget3," To play lawn twister, cut out a circle from the top of a pizza box and use it as a stencil to spray temporary paint on the ground. Use four colors and spray circles onto your lawn in rows of six. As a replacement for the spinner, you can put slips of paper with the colors and body part names in a jar and have people pick out a piece of paper.The pieces of paper should read left hand, right hand, left foot, right foot, and the paint colors.
Your game board should be 4x6 circles.

, Tie a string around the ends of a couple of water balloons and then hang them on a tree. Blindfold players and have them swing at the balloons, just as one would for a regular pinata. When people hit a balloon, the water balloons will explode and get everyone wet. This is a great game to play when it's hot outside., If you already own some board or card games, you can bring them out for people to play. Make sure that you bring out games that allow a lot of people to participate so that you can involve the most people as possible.


Popular party games include Cards Against Humanity, Monopoly, Scrabble, and Uno., Adding music and dance to your party will make it more fun. Create a song list that will encourage people to dance, and clear some space in your yard to create a dancefloor. Remember to provide enough water for everyone so that they stay hydrated.

, Games like tag, charades, hide and seek, limbo, capture the flag, never have I ever, musical chairs, and tug of war are all free games that require almost no setup. Think of other free games that don't require equipment to play and set them up for your party.Think of games that are appropriate for all ages if kids are going to be at the party.

You can do this party one of two ways:


Make it just like the show, and invite one of your friends/family members that makes fashion faux-pas a little too often, then surprise them by saying they they're going to get a fashion makeover!,
For both parties, assign your own family/friends to be the cast of ""What not to Wear"".,
For both parties, decorate your house/party space just like the ""What not to Wear"" studio.,
At the end of either party theme, eat cake/snacks, chat, dance, or do whatever you please now that everyone looks great, and you can go to bed knowing that you had a great party!

",How to Host a What Not to Wear Party1," This is a great idea for a surprise birthday party, because then all the guests could get the birthday person fashionable clothes or gift cards to cool stores.
Tell all your guests to wear their most horrible outfits. Floor-length skirts, see-through shirts, unmatched colours and patterns, old lady dresses, nurse's shoes, and bad makeup. Also, tell them to bring their favourite/most fashionable outfits. This is a good theme for younger kids/teenagers because it gets the guests more involved.
If you want, you can mix components of both parties.

, If possible, get a man and a woman and assign them as the hosts (Clinton Kelly and Stacy London), then a woman to be the makeup artist (Carmine), and possibly even a man to be the hairstylist (Ted Gibson). However, it's not recommended to have your hairstylist actually cut anyone's hair. Instead, have them braid their hair, or curl, crimp, or straighten it.

, Make sure to have a place for your guests to get their makeup done by your very own Carmine. Place pictures of fashionable outfits around your house as well.

Feed and exercise your dog before the party.,
Clean up before guests arrive.,
Keep your pet off the furniture.,
Notify guests ahead of time.,
Talk to guests about how to engage with your dog.",How to Host a Party When You Have a Dog1," Two potential issues for your dog during the party are hyperactivity and begging. Even if your dog is well-behaved around you, they may see the opportunity to snag a hot dog from an unsuspecting guest and go for it if they’re hungry. Likewise, a dog that didn't exercise recently will be more likely to get too excited when guests arrive.Ideally, get your dog a solid exercise session an hour or so preceding the party. Then feed them shortly before the party begins. A tired, satiated dog is especially likely to be calm and well-behaved.;
, Whatever type of party you’re having, it’s unlikely that fur is one of your intended decorations - at least in terms of the furniture. Aside from the cleanliness factor of fur-free seating, some guests may also be allergic. In short, use a vacuum to clean any upholstered furniture that guests may be using during the party.A quick lint roller to prominent pieces of furniture right before guests arrive can be a good idea as well, especially if folks will be well-dressed.

, This will likely require training before the party. It’s also pretty important if you want to allow your dog to roam freely during the party. Even in your dog is usually allowed to join you on the couch, you should disallow them from getting onto the furniture while others are visiting.The commands to “sit” and/or “stay” will likely be sufficient to keep your dog off the furniture, if they are well-enough trained to follow these commands obediently.

, It’s important to let any visitors know that you have a dog before they arrive. Not only is this fair to them, it will also ensure that you’re aware of any guests' fears or allergies that you need to address. For instance, if one of your guests simply cannot be around dogs for whatever reason, plan to keep your dog outdoors, in a kennel, or even at a different location., Visitors can inadvertently create issues without intending to do so. Most commonly, guests might insist they don’t mind when your dog jumps up or slobbers on their hands. However, if a guest allows your dog to do so, it reinforces these behaviors.Be clear with guests that there are certain obedience things you’re working on with your dog. For instance, say something like, “I’m glad you and Gateway are getting along so well. I have a favor to ask though. Whenever he jumps up, can you ignore him? Only acknowledge him when he's being well behaved, with all four paws on the floor.”
You may have to crate your dog based on your guests' behavior. If they allow or encourage negative behaviors, this will make it much harder to train your dog.
Give specific directions to guests about things you don't want them to do. For instance, ""I avoid feeding Rocky from the table, and I'm hoping you'll do the same. If you want to give him a treat, ask him to sit or lay down away from the table and give him a reward if he obeys.""

"
"
When you send out invitations to your guests, tell them to send you pictures of your 'Fashion Faux-Pas Person' (the FF-PP) wearing their worst outfits.,
Once the party starts, sit your 'Fashion Faux-Pas Person' (FF-PP) down, and tell them that you've been secretly filming them for the past 2 weeks (or however long you want).,
Go through your FF-PP's outfits and 'throw them away' (You don't have to if you don't want to).

,
Instead of going shopping for new outfits like they do on the show, open your guests' presents (if they've gotten the birthday person clothes and gift cards).,

, Take pictures of your guests in their best outfits.

, Make sure that Stacy and Clinton both say positive stuff about the guest's outfits. Make sure that the person playing Stacy London says ""Shut up!"" frequently (she says ""Shut up!"" whenever she's impressed with an outfit).

, This will be a lot of fun and will get a lot of laughs.

Ignore your dog when they jump up.,
Reward behavior you want to reinforce.,
Practice greeting visitors to reduce barking.",How to Host a Party When You Have a Dog2," Though you may be thrilled when you can tell your dog is excited to see you when you get home, you can’t allow your dog to jump up on guests. This may frighten some folks, and risks injuring children or unsuspecting visitors. Fortunately, training dogs to avoid this behavior is simple. When they jump up on you and try to rest their paws against your leg or body, simply turn away.Indicate that they do not get attention by jumping up. More to the point, give them less attention than you normally would by ignoring them outright.
Prevent inadvertent rewarding that may confuse your dog. Direct other people that spend time around your dog not to acknowledge them when they jump up. If others happily pet and speak to your dog when they jump up, this will teach them that doing so gets them attention.

, For instance, whenever your dog greets you or another person quietly and keeps all four of their paws on their ground, reward them immediately. Similarly, if a dog goes to their bed and sits quietly while you and your guests are sitting down for a meal, reward the dog for doing so.A quick pet and a friendly verbal acknowledgment can do the trick, while providing a treat can also help convey that you favor what they’re currently doing.
To reinforce the idea of rewards for good behavior, provide a treat for desired behavior when you train your dog something new.

, Practice introductions when anyone visits, especially preceding any events that will include lots of people in your home. Keep your dog on a leash, direct them to sit beside your before opening the door, and reward them if they stay calm when new people arrive at your home.Tell visitors to ignore jumping or barking and only acknowledge the dog when the dog is being calm and friendly. This will not only help teach the dog not to engage in undesired behavior, it will also help reward positive behavior.
Keeping your dog on a leash is another way as visitors arrive at your party will also help prevent them from bolting out the door.
Even if your dog does not bark at visitors or attempt to bolt regularly, they may be more likely to do so during a party.

"
"
Keep your dog on a leash as guests arrive.,
Provide your dog chew toys during the party.,
Crate your dog if necessary.",How to Host a Party When You Have a Dog3," This is especially important if your dog is likely to become excited during introductions with new guests. Greet arriving guests outside, if possible, as dogs are more likely to remain calm in large, open areas as opposed to closed spaces. Reward your dog with a treat each time they calmly greet your visitors with all four paws on the ground.A harness with a front clip or a head halter are best, as they will make it easier to control your dog, but a simple leash will suffice.
Do not allow your dog off leash during a party unless you are sure that they will be able to calmly sit and stay when directed to do so.

, A great way to keep your dog calmly occupied is by providing them chew toys that you know they favor. Ideally, you will be able to command your dog to stay in a particular location, such as their bed, and provide them a long-lasting chew toy to entertain them.Chew toys are also a great way to prevent your dog from chewing something they shouldn’t, which is more likely during potentially high-stress experiences like parties.
If your dog ever becomes aggressive when protecting food or other items, do not give them a chew toy in the presence of visitors. Instead, simply place a chew toy in the dog’s crate, or somewhere else they may enjoy it in private.

, If your dog is unwilling to sit or stay when commanded to do so, and persistently pesters guests (even if only with affection), you should probably put them in their crate during your party. Extra humans in your home will potentially stress your dog out. In turn, moments of fear and aggression may be more likely. Even if they usually never do so, your dog may snap at someone unexpectedly is they are uncomfortable.At the minimum, ensure your dog has a space that they can retreat to. For instance, leave the door to your bedroom cracked, and potentially even leave one of their favorite toys on the floor.

Invite a group of friends over for the beer tasting party.,
Purchase the beers for tasting.,
Set up the beer tasting area.,
Make beer tasting score sheets.,
Pour the beer.,
Encourage guests to try the beer in a suitable order.,
Encourage snacking in between all beer tasting.,
Consider awarding prizes.",How to Hold a Beer Tasting Party," Be sure that most of them enjoy beer. Even those who don't like beer though, can be encouraged to at least try a few on the off chance that they might discover one they do like. Send email invitations with photos of beers or make paper invitations in the shape of a beer bottle or similar.


Keep the group of friends small for the beer tasting event. This makes it easier to spend time together and to keep the costs reasonable.;
, There are several ways that you might approach this:


Buy a range of beers across different brands, randomly.
Buy a range of beers of a particular style (lager, ale, stout, etc.)
Focus on the season and buy beers suited to the season (e.g., lager for summer, stout for winter)
Pit imported beers against domestic beers, buy a few of each
Try some organic beers
Throw in some boutique or even some home-brewed beers if you can get some.

, Display each bottle chosen so that guests can see what they're tasting. Arrange 3 ounce sample glasses near the bottles for pouring samples of each beer into. Note that the wider the glass, the better for the aroma of the beer, as your nose is an important part of the beer tasting process. Also leave normal beer glasses for guests to help themselves to if they'd like to have more of any kind of beer; this is a party and their enjoyment comes first.


If you have the time and interest, search for some additional background information on the beers and make small background sheets or notes to accompany the bottles. Guests could read out this information to each other or simply read it at their convenience.

, A simple table can be produced on your computer that allows guests to rank taste, texture, finish, head, etc. of the beers. Leave space for comments as well, as some guests might like to explore the taste impact further, pointing out fruity notes or how they didn't like the beer, etc. Print off enough for guests, plus some spares. Also find enough markers for each guest to use.

, Don't fill the sample glasses. Only pour about a third of a cup's worth into each sample glass. This ensures that the aroma can fill the glass and prevents the over-indulgence of any beer by guests during the tasting stage.

, Beer should be tasted in order of lightest flavors to heaviest. This cannot be guessed by color alone; the more hoppy, high alcohol level beers should be left until last as they're the heaviest flavors. Unlike wine, beer must be drunk, not swilled and spat out. This is because some of the beer flavor is tasted at the back of the tongue and swallowing a few sips allows this flavor to be captured.

, This will help to clear the palate between beer tastings, keep alcohol levels lower in the bloodstream and prevent hangovers from over-indulging in the beers. Suitable snacks include crackers, cheese, fruit, raw vegetables and pates and dips.

, There are several possible approaches to this, including:


Sending guests home with a goodie bag with a few beer samples inside and perhaps a beer inspired food item, such as a beer cake recipe or a bag of pretzels.
Award a prize for the most interesting or comprehensive tasting notes.
Have a blind tasting competition to see if guests can guess which beer they're tasting, awarding the prize to the guest with the most accurate guesses.

Dust, vacuum, clean surfaces, and get rid of clutter.If you’re having overnight guests, change the linens on the bed where they will sleep.
Put out clean towels in the bathroom.;
, Make sure you’ll have everything you need while your guests are in your home. Buy enough food, drink, and other necessities, like tissues. You’ll feel more prepared and confident knowing that you won’t run out of anything.


Check your supplies of toilet paper, soap, napkins, and other essentials.
Make a shopping list based on your menus and any supplies you need to restock so you don’t forget anything when you shop.

, Whether your guests are coming for a party or a weekend, you want to verify that things work. For your party, make sure that the equipment you want to use for playing music works and can be amplified. Also check that games have all of their pieces. For your overnight guests, check that lamps have lightbulbs, clocks are set correctly, and remotes have batteries.


This is a great time to fix major things aren’t working, like plumbing that is stopped up or a broken step on your porch. If you can’t fix them in time, be sure to warn your guests and have a backup plan.

, Your guests will arrive with gifts for hosts, coats, purses, and luggage if they are staying overnight. Plan where you want these to go while you’re entertaining. Take care of your guests’ things as soon as they walk in the door so they will immediately feel welcome.Set aside a space for your luggage on the surface like a trunk or the floor of a closet. You can even invest in a luggage rack. This will help guests stay organized.Make space in dressers and closets for your overnight guests.

, If you are having a party, invite people who you think will get along, appreciate the invitation, and enjoy the party. Plan your guest list so everyone can fit comfortably in your home. For example, if you’re throwing a dinner party, decide how you want to seat guests and if you’ll have enough chairs. When you plan for overnight guests, only invite the number of people you can reasonably accommodate.Consider throwing a few smaller parties if you have a small space and a long guest list.

, If you are worried about guests overstaying their welcome, specify how long you are inviting them for. For example, give specific dates to overnight guests. And when you issue party invitations, state exact start and end times.If you don’t want overnight guests for more than a weekend, you could say, “We are so pleased you can visit us. We will be able to host you the weekend of the 10th to the 12th and would love to have you visit then.”

, It’s a good idea to decide if there are places in your home where you do not want guests. For example, you might not want them in bedrooms during a party. If you have a family or roommate, come to an agreement about which areas are off-limits and how you will all politely steer guests away from those areas.


Say that you aren’t prepared to show guests certain rooms, for example: “Those are the bedrooms. We didn’t really clean them up for guests. Sorry.”
Encourage guests to explore areas that you don’t mind them seeing, for example: “The bedrooms are down that hall. Let me show you the patio and garden now. I think you’ll enjoy seeing them.”

Have a bullet-proof exit strategy before you leave the house.,
Don't make a big deal about being ""the sober one."",
Use the party to your advantage.,
Get entertained by the drunk people.,
Finish strong.",How to Have Fun at a Party Where Everyone Is Getting Drunk," This will ensure that you can have fun on your own terms, and don't fall victim to the whimsy of your friends, who may have different ideas about how the night will go. In order to plan for a good time, you must be able to leave whenever things get too crazy...or just boring.


Though life is unpredictable, you can get a reasonable sense of how wild the party will be based on the occasion. Are your aunt and uncle having a daytime housewarming party, or is it the 30th birthday party of a guy who refers to himself as ""Mr. Blackout""? Having a sense of how the night will go can help you decide if you're just popping in to say hello, or if you'll have fun late into the night.
Figure out the ride situation. If you promised to give rides to your four best friends, then you have committed yourself to a long night, whether you want to be there or not. Leaving them in the lurch makes you responsible if they try to get home in an ill-advised fashion. If you only plan on staying at Aunt Nina's housewarming party for an hour, make this clear to your beer-guzzling cousin from the get-go, so he doesn't end up begging you to stay longer so he can get home without getting arrested. Remember that you're first and foremost a guest at a party, not a carpool mom or a night nurse.
Be realistic. Sometimes, there's no predicting how a party will go, and you just might end up holding back the hair of your new best friend as she hovers over a toilet bowl. Go into the party knowing that things happen, and that the party just might not be fun this time, even if your party plan was bullet-proof.;
, Not drinking is always okay, but if you want to have fun, you should avoid alienating people just because they're drinking and you're not. The other guests shouldn't feel uncomfortable about being tipsy in front of you. They're doing their thing, and you're doing yours.


Always have a drink in your hand, even if it's just a club soda or a caffeinated beverage. This will keep some people from feeling self-conscious that they are too drunk while you are sober, and will allow them to open up to you. This will also help you avoid that annoying guy who keeps tapping you on the shoulder to say, ""Are you really sure you don't want just one drink?""
Avoid constantly talking about how you're not drinking, or pointing out how drunk some people are. It's great to be open about your habits, but you should avoid sounding judgmental or like you're nagging people who just want to have fun.

, Don't think that being sober is a drawback. Instead, look at this as an opportunity to do something you've always wanted to do — but which will be easier to accomplish at a party where others are drinking, and therefore, more amenable to your ideas for fun activities.


Be the DJ. Are there a few silly and ridiculous songs that you have been too embarrassed to admit you like in public? This is your chance to control the stereo, and to hit up the dance floor to your favorite beats. So what if you make a fool of yourself? Those sloshed souls don't care! Have fun!
Play an old video game. Are you obsessed with a certain video game, but can't find anyone to play with? This is your chance to convince an eager drunk to pick up a controller and have some fun!
Try a new recipe. Have you been meaning to make that watermelon-and-feta salad for weeks, but were too shy to share it with anyone? This is your chance to find out what people really think about your culinary skills.
Make new friends. Use the party as an opportunity to approach that cute guy you've been crushing on for weeks, or to look for a new yoga buddy. Remember that not absolutely everyone at the party will be completely drunk, and you may still be able to have some pretty interesting — and coherent — conversations.

, You may be sober, but that doesn't mean you can't have as much fun as the girl dancing around with a lampshade on her head. If you're at the party being sober, you can talk to drunk people and get entertained by their comments and antics; heck, you can even tease them about it later, without being obnoxious. Here are some great ways to have fun at a party by being entertained by the drunk people in your orbit:


Drunks can be fun to talk to. When your friend is buzzed, maybe he'll tell you that secret you've been dying to know. Or say what he really thinks about your best friend's new beau.
Drunks can be fun to watch! It can be really funny to simply watch them stumble around, and do things that they'll regret. Of course, you don't want to be judgmental of these people — being drunk is a choice, just as being sober is. Still, you can quietly chuckle to yourself.
Be the historian. Take this as an opportunity to take silly (though not incriminating) photos of your friends having a blast. They'll thank you the next day when they realize they didn't take a single photo the entire night.

, As you get ready to leave, remember that you should leave a positive impression with the guests and hosts so you will be invited to their future shindigs — and can invite them to yours. Maintaining a fun attitude at the end of the night will make everyone see that you don't need to do a keg stand to be the most fun person at the party.


Remember that if you had a great exit-strategy, you should be able to leave when you want to. If no one is depending on you, leave as soon as you get bored or tired. You don't want to be remembered as the grumpy guest who wore out his or her welcome.
Make plans with your new friends. If you really hit it off with yoga girl, you can get her number, or ask if your crush wants to grab coffee some time.
Give yourself a reward when you get home. If the night was a bit taxing, unwind with your favorite TV show or your favorite dessert — or that leftover watermelon salad.
Sum up your night. The next day, ask yourself if there was anything you could have done to make the party more fun — or to avoid any unpleasant incidents in the future.

Line up your menus.,
Plan your music.,
Get your activities ready.",How to Entertain Guests2," Decide the types of foods you will serve your guests. For example, determine if you want to serve a full meal or just snacks at your party. Next, choose if you want foods from a specific country or with a theme, especially for a dinner party. For overnight guests, plan all meals for their visit. Keep meals and snacks relatively simple so you can focus on entertaining.Along with the food, decide which drinks you will serve.
If you are budget conscious, figure out what you can afford and focus on making that wonderful.
Set out snacks and drinks in your guest room for overnight guests so they won’t need to find their way to the kitchen for a midnight snack.
Ask about food sensitivities and allergies and plan your meals and snacks around those. If you make something a guest can’t eat, point out that food to them in advance.

, Make a playlist for your party. You can do this on your phone, computer, or tablet using apps like Spotify, iTunes, Google Play, or YouTube. Choose the music that will help you set the mood you want for your party. When you’re ready for the party, hook your device up to your stereo.Plan a long enough playlist so you have music for the entire party.
Mix up the type of music you play during the party. For example, you might want to start with something really upbeat, and then play mellower music at the end of the night to wind things down.
Use an app that lets guests choose songs from your playlist, like Jukebox Hero.Hire a DJ for a large party if that fits in your budget.

, Plan to show your guests a good time. Help people interact at your party with games or by making a space for dancing. Plan some conversation topics or interesting questions, especially for a dinner party. Overnight guests do not need to be entertained constantly, but you should plan some things to do together.Be prepared to get the dancing going and to start the games at your party.
Set up a board game during coffee and dessert at a dinner party.Ask party guests to dress according to a theme, like a beach party, or plan a mystery party.
For overnight guests, prepare a list of local entertainments and things to do in your area. Plan at least one outing with them, for example to the zoo or a local farmer’s market.
Make plans for entertaining overnight guests at home, like a movie night.

Greet guests warmly.,
Spend time with each guest.,
Help your guests get their bearings.,
Be a happy, flexible host.",How to Entertain Guests3," Welcome every guest to your home and tell them how pleased you are to have them. Show you care about their comfort by taking their things and offering them a drink. Even if you can’t meet them at the door during a party, be sure to stop whatever you’re doing to say “hello” and “welcome.”, Take a few minutes to interact with every party or overnight guest so they continue to feel welcome. At a party you should also introduce your guests to each other at the beginning of the evening. Look out for your shy party guests. Help them feel included by asking them to help you with the food or the music.

, Give guests a tour if they haven’t been in your home before. Or ask them to explore and make themselves at home if that’s okay with you. This is a good time to share any boundaries in your home and to tell them about any quirks in your house, like plumbing problems or doors that don’t lock.For overnight guests, prepare a map of your area (even if you need to draw it yourself), a spare key to your house, a list of emergency contacts, and any household instructions, like how your alarm system works.

, It’s very important that you enjoy yourself. Set the tone for your guests by relaxing and having a good time. Keep up a positive attitude and be flexible, especially if things don’t go as planned.


If you do run into a problem, ask your guests for help. Most people will love to pitch in."

This may seem at odds with the previous step, but it isn’t, as it involves learning to relax, not trying to. Some things to learn:


Deep, slow breathing
Meditation
Yoga
Self-awareness

, Part of learning how to relax is learning what relaxes you. Deep breathing and meditation are generally accepted as fundamental to any relaxation practice, but you will find other things that relax you too.


Examples of other things that relax you might include knitting, reading a book, going for a walk, or playing a musical instrument.

, If you don’t schedule things, chances are you won’t do them. Look at your week and purposefully schedule in time to practice relaxation. Be specific about the time and the activity, and stick to your plan.


For example, you might practice deep breathing between 6 and 6:15 p.m. every Thursday night, or read a book every Sunday between 8 and 9 p.m.

, A lot of people imagine sitting quietly for hours on end with a clear mind, and give up on meditation before they begin. The truth is, keeping a clear mind and sitting quietly is difficult for most of us. Here are some tips to get started:Start with short 3- to 5-minute sessions. If even that seems too long for you, try just a minute or two to start. Setting a timer on your phone can be helpful.
Know what to expect from yourself. Don't expect your mind to be completely clear while meditating. It’s more useful to work on catching yourself when your mind drifts. With time, you’ll become quicker at catching your mind and setting it back on track.
Meditate in your own way. If you struggle with sitting and doing nothing, try a walking meditation, where you focus your attention on the act of walking and the sensations that accompany it. You can also try a guided meditation, of which there are many videos and audio clips online.

,), don’t give up on your whole week. Just make a commitment to stick to your next scheduled relaxation day.

, The more confidence you have, the less you will worry about what others think of you.Know that what people think of you may be more of a reflection of their own issues and insecurities than an accurate reflection of you.
It’s important to consider people’s feelings, and respond to any concerns that they express about your behaviour. Ultimately, though, what matters most is how you view yourself.If you think people are judging your or talking about you, try to ignore them and focus on something else, like a fun conversation. People who do that at a party have so little to talk about, they focus on other people. How dull!
This is easier said than done, but it will work wonders for your self-confidence and your ability to relax.

, Maybe you feel like you look unattractive, or you’re feeling extra awkward the night of the party. Don’t give up on going.


Telling yourself you’ll only have fun when the conditions are perfect isn’t very fun. In fact, it sets you up for never having fun, because life rarely goes the way we expect or want it to.
Instead of being afraid of making a mistake, accept that you’re afraid and tell yourself that you’re going to make the most of the night, in spite of your fear.
Instead of worrying about what might happen, make a goal to be positive and meet the night’s challenges as they come. Do this and you’ll feel stronger and more confident by the end of the night.

, Trying new things is a great way to build self-confidence and help you learn to relax even in difficult situations.


Use the party as an opportunity to try doing low-risk things that you would not normally do: sing karaoke, talk to someone you don’t know, or lead a party game.
Sticking to things that you know and feel comfortable with may feel safe, but it can also prevent you from changing and growing in important ways., If you have low self-esteem you're less likely to have fun in life, and you may even view the world as a hostile place. Taking care of yourself, both mentally and physically, is the most important thing you can do to build your self-confidence.Ways to take care yourself physically (these effect your mental health as well): get enough sleep, drink enough water, eat healthfully, exercise regularly.
Ways to take care of yourself mentally: meditate, think positively, and combat negative self talk (that voice in your head that calls you dumb, useless etc.) with positive statements about yourself. You might ask your friends or family to help you come up with a list of your good qualities.
Feeling like you look good will help you feel more confident and enjoy the party. Take time to do your hair and makeup (if you wear it), and wear an outfit and shoes you love., Standing with good posture in an open, friendly position will invite others to talk to you. It will also put people at ease, which in turn may help put you at ease.


Stand with a straight (but not too straight!) back, with your chest slightly out, your stomach in, your feet forward, and your hips and knees in a neutral position. Try not to force your body into this position, otherwise you’ll look stiff.
Avoid slouching, crossing your arms over your chest, or otherwise looking worried or unapproachable.When talking to people, keep your chin down and stand at a slight angle to them so that you’re not facing them head on. This will make you seem more positive and non-judgemental., If you’re frowning and looking unhappy, people will be less likely to approach you, and you may leave the party feeling as though no one wanted to talk to you, when in fact you might have pushed them away.


Maybe don’t smile and laugh if you’re completely by yourself in one corner of the room though, unless you want to look possessed or deranged.
Studies have shown that the physical act of smiling can actually boost your mood, so try to smile even if you don’t feel like it., When you’re speaking use your body language, emotions, and voice to boost the power of your words. Studies have shown that these things count more than the actual words you say.To build your charisma, practice speaking out loud in front of your mirror or a camera. Get a sense for what body language you use. Think about what works and what doesn’t.
If you’re smiling, modulating your voice, and gesturing when you’re speaking (and not going over the top with these things), you’re doing pretty well!

, Pick a few funny or interesting stories that you can tell in social situations, and then practice telling them. This is particularly helpful if you struggle with finding things to say when you speak to people.


Some experts recommend having three good stories.Just make sure that you don’t always tell the same stories in front of (or to!) the same people. You may need to switch them up regularly.

, Another great thing to do if you struggle with speaking in social situations is to just ask people about themselves, and then actively listen to them.Examples of things you can ask are, “How do you know the host?” or “How has your week been?” or “What do you do for fun?”Actively listening to someone means not interrupting them. It also means nodding or making short comments such as “yes” or “go on” to show you’re listening. When they’re done, repeat the gist of what they said to show understanding, and then ask follow-up questions.If the person you’re talking to begins talking about something you’re also excited about, resist the urge to interrupt. Really try to focus on what they’re talking about instead of thinking about what you’ll say when they’re done.

, The best way to be interesting is to have an interesting life. Have hobbies (music, dance, sports etc.), and hang out with people who excite and inspire you.Having hobbies and inspiring friends will make it easier for you to connect with other people. You’ll always have something interesting to talk about!

, If you arrive at the party alone and don’t know anyone very well, you can still join a group conversation. Here are a few ways that you can join a conversation:Walk up to a group but stay on the outskirts. Listen to what they’re saying and then after a few minutes, contribute if you think it makes sense to do so. Only do this if you have something relevant to say. If you don’t, move on to another group and try your luck there!
Walk up and when there’s a break in the conversation, introduce yourself to the group. Say a brief “Hello” and your name, and then apologize for interrupting and ask them to go on with their conversation: “Hi I’m John. I just wanted to introduce myself. Please go on with your conversation!”
Talk to a person on the outskirts of the group, and then turn your attention towards the whole group if appropriate.
If the group wants to include you in their conversation, they’ll smile and make room for you. If the group politely says hello but then returns to their conversation without making space for you, just move to another group or person. Try not to take it personally. They could be having a private conversation., It’s important to always stay true to yourself in social situations. Even if you’re working on stepping outside of your comfort zone, you can be honest about your basic likes, dislikes, and values.


Example: If you don’t like drinking or doing drugs, don’t do them just to fit in. The same goes for anything else that you don’t feel comfortable doing. Stepping outside your comfort zone is important, but you can do that with things that don’t go against your personal values.
Example: You’re all dancing and a song you don’t like comes on. Everyone is cheering and starts dancing harder. You can look at a friend or the person next to you and say while smiling, “I actually kind of hate this song,” then shrug and say “but I gotta dance” and keep dancing.

, The host will appreciate your help.


The host may insist that you just have fun, but you can say it’s okay you feel like you need a bit of a breather anyway, and would be happy to do dishes or set up a plate, or whatever else they may need done.

, If things get slow, you can suggest some games to play. Make sure they’re simple and quick to learn. If they’re too complicated people will likely lose interest pretty quickly.

, If the party-goers decide on a game that you’re uncomfortable with, it’s okay to politely decline and do something else while they play the game. You can also suggest an alternative game.


Common games that make people feel uncomfortable include spin the bottle and seven minutes in heaven, which involve making out with others who you may not want to make out with.
If you feel weird sitting on the sidelines and watching, go into the kitchen and clean up, or excuse yourself and go to another room until they’re done.
The same goes for drinking/drugs. If you’re not interested, just politely decline.

, The goal is to stick the stickers to other guests without them noticing.


If someone notices you putting a sticker on them, you have to take it back, and they get to put one of their stickers on you.
Whoever gets rid of all their stickers first wins.

, The instructions are as follows:


Sit on the floor in a circle.
Set the self-timer on the camera and pass it around.
Each player must quickly hold the camera out in front of them as if taking a selfie before passing it on to the next player.
At some point the camera will go off, ideally when someone is holding it out in front of them.
If you don’t have a self-timing camera, you can also just have someone control the stereo, randomly stopping songs without looking at the group. Whenever the song stops, the person stuck with the camera must snap their selfie.

, How to play:


Pass out index cards and pens.
Have everyone write out 5 likes on one side of the card, and 5 dislikes on the other side.
Put the cards in a box and shake them up.
Walk around the room and have everyone draw a card.
Each person reads their card and guesses who it belongs to. Others are allowed to put in their guesses too.
Do this until everyone has read their card.
To make it a bit harder, don’t reveal whose card is whose until everyone has finished guessing.

, Going around the circle, each player must say “Ha”, “Ho”, or “Hee” without laughing. Whoever laughs is out of the game.


Keep going around the circle until there’s only one person left.
You can make it even harder by setting the rule that everyone must keep a straight face — they can’t even smile.

, Here’s how to play:


Sit in a circle.
Tell each person to think of 3 things they will say about themselves. Two statements should be true, and one should be a lie.
Going around the room, each person says their three statements, then the group votes on which one is a lie, and the person who made up the statements reveals which was a lie.
Try to keep your truths and lies lighthearted, especially if you don't know anyone at the party very well. Make them interesting or funny, not too sad or serious.

, When the music stops, everyone has to freeze. Whoever is still moving the moment the music stops is out.


Take turns controlling the stereo for this one, and be sure that whoever controlling the stereo isn’t watching the group.

, This will help you break out of your shell, and even if you don’t manage to do anything else that night, if you achieve that one goal, you can feel proud of yourself.


For example, make a goal to ask at least 5 people you don't know how they know the host., This game works best when a few of you are going to a party where no one knows you.


You can really get into it by discussing your costumes and characters, including your back stories, with your friends. You can even make up fake names.
You might even put on a fake accent and pretend to be from somewhere else.
Avoid doing this at work-related parties or other parties where you might meet someone who you’ll have to work with in real life. They might be weirded out or feel resentful toward you if they know you fooled them.

Make a list.,
Use bright colors and one statement piece : Sometimes less is more.,
Shop at the dollar store: Look, you don't have to buy the new set of fine china.,
Add Christmas lights.,

Buffet, not meals: Which might be obvious to most.,
Cut the list: You can't have 110 guests, how about 10?,
Forget it!",How to Have a Party for 100 Dollars," The most important step when keeping in budget. Try to set a price for all the supplies you would need and calculate before you shop. You might even want to go to some stores or online and check prices. To make it easier set it off to the main things. Food, tables, walls, ceilings (optional), invites and cake(optional).;
, With bright colors and a statement piece (to say hanging empty,colorful frames from the ceiling so they hang in mid air) it will take a a very bold look for more bang for your buck. To say the tables are bright blue, pink and, green. Plus the statement piece mentioned above in your back yard. Takes half the decoration out and leaves more cash.

, The dollar store will have most what you need of décor and food. Yes the quality may be lower, but you only need it for a day. It's also easy to budget, bet you anything everything will be under $5.

, Yes. Hang them from your ceiling in a swooping motion. Or even hang lanterns from different heights. Some above the head of the guests and a few stragglers meeting there faces. It doesn't even have to be lights. How about the head of fake flowers(which are cheaper), hung by fishing line to give your room a magical feeling.

, While yes most of you will have house parties keep in mind free and outdoor places that are scenic, It saves a lot in the end. Does your neighbor have an awesome garden for a tea party. Are there picnic tables at the lake so you can have a sweet 16. but if you do do it in your house choose a room or place where it's more open. Think, if you were to hold it in your bedroom it feel like a coffin. Most important to a house or indoor party, do not make your space big! Yes if your space is to big that means more décor, thus more money.Use some logic and give your  location a room to décor ratio.

, You might want to try some 5$ pizza places. Try having bulk of one dish like meat or soup.Any one specialty entrée you can make in a good bulk. Then have little things in bulk. Colored marshmallows in a bowl. Things like crackers, and candy. The classic chips and dip(sour cream with dressing).  Or swipe things from your kitchen. Cut and rolled up ham with a small piece of cheese with a toothpick, PB&J  minis(use Ritz crackers or cut the bread small), get creative with what you have.

, Just not too many.

,: You know a party, all it really is, is a group of people that you're close to you celebrating an event. If planning and such annoys you. that's cool. Throw some tunes. Use the $100 in a lighting system and dance the night away.  As long as you and your guests are having fun your party is perfect.

You should consider who is going to be coming, such as family and friends, and how many people you are inviting. If it is a birthday party, children will more than likely be present. If you are having a house party, more than likely you will mainly have friends.


Make sure you know what type of party you are having well in advance, with probably 2 weeks notice.
There are plenty of other parties. However, the main parties are birthday and house.;
, If it is a house party, reserve a dance hall. If is a birthday party, you can have it at home. You can have a house party at home, but you will need to find a bunch of equipment and a DJ.


Do not spend too much money on your party. If you are having a birthday party, it should not cost too much.

, You will need this for any party, and especially for a birthday party. You will need to have a maximum number of guests. If you are having friends over for a birthday party, only invite the closest friends.


You can easily have a party with a few people. There is no minimum.

, If there is a certain theme, you will need to note the proper attire in your invitation. If you are having a house party, it is recommended that your guests have a more informal dress. If the party is for a birthday, more formal attire would probably work best.


Not everyone might show up in the right theme, depending on the theme. Try to keep the theme relevant to the type of party.

, In the beginning of the party, you should have something entertaining, such as certain dancing. Then you should have certain games like pool (if you have a pool table). You can even invite them to your hot tub or pool (if you have a pool).


Just make sure the party will not be boring.

, Make sure your house or dance floor is clean before you have the party. Guests will more than likely stay for the entire party if the place is clean. The cleaner your party atmosphere is, the more your guests will be attracted to the party. It is wise to have a maid just in case you need help for larger house parties.

, Depending on where you throw your party and what type of party you are throwing, you might or might not need a DJ. If you can play your own music, this will save you the hassle of finding a DJ. You can play music videos from your smartphone with a projector, which is a really cool idea.You can even invest in wearing a sound system on your back, which will play the music!You do not necessarily have to play newer music.

Mention the party to your friends.,
Piggyback on the invitations of friends.,
Show your appreciation when tagging along.,
Accept being turned down graciously.,
Ask to go through a friend.",How to Get Invited to a Party1," You might casually bring it up while chatting about your plans for the weekend, or you might ask directly. You should target friends that you think have already been invited, because if you bring up the party to another friend who's uninvited, you might end up making that person feel left out.


If you get into a situation where you and a few friends weren't uninvited to a party, you could throw a party of your own.;
, In most cases it is generally accepted for invited guests to bring a ""plus one"" to a big to-do. If your friend tells you that he has received an invitation, you can say try to get invited by saying things like: ""That's fantastic! I wish I could be there, too.""
""You know, I don't have any plans that night. You think it'd be alright if I tagged along?""
""Dude, it's been forever since we've gotten rowdy! We should go together!""

, If your friend agrees to bring you with him, you should show your thanks in some small way, like by offering to drive to the shindig. Be sure to get the particulars from your friend since he has the invitation, and try to be accommodating to his wishes., If your friend says he's made arrangements to go to the party with someone else, be courteous and pleasant. After all, your friend probably didn't know you weren't invited or that you needed a piggyback-invite. Then check with other friends you think may have been invited to see if you can tag along with them.


Even if turned down, you may be able to ask your friend if he has any leads for a mutual friend who is going that you can tag along with.

, This is an especially useful tactic if a good friend of yours has been invited while you have not. This way, you can save yourself and the host some embarrassment by asking indirectly through your friend. You might coach your friend to say to the host:


""Hey Emily, I was talking with my friend John the other day, and he doesn't have anything going on this weekend during the party. I didn't say anything about it in case it wasn't cool with you, but would you mind if I invited him along?""
""Emily! I have a favor to ask. I wanna come to your party so bad, it sounds mad awesome, but I promised my buddy Kris I'd chill with him. You know him? He's real cool - mind if he comes along?""

Identify a unique service you can provide.,
Offer to help out the host.,
Prepare yourself to help.,
Show initiative.,
Take the hint if rejected, but be politely persistent.",How to Get Invited to a Party2," A small effort on your part can go a long way toward charming the host into forgetting that you weren't invited. A unique skill, like decorating talent or a knowledge of specialty drinks, can enhance the theme of the party . You might:


Make specialty decorations.
Mix up a batch of your favorite party drink.
Offer your services as a DJ., Many people feel awkward about approaching the party host or one of its organizers to offer help, but this can get you on their good side and earn you an invite. It may be easier for you to ask someone you already know. Start with specific suggestions, but also offer to help in any way you can. You might suggest:Helping with decorations, for larger parties.
Assisting refreshing party necessaries, like ice.
Organizing or setting up sound equipment., If the host or one of the party organizers accepts your offers of help, you might be put to work double-time. Follow instructions and use your judgement to try and take as much pressure of the host/organizers as you possibly can. And don't forget to relax about your invite - now that you're involved with party preparation, you are most likely invited!, You could hurt your chances of getting invited to a party next time around if you sit around when you're supposed to be helping or only do the bare minimum. If you finish your job early, see about helping others in their tasks. Even something as simply as handing pieces of tape to someone putting up decorations can help the party set up go smoothly.

, It can hurt if the party host or organizer says everything is taken care of without offering an invite, but there are other considerations the host may be taking into account. It's even possible that the host is trying to protect you from having a bad time, especially if, for instance, someone you seriously dislike will be attending.


If you have a great idea that would add to the party, you might suggest this to the host, but you should be aware that this refusal might be a gentle way of saying you aren't invited.
As an example, you might volunteer to take photos of the party to commemorate the event. If the party host or organizer likes your idea, you are in!"
"
Anticipate the needs of the party.,
Add to party supplies or bring a gift for the host.,
Mention your potential contribution to the host.,
Accept the invite, or politely accept being turned down.",How to Get Invited to a Party3," The kind of party being thrown will dictate the things that need to be available for the party to be a success! A dance party isn't much of a dance party without music, a wine tasting party could benefit from an intriguing vintage, and almost every large party needs ice at some point.


By anticipating needs, you can prove to the host that you'd be a welcome addition to the party crew., There are cost effective ways of doing this, like making a dish to pass, or bringing suitable beverages. Think carefully about what you can bring to make the party even better, or bring a specific gift for the host that takes her tastes into consideration. For example, you might:


Bring seasonal gifts, like a plastic pumpkin of Halloween candy, eggnog, winter themed treats, or cold drinks in the summer.
Give a mixology set as a present for when the party gets started, but only if age appropriate.
A dish to pass or snacks to contribute., Now that you've figured out a worthwhile contribution, bring it up to the party host or organizers. For instance, if you have a delicious recipe for chocolate chip cookies, you can simply say something like:""Emily, I heard about your party. Sound super fun! If you need any dessert, I make killer chocolate chip cookies - my grandmother's recipe. Everybody love them!""
""So what are your plans for the weekend? Oh, a party? Well, if you need dessert, I have the best recipe for homemade chocolate chip cookies."", If your offer matches the needs of the party or the tastes of the host, you'll almost certainly be invited! This scenario has the added benefit of not only getting you legitimately invited to the party, but you'll also be appreciated for your contribution to it!


There's always a possibility, whether due to your associations or the hosts perceptions, that you might be denied. Getting angry in this situation rarely does anything positive for your reputation. Be polite and have fun on your own.

Then, cut the pumpkin into quarters. Scrape out the seeds with a spoon and transfer them to a colander.If you're going to be carving the pumpkin for Halloween, you have to cut the pumpkin a different way. Two to three inches out from the stem, insert a knife into the top of the pumpkin on a 45-degree angle aimed inward toward the center. Cut a hole around the stem on this angle. Pull out the top, reach your hand in, and scrape out the insides with a flat spoon. Transfer the seeds to a colander.;
, Place the colander of seeds under running water. As the water rinses the seeds, use your fingers to pick through and loosen and remove the bits of orange flesh.


When you’ve removed all the stringy bits and flesh, turn off the water and shake the seeds in the colander to remove the excess., Pour the salt and water into a small saucepan. Add the pumpkin seeds, and bring the brine to a boil over medium heat. When the water boils, let it simmer for another 10 minutes.When the simmering time is up, remove the pan from the heat. Drain the seeds in a strainer, shaking the strainer a few times to remove as much water as possible
If you didn’t get a full 1½ cups of seeds from your pumpkin, use 2 cups (474 ml) of water and 1 tablespoon (19 g) of salt per ½ cup (65 g) of seeds.

, Transfer the seeds to a bowl. Drizzle the seeds with oil and toss or stir to coat the seeds in the oil. You can also season the seeds with your favorite spices. Use about 1 to 2 teaspoons of seasoning, or to taste. Popular spices for pumpkin seeds include:Salt and pepper
Cayenne pepper
Garlic powder
Onion powder
Cajun powder
Paprika
Brown sugar and chipotle powder
Curry
Herbs, such as rosemary and thyme

, Transfer the seeds to a baking sheet and spread them out in a single layer. Bake the seeds in a 400ºF (204ºC) oven for 10 to 20 minutes, until they're golden brown.Stir the seeds every five minutes to prevent burning and ensure even cooking.

Transfer the seeds to a colander and rinse them under running water. Pick through with your fingers to remove the stringy bits and orange flesh. Toss the seeds to remove excess water., The easiest way to toast pumpkin seeds is to cook them in a frying pan.

Coat the sugared almonds in melted chocolate.,
Let set in the fridge.",How to Make Chocolate Covered Almonds," You can dip raw almonds in chocolate just as well, but toasting them creates extra flavor and a crisper texture. Preheat your oven to 325ºF (160ºC). Toast your almonds on a lined baking sheet for 6–8 minutes, or until they turn golden brown and release a strong aroma.Let them cool while you move on to the next step.;
, This will hold your chocolate-covered almonds later, while they harden in the fridge.


For a perfect presentation, place a fine mesh cooling rack on top of the sheet.This will leave a more even coating of chocolate, without the impression where the almond rests on the sheet.

, Chop 6 oz (170g) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate into small, roughly equal pieces (~¼ in / 6mm) and add to a double boiler.Heat over low heat, stirring slowly with a rubber spatula, until the chocolate is fully melted. Keep it away from moisture and high heat, which can cause chocolate to seize and turn grainy.You can use other types of chocolate, but lighter chocolate burns more easily. Prevent this by taking the chocolate off the heat when there are only small lumps left, then stirring until it finishes melting.
If you want the chocolate to look glossy on the almonds, temper it instead or follow the ganache recipe in the ""Variations"" section below.

, Mix in a large bowl until the almonds are covered in melted chocolate.

, Scrape the almonds onto the baking sheet (or mesh cooling rack), then quickly separate them with a fork so they don't get stuck together.For a professional look, get finicky: lift the almonds out one or two at a time with a fork or dipping tool, tap gently against the bowl to remove excess chocolate, and place on the baking sheet., A generous sprinkle of sea salt is an excellent complement to dark chocolate. Large grains of raw sugar are another great addition, especially if the chocolate is very dark., Un-tempered chocolate will ""bloom"" if left to solidify at room temperature, forming a layer of white fat solids on the surface. To prevent this, let it set in the refrigerator until the chocolate is completely hard. Cover the tray with plastic wrap if there are any strong scents in your fridge.


Condensation may gather on the chocolate after you remove it from the refrigerator, causing a ""sweating"" appearance. You can reduce this effect by covering it, so most of the condensation gathers on the lid of the container instead.If you tempered your chocolate, you can let it set at room temperature.

, Some people prefer the cocoa powder look to the sometimes dull appearance of once-melted chocolate. This is particularly useful if your chocolate has ""bloomed"" — it's still good to eat, so dust it thoroughly and serve it without shame.

, Ganache is an emulsification of melted chocolate and heavy cream that hardens into a glossy, attractive coating. Ganache will also coat the almonds more evenly, adding to the visual presentation.

, Chop 4.2 oz (120g) bittersweet chocolate into even pieces less than ¼ inch (6 mm) across. Place it in a large, heatproof mixing bowl.


You may use milk chocolate or white chocolate instead, but the ganache will be too soft unless you increase the amount of chocolate. Try 5.25 oz (150g) of milk or semisweet chocolate, or 6.3 oz (180g) of white chocolate., Pour 3½ tbsp (50 mL) heavy cream into a pot and heat until it just begins to boil. This ratio of 1 part cream to 3 parts chocolate will create a thick ganache that sets into a hard shell.

, Let it cool undisturbed for about a minute.

, Beating too fast can make a grainy, ""broken"" ganache. Stir at a steady pace until the mixture is smooth. Do not pause, as you can only form smooth ganache in a limited temperature range.

, Toss 1.5 cups (360mL) almonds in ganache and transfer them to mesh cooling racks. The storage life depends on the type of chocolate and many other factors, but it's generally safe to leave ganache at room temperature for two days., Classic pastel Jordan almonds require a more specialized approach, but this rougher riff on the sweet only requires basic supplies:1.5 cups (360mL) toasted almonds

10 tbsp (150mL) granulated sugar
2 tbsp (30mL) water
½ tsp (2.5mL) salt
½ tsp (2.5mL) cinnamon

, The almonds are done when the coating starts to look dry and sandy, about 8–10 minutes., Let cool on a parchment-lined baking sheet in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.

, Melt 6 oz (180g) chocolate in a double boiler over low heat, stirring constantly. Once smooth, pour over the almonds and stir until well-coated.

, Place the almonds back on the baking sheet. Spread them out with a fork so they don't end up stuck together. Store in the fridge until ready to eat.

The idea is to use the bread to dip in the olive oil of choice, then dip in the dukkah for additional flavour. This has become a popular choice at wine tasting events where olive oil is also on offer for tasting.
Use to season. Dukkah makes an excellent seasoning for meats or fish fillets - apply to oiled meat prior to roasting, baking or frying or mix with flour for coating fish fillets.

, Slice the cooked potatoes into small, pea-sized chunks, or use a potato masher to mash them into small bits. If the potatoes pieces are too large they may rip through the pastry puff.

, Bring a small pot of water to a boil and place the peas in the pot. Let them boil for about one minute, until the peas are tender (test one to be sure). Drain the water and reserve the peas.


If you're using frozen peas, simply thaw them by letting them sit at room temperature for one hour. If you're in a hurry, submerge the bag of peas in cold water for ten or fifteen minutes to thaw them.

, Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan. When the oil is hot enough to shimmer and slide easily through the pan, add the chopped onion. Sauté the onion for about five minutes, until it begins to brown.

, Put the curry powder, turmeric powder, chili powder, black pepper and salt in the pan with the diced onion. Stir the spices and the onion until the mixture is thoroughly incorporated.

, Stir them together with the onions and spices. Cook the mixture for two minutes, stirring constantly.

, Remove the pan from heat and set the mixture aside while you make the pastry., Use your hands or a pastry cutter to incorporate the shortening into the flour mixture.

, Mix together until the ingredients are well combined. If needed, add a little more water to ensure a good, smooth consistency. If the pastry seems too moist, adjust with a little more flour.

, Place the dough on a floured work surface and form it into a ball. Use the heels of your hands to push down on the dough, then turn the dough and push it again. Continue until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.

, Place it in a mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside for a minimum of 30 minutes before rolling. Resting the dough will help the puffs become lighter and less dense, so don't skip this step., Remove the plastic and turn the dough back onto a floured work surface. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough until it's 1/4-inch thick.

, Use a biscuit cutter or the rim of a glass to cut circles about three inches in diameter from the dough. If you want larger puffs, cut larger circles; for miniature puffs, cut smaller circles.

, Spoon about one teaspoon of filling in the center of each circle. Brush the edges of the dough circle with a little water, then fold the circle in half over the filling. Use a fork to or your fingers to seal the edges together so the filling won't fall out.

, This will prevent them from drying out while you finish making the puffs and heating the oil. Keep them covered until you're ready to fry them.

, Pour frying oil into a large dutch oven or metal pot. If you have a high-sided frying pan, that will also work. Pour in enough oil to rise at least one inch up the sides of the pot or pan. Heat the oil until it reaches 365 °F (185 °C).


If you don't have a kitchen thermometer, you can tell the oil is ready by observing small bubbles forming strings from the bottom of the pan to the surface of the oil.
Or test the oil by placing a small piece of dough in the pot. If it starts to fry and turn brown right away, the oil is ready. If it doesn't fry, keep heating the oil.

, Place four or five puffs in the pot. Don't crowd the puffs by trying to fry too many at a time, since this will cause them to cook unevenly. You may have to fry them in several batches.

, They should be ready in thirty seconds to a minute, depending on how many you're frying at once.

, Use a slotted or sieve spoon to drain off the oil as you lift the puffs from the pot.

, Let the puffs sit for a moment or two so the excess oil drips off and gets absorbed.

, Curry puffs are usually served with a dipping sauce such as yogurt and mint, fresh mint chutney, peach chutney or tamarind chutney.

, Try to space out the slices so that they don't overlap. This allows them to cook evenly for the best results.

, Lightly add Cajun to the potato slices evenly.

, Just like a pancake, it's now time to turn over the slices so that both sides are cooked. Check that the first side is golden/brown and slightly crispy then turn them over.

, You may need to flip the slices a few more times to get the desired result.

, This allows any excess oil to drain off of the slices and can later be discarded.

, Letting the slices cool down can make them even more crunchy and can then be put in a box or bag as a little tasty snack!

Season and mash the avocados together.,
Fold in jalapenos, cilantro, and red onion and mash together.",How to Make Guacamole Like Chipotle1," Choose a ripe Hass avocado. A great way to tell if your avocado is ripe is by looking at the color under the stem. If the color is green, it is ripe and good to eat. If it's brown, then it's likely your avocado is overripe and will have brown spots on the fruit. If the stem does not come off, then your avocado is not ripe yet.Hass avocados are a common type of avocado in America and are distinct for their oval shape and dark green to purple color.;
, Remove the avocado pit from the surrounding pulp by using a spoon to scoop it out. Alternatively, you can cut your avocado halves into quarters to make the pit more accessible., Scoop the rest of the avocado from its skin and place it in a bowl. If you don't like how messy scooping the avocado is, you can make lateral cuts on the avocado and remove them in longer slices. Get as much as you can from the fruit and be sure to remove all of the skin., Add the lime juice to your avocado bowl and lightly toss the avocado with your fingers. Make sure to coat the entirety of the avocado with the lime juice so that your guacamole has a consistent flavor.

, Add your 1/4 tsp (1 g) kosher salt to the avocados and begin mashing them. You can use a fork or potato masher. Continue to mash the until the mixture is smooth in texture., Add in the rest of the ingredients and fold them in using your tool. Continue to do so until your guacamole reaches its desired consistency and serve.


Leaving guacamole out and exposed to the air can cause it to turn brown. Put it in an air sealed container and refrigerate it if you plan on saving it for later."

Add 1 1/2 tbsp (22.18 ml) lime juice, 1/3 cup (78.8 ml) sour cream, cilantro, and salt.,
Combine garlic, onions, chiles, and tomatoes and mix.",How to Make Guacamole Like Chipotle2," Mince your cloves of garlic, green onions, cilantro, and chiles and set them aside for later. The smaller that you mince your ingredients, the more consistent your guacamole will taste.


Remember to wash your hands after handling chiles.

, Cut your avocado in half and remove the pit. You can either use a spoon or a more advanced technique using a cooking knife. To do this, gently tap the pit of your avocado with enough force that it sticks into it. From there, you can twist your knife and discard the pit. Use a kitchen rag or towel to protect the hand that's holding the avocado.Hass avocados are resilient and can grow throughout most of the year.If you save your pit, you can use it to grow an avocado tree.

, Add the soft ingredients to your avocado bowl first, and fold them into it until you reach a smooth consistency. Your guacamole should look light green at this point., Add the minced ingredients to your guacamole and mix it thoroughly. Once it's reached the desired texture, serve it immediately with a side of tortilla chips. You can find chipotle chiles in adobe sauce down the Mexican aisle of most grocery stores or online.

Pulse the mixture until it has a thick, rustic texture, which should take approximately 5 seconds.You can add more of the green chile, ginger, lemon juice, and sea salt if you prefer. Taste the mixture and decide if you want to add more seasoning.;
, The mixture may be too thick after you first mix it to work well as a dip. If you want a thinner consistency, mix in more water using the food processor. It’s best to add just a tablespoon (15 ml) or so at a time so you don’t thin it too much.If you want to turn the dip into a salad dressing, continue adding water until it has a thin enough consistency to pour over your favorite salad.

, Once the dip reaches your desired consistency, add 2 tablespoons (6 g) of finely chopped cilantro and use a spoon to carefully mix in it in. Next, spoon the dip into a bowl and serve.The dip pairs well with vegetables sticks, crackers, or chips. You can also use it as a sandwich spread.

Customize your Cheetos.",How to Make Cheetos," Pour the oil into a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Turn the heat to medium to preheat the oil. Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and insert the bulb into the oil. The oil should be 350 F (177 C) before you fry the dough to make the Cheetos., Pour the cheese powder into a sealable plastic bag. When the Cheetos have been fried and cool, you'll toss them around in the cheese to coat them., In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, corn meal, and salt. Whisk the dry ingredients together to combine everything and remove any lumps that may be in the flour or corn meal.

For this recipe, you can use regular corn meal, fine grind corn meal, or corn flour.Corn meal will produce a slightly grittier texture, whereas corn flour will produce smoother Cheetos.

, Fill a kettle to the minimum fill line. Bring the water to a boil and let it cool for a few minutes. Pour ½ cup (118 ml) of the very hot water into a measuring cup. Pour the hot water into the dry ingredients slowly, whisking the mixture as you pour.Continue whisking until all the water has been incorporated and you have a smooth dough.

, Fit a piping bag with a large, plain round tip. Spoon the dough mixture into the piping bag. When the bag is full or when all the dough has been added, twist the top of the bag to keep the dough inside.

Use a clean freezer bag if you don’t have a piping bag. Cut a half-inch (1.3-cm) hole in the bottom corner of the bag, and press the dough toward the hole to pipe it out., When the oil is at temperature and the dough is ready to go, squeeze 2-inch-long (5-cm) logs of dough into the oil. When you squeeze out a length of dough, use scissors or sheers to cut it away from the piping bag.Repeat until you’ve filled the pan with as many logs as you can fit, but don’t crowd the Cheetos in the pan. You may have to fry them in multiple batches.

, You want the logs to be a golden color when they come out of the oil. If the Cheetos aren't fully submerged in the oil, use a fork or chop sticks to flip them halfway through the cooking time.

For healthier Cheetos, bake them in a 350 F (177 C) oven for 15 to 18 minutes, turning once halfway through the cooking time., Scoop the cooked Cheetos out of the hot oil using a metal slotted spoon. Transfer them to a plate covered with several layers of paper towel. Let the Cheetos drain and cool for one to two minutes.Once the first batch is out of the pan, allow the oil to come back up to temperature before adding your next batch of dough.

, When the Cheetos have had time to cool and drain, transfer them to the bag filled with the cheese powder.Keep as much air in the bag as possible and seal the bag shut. Shake the bag to toss the Cheetos in the cheese powder and fully coat them.

Add more cheese to the bag if necessary, especially after each batch.

, Place a colander inside a larger mixing bowl. Pour the Cheetos and cheese powder into the colander. This way, the Cheetos will stay in the colander and the cheese powder will sift into the bowl below.

Transfer the Cheetos to a serving platter or airtight container for storage, and pour the cheese that collected in the bowl back into the freezer bag.

, Once all your Cheetos have been fried, cooled, and coated with cheese powder, you can sit back and enjoy your homemade Cheetos. Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to a few days., In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the butter, garlic powder, and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of the salt. Use the paddle attachment to beat the ingredients together at medium-low speed for about two minutes, until the mixture is light and fluffy.Combine the ingredients in a mixing bowl and use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to cream the butter if you don’t have a stand mixer.

, Add the flour, cornmeal, and shredded cheese to the creamed butter. Switch the mixer to low speed and continue beating the ingredients for another two minutes. Stop mixing when the mixture comes together as a firm dough.Ideal cheese for this recipe is a strong cheese like Monterey Jack or white cheddar.

, Turn the dough out onto a flat surface, like a countertop. Knead the dough into a ball, and then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Transfer the wrapped dough to a sealable plastic bag, press out all the air, and seal the bag. Move the dough to the refrigerator and chill it for at least an hour.Chilling the dough will give the flour time to rest, and make the dough easier to handle when you form the cheese curls.

, When the dough is 15 minutes away from being chilled, set the oven to 350 F (177 C) and let it preheat.While you wait, line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats., Remove the dough from the refrigerator, take it out of the bag, and unwrap it from the plastic. Tear off balls of dough that are 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter, and roll each one into a log that’s 2 inches (5 cm) long and half an inch (1.3 cm) thick.Shape the logs into crescents and transfer them to the prepared baking sheets.

The curls can be positioned close to each other, but make sure they're not touching.

, When the curls are ready and the oven is at temperature, transfer the baking sheets to the oven. Bake the curls for 12 to 15 minutes, until they're golden brown at the edges and no longer shiny., When the curls are baked, transfer them to a wire cooling rack to cool for about 30 minutes to an hour. You want them to be room temperature before you coat them with cheese., In a small mixing bowl, combine the cheese powder, buttermilk powder, cornstarch, and remaining ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt. Whisk the ingredients together to fully combine them and form a smooth powder. Transfer the cheese powder to a sealable plastic bag.

You can also mix the powder in a food processor by pulsing the ingredients together for 15 seconds. , Drop half of the cooled cheese curls into the bag with the cheese powder. Seal the bag and shake it to fully coat the curls with the powder. Use a slotted spoon to remove the coated curls from the cheese powder.

Repeat with the other half of the curls until all the curls are coated.

, Once the curls are coated with the cheese powder, they're ready to be enjoyed. Serve immediately for best results, and store leftovers in an airtight container for up to a week., People who adhere to a vegan diet don’t eat dairy, but you can make homemade Cheetos vegan by substituting nutritional yeast for the cheese powder. These Cheetos are also suitable for people who are lactose intolerant. To make the vegan cheese powder, pulse together in a food processor:1 cup (125 g) of cashews
¾ cup (45 g) of nutritional yeast
¼ cup (23 g) of oat flour
¼ cup (31 g) of tapioca flour
1 tablespoon (5 g) of paprika
1 tablespoon (14 g) of sugar
2 teaspoons (4 g) of powdered mustard
2 teaspoons (12 g) of sea salt
2 teaspoons (6 g) of onion powder

, For people who have celiac disease, avoiding gluten is key to staying healthy. Making gluten-free Cheetos at home is possible, and all you have to do is change the type of flour you use. To make your snacks gluten-free, replace the wheat flour with equal parts:Superfine brown rice flour
Sorghum flour
Potato starch

, Cheetos come in a variety of flavors, and you can replicate those flavors and create your own by adding different spices to the cheese powder. Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of any herb or spice you want to make different versions. Here are some ideas of spices you can add:

Jalapeño powder to make cheddar jalapeño Cheetos
Chili powder to make chili cheese Cheetos
Tomato powder and oregano to make pizza Cheetos
Chipotle and ranch powders to make chipotle ranch Cheetos

, Ask each player to bring a plain colored t-shirt. You are responsible for bringing adhesive back-felt, rhinestone stickers, and adhesive felt stickers. Each guest should trace a circle onto adhesive backed-felt. Cut out the circle and peel off the paper backing. Attach the circle to the back of a t-shirt. Add three rhinestone stickers for the bowling ball's holes. Each guest can also put the initial of their first name on their shirt by using the adhesive felt letters.

, Choose an adjective that starts with the same letter as your first name. Then combine it your pets' name (if you have one). Use your new name throughout the party. You could even put your new name on the score board.

, The captain thinks up her own way to bowl. Then when the other bowlers take their turns, they have to bowl the way the captain did. Play until everyone has had their turn as captain.

Attach the paper circle to a large sew-through button with craft glue.Let dry.
Cut two 1-by2 inch strips of paper. Glue the strips to the back of the button.
Using a thin marker, write the award names on the paper circles.

Invite.,

Set rules:

Friends share a lot of things...but underwear isn't something that should be swapped.,

On the day of the party, make sure you have designated areas for tops, bottoms and dresses.",How to Host a Clothing Swap Party," You'll want to send invitations out a couple of weeks in advance to let your guests have plenty of time to think about what clothes they will donate to the party. It's best to invite ten people or fewer. Any more and you'll be playing referee on a living room floor scuffle over the blue sheath dress that everyone was eyeing. Make sure each invitee has at least one other person that is her/hes size so that everyone has a great selection to choose from. Finally, try to invite friends with similar fashion sense.
, So tell your friends to leave the lingerie at home.
All clothing brought to the party should be clean and in good condition.
Each guest should bring a minimum of 5 articles of clothing so there is plenty to choose from.
Implement a numbering system or something similar to determine who gets to choose an item first. If you believe your guests can get along with no structure, at least think about what to do if two people want the same item. Rock-paper-scissors works well. If you want to add some spice to the party, have the two guests strut their stuff in the item of clothing and hold a vote. The girl/boy with the most votes gets the prize. Just make sure everyone knows it's all in good fun.

, If you don't have a wardrobe rack, get creative with the space and furniture you do have. Get the food and drinks out and crank up the music. It is a party, so have fun!"

Teach your guests popular disco dances.",How to Host a Disco Party," The most important element of your disco party is the disco ball! You can purchase or rent a disco ball at a party store to hang on your ceiling to set the mood for your party. Hang posters of bands and popular idols from the 70’s (The Bee Gees, Farrah Fawcett, The Brady Bunch) on the walls. Get a black light and hang black light posters up as well. Finish off the decorations with lava lamps, strobe lights, beaded curtains, and bean bag chairs. , Popular food from the decade was deviled eggs, hamburgers, casseroles, fondu, and nachos. Jiffy Pop Popcorn, Tang, Twinkies, and Hamburger Helper were popular brands during that time that you can still purchase today. , Although you can play music you like from today, make sure to include at least some songs that were hits in the disco era. Popular musicians were Donna Summer, Kool and the Gang, Village People, and KC and the Sunshine Band. You can make a playlist yourself, use a pre-made one on Spotify or Apple Music, or purchase a CD of 70’s party music hits. , Dress up for the party and tell your guests that they have to dress up too. Wear a jumpsuit, a leisure suit, bell bottoms, a flared sleeve top, a band t-shirt, metallic pants, or a mini skirt or dress. Get platform shoes or even roller skates. Finish off the look with plenty of peace signs, bright colored accessories, and large, round sunglasses. , Not wearing makeup with your costume is actually a very authentic way to look like you are from the 1970’s because many women during this decade stopped wearing makeup. This was not always the case though, especially for discos. If you want to wear makeup, wear bright and metallic eyeshadows and black, blue, or white eyeliner. , Long, straight hair that is parted down the middle was popular in the 1970’s. You can also blow dry and curl your bangs and the ends of your hair up to create “wings” in your hair. Get an Afro wig for an authentic disco hair style that works well for all genders. , You can try to copy the look of your favorite 1970’s musician, actor, or celebrity. Donna Summer, Sonny and Cher, Joan Jett, Barbra Streisand, Olivia Newton John, Carrie Fisher, Burt Reynolds, and John Travolta are examples of stars you could dress up as. , Have a few friendly competitions for your guests to partake in at your party. To encourage your guests to get into the theme, have a costume contest. Tell your guests beforehand that you are going to have a 1970’s disco themed costume contest at the party so they can plan ahead and dress up. Other 1970’s themed contest ideas are a Rubik’s Cube solving competition, a karaoke contest, and a dance contest. , People aren’t going to want to dance the entire time and will want to play games. “Name That 70’s Song” is a game where you play a song and the guests have to guess what the name is and who the artist is of the song. Have a pet rock table, a popular fad in the 1970’s. Lay out rocks on a table and let the guests choose and decorate their own pet rocks. Play board games like 70’s trivia games and Twister. , This is a fun way to get everyone to dance and to keep your party true to the theme. Popular dances in the 1970’s were The Hustle, The Bump Dance, The YMCA, The Funky Chicken Dance, and The Bus Stop.


The Hustle was a very popular disco dance that involved stepping, tapping, and snapping. It was a mixture of Swing and Latin done to disco songs.
The Bump Dance is where partners stepped or swayed to the music then bumped hips every other beat.
The YMCA is an easy dance done to the song “YMCA” by Village People. Put your arms in the shape of a Y, an M, a C, and an A to the music. "

Send off your guest prepared and with great wishes and memories.",How to Hold a Farewell Party," The best farewell parties revolve around a specific theme that honors your guest. Themes typically highlight the next part of this person’s journey and commemorate your time together. If your friend is moving away think about what kind of themes would work. You might want to host a ""bon voyage"" party that utilizes themes of travel and exploration. Maybe your party highlights some of the best local things your friend loves. In addition, you can introduce some culture and cuisines that are local to the next place your friend is going.
Maybe the guest of honor is leaving work and moving to a new company. You might want to throw a party that highlights all the great work this person did at your office.
Incorporate your theme into the invitations, food, decorations, etc. For example, if your friend is moving to another state or country, you could make cupcakes with that place's colors. You can even make toppers that have a map of the new location on one side and the place your friend is moving from on the other. ;
, Choose an appropriate place to hold the party. It could be at an office, a restaurant, or even at your own home. The location should be a combination of someplace easy to throw a party and a place your guest will enjoy.


For a family member going overseas for a while, home is a good choice. For a co-worker who is retiring or changing jobs, the office or a favorite local restaurant is suitable.
Think about what the guest of honor would like. Remember that you’re holding the party for your friend. It should be somewhere this person will cherish. For example, if your friend is moving away you could hold a party at the bar or restaurant you all frequent. See if you can rent it out for a few hours.
The location should be somewhere special and somewhat intimate. You want to be able to have a good time without other people distracting you or being distracted by you.

, Invite people well in advance so that most people will be free to attend. When sending out invitations, think about who the guest of honor would want at the party. Invite close friends and family first. Think about your budget and keep the guest list intimate or smaller if you have a smaller budget, or if you know your guest of honor wouldn't want a large party. Unless it's a surprise party, don't forget to invite your guest of honor. You could even send a personalized special invitation. Sending out physical invitations is a great way to get people to attend the farewell party. Decorate the invitations in a way so that these are part of the theme.
If your friend is moving, you could make invitations that look like a plane ticket. Print where the person is leaving from and going. Add information on the ticket that details the time and location of the party. Ask guests to RSVP by a date a two or three weeks before the party so you can plan for food accordingly.
You can also create an event on Facebook. Social media is a great way to invite people and discuss the details of the party. Create a social media event along with physical invites.
People won’t always track the invite if it’s solely from social media. Plus, the physical invitation is a great party favor and can be used as part of a farewell gift or memory board. However, if you don't want to do physical invitations you can design a colorful e-vite as well.

, You should get the guest of honor something to remember this time by. A sentimental gift is a great way to send your friend or co-worker off with lasting happy memories. Ask the people who are attending to contribute in some way.


If you feel uncomfortable asking people for money that’s ok. You can let the guests know that you are planning on getting or making something for the guest of honor. Explain that you'd be grateful for any contributions.
Offer alternative ways for people to pitch in. If you don’t want to just ask for money, consider asking people to help get decorations, setup, make or bring food, etc. Any type of contribution helps.

, It will be hard for you to throw a fantastic farewell party on your own. But chances are you won’t have to. There should be plenty of people in your group who are more than willing to pitch in.


Assign certain roles to people so that it’s easier to get everything done on time. You could assign one of your friends the task of getting decorations. Put someone in charge of the food. Maybe you have a crafty friend who wants to help you make that perfect memory book or gift.
Dividing up roles will ensure that your party is the best it can be. And when it’s time to have the actual party you can focus on the guest of honor.

, Decorate the party area to match your theme. You can have decorations that blend the past and the future together. For example:


Have little ships or planes for someone traveling overseas. Use colors that match the country your friend is leaving and the country your friend is going to. Maybe you divide the party area in half. You decorate half the area with colors and elements of your friend’s favorite things from this country. And the other half has colors and things that represent the culture of the new country.
Have little clocks, timesheets, or similar work items for someone retiring. Additionally, think about including elements that your co-worker or friend has expressed excitement about when retired. Maybe this person has expressed a desire to sit on the porch and read books. Why not decorate a corner of the room to look like a porch? Add a nice chair and a side table with some books. This area can also be the guest of honor’s special party throne.

Streamers are always good decorations. Get streamers in the person’s favorite colors, or ones symbolic of something to do with the farewell. You can even make streamers that have pictures of a map showing where your guest is leaving from and going to.
Think about including a special area where you can place a book or card for everyone to sign and write a note. You can also tailor this to your theme. If your friend is moving overseas, maybe you get a bottle and small roles of paper. Then people can write notes on the paper and place the notes into the bottle.

, Unless you're planning a sit-down meal, finger foods are just fine. Try to choose food that you know the person who is leaving likes a lot.


Small snacks, sandwiches, and desserts are great because these foods allow people to move around and mingle.
On the other hand, a nice sit-down meal may mean more to your guest of honor.
Use plates and silverware that match your theme.
Get your friend’s favorite local food and/or food that depicts the cuisine of the new place your friend is going. Or, if you are having a farewell party for a co-worker, consider ordering food from your co-worker’s favorite restaurant near the office.
Get your guest of honor’s favorite local beer and spirits if you are old enough to drink. Sometimes a cold beer from your friend’s favorite local brewery goes a long way. , Organize people who might wish to give speeches.


The speeches could talk about how great the guest of honor is. Center your speech around much this person means to you or how much this person has taught you. Ask those talking to keep it brief, to avoid dragging things out.
Speeches can highlight any number of topics from funny stories to heartfelt remembrances and best wishes.
Ensure that there is an opportunity for the person being honored to respond. But don’t make the guest of honor speak. As fun and happy as a farewell party can be, it can also be emotional and your friend may not wish to speak in front of everyone.

, It is usual at farewell parties to present a gift or gifts to the person leaving. Think about both the person who is leaving and in what capacity. Your friend may get more enjoyment out of a memory board or book than something you bought. Additionally, think about where this person is going. If your friend is moving overseas, get a gift that is small or will even help the move.
For retirement, there are traditional gifts from a company that an individual may receive. But you should also give the guest of honor something that commemorates the time and relationships at the company.
For someone traveling, find things that help a person travel. Maybe you know that your friend is going backpacking but doesn’t have a great backpack for travel. You could all pitch in and give your friend a great traveling backpack. If you want to go above and beyond, fill it with supplies like a water bottle, toiletries, and favorite snacks.
Think about why your guest of honor is leaving and where this person is going. Try to make or give a gift or gifts that will be useful to your friend. Don’t give your guest of honor something that will be hard to move or that your guest doesn’t need.
Maybe your friend is moving to another state. Instead of giving your friend more stuff to have to pack up and move, why not give this person moving boxes or even hire a moving company to help pack everything up. Or, perhaps you and your friends make a memory collage as well as practical items like a traveling backpack and supplies.
If your co-worker is moving on to a new company think about something work related that will remind this person of the great memories with you but that will be useful for the new job. Perhaps it’s a customized notebook or laptop case. Or maybe you give this person a trinket to sit on a desk.

, You can email or even print on canvas the best of these and send to the person leaving to remember the event and everyone who attended.


You can also make a collage of photos that depict your group of friends or co-workers sharing fun memories as an added gift.

, Hold some party games to play that your guest of honor loves or that center around your guest.


You can take a tailored spin on classic party games like Two Truths and a Lie. Guests go around and tell three quick anecdotes that involve the guest of honor. Two of the anecdotes are true while one is made up. The guest of honor doesn’t get to weigh in until the other guests get to guess. The guest who identified the most lies at the end wins. You can also hold a roast for the guest of honor. Just make sure that all the jokes aren’t actually offensive and that you end on a positive note. A roast can be fun but you have to be careful that you keep the context light.
You can play any type of game you want. For an added touch, tailor the game with the same theme as the party. For example, if your friend is moving overseas and you are of legal drinking age, you can play a tailored version of beer pong. One side represents your current country, the other the country your friend is going to.
Take out a map of your guest’s destination and have everyone pick a fun place to go or something to do at the new location.

, Give everyone the opportunity to contribute to some aspect of the party. Just because you may be the one in charge of throwing a party doesn’t mean that you should take all the credit.


Whether it’s a co-worker getting a new job or retiring, a friend who is moving, or someone close to you going off to active duty, there are a lot of people who care about this person. When you let everyone contribute something special you not only give the guest of honor the best farewell party but you let everyone say goodbye in a meaningful and unique way.

, When thinking about gifts and a great way to finally say goodbye, you want to give your guest of honor something happy to commemorate all your time together.


Before the party winds down let everyone have a moment with the guest of honor to say a personal goodbye. Farewell parties can be overwhelming and it’s not always easy to find time to get a one-on-one. Come up with an activity that most people can participate in while allowing the guest of honor some one-on-one time.
Finally, give your guest of honor any gifts and toast to your friend’s good fortune. Give a final farewell toast that expresses all your love and admiration for this person. Let your friend know that even though you won’t all be together every day, your friendship will always last.

, Try to invite people who know a lot about Harry Potter.

, Here are different ideas for making the invitations:


Idea number 1: Invite friends to Hogwarts with an official looking invitation in a large, handmade envelope with red wax seal. Write your invitation on white paper with green ink, stain with a cooled coffee or tea mixture (try staining your paper before you write on it, and dry it flat), and roll up when dry. Tie with red ribbon or seal with red wax. To make this look even fancier, get your parent to mark an H for Hogwarts.
Idea number 2: Print some Hogwarts house ties and use them as invitations - or cut them out and send them as they are in a big envelope, with instructions for your party guests to color them in in their favorite house's colors and wear them to the party!
Idea number 3: Put the Hogwarts crest/badge at the top of the page on the right-hand corner where the address goes on muggle letters. You can find this in images online if you type in ""Hogwarts badge"". Then type out your official invitation underneath.
Idea number 4: Send your friends a letter, inviting them to Hogwarts, for an end of O.W.L. party. Instead of your friend's name, write the name of their favorite Hogwarts character (such as ""Dear Luna""). Make sure you have an equal number of students from each House. Then, print of some pictures of owls and stick them on top.

, Besides the date, place and time, here are some other things you might like to add:


Dress up as your favorite Harry Potter character (Harry, Ginny, Ron etc).
Ask your guests to bring their own wands.
State that everyone gets 20 House points to start off with. Make sure all guests understand what House points actually are.

,, You may want to include your backyard or garden, too. Label the places differently.


For example, your backyard or garden is the Hogwarts grounds or the black lake. This grabs people's interest, and you can play Find the Sorcerer's Stone, or something similar.

, While you don't really need decorations to have a great Harry Potter party, if your party is themed on a particular part of Harry Potter, they can be useful for getting the mood right. Handmade posters, the ""paintings"" that hang up around Hogwarts and drapes in house colors are all possible ways to decorate for your Harry Potter party.


Stick stars on the ceiling if it's okay with your parents, so that your room looks like the Great Hall.

, These can be made as follows:


Stuff inside the party bag: At the end of the party, have a hunt to see if kids can find the following objects. Whatever object that is on the list that they find, they get to take home. It may be a good idea to do this in the backyard. Here is a list of things you may want to use:
2 chocolate gold coins
2 Harry Potter collector cards
2 Harry Potter badges
1 toy mini dragon

, Set up a music playing device and organize playlists. Play some different Hogwarts songs at the party to set the mood. Some good bands are Swish and Flick, Draco and the Malfoys and The Parselmouths.

, You can use anything referred to in the book series, as well as related food items that you think would have been appreciated in a Harry Potter context. Harry Potter party food is really easy to come up with. Just think of a food or drink you and your guests would like and come up with a creative Harry Potter name for it. Some suitable foods include:



Treacle tart. This has a Harry Potter feeling to it, as Hagrid serves it to Harry multiple times.

Roast potatoes. Baked, fried, and mashed are okay too - they have these at the start-of-term feast.

Pumpkin juice. You can use orange juice, or learn how to make pumpkin juice. This is a nice addition to any party.
Chocolate frogs. Use chocolate in the shape of frogs. You can buy frog molds at cooking stores and online, or buy ready-made chocolate frogs from candy or sweet shops.

Pudding. Luna Lovegood says that you cannot have a party without pudding. Well, your party wouldn't be a party without pudding, either!

Butterbeer. There are loads of recipes, so look it up! Most people suggest microwaving a tiny bit of butter and some butterscotch syrup for a minute and then adding cream soda.
Bertie Botts' every flavor beans. Jelly Belly beans come in almost every flavor and make a good substitute.

, Here are some additional ideas for things you can make at home fairly easily:


Strawberry acid pop drinks: All you need is strawberries and fizzy strawberry drink. Cut the strawberries up into little bits and tip into a glass, pour a reasonable amount of a fizzy strawberry drink into the glass and dilute. To make this into a dessert, simply add some strawberry ice cream.
Spark wands: This is easy; all they are is bread sticks. The bread sticks are the wands, and if you want your""'wands"" to shoot ""sparks"", then get ones with seeds on them.
Crumpet faces: If you like crumpets and pizzas, you and your guests will be excited to get to one of these delicious morsels.

Get two crumpets and cover with cheese, olive oil, tomatoes, and olives if you like them. Make into faces or throw on.
Heat in your oven for about 10 minutes.
Eat and enjoy!



, To get to it, you must run through a brick wall. To do this, place two curtains in your foyer with the words ""Platform 9 and 3/4"" pinned to it. Ask your guests to ""run"" through it. Next, have your living or family room look like a compartment. Get off the train to go to ""Hogwarts.""

, The Sorting is a celebrated feast at the beginning of a school year. The first years find what house they're in, and so can your guests!


Find or buy a witch's hat, and dirty it up a little, so that it looks old.
Place the ""Sorting Hat"" on a stool in the ""Great Hall.""
Ask a family member to call out names. For example: ""Weasley, Rose!""
Have someone in the background shout out the house, depending on what the person's characteristics are (decide this in advance). Are they bold and brave? Gryffindor would be their house. If they're sharp with smarts, Ravenclaw is theirs. How about if they have a green thumb and a kind heart? Try Hufflepuff. If they're clever and proud, choose Slytherin. Remember, Slytherin isn't that bad of a house to be in!

, If a guest does something really well, the party organizer (an adult) will award the relevant House 1, 5, 10, 20 or 50 house points. But beware! Each guest can lose House points, too! In each game mentioned below, there is a note of House points and how many a guest should get.


An adult should be placed in charge of the House points. If you have a mom and a dad, try having your mom dress up as Minerva McGonagall and your dad as Snape! (Be prepared - they may have a few objections about this!)

, The ""Great Feast"" comes right after the Sorting. So can yours, or you can delay it until later in the party. Any dish will work, though for specifics, see the ""Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook"" and the suggested foods above.


Have four tables, or only as many as you need for the Houses. Perhaps no Slytherin? No need to make a table then.
Have someone be headmaster and say a few words before serving. Perfect.
Add whatever you'd like to make the feast more fun.
Make sure everyone is informed that good behavior earns points, and naughty behavior loses them.
Give out schedules as well.

, Here are just a few ideas to inspire you:


Astronomy: Print and cut out a picture of each of the planets. Each student at Hogwarts has ten minutes to find all the planets hidden around the house. Award ten House points to everyone who finds the planets, and take ten away from anyone who doesn't find them.
Create your own spell: This game is bound to be a big hit. Before the party, find a Latin dictionary (online or a book) and compile a list of Latin nouns and verbs to give the ""students"", which they can combine into their own spells. Latin is the best language to use, because it is the one used in the Harry Potter books (e.g., the Lumos spell, which means light in Latin). Let them practice by having Wizard Duels with each other. Use glow sticks as wands, as they give off light.
Race to dinner: This little game is good fun. Create a course around your house to get to your dinner. Everyone can shoot a spell, although all spells are restricted except Stunning spells and Disarming spells. If you are hit by a Stunning Spell, then you have to stay still for 5 seconds. If you are hit by a Disarming spell, you're not allowed to shoot a spell at anyone for 5 seconds. You're not allowed to shoot a spell unless you have counted two seconds from the last spell you shot. This is a bit complicated, so practice before dinner, or this could end in chaos! You may also want to check with a parent, since they may think you've gone mad if you want to race around the house with your friends waving sticks at each other, and you could knock over some valuables.
Harry Potter board games: There are a lot of great Harry Potter games out there, so if you or any of your friends have any, make sure you include them in your party!
Harry Potter make-a-food: Give all the guests a selection of the basic foods. All they are doing is picking a Harry Potter food each, or making one together, getting the food they will need, cooking it and finally tasting. You can get suggestions of Harry Potter foods if you can buy/read the Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook. You get five House points if Snape thinks it is yummy. But will it come out as sour? Sweet? Tasty? Yucky?
Potions class: Get lots of fizzy drinks, sweets and berries. Split into pairs and take a ""cauldron"" (a large bowl or toy cauldron) for each pair. Now have fun mixing it all together. Make your dad/brother/uncle dress up as Snape and taste each pair's potion. His favorite potion is given ten House points, the second favorite gets five, and third is awarded three. (Specifics on potions are offered below.)
Crosswords: There are thousands of Harry Potter Crosswords on the net, but making your own is much more fun. If you find this too hard, just make a word search instead. Guests will then find a partner and they will swap crosswords and try to figure them out. The crosswords should be Harry Potter-related.

, It's actually really fun! But don't stay inside while you're doing this if it's a nice day, or your dad might think you're up to something.


Care Of Magical Creatures: Using ""Magical Creatures and Where to Find Them"", each draw up a bingo grid. Write down a magical creature in each slot. Now ask an adult to flick through and call out random names. First one to get every creature called wins. Instead of shouting bingo, shout ""Hagrid!"".

, Have your guest bring a broom, (or you will have the brooms)and play Quidditch outside. Remember, there are two beaters, one seeker, a keeper, and three chasers. On the web, you can find plenty of variations of Quidditch. Try Mugglenet's official college Quodpot.


Have a scavenger hunt. The Marauders' Map can be your guide!

, Everybody needs a quiet time after all the fun stuff, and this is perfect. Don't worry, it won't be boring - you'll be watching a Harry Potter Video/DVD. If you have multiple movies, do a vote.

,


For spells, start with Wingardium Leviosa. Use wands and balloons. Last one's balloon to drop wins 10 points for their House. First one loses 5 points. Next, transfigure buttons into bobby pins. Have the ""students"" close their eyes. Make up a spell for them to say and switch them. Hide the buttons. If they can transfigure them, 5 points.
Potions. No foolish wand-waving. So, wands away please. Make five types of potion: Felix Felicis, Babbling potion, Truth potion, Silence potion and Polyjuice potion.

For Felix: pour four drops of yellow food coloring in a cup with ice. Then, add Sprite. Tada! You're lucky.
For Babbling: pour four drops of blue food coloring in a cup with ice. Then, add Sprite. Now you can't stop talking!
For Truth, pour only Sprite. Have someone ask you a question, and you can't lie.
For Silence: pour four drops of red food coloring in a cup with ice. Add Sprite. Take a sip and zip!
For Polyjuice, follow the steps for Silence, but with green food coloring.



, If you have a pool, you can put obstacles and challenges in there. For the dragons, you could have them chase dogs with something on them that they have to get off, or for the maze, you could get some tall inflatable walls and put them in your backyard.


Do a calmed down version of the Tri-Wizard Tournament.

, Here are some things to consider:


Bedtime: Make a dormitory out of your bedroom. Deck in Gryffindor colors (red and gold), tidy up and put some beds/sleeping bags on the floor. You could divide up the sleeping room for the four houses. Also, have a picture that you need to have a password to.
Breakfast: Usually at a sleepover you will all have breakfast together. Think up something Harry Potter-ish for breakfast. Dress your breakfast place like Dumbledore's office and have some nice crumpets with butter while having an enjoyable talk with your dad (Dumbledore) about favorite Quidditch teams.

Plan your guest list with the most outgoing, fun people that you know.,
In the '80s, arcade games became the rave.,
The Music Scene was definitely unique as the use of keyboards came into play (New Wave or Synthpop) and MTV hit the scene.,
What to wear, what to wear, what to wear?,
Everybody needs to eat and you can't host a party without proper munchables!,
Smell is another sense you'll need to hit on - so let's think about what you might have smelled back in the '80s.,
Life is simply one game after another.",How to Host a 1980s Themed Party," Stuffy Stuffertons won't likely enjoy this style of a party! You'll need people that are not afraid to have fun. Once you get your guest list prepared, send a save the date via email. Yea, they didn't have email in the '80s, but this is the informal process involved with the party that will enable you to set the date. Once you verify that your main peeps are coming and you don't need to change the date, plan out the perfect invite. In the '80s - we either made a phone call or prepared a formal snail mail invitation. From this point on, you'll need to remain in 1980s character, so sending an Evite would not place your guests into the correct decade. Prepare a colorful (i.e. aqua, hot pink, bright green) invitation to mail to your guests to get the party train engine fired up! Give your guests an '80s slang dictionary with the invitation! This will help boost your verbal stimulation for your party guests and make them feel like they are smack dab in the middle of the '80s. Here's a helpful slang dictionary:

, If you lived in the '80s, you likely had a Nintendo Entertainment System as it had 90% of the American video game market by the end of the decade! Computers hit the scene in homes and as a complete industry as the IBC PC launched in Commodore 64 was another popular home item although it had minimal capabilities for home users. Think about this realm of technology when you are ready to start decorating. Having these items at the party will fulfill your visual senses as well as your kinesthetic (touch) sense - if you can get the real stuff. If you can go to some vintage stores to score some old video game systems (i.e. Atari) or computers from this era (i.e. Commodore 64), you will add authenticity to your event. It would be ideal if these systems actually worked so the guests could have a go at them. But no worries if you can't get your hands on them - if you can simply get some screen shots of this archaic technology, you can either put them as a slide show via a DVD and monitor or print them out and slap frames on them to scatter about the room.

, Think about your party playlist. You must stimulate the audio senses, and what better than some '80s new wave tunes! The following artists were popular in the 1980s, so jam up your playlist with their Billboard top 40's:


Madonna
Queen
Michael Jackson
Duran Duran
Prince
Queen
Guns N' Roses
Bon Jovi
Joan Jet

, Clothing was colorful to say the least. Sweatshirt dresses with matching bold-colored leggings, parachute pants, big plastic bangles, and Member's Only jackets were extremely popular! Be sure on your invitations, you encourage your guests to dress in the theme of things. Your guests can and should become part of the décor and enhance the visual portion of your party experience! An alternative is to go to vintage stores, grab some '80s fashion and have a dressing room designated for your guests to change into your hand-picked garb. It shouldn't cost too much to score some '80s rags, but if money is an issue, simply task your guests to dress up for the occasion.

, Taste is a sense, so you must stimulate it! In the '80s, the yuppies of this generation made sushi the cool food. Eating in a bread bowl was popular, as well as anything they could blast ranch flavoring on was the rave (i.e. Doritos). ""New Coke"" was a flop, but a popular flop of the '80s, so if you can print out some New Coke labels and adhere to some Coke cans, that'd be neat! Frozen yogurt was a new fad, and if you are serving cocktails, be sure to have some Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers handy.

, One thing comes to mind - Polo Cologne - the original in the green bottle. Anybody that lived in the '80s smelled that and would remember the scent. Believe me, a little goes a long way where that fragrance is concerned! However, don't spritz this next to the food - any scent other than a food odor will be unappetizing. Spray a few squirts next to the entrance to give a blast from the past when the guests enter the room. If these are a newer generation that didn't survive the '80s - they'll know what they missed!

, Party games are a must! Spend some time Google searching or creating your own party games and try your best to stay in the theme of your decade! Rap music was emerging at this time, so why not host a rap contest with some cheesy '80s rap beats and a microphone! Everybody loves to dance - well, maybe not everybody - but everybody enjoys watching dance contests! Pair up your guests and play a fun '80s tune for them to dance to and be the host-judge. You'll be surprised how much your guests will get into this! Relay matches are good - maybe with '80s fashion at each end for the team members to have to put on before running back to the starting line, as well.

, You will need to think about other events in your area that might conflict with the date you choose. Think about what would be the best time for your friends to attend your bracelet party.

, You'll want to decide on a number of guests before beginning this list. Inviting 4 to 8 friends would make a great party.

, You'll want to mail these at least 7 days in advance to give your friends plenty of time to mark the date on their calendars. Be sure to include the location and don't forget to emphasize this is a fun party, where they will get to make a bead bracelet of their very own.

, If you are ordering any of these items on line, be sure to allow time for the items to be shipped to your home.

, Be ready to demonstrate to your guests how to make a bead bracelet or print directions before the party for your guests to follow.

Buy tea.,

Prepare the tea.,
Dress the part.,
Welcome your guests.,
Serve your guests.",How to Have a Tea Party1," Traditionally, a tea party is held anytime in the afternoon. It is typically held around noon (11:30 AM to 12:30 PM), or afternoon (3:00 PM to 4:00 PM). Really, anytime is good for a tea party. A tea party is even okay late at night after dinner.


Consider your guest’s schedules when planning a tea party.
It may be difficult to have a party during the afternoon during the week when people are working. A weekend would be ideal if you plan to have it in the afternoon.;
, You can send handwritten invitations two weeks in advance. If you don’t want to send an invitation, simply call them on the phone, or send an email to your guests. Try to keep the guest list to around eight people. Tea parties are supposed to be cozy, so the tea party host can easily mingle with each of her special guests.


It is, of course, okay to invite more than eight people. Just make sure to have enough tea and snacks available.
You can ask your guests to bring items, like extra tea or desserts.

, You will need a teapot, cups, and saucers in order to serve tea to your guests. Buy a tea strainer and use a small dish to collect used tea leaves. You can also serve a pitcher of milk, lemon slices, honey and sugar. Make sure you have enough small plates, napkins, and utensils if you are serving food.


It will also be helpful and decorative to set out tablecloths. White linen or lace tablecloths are traditional, but you can also purchase disposable tablecloths if you want to make it easier to clean.

, There are many different kinds of tea that you can serve, but you don’t have to serve more than two or three varieties. Some varieties include: black tea, white tea, green tea, oolong tea and blended teas. You can ask your guests what they would prefer before they arrive or you can just buy whatever you think they might like.


You can serve iced tea if you’re having the tea party during a warm part of the year.
You can also buy drinks life coffee and lemonade for those that don’t like tea.

, Look up tea sandwiches, scone, and pastry recipes online or in your favorite recipe book. You can also choose to purchase the food instead of making it yourself. You will want to serve something light, like cucumber sandwiches, but you also want to serve something sweet, like cranberry scones or fruitcake. You can also serve things like teacakes and buns.Some common types of sandwiches served as tea parties are salmon club, crab, smoked salmon and avocado, and carrot and raisin.
A few classic scone flavors are lemon drizzle, walnut, and cherry.
Cookies and cakes are also nice to have out after sandwiches are served.
Put jams out to pair with the scones. Strawberry, rhubarb and ginger, and jumbleberry are some options for jam flavors.

, Cover a large table with a white linen tablecloth, or any other tablecloth of your choice. Place the tea at one end of the table and make sure to leave plenty of room for yourself. As the host, you will be serving the guests their tea. Place the lemon, milk, honey, and sugar next to the tea, and the trays for food at the other end of the table. It is normal at tea parties for the guests to serve the food themselves.


You should set out tea pots and tea cups for the tea.
Set out trays and cake stands for the food. You should also have plates and cutlery available to either be picked up next to the food, or placed at the tables.
Place napkins, doilies, and name signs out if you want people to sit in certain places.

, Begin boiling the water and setting out the food about ten minutes before guest are scheduled to arrive. When the kettle is whistling, pour the water into the teapot and take the teapot to the table. You can also choose to set out a hot water dispenser next to a tray of tea bags if you want the guests to make the tea themselves.


Set out coffee or any other drinks you anticipate your guests may want.
Take this time to look around the room one more time to make sure everything is ready.

, Wear nice clothing similar to what you would wear to church or to a casual wedding. Tea parties are casual affairs, but don't be afraid to get a bit dressier than you would for a normal gathering with friends. Dress up in elaborate hats and gloves if you are having a “traditional British” themed party.


You can suggest a dress code in your invitations if you wish for your guests to dress a certain way.

, Individually greet each of your guests. Greet them politely with a handshake, or with a hug or kisses if you know them well. Take whatever they may have brought and place it on the table for them. Then, show them to their seat if you have set places, or show them where they can choose to sit if you have not.You may not be available to greet each person as they walk in. If you can’t, greet them as soon as you’re available.

, Once all or most of you guests have arrived, begin to serve the tea. Individually fill the first tea cups and pass them out or serve them to each person. After that, you can leave them the option of refilling for themselves. You can also choose to have the guests serve everything for themselves if you want to have a more casual party.


Make sure anything they would need with the tea, like honey, sugar, and milk is out on the table.

Get permission.,
Choose a date.,
Create a budget.,
Make the guest list.,
Decide on a venue.",How to Have a Surprise Party for Your Mom1," Surprise parties aren’t for everyone and if you’re planning one for a parent, it’s a good idea to ask permission first. Since you don’t want to ruin the surprise for your mom, ask your dad. If that’s not an option, try asking a family member that your mom is close to, like an aunt or grandparent.It’s good to have someone else on board who can help plan the party and also weigh in on your mom’s likes and dislikes.
Some people don’t like surprise parties, so if the person you ask says no, brainstorm alternative ways to celebrate your mom.;
, The most important step in planning a surprise party is picking the date; this will inform the rest of your party planning decisions. Think about what the party is for – is it a surprise birthday party? A surprise Mother’s Day party? A surprise party to show your mom how much you appreciate her?If you’re celebrating a specific thing, like a birthday or Mother’s Day, try to pick a Saturday night near the date you’re celebrating.
Check your mom’s calendar to make sure she doesn’t have any plans that would conflict with the party.
If your mom doesn’t have a calendar, ask your dad or one of your mom’s friends to check to make sure the date is okay (make sure you let them know it’s a surprise!)

, In order to effectively throw this party, you need to know how much money you have available to you. Ask your dad, a relative, or one of your mom’s friends to help you plan the budget for the party.Make sure to factor in things like the venue, food, drinks, decorations, invitations and cake.
If you’re working with a small budget, figure out how many of these things you can do yourself to save money.
There may be small ways you can cut costs. Instead of sending out physical invitations, you could try inviting people online via email or social media. You could also consider throwing a potluck to cut down on the costs of catering.

, Decide how big you want the party to be. If you’re planning a big party, you might want to consider inviting the following people: your immediate family, extended family that live nearby, and people that your mom is close to, like co-workers, friends and neighbors.If you’re planning a more intimate party, maybe stick to just immediate family with a few close friends.
Ask your dad or one of your mom’s close friends to help you construct the guest list.
Make the guest list a month before the party is scheduled to happen.

, Once you know how big or small you want the party to be, it’s time to figure out where to hold it. If it’s a smaller party, consider having the party in your own home or in the home of a friend or family member.If it’s a larger party, you may need to rent out space, which will cost money.
Look for free spaces in your area. If you belong to a church or synagogue or community center, they may rent out rooms for free for members.
Make sure you choose a place where your mom is unlikely to go leading up to the party. If you end up selecting a place that your mom frequents, you will have to find ways to keep her away while setting up the party. This adds an extra layer of complication.

Decide on the date of your swap party and invite everyone that you think would have some cool clothes.,
Make up 3 ""value spots"" on a table or on the floor.,
Create tickets for each pile (about 20 for each).,
When your partygoers arrive, tell them to put each item they have in the value spot that they think suits it best.,
Once everyone has arrived, tell the party to put their tickets into a box.

,
Put some cool music on to keep a festive mood going.

,
Get the box of tickets and shake them all up.,
Each ticket you pick will say a name and have the colour of a value spot.,
When Emily has chosen her item she sits down and the cycle repeats.

,
If Emily chooses an item that somebody else really wants then they must object.",How to Hold a Fashion Swap Party," The best way of doing this is with emails. In the email, make sure that you tell your friends what it's all about. For example:Hi Fashion lovers! I have decided that I need some new clothes, but I don't want to spend any money, so I have decided to throw a FASHION SWAP PARTY! I came to this decision after looking through my closet and seeing all these great clothes that I'm a bit tired of but I know some of you might love. So if you want renew your closet then keep Saturday night free from 5:30pm onwards. Please bring as many clothes as you can. The more you bring the more you get. Please be sure that you wash and press all your items. Try to have them in a condition that you would like other people's clothes to be. Please RSVP. Emily.;
, Mark them as Cheap, Mid-price and Expensive.

, Make sure you leave a spot for people to put their names. A good thing to do is go to the newsagent and pick up 3 different coloured post-it notes, one colour for each pile.

, For each item they put down, give them a corresponding ticket and tell them to put their names on each.

,,, Reach in and pick out a ticket (you can ask random people to do this to make it more fun.)

, So, for example, if a ticket says EMILY and MID-PRICE, then Emily can go and pick something from the Mid-price pile.

,, If there is an objection then you can play a game to see who gets the item. There are heaps of games (see Tips). Whoever wins the game gets the item.

Choose a time.,
Plan a theme.,
Send out invitations.,
Buy supplies.,
Purchase the tea.,
Buy food.,
Decorate the room.,
Dress up in costumes.,
Put out the tea and food.",How to Have a Tea Party2," Keep in mind the age of the children when planning the time. You should also keep in mind the parents when planning the party, especially if the party is for very young children. Consider things like work for the parents and school for the children. Late morning or early afternoon on a Saturday could be a good time. If possible, ask the parents of the children you’re inviting what would be a good time for them.If the party is for very young children, consider common nap times.
Parties at night would probably not be the ideal time for children.

, A tea party for children is the most fun if a theme is involved. If the party is for mostly girls, you could choose a princess theme. An Alice in Wonderland theme is another cute and classic option. You could also choose a theme based on a country, which would be educational and fun. A British theme or Chinese are a couple of options. Research the decorations, costumes, food, and music based on the theme of your choosing.

, Send out invitations based on the theme. You can have invitations printed, or you can send them out via email. You should send the invitations out at least two weeks before the date of the party, though a month before is ideal. If you don’t want to send out custom-made invitations, you can simply email or call the parents of the children.You can find websites that have downloadable invitation templates. Some are free, but others cost money.

, Don’t worry about buying very costly supplies if you will be hosting a room full of children. Small, plastic tea cups and plates will work fine. Again, consider the theme when choosing the tea pot, cups, and plates. You can buy colored or design plates based on the theme. You will also need to buy plastic utensils, a tablecloth, serving trays, and napkins.You can buy tea sets made for children. Many of them, however, are expensive and easily breakable.
You can purchase supplies at party stores, like Party City. You can also purchase supplies online. Just make sure you purchase the items in enough time for them to be delivered by the date of the party.

, Children may not drink hot tea, so consider some other kid-friendly options. Sweet tea, apple juice, and other fruit juices are some alternative options. You can still serve the drinks in the tea pot, even if you aren’t serving hot tea.


Consider if parents will be staying when planning the food and tea. If some parents will be staying, buy hot tea, cold tea, and wine.

, Buy food the day before or a few days before the party, depending on the type of food you will be buying. Children may not eat the same things you would serve at an adult tea party, so choose some basic foods. For food, simple cheese, or turkey and cheese sandwiches, muffins, and assorted tea triangle sandwiches with simple ingredients work well. For dessert, sugar cookies, brownies, cupcakes, and fresh fruits with sugar lightly sprinkled on top are some options you can serve.If possible, ask the parents about potential allergies when planning the menu.

, Decorate the room based on theme. Put a tablecloth on the table. Set up the table with small favors, like small toys that the children can bring home. Put out balloons and hang up streamers. Make the room as colorful and cute as possible.For an Alice in Wonderland theme, you could set out the book and place figurines from the story out on the table.
For a Chinese theme, put out chopsticks for the food and hang up Chinese lanterns.

, You can ask the children to come in costume, or you can have some costumes set out for the children to dress up in at the party. Even if you do ask the children to come in costume, it is considerate to set out a few costumes for children that may have not gotten the memo. Make sure the parents are aware of the theme if you are asking them to bring their children in costume.

, You can choose to have everything set up before the party begins, or serve it after the children arrive. It is good to at least have some food set out on the table when the guests begin to arrive so that they can snack or drink while waiting for others to show up. Begin setting out the food and preparing the drinks about ten minutes before the children are set to arrive.Make sure to have plenty of napkins available in case of spillage.

Plan activities for your guests.,
Decorate the area.,
Choose a theme.,
Wear costumes.,
Play music.",How to Have a Tea Party3," Play tea party games like, Tea Leaf Pictionary. In this game, the players use their tea leaves to create picture of objects that are written down on small pieces of paper and drawn by each team. Another activity is to have your guests create their own tea bags. Place out tea leaves, tea bags, strings, and a stapler. Have the guest fill the bags with the leaves of their choice to create their own teaYou should place the leaves in shallow bowls and put of spoons for the tea leaves.

, Go to the florist the day of the party and buy flowers. A few bouquets should be enough, but you can buy more if it fits in your budget. Place the bouquets in vases around the area you are having the party in. Daisies and lilies are always nice choices for flowers. If you’re having the party outside, hang up some string lights. Paper lights in the shape of flowers or other fun shapes look especially nice. You can also light candles to add warm lighting and create a nice scent., Theme aren’t just for children. You can choose a theme for adult parties as well. Themes liven up the occasion and give adults a reason to dress up and bring out their inner child. Some themes to choose from are British, Chinese, Victorian, and Alice in Wonderland. You can also choose to make an event out of the party and have a mystery theme. Make sure to plan the food, music, tea, decorations, and dress around the theme.


For a mystery tea party, the host has a booklet that includes the instructions, script, name tags, and place cards. Each guest has a character and role to play according to the script. A mystery is acted out and solved by the guests.For an Alice in Wonderland theme, send out invitations telling guests to “not be late for a very important date with the white rabbit.” Decorate the area several mismatched tea pots and cups, clocks, paper lanterns, and quotes from the book. Play chess and lawn croquet. Ask guests to show up dressed as characters, like the Mad Hatter and Alice., Ask guests to wear costumes according to the theme you’ve chosen. Even if you don’t have a specific theme, you can ask guests to wear costumes anyway. They could dress up in flamboyant hats, like the British are known for wearing to formal events. An option for dressing up without a theme is asking guests to dress up in their formal attire. Make sure to specify costumes on the invitation.

, Plan music for the party. If you’ve chosen a theme, choose music according to that theme. For general music, choose low, soft music that can be played in the background. Classical music and smooth jazz are some options. If you want to take it a step further, you can hire music group to play. A small group playing classical or jazz music is ideal. If you have friends that play instruments, ask them if they would like to play.You can also find tea party playlists online.
Set out a CD player, record player, or connect your iPod or smartphone to speakers to play the music.

Send out invitations.,
Choose the menu.,
Plan the decorations.,
Choose some sentimental decorations as well.",How to Have a Surprise Party for Your Mom2," Once you have the date, guest list and venue confirmed, it’s time to send out invitations. Invitations can be sent out in a number of different ways: you can make or buy physical invitations, invite people online using e-mail or Facebook or call the people you’re inviting directly.Send out invitations roughly four weeks before the date of the party.
Make sure to ask people to RSVP by a certain date so you can get an accurate headcount.
Remind people that this is a surprise. You don’t want someone accidentally ruining the party.
Make a note on the invite for people to park away from the venue. You don’t want a bunch of cars ruining the surprise., The menu for the party will depend on the size of the guest list and the party’s venue. Some venues insist that you use their food and beverages, whereas others will allow you to cater or hire someone else to cater your event.If you are planning a party at home or at a venue that allows outside food, make a list of what you want to cook or order.
Consider having a potluck. This will take some of the pressure off you to cater the entire party. Plus, people like being able to contribute something to the event.
Plan the menu and order any catering you might need four weeks before the party.
Decide if you are going to order a cake or make one on your own. A homemade cake can be more sentimental, but it may take more time. If you're already busy planning a party, ordering a cake may make more sense.

, Party decorations are a chance for you to really get creative and have fun. Try to make the decorations personal to your mom and her interests – if she loves gardening, plan to incorporate a lot of flowers into your décor.If you want to keep the decorations simple, plan for balloons, streamers and possibly a banner of some kind.
If you’re holding the party outside, make sure to decorate with things that won’t get blown around.

, As the party is for your mother, see if you can think of sentimental decorations. Your mother may appreciate decorations that show her how much you appreciate her as a mother.Photos are a big plus for a party for your mother. Hang up photographs that showcase her role in the family. Go through old photo albums and find pictures from big vacations, milestones, and events in your family's history.
If you're tech-savvy, go through old movies and photographs you have on a computer. You can create a short movie to play in the background including photos and videos of your mother.
Find decorations that speak to your mom's interests. For example, if your mom is an avid horseback rider, consider having little horse figurines lining the tables and having horse-themed tablecloths.

Go shopping.,
Make sure your mom does not get suspicious.,
Figure out the logistics.,
Clean the house.,
Set up and decorate.,
Figure out how to reveal the party.,
Have fun and roll with the punches.",How to Have a Surprise Party for Your Mom3," One week before the party is slated to start, go shopping for everything you need. If you aren’t able to drive, ask your dad or one of your mom’s friends to help you with the shopping trip.Don’t forget to pick up things like cups, plates, napkins and utensils. You can hide these things somewhere in your room so your mom won't see.
If you’re buying lots of food, don’t store it in your family refrigerator.
Ask a friend or family member if you can store the perishable party supplies at their house so your mom won’t notice.

, In order to throw a good surprise party, you need to be good at deception. People are often able to tell when something is up, so your mom may start asking questions. In the event this happens, do not panic. Try to smooth over the situation.Play dumb. If your mom asks if something is going on, say something like, ""I don't know what you're talking about."" Keep playing dumb and your mom's suspicion may pass.
Try to distract your mom as you plan party events. If your mom has something else going on, she is less likely to notice you sneaking around. You can, for example, have your dad take your mom out to the movies when you need to start gathering decorations.

, Since this is a surprise party, you need a way to get your mom out of the house while you’re setting up and while guests are arriving. Ask one of your mom’s friends to invite her over on the day of the party.Make sure the person hanging out with your mom knows to bring her to the party at a certain time.
You could also try having your dad take your mom on a date. When they return, the party begins.

, If you’re holding the party at your home, you need the place to look nice. But cleaning the house for a surprise party can be tricky because you don’t want your mom to get suspicious.Make sure your mom is out of the house before you start cleaning.
Prioritize cleaning the bathrooms, living spaces and kitchen. These are the places where people are likely to congregate.

, While your mom is still out, hang all the decorations and set out the food, drink and cake. Make sure you have lots of ice in the freezer and avoid setting out any food that needs to be refrigerated until just before the party starts.If guests bring presents to the party, group them together on a table.
Put on some background music to keep the party from feeling still and silent. It's a good idea to make a playlist featuring your mom's favorite songs.

, There are a lot of ways to successfully execute a surprise party. The classic idea is to have the guest enter a dark room where everyone is hiding. Then, when the guest enters, the lights are turned on and everyone jumps out and yells ""Surprise!"" However, this has become somewhat cliche and it may give the party away prematurely. A dark room is suspicious.If you want a dramatic surprise, you can go with the classic. However, a low-key surprise can be just as fun for your guest. You can have the party in progress when your mom enters. She'll be surprised to come home and have friends and family members waiting for her.

, Sometimes surprise parties go awry – someone spoils the surprise accidentally or someone comes home too early. No matter how hard you plan, you can’t account for everything that might happen before or during the party.If the surprise gets spoiled accidentally, shake it off. Your mom will still be touched that you thought to throw her a party in the first place.
Be a good host. Even if you’re upset about the way the party is going, it’s your job to make sure everyone else is having a good time.

Consider showing the DVD of at least one of the movies.

, Instead of killing each other, give all players three minutes to hide around the house. Decide which areas form part of the game and which are off limits, such as your parent's bedroom.


The basement is probably the best bet, as there will be a lot of rushing around and bumping things.

, Wherever is included in the game, hide things like compasses, water bottles, bottles with a life in it (put a piece of paper saying ""You have got another life"" inside), snacks and other things, which can help players through the Hunger Games.

, Make sure your room is tidy and smells nice before friends arrive. Split it into different sections to have separate work stations. For example:


your desk - face area
table - manicure and pedicure area
beds - massage area

, Make some face masks out of certain foods like strawberries, oatmeal, avocados, cucumbers, or bananas. You can also buy some at your local drugstore. Then store them in the fridge until your guests arrive.

You want them to be comfortable and keep whatever stuff they have on their faces out of their glamorous locks.

, Pretty clothing should be protected with a larger shirt or apron.

, Wash your faces with cleanser or water and dry with a towel. Get a bought face mask or a homemade one (suggestions are in tips box) and put onto face avoiding near eyes, mouth, and ears.

, If it's sunny outside, go outside and dry your hair a little bit, and if there isn't, dry with a hair dryer, while watching the movie. Make sure to attach the diffuser!

, Brush for a full 3 minutes and then floss and use mouthwash. This will make you and your guests feel super clean!

, Don't rush! You have all the time in the world. Soak your hands and feet in water, then remove any old nail polish. Now go paint each others nails. You should tell the girls to bring all of their polishes before the party so you have a wide variety. Ten should be enough, but try to have as many as possible.

Have fun!",How to Have a Spooky Party," Doing them on the computer and you could put the face from the exorcist on the invitations and mention that it's going to be a scary party. Remember to include the time, date, place, R.S.V.P. number, who's sending and possibly some pictures. Have fun with them! Instead of just writing 9pm-12am, try 'til the witching hour. To avoid confusion, write the more common version underneath in a plain type or on the back. Consider signing them from Count Michael or Jennifer Long, W.I.T.C.H.. Try aging the paper and writing in a pen and ink for extra effect! Mention that it is a Halloween party, as they may wish to wear a costume. See How to Make Creative Invitations for ideas.;
, Perhaps have a room that is ""haunted"". Put in a faulty red/black light bulb, splash some red paint around, prop up some cracked, dusty mirrors; be creative! A fog machine might be a great idea. Flickering candlelight or lanterns can add great effect but only if you take proper care. Hanging fake cobwebs over the doorframe is a great idea. Why not put a sign over the front gate saying Welcome to the Haunted House? Determine if you want the room to be very realistic or just fun. If you're going for a properly scary effect avoid the plastic smiley pumpkins and Happy Halloween signs.

, Make edible glasses (instructions can be found on the internet) make red jelly with ""eyeballs"" (grapes or eyeball toys) in it or brown jelly with gummy worms in it. Have some kind of red drink (red wine, tomato juice, cranberry juice and raspberry cordial are all good) and perhaps label the bottle ""Not Real Blood?"". If you're having food use creative names for all the dishes. Who said French fries weren't fingers when they have a sliver of almond in one corner?

, If you are dressed in normal clothes during a Halloween party, it will spoil the effect. Make sure it is just right for Halloween though! Some ideas for costumes are: A black cat, a witch or a ghost. (Definitely not one which is a sheet with holes in though!)

, This could be a ghost-story telling session, a treasure hunt in the ""haunted"" room, Bloody Mary, Candy man etc., This is the most essential part of a party, and if either you or one of your guests is unhappy, the party atmosphere may go down."

If your babysitter needs instructions on how to face paint you can direct her to the wikiHow article on face painting titled “How to Face Paint a Child As a Butterfly”. This article covers the basic techniques and gives you information on the paint and supplies that you will need. Look at the pictures on this article for samples of face painting. These pretty princess pictures detail face painting that look s like jewelry hanging down from their heads.;
, Most everyone knows the story of Cinderella and how she lost her Glass Slipper. If you paint slippers on the children's feet they will not lose them but they will be easy to wash off. See the pictures on of the feet on this article.

, Most little girls also loved to have their hands painted with hearts, flowers or other designs.

, Have the little girls make finger sandwiches and cut them with cookie cutters to turn them into princess sandwiches. Have plenty of toppings such as jam, peanut butter, chicken salad, egg salad, tuna salad, etc. available to put on their finger sandwiches. If possible have a bakery make colored bread for you for the sandwiches. The colored bread adds a different unique touch to the sandwiches.

, To make fancy princess drinks cut oranges in half, remove the pulp and place in the freezer. You can put punch in the frozen orange shells and add cherries if you like. Provide straws for them to drink out of the orange halves.

, Look at the pictures of the two cakes on this site for ideas on a princess cake for your party.

, A good craft project is party masks. You can also do sand art for the girls to take home. Sand art can also be used to make rings, necklaces and bracelets. Fans are also a good craft project. Provide colored construction paper crayons for decorating and then the paper can be folded into fans.

, Did you know that King and Queens were once picked by the lines on their feet? You could have prizes for the best finger sandwich, the best costume, the best party mask, or the prettiest face painting. The idea is to have prizes for these games or what other games you decide on. Have plenty of prizes for the games. A good prize is small plastic bowls such as fishbowls filled with bubble bath crystals or small bars of bath soap. You can also wrap small candies in netting and tie it with a ribbon for a sweet prize. If you put medium-sized confetti in netting tied with a ribbon you can call it fairy dust.

, Hire a balloon artist that can do magic wands, balloon hats and other advanced balloons twisting items to provide a medieval touch to your party. This is the best place to spend your money for the party.

Start with some rules.,
Find a pool!,

Make unique and personal invitations.,
Choose the music carefully.,
Get cool party food.,
Get the drinks!,
Include fun decorations.,
Choose some games.",How to Have a Pool Party with a Theme," Although rules may be boring, they keep everything from getting out of control. Set party guidelines and talk them over with your parents. Include how many people are invited. 10-20 is a good number (very important - if one person invites 2 people, and another person invites 2 people, and it keeps going, you could end up with over 50 guests!). Younger children will need more adults to chaperone them. Most people don't have their guests invite more people, though, so you don't have to do that.;
, Ask around for pool-hire, and whether you can decorate it and have food and drinks at the pool. Jet-powered cleaning hoses are great fun. Or, you can go to a hotel with a pool(endless pools are better) There's nothing worse than a group in togs with nowhere to go!

, Some ideas for pool/ocean-y themes include:


Pirates
Mermaids
Ocean cruise
Tropical resort
Movie stars by the pool
Neptune's kingdom and the Little Mermaid
Spongebob Squarepants

, Reflect the theme in the invites. Make sure to include the date, times for start and finish, RSVP, and the theme (for costumes). Have your guests dress to the theme. A fun idea is black/white bathing suits with sunglasses, for a rich and famous celebrity theme. But don't go over the top - a massive mermaid tail can be difficult to maneuver, and if no-one dresses up, that's fine too - just have fun! You can either let your guests choose their costumes, or you can advise them in the invitation.

, Be sure your music is appropriate for the theme. Think ukulele for a Hawaiian luau, or perhaps dance or R&B music for a celebrity theme.

, Finger food is best, because you can keep snacking! Pizza, being the ultimate party food, is great, but order it early so it arrives in time. Hungry guests will not put you at the top of anyone's Christmas list. To make hot dogs, you don't have to have a huge grill, you just can have a small table top grill. If it's someone's birthday, you might want to have a cake as well. Be considerate if some of your friends are vegetarian/vegan, and make sure to provide at least a couple of things that they can eat.

, Nobody wants to be thirsty and bored., Try to choose items that fit in with the theme. You can use banners, balloons, or streamers; just don't let them get wet. Other elements suited to a theme might include:


Posters and pictures
DVDs (JAWS?)
Props (fake palm trees!)
Decorations from the movie/book/era/set...
Add some beach toys, sun umbrellas, and some buckets of cold water.

, Depending on the age of your guests,you could play games like Sharks and Minnows, Water Balloon Pop, Pinata, Kiss Chase (in the pool)and beach volleyball. Games for younger children include Marco Polo, Stuck in the mud, Tag etc. Again, try to match the games to the theme if possible, for example, a pirate theme could have a ""walk the plank"" game. Competitions like handstands and holding your breath are fun too!

Schedule a meeting with the church officials such as the pastor, youth leader, church secretary.,
Add the event to the church's calendar and notify everyone about it.",How to Organize a Church Bazaar1,"


Decide on what should be sold at the bazaar and who should help. Once these details have been figured out, then you can schedule the bazaar at any time you want. Usually, the best season is during summer and it should not conflict with anything else that is important to your church family.;
, If you can't find things in the church to sell, you can ask families to donate their items. Also, ask the Youth Group if they would donate their time to helping sort the items and mark them with prices tags.

"
"
Set a date, you need to start getting ready!,
Invite the church volunteers who will help at the bazaar.,
Start advertising: put an ad in the paper or post some signs around the neighborhood saying that there will be a sale at your church on this date at this time.",How to Organize a Church Bazaar2," Be sure that if you are going to be selling material things such as books and furniture that you put everything that will be sold into a separate part of the church where you know where it is and can find it the day before the sale.


If your church families are donating things, make sure you have someone(s) sort the items coming in. It is usually best to put the items to be sold in categories (i.e. Toys all together, books, clothing, etc.) If you are going to be selling edible things at the bazaar, be sure you know who is cooking what and that all of the food arrives well-packaged at least a couple days before the actual sale in order to be priced and categorized.
If you have children, and especially teens, helping you in this process, you have to keep them active and make sure that its fun! You can use competition to do this by saying, ""Let's see who can price the most items!"" or ""Who can put these books into alphabetical order first?""
Create games by having them race from one side of the room to the other with a price tag to be put on a certain item. Whoever prices their item in the correct spot and makes it back to the first side of the room first, wins!

, A couple days before the bazaar, have as many people as you can get come and help! This is a big job! You have to make sure that everything has been priced, categorized, and (if edible) packaged.


Have a couple people carry tables out and have them put all the books or clothing on that table and some more people put pies and such on another. Anything that can stand on its own, should. Anything that could be in a box on the ground, should!
Make sure that everything is sensibly placed and easily accessible. It should also be attractive to anyone walking or driving by on the day of the sale. Be sure that the prices are in an easy-to-see place. If you are willing to barter for items, make sure that you have a sign saying so. If a whole box of things is being sold for a dollar a piece, make a sign saying so
Be sure that everything is ready for the day of the bazaar. Check to see if it is supposed to rain. If so, make sure you have a tarp or something water-resistant that you can spread over the items so that they won't get wet.
Make sure that everyone has a job. If no one knows what they are supposed to do, then they will all flock to one job and nothing will get done. Be clear and specifically tell each person what they are to do.

Once they are done with that job, give them another job until everything has been completed. 



, Be sure that everything is clear and easy to read.

Get up bright and early in the morning and be at the church to make sure that everything is in its place and ready for the bazaar.,
Close up shop when the bazaar ends.,
Give the money to the church and then you're done.",How to Organize a Church Bazaar3," Have about four people come to help at the bazaar. Two to handle money and two to sell the refreshments if there will be any.


Make sure that they and you know the prices and conditions of every single piece. Someone may ask you a question and if you don't know the answer, they probably won't buy the item! Be honest if you don't know, but try to make sure that you do just in case.

, Once it gets time to end the day, be sure you count the money and have a list of everything that was sold and for how much. If you are paying the people who helped, be sure to give them a fair amount and don't over or underpay them.


If you have items left over, you can donate them to the local Salvation Army or Goodwill.

, Well, not until after you've cleaned up!

Estimate the number of people who will come to the convention.,
Plan it out in writing.,
Book the venue.,
Create a committee.,
Book your audiovisuals early.,
Remember that people get hungry; so they eat.,
Check with the venue owners about your responsibilities in regard to local council by-laws etc.,
Make sure you have insurance cover for the event.

,
Formulate a plan to cater for eventualities resulting from unexpected rain, hail or snow if you decide on a venue that may be compromised by inclement weather.

",How to Organise a Convention1," Remember that size matters. Depending on the nature of your convention, you may or may not be able to fully control the size of your convention. However, it will be essential to estimate some numbers, as you will need to book arrangements based on estimated attendance.;
, With so much to do and so many details to manage, it’s far too easy for important steps to fall through the cracks. Plan your work and work your plan. This will also help you keep track of delegating and maintain timely follow ups.


List the number of people required to assist the running of your event in regard to things like camera operators, lighting operators, sound controllers, ushers, security, ticket booth assistants, car park assistants, caterers etc. It is a good idea to seek out from your organisation any doctors or nurses who may be prepared to answer a medical call should the need arise.
Create a budget. This step will need to be completed rather early, in order to ascertain sponsorship needs and set a ticket price for attendees.

, This may be the single most important decision you make regarding the planning of your convention. Choose a location that suits your estimated group size, with clean, well-appointed facilities, and the ability to provide food service to your group in a fresh and timely manner. Consider whether or not your participants will want to come early or stay late, which may mean you’ll want to assess nearby attractions. 


Save the date.  Once the venue is booked, it’s never too early to encourage potential attendees to save the date – even if it’s a year in advance.

, Nobody said you had to plan the entire convention on your own, did they? Enlist help, create a committee, and surround yourself with helpful, hardworking, committed enthusiasts. Plus, it pays to run key ideas across a small focus group, to avoid any major oversights.


Make sure the overall coordinator has no other task for the event than coordination. The overall coordinator should chair all planning meetings prior to the event and work with the managerial assistants to bring the event together in the planning stage to ensure successful outcomes are attained.
Appoint a suitable person to act as Master of Ceremonies. In many ways this is the most important task of such an event; if the Master of Ceremonies fails the whole programme can be in jeopardy.
Appoint someone to deal with anything out of left field that might crop up during the event. This person may require assistants and should be free to appoint these as needed.
Appoint either one person or perhaps a married couple to act as convention hosts for your convention speakers and presenters. This host person or host couple will be commissioned to look after guests from the time they step off the plane on arrival until they go back through the airport after the event is all over. These hosts must be people of high calibre as they represent your event in the eyes of the guests coming.
Split your event into workable categories (video, sound, catering, security etc) and nominate one person (managerial assistant) to take charge of each category.

, Audiovisual support is one of those things that most people won’t notice unless it’s missing or malfunctioning. Effective audiovisual support should be seamlessly integrated with the main stage.

, Conversely they need to visit the bathroom from time to time. Make sure your program is structured so that attendees have time to eat their snacks and/or meals during breaks and visit the bathroom also; should that be necessary.

, Don't get caught out, ask. Once you know what is required make sure everything is covered in your planning. It would be a good idea to put someone in charge of this area of the event.

,,"

Get a suitable type and amount of paper.,
Measure out your tickets.,
Write in the information.,
Keep your raffle design distinctive and consistent.",How to Make Raffle Tickets1," Consider the paper you'll be using for the raffle tickets. If you just need very basic, utilitarian raffle tickets, regular printing paper will do just fine. If you want something that leaves a more professional impression, consider buying a heavier weight paper, or a coloured material instead of the standard plain white.

If you think there's any risk for ticket fraud, something off-white or irregular will make it more difficult for people to make fake copies.;
, If you are keeping your raffle fairly small (>50 people), it is just as easy to write up the tickets all by hand. Take a ruler and cut them out in rows and columns so that you have a bunch of tickets of the same size. If you're making enough tickets in the raffle to be worth several pages of paper, you might try measuring them out and cutting them all at once. However, this time-saving technique shouldn't be tried unless you know you've gotten your measurements down perfectly.

Scissors aren't recommended for cutting if you're selling your tickets. You probably won't get a straight cut out of them. Instead, a ruler and a craft precision knife can get you an even cut that looks like it was done professionally.Raffle ticket size can vary if you're making them from home. However, for the sake of making lots, you should aim to make them around 2x4"" inches (5x10cm). For the sake of saving paper, keep them as small as you can without sacrificing the essential information.
It's helpful to record who bought each ticket if possible. That way, you can make sure the purchaser lines up with the person who calls out the winning ticket.

, The sort of information you put onto each ticket varies from raffle to raffle. What matters most is that all tickets are consistent. Except for the ticket number, which should vary from each ticket, each ticket should be roughly the same. While the tickets should be customized to fit the event, here are some details you almost certainly want to have:

The name of the hosting organization.
The date and name of the event.
The price of the raffle ticket.
The number of the ticket.
For small raffles purchased on the day of the prize, you can leave it as simple as a number and signature., Although smaller-sized raffles don't usually run the risk of ticket fraud, it still helps to give your tickets a special touch for legitimacy's sake. Something like a drawing specific to the type of raffle you're putting on, or a quick signature can make the tickets feel more worth the money. It's a small detail, but buyers will appreciate the effort you put into each of them.

For example, if you're trying to raise money for Little League, you could draw a baseball bat on each ticket
If you're intent on doing your tickets by hand, it's recommended that only one person make them. That way, the handwriting will be consistent for each one, and it will be easier to spot a dupe if one occurs.

Stay hydrated.,
Communicate.,
Collect information.,
Put on your game face.",How to Organise a Convention2," It may sound like a simple thing, but conventions require long hours and lot of time on the go – make sure you and your staff stay hydrated and fed, so that you have the energy and stamina to keep going all day (and then wake up to do it all again tomorrow).

, You can’t put out all the fires and handle everything on your own. Stay in constant communication with your staff, solicit help, make sure everyone is on task and ask for assistance as the need arises. The stronger your communication and leadership skills during your event, the smoother the outcome.

, In addition to registrations, you’ll want to collect suggestions for improvement, contact information for representatives who may wish to sponsor or present at your next convention, and participant feedback surveys. This information is essential in helping you improve your event each time, so be sure to take time after the event to analyze the data.

, Smile, be cordial and welcoming, and remind your staff to do the same. When it comes to using your staff effectively, play to everyone’s strengths. Put your most outgoing, knowledgeable staff and committee members out on the floor to help direct traffic and answer questions. Friendly, organized folks would be ideal at the registration desk and check-in. Hard-working individuals who are more on the shy side would best serve as runners and back-of-the-house personnel.

Make some notes.,
Enter data (if applicable).,
Analyze the data.,
Say “thank you.” After your event, send out your thank you notes or letters to those who assisted in some key way.,
Make decisions for next time.",How to Organise a Convention3," Now that your convention has ended, you can relax, right? Well, not exactly. The smarter approach would be to make some notes to assist you (or the next lucky individual who will take this responsibility over from you) in planning your next convention. Make notes about what worked, what didn’t work, things you liked and didn’t like about the venue, and what recommendations you have for improving next year’s event. Have a debriefing meeting with your committee members – they will have additional input for you, as well as from conversations they had in the field during the event.

, Hopefully, you were able to collect participant information electronically, which eliminates the need for data entry. If not, it pays to get forms entered sooner rather than later after your event – this way, you are building your contact list for next event’s “save the date” mailing.

, Review, summarize and analyze the responses from your participant surveys. Pay attention to what worked, what wasn’t as well received, and what suggestions were made by participants for improving the process and experience. Include this information with your notes from the previous step. Additionally, review your budget – did you meet it? What funds were spent that could be avoided or omitted going forward? Where would funds have been better spent (for example, your participant surveys may show that additional signage was needed to avoid confusion and manage traffic flow – knowing this, you can add funds to next year’s signage budget).

, This would include committee members, volunteers, staff, sponsors, speakers, vendors who donated funds or items (flowers, decorations, beverages, publicity, etc.) to the event. Never underestimate the power of a thank you – when you take the time to express sincere gratitude, these same individuals and vendors will be even more receptive when you approach them for assistance next year.

, You can begin making some key decisions about the next event (venue, location, speakers, even the date and duration) based on the feedback received and the overall experience of this event.

Locate a party popper.,
Remove excess paper/packaging.,
Ignore the warning printed (normally in red) on the base of the first cardboard disk at the base.

,
Using a tool such as a screwdriver (or other thin wedge), pry away the first disk (the one at the base with the warning) to reveal the streamers.

,
Remove the streamers from the compartment.,
Remove the second desk, revealing the empty shock wave chamber.

,
Carefully remove the charge and the string through the bottom (where the disks once were).,
Pick your detonation method.,
Always use hearing protection while detonating, especially when in close contact.,
Put on some gloves.,
While keeping face and other unnecessary body parts away, pull the string away from the body of the explosive.,
Make a base for the explosive:


Get a tealight candle.,
Insert the explosive string side down in the base you just created.,
Hold an open flame from a match or lighter on the body of the explosive.,
Get the wick from the base in the 'Direct Flame' method and tie the explosive part to it using the string.,
Light the wick/fuse and get a considerable distance away.",How to Make Fire Crackers from Party Poppers," They can be found at:


Party Shops
Novelty shops and stands (like at carnivals)
The toy aisle in some grocery and department stores;
, There will probably be a label on it and sometimes a band to protect the string to stop it from firing when not wanted (in packet).

,,, (There are some fun things to do with these)

,,


You may need to use a toothpick or alike to thread some of the string through the small hole.
You may also need to widen the small hole slightly.
Although removing it should be safe as long as the string isn't pulled with reasonable force, they are explosives so still express caution while doing removing.

, Once you have removed the explosive there are a few ways to detonate it:

By simply pulling the string from the rest of the explosive.
By igniting the explosive directly with fire (instant ignition).
By using a fuse (candle wick works) to lead fire down to the explosive.

, Although it is quieter than most fire crackers, it is still loud and could cause hearing damage., Firmly hold the body of the explosive and the string in the other., The small piece of flint inside should light the gunpowder immediately and there will be a satisfying ""bang."",
Remove the wax part from the tin.
Remove the wick and the wick base (you can use later this for the 'Fuse' method).
Optionally, cut back the tin so only a small 'tray' is left.

, Alternatively you can hold it with hand protection on (gloves) but it is more dangerous.

, Don't expect it to work first time, but prepare for it to go off as soon as the flame touches it., Alternatively, for a faster burning fuse but a more dangerous method, dip the cotton string in oil, petroleum jelly, or other flammable substance.

, Let the flame get down to the base part of the explosive and hope for the bang.

, , Use the designs provided on this article for painting the feet. However do not paint the bottom of their feet so the children can walk and play without getting paint on everything. You can paint the top of the feed and lower part of the ankle. If you know the children and know that they won't have an allergy reaction to the paint you can paint higher up on the ankle to provide a sock.

, This should be a warm activity where the children can come wearing shorts and if possible sandals so you can easily paint their feet. Remember they will end up barefoot because you will be painting on their socks and shoes on the top of their feet. If necessary they could put on flip-flops or wear their sandals protect the bottom of their feet.

, Such things as soccer, line dancing, Limbo dancing, the Hokey-Pokey or a sock hop.

, Put a foot outline on your invitations. Add a paint bucket with a brush and some paint splatters on it as well. Tell your guests to come prepared to get their feet painted fancy.

, Play lots of dance music for dancing for these wild feet. If you like, you can teach them some line dances or other fun dances that they can easily learn. This would work well for older children who really want to learn ballroom dancing or other types of dancing.

, Put together a birthday cake that looks like a shoe or a foot. You could even make it look like a foot in a cast.

, You can use balloons and have the children step on them. The balloons can be loose on the floor where everyone can step on them. Or you could tie the balloon to a child's foot with a ribbon and they would have to pop their own balloon or another person could pop their balloon.

, Provide papers with a foot on it. Let the children design a sock or shoe or some other design for a foot. The design can be used either as the painting on their feet or in a contest to pick the best design.

, Let's try to get the kids back to dancing and dance the night away with their wild feet.

Print using a template.If you're printing over a computer, you don't need to design the tickets from scratch.,
Fill in the information.,
Print your template sheet.,
Keep track of your tickets.,
Perforate your tickets.",How to Make Raffle Tickets2," There are templates specifically designed for raffle draws. Look up one of these templates and print rows and columns of them onto as many printer sheets as you need. You can take the image and type the necessary information as needed via a Word processor. Print off a sheet and have it ready.

Even if they're blank to start with, you can fill out the details afterward by hand, so long as the work is done in a permanent marker or pen.
Some programs like Microsoft Publisher will guide you through the process of numbering and printing tickets., Much like making your tickets by hand, you'll need to input information for the tickets. Because you're doing it via computer, it will be faster to make the tickets consistent. Write in the basic information into the template you're using. The individual ticket number can be either written in or sequenced via a program like Microsoft Publisher.Although specifics will vary between raffle events, here are some things you'll absolutely want on each ticket:

The name of the hosting organization.
The date and name of the event.
The price of the raffle ticket.
The number of the ticket. This can be done automatically, or by hand. Because it's so fast to write the number by hand, many raffles choose to approach this route.

, When the tickets have all the necessary information on them except for the ticket number, load adequate paper into your printer and make as many copies as you need. It's a good idea to print a couple extra sheets in case you make a mistake, or wind up needing more than you expected.

The number of the ticket is the only thing that changes. If you're starting to sell tickets that are in the double or triple digits, you can add a digit to the front. However, given how fast numbers can be written by hand, this may not be worth the trouble.

, If you're using a computer, keeping track of the tickets digitally via a program like Excel can help avoid screw-ups as the event goes on.Keeping a firm grasp of the numbers will give you a better idea as to whether the raffle will be lucrative or not.

If you find your raffle won't be worth the costs, try selling more tickets or cut the costs somehow.

, Printed tickets are more uniform, so it works in your favour if you're a little more professional with them. Perforating your tickets means you'll be able to tear them each off quickly.Perforating tools are spindled wheels that poke holes evenly in a line. Run them between tickets like you would use a pizza cutting wheel. Cut your tickets out into rows and perforate the border between each ticket.Perforation isn't necessary, but it does make the raffle easier when it comes time to sell them. You can purchase a perforating machine from an arts store.
It should be mentioned that perforating tickets yourself is a pretty time-consuming ordeal, especially if you're going through a lot of raffle tickets. If you want to save money by going DIY, it can make your product more professional. However, if the funds are available, it is easier to go ahead and get them done by a third-party.

Compare manufacturing prices.For any sizable raffle (500+ tickets) it is recommended that you buy tickets from a professional company.,
Contact a manufacturer.,
Design and order your tickets.,
Wait for the tickets to ship.,
Receive and unpack your tickets.",How to Make Raffle Tickets3," This will lessen the workload for you, and there won't be a risk of potential ticket fraud. There are online outlets that specialize in ticket printing.Check online for a few of these and compare prices to see which one suits you best.

Depending on where you live, you may also be able to find a printing store with ticket printing options.
Tickets tend to be sold for 60-80 USD per 1000 tickets. You'll need to add shipping costs to your tally if you're getting them online., Whether you've found a local ticket producer or an outlet online, you need to get a hold of them before you can order your tickets. Online companies will have their contact info somewhere on their webpage. Drop them a line, introduce yourself and let them know you're interested in purchasing raffle tickets. Be sure to let them know roughly how many tickets you're looking to buy, as well as the date you want to have them by. A representative should respond within a business day to take things forward from there.

While you don't want to waste anyone's time intentionally, it may be helpful to contact a few places. It's possible you'll be able to snag a better deal if the company is open to wholesale bargaining.

, Once you've chosen a manufacturer and are in contact with them, it will come time to solidify the specifics of your order. Some of the bigger outlets will come with pre-made ticket designs you can buy more cheaply. Custom orders may cost more, but you'll have a ticket with a specific look for your event.Make sure to give the manufacturer all the information they require. This may include:

Name and date of the event you're hosting.
Name of the hosting organization.
Quantity of tickets you want to order.
Date you need the tickets by.

, Once you've gone through with your order, it's time to wait for the tickets to ship. Because shipping can take up to a couple of weeks depending where you, it's a good idea to order your tickets far in advance of the raffle itself. You'll also want time to sell the tickets after they arrive.

If you're in a bind for time, you can have tickets manufactured locally. Even then, depending on the business' workload, you may have to wait a couple of business days before they have something ready for you.

, The tickets normally come wrapped coil and will most likely be perforated. You should leave the coil wrapped until it comes time to sell the tickets so you don't lose any.

If the tickets do not make it by the agreed-upon time, you should ask that your money be refunded. From that point, purchasing from a local vendor or making the tickets yourself are viable options.

Design your invitation to resemble the party theme.,
Include all important information guests will need to know.,
Respect the level of formality of your party.,
Decide how many people total you want at your party.",How to Invite People to a Party1," For example, a disco-themed party invitation could feature a large disco ball. People are likely to look at your invitation and make a quick first impression -- you want that first impression to be informative and fun.


If your party doesn't have a theme, have the invitation mirror the formality of the party. If you're throwing a black tie soiree, keep it simple with a plain border, a fancy font, and to-the-point text. If you're throwing a rave, make your invitation as wild as you'd like.
You can also send a mail to your friends and relatives to give an invitation for a party.;
, That's usually the time and date of the party, location, where to call for more information, and whether or not the guest needs to RSVP are all important. And do they need to bring anything (food, swimsuit, etc.)? Does the party have a specific time it ends?


You may want to include a few selling points if applicable. Will you be having awards for best dressed? Provide beer and wine? Will there be 50 varieties of European cheeses? Give your guests a slight clue as to what you have planned for the evening to whet their appetite.

, A formal party should require a more formal invitation, such as a letter. An informal party invitation is up to your discretion – a phone call, email, or social media event would all work fine.


Formal events generally require a bit of advanced notice -- preferably around 2 weeks.

, There are several things to consider when thinking about a party's size and attendance:


How big is the space where your party will be? Can your apartment hold 10 people, 50 people, 200 people?
Is it okay for the people you invite to bring friends? How many friends?
Do you have a say over who those friends are?
How many people can you feed and have drinks for at your party? Does this include friends of friends?
If you're having your party at a club, bar, hotel, rented room, etc., does the owner have limits on the number of people that can be there?

, Chat with your guests as you fill them in on the details of your party. Your winning personality will sell the party for you!


Try starting out with the usual pleasantries. ""How are you?"", ""How is work going?"", and ""How's the family?"" are often good starting points. Choose a natural pause in conversation or termination of a subject to bring up that you are having a party.
After you have alerted them to the party, you can answer any immediate questions the guest might have, and even gauge interest through tone of voice.

, The spoken word can be easily forgotten, and it may be worth emailing, texting, or mailing them some of the details. They could be swamped with a dozen other things going on, even if they are really interested in your party.

Make sure they know what's expected of them. Sometimes getting involved (like bringing a dish) can get them remembering and even looking forward to it.

, You're not nagging them; you're simply getting a head count so you can plan your party accordingly.


If they can't give you a yes or no on the second go-round, it's best to discount them. If they show up, fine, but if they don't, it's no skin of your nose. The party will still go on and it'll be great.

Approach your guests at a convenient time.,
Leave guests a way out.,
Make sure to give them all the necessary information.,
Chat up your guests.,
Be aware that you may offend people you didn’t invite who overhear your invitations to others.",How to Invite People to a Party4," Invite them during a time you might see them anyway. Maybe you share a scheduled activity together? Otherwise, schedule an activity or meet up with them as is convenient. The more time they have, the more receptive they'll be to your approach.

, Don't invite guests in a way that makes them feel they have to say yes. Your party should be fun and totally accommodating. If they can't make it, they should feel a little disappointed -- not guilty!


For example, instead of saying ""You're coming to my party next weekend, right?"", say something like ""Hey *guest's name*, I'm having a party next weekend. I'd love it if you could come!""

, Much like with a phone invitation, it is easy to forget details in the heat of a personal conversation/invitation. Make sure to cover where and when it is, what the occasion is, and if they need to bring anything.


To avoid guests forgetting information, you can hand out a physical invitation as well. This doesn't have to be a tried-and-true invite so much as a reminder.
Short of that, you can offer to write information down or text it to their phone, etc.

, You can raise interest for your party with an in-person invitation. This can be especially effective in a group setting. The more excited you are about it and the more you can build it up with detail, the less they'll be likely to forget and the more likely they are to feed off your excitement and get excited, too.


Describe what your party will be like, and how excited you are. You can say something like ""I'm really looking forward to it; it's going to be great!"" You can also use tone and body language in a personal conversation for added effect.
If you don’t have the party’s details nailed down, open them up for suggestions by your guests. Guests are much more likely to come if they had a hand in the creation of your party.

, Be discreet when you're doling out your in-person invitations. Make sure only the people you want invited are hearing the discussion.


If it's an issue, tell them that you can only have so many people at the party. Because of that, you need them to keep word on the down-low. They'll feel special for making the VIP list!

E-Cards are sent to email addresses just like a normal message, but they include images, sound, and sometimes short animations. E-cards can also be acceptable for semi-formal parties if themed correctly.
If you prefer to send a normal email, just include the necessary information, any additional message, and an image if desired. For more information, check out How to Write an Email to a Friend


, Evite, Socializr, and MyPunchBowl are three popular choices. Choose a style that fits the theme and/or mood of your party, and be sure to include everything that needs including!


There are a dozens of invitation websites out there. If the one your one isn't doing it for you, just go to another one!

, Type a nice, handcrafted message if desired. Make it unique and personal -- not just some template that will do. The more time you spend on it, the more impressive it'll be.


Also consider adding end time, costume specifics, meal details, etc. Anything you think may give your guests a better picture of what the plan is can be useful.

, It is usually necessary to include a comma between each email address, just for the record. Some websites will let you know when the messages have been read and will keep correspondence for you -- take advantage of it and select this before sending!

, It'll keep tabs on your recipients and will handle the RSVPs. Though you may need to send a courtesy text to a few of your busier friends! Sometimes emails do get lost in the shuffle.

, Throw in a picture of two if you like. The more complete it is, the more people can get a picture of the awesomeness of your party.


Be creative here! Saying, ""Hey guys, having a party at 7 on Friday!"" won't get them jazzed.

, Be sure to respond to the comments and questions of others. This way you can start being a good host before your party even begins. Getting people involved in the makings of your party will ensure their attendance and get them feeling like a part of the magic.

, Often times, the amount of people you invite to a social media event and the amount of people that show up are quite different. Never take the numbers you see online at face value.


Usually, fewer people show up than RSVP ""yes,"" but the discrepancy can trend in either direction. Especially if it's open and people bring friends.
Generally, the higher the number of people that RSVP ""yes,"" the more likely it is for your party to ""snowball"" into a much bigger event than you planned for.

Buy beach balls and inner tubes.,
Purchase latex based glue.,
Add props or other enhancements.",How to Make a Beach Ball Party Arch2," Your arch will be built using the beach balls as the arch “walls” and the beach balls to secure and ground the arch.


Spring for a pump to blow up all inflatables. This will make the process go faster and avoid you getting lightheaded!






Consider purchasing balls and tubes in a variety of sizes. You may want to start with larger beach balls and tubes toward the base of the arch and then get smaller toward the top.






Use small sized inner tubes to connect beach balls together. Use a large tube to ground the arch, then add the beach ball and then add a small inner tube.







, Although the arch will most likely stand on its own without gluing it together, you are better off with some sort of adhesive material to ensure it doesn’t topple over in the event it is bumped.

, For example if you want to go extravagant you could purchase sand to surround the arch or create a beach towel “red carpet” going through the arch.

"
"
Blow up all inflatables.,
Stack inner tubes and beach balls without using the glue.,
Add adhesive to the beach balls and inner tubes.",How to Make a Beach Ball Party Arch3," Use your electric or battery operated pump to avoid getting lightheaded while blowing up all the inflatables.

, You want to construct the arch first to make sure you like the design before making it permanent.


You may need to enlist the assistance of a friend to hold the beach ball arch in place toward the top. Use small inner tubes to hold each beach ball in place.







, You may need to hold the middle portion of the arch in place until the glue adheres. Glue as you build the arch to ensure it arches and curves in the right place (as opposed to building it on the ground and then standing it up).

, There are endless possibilities for dinner, four to five dishes should suffice.


Buy microwavable noodles, and follow the directions. One small pack is enough for three to four people. If there are no microwave directions but you are sure it is safe, then add in water, a bit extra and microwave until the noodles are soft. Drain out some excess water.
Buy sausage/vegetarian links and microwave them. Chop them up into small pieces and add them to the noodles.
Make a chicken bake-one per every four people if you can be trusted with an oven. There are directions on the back. Chicken bakes can be sold in most stores.
Go the extra mile and try some foreign food! Heat up some tortillas, and defrost fajita chicken bits (if directions allow microwave use). Buy guacamole and cheese and set up an assembly line. Alternatively, fix the fajitas yourself if time allows you to.

, Buy lettuce, tomatoes, and any other ingredients of your choice. Wash them and cut them up into small pieces. Whip it all together with dressing.

Serve a warm, seasonal main dish.,
Invite guests to bring a contribution to the meal.,
Think seasonally when deciding on dishes and ingredients.,
Serve a pie (or two) for dessert.,
Plan ahead for seating arrangements.,
Stock up on supplies in advance.,
Ready your decorations, music, or general ambiance.,
Invite guests with at least a week’s notice.,
Plan to finish preparation and cooking before your guests arrive.,
Put early arrivals to work.",How to Host a Winter Dinner Party," Even if you have asked guests to bring side dishes or desserts, plan to prepare the main dish yourself. Take advantage of the wintery season and cold weather to make a dish that’s warm and comforting. Soup, chili, roasted meat, or roasted vegetables (for attending vegetarians or vegans) are all good options.For example, you can prepare a filling and warm White Chicken Chili which serves 8 adults. The chili contains cannellini beans, green chili, onions, 5 chicken breasts (or 2 rotisserie chickens), butter, and flour, in addition to several spices and optional toppings.
Avoid grilling or barbecuing meat, as these methods of meat-preparation are more associated with summer dinners.;
, While you don’t necessarily have to turn your dinner party into a potluck, if guests offer to bring something, politely take them up on the offer. This could be as simple as asking guests to bring a bottle of wine or “something to drink,” or asking guests to bring a specific culinary item that would be helpful to you as you prepare the meal. For example, if you have a friend who enjoys bread or lives near a bakery, ask them to bring a fresh loaf of their favorite bread.If you would like to host a winter potluck, you’ll need to make that clear to guests when you first invite them. State that you’ll be providing the dinner’s main dish, but would like guests to bring options for sides and desserts.

, Since you’re already hosting a dinner party in winter and are likely planning to cook a variety of dishes, why not take advantage of the season and cook dishes using seasonally available ingredients? Take a trip to a nearby farmer’s market and see which vegetables and fruits are in season.For example, kale and cabbage are in season during the winter months, and can be found at a farmer’s market or local health-food store.
Preparing dishes with local, seasonally available ingredients will improve the taste and quality of your dishes.

, Pies are a great winter dessert: they’re served warm, filled with tasty fruits, and not as difficult to make as cakes and other desserts, so you could make more than one in advance of your dinner. The category of “pie” can also include turnovers; get creative with the size, style, and filling of dessert pies.If you’re already stressed with the other duties associated with hosting a dinner party, ask one of your guests to bring a pie instead.

, Unlike a dinner party held in the spring or summer, during which guests could spread out and sit outside, your winter dinner party will likely need to be contained within your house or apartment. This means that you should plan to have a chair at the table—or at least a seat on the couch and room on a nearby coffee table—for each guest. While you don’t need to fully script seating arrangements (guests can choose their own locations around the table), make sure that there’s plenty of room indoors for everyone to sit and eat.


It would be appropriate to let guests know that you have limited seating room, and that they should alert you promptly if they would like to bring a guest to dinner, or if they will not be able to attend dinner for a personal reason.

, It can be awkward and potentially detrimental to the meal to run out of a key ingredient partway through dinner. Make that your pantry and refrigerator are well stocked before the dinner party begins. Double check that you have plenty of butter, cooking oil, dishware and silverware, and wine earlier in the day; you don’t want to have to send someone out into the cold to purchase an ingredient that you forgot, or to pick up more wine.This step is especially important if you have guests coming over who plan to cook using your stove or oven, or who would like to use your serving dishes to present their own food.
To this effect, double check that you have plenty of clean serving dishes and forks or spoons.

, To put your guests at ease and in general set a pleasant and seasonal mood for your winter dinner party, decorate your home to a degree that you’re comfortable with. If you’d like to use seasonal flowers and greens to decorate, purchase a poinsettia or two to use as a table centerpiece. Baby’s Breath flowers are an effective winter decoration: they are dried and can last for months, and will add a nice touch to your dinner or coffee table.For a more minimalist decoration / ambience setting, light a handful of evergreen-scented candles around your home.
If you’d like to play music, plan to play some winter favorites—including Christmas carols, depending on how near you are to the holiday—and mix in some upbeat rock, jazz, or pop. Online music streaming services likely already have a variety of winter-themed playlists put together for your choosing., Putting together a dinner party takes time, and you’ll want to give your guests enough advance notice so that they can check their schedules and plan ahead for your party. Regardless of the size of your prospective dinner party, and whether you plan to invite guests via face-to-face conversation, email, text, or mail, invite them at least a week in advance.


You may need to give guests more than a week of advance notice, considering that winter tends to be a busy season. If your planned dinner party is near the holidays (or anytime between mid-November and mid-January), invite guests three or four weeks in advance so their calendar isn’t already full by the time they receive your invitation.

, Part of the anxiety that some hosts feel surrounding a dinner party comes from being concerned that they’ll spend all night in the kitchen and have very little time with their guests. In order to avoid this conundrum, complete as much of the preparatory work as possible in advance. Earlier in the day, arrange chairs and set the table, and prepare the main dish (and any sides that you’re cooking).Then, when your guests arrive, plan to engage them in conversation and start the dinner party by opening a bottle of wine or a couple of beers.

, It can be a little awkward when party guests show up over 15 or 20 minutes early; you’re still preparing, but expected to entertain the guest as well. To avoid this situation, put any early arrivals to work helping you prepare the meal. For example, if you’re serving a charcuterie plate as an appetizer but haven’t had a chance to prepare it yet, ask your early guest(s) to slice the cheese and meats and set out crackers and olives.If you have guests who arrive early and would like to finish baking or preparing a dish in your kitchen, or who would like to refrigerate a cool dish in your fridge, give them the time and space they need.

Start with a box and its cover.,
Cut windows into the sides of the box using scissors or a utility knife.,
Use a hot glue gun to cover the top of the box with glue.,
Cover the sides of the house with pieces of cookies or crackers.,
Add ""paint"" or glitter to the outside of the house.,
Use cookies and hard candies to accessorize the exterior of the house.,
Add some creative landscaping.,
Take your faerie house outside and leave it in the most wooded or overgrown area in your yard.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Fairy House with Food," An angular box, like a shoebox, will create a more traditional house, while a round box, like a wine box, will create a turreted castle. Set the cover aside.;
, Also, cut out a front door. Invert the box onto a work surface.

, Attach crackers or cookies to make shingles for the roof.


You can make a cone-shaped roof by turning sugar ice cream cones upside down and gluing them to the cracker- or cookie-covered roof.
Trim squares out of the sides of your box cover. Doing this will create ramparts for the top of your turrets if you decide to build a castle. When you invert the box, glue the top of the cover to the ""roof"" of your house.

, Use hot glue to attach the items to the box, making sure to leave the windows clear.


Create a ""stone"" house by gluing small nuts, like acorns, to the outside of the house.
Build a ""log cabin"" by gluing thick pretzel sticks horizontally to the cardboard box.

, For example, you can:


Cover the exterior of the house with a thin layer of glue that will dry clear. Sprinkle the house in cinnamon or other colorful spices for a dash of color. Just skip the hot spices; you don't want to get those on your fingertips or in your eyes.
Decorate the outside of the house with glitter glue.

, Try some of these ideas:


Glue a heart-shaped cookie over the front door of the house.
Hot glue hard candies around the eaves of the house.
Outline the doors and windows with red hot candies that you've hot-glued to the edges. If you don't have any red hot candies, use unpopped popcorn kernels instead.

,


Invert your faerie house onto a ""yard"" made of flat cardboard, and glue dried banana chips over the surface of the cardboard.
Create a path to the door of your house using glue and either sliced almonds or hard candies.
Add foundation ""bushes"" to the bottom edges of your house by gluing colored cookies or dried fruit pieces around the bottom.
Build a fence using pretzels or any shape or size. If the pretzels won't stand up, you can glue them to a strip of thin cardboard for extra support.

, If you don't have a yard, put the house at the base of a tree on your property. Faeries are extremely grateful when they receive a gift made with such love, and you can expect that good things will happen.

Will you compete for a spot on the weekend? Or will you host it on an evening during the week when their spouses can watch the kids? Do your guests need babysitters? Those can be hard to come by during the Christmas season. Ask these questions to help you decide:


When will this party best work in with my schedule?
Will I get a better guest turn-out on the weekend or a weeknight?;
, It is recommended that you run the party somewhere between an hour or two. The longer the party, the more activities you'll have to plan, but also allow for a little mix-and-mingle time after the games are over.

, Are you planning to host five or 25 people? Make sure you can comfortably seat all of your guests. If you're hosting the party at your house, you'll need time beforehand to set up tables, chairs, refreshments and décor (if you don't already have that up). Otherwise, you'll need to book a spot. Reservations fill quickly during the holiday season, so book it ASAP. Don't forget the tables! You'll need at least one, if not two, tables for the food (depending on how many people you're hosting) and another table for the wrapped ornaments. Some questions to consider include:


Can the space I'd like to use comfortably seat the number of guests I want to invite?
Does it have enough tables (or space to set up tables) for refreshments and ornaments?
Is it available when I need it?

, This is probably the easiest part. Simply ask yourself:


Who do I want at the party?
Can I host them all?

, Here are four different methods for you to think about:


1) Use sites like Evite.com or similar, where they have a wide range of awesome looking invitations to choose from for free; try to use one that is able to handle all the RSVPs. (That tends to only work if you have everyone's email address.
2) Facebook also gathers RSVPs for you when you set up a Facebook event - this usually means less eye candy, but it's an easy option. All you need is to be ""friends"" with your would-be guests to send them an invite to your event.
3) You can also use your mad graphic design skills to make your own party invitations and attach them to an email.
4) And of course, there's the old fashioned snail-mail card. Frankly, everyone loves these still, as they're great to receive, hold and display. So even though they are more expensive than a digital invitation, they're worth mailing out just for the wow-factor.

,
Do I want to send digital invitations through email?
Would it be better to make a Facebook event and invite them that way?

, On the one hand, gathering games can be a riot (for example, Christmas trivia or getting-to-know-you games). On the other hand, the ornament exchange might be ""game"" enough. Exchanges that involve one person opening at a time take longer with bigger groups. Exchange games, such as reading stories and passing the ornament left or right, take only as long as the story takes to read. But then again, if you go around and have everyone show off their ornament individually, it's going to take longer, which might be a good thing. Ask yourself:


Do I want to do a gathering game?
What game would make the exchange work best for my group of guests?
Do I want the guests to make some ornaments of their own? (If so, provide the crafting materials and a crafting space.)

, Keep in mind that the more extravagant the refreshments, the more prep time and table space you're going to need. As the host, you'll be in charge of paper goods - plates, utensils, napkins, cups, and serving utensils.


What refreshments will I have time to prepare before the party?
Am I doing the whole yummy spread by myself? Do I have enough serving dishes to do that?
Should I do ""pot-luck"" style and have guests bring something to share? And if so, will I add a dish of my own?

, The invitations are out, the food planned and the games ready. What now? Make your To-Do list to prepare for the party!

, Do you need paper and pencils, a bowl to draw numbers for the exchange, or...? What about prizes?

, Sometimes you can make the food the day before, other times you'll need to buy it on the same day as the party. Plan that out now.


Buy any food, paper goods, and decorations you'll need (don't forget an ornament!) a few days before the party. Then if you forget something, you have time to go buy it.

, Here's an example:


7 pm - Gathering Game
7:30 pm - Ornament Exchange
8 pm - Refreshments and Mingling.


Of course, the games may take longer or shorter than planned, so just be flexible with your schedule.







, Before the party starts, you'll need to decorate. Hang up ornaments, tinsel, Santa decorations, etc. as you wish. You can also add table centerpieces, a front door wreath, a Christmas tree, etc.

, Get your table spread ready with food and drinks, set up the chairs and rearrange furniture as needed. Don't forget to get your party music playing.

, A stressed host can lead to stressed guests, picking up on the vibes. Relax a little. Eat some chocolate. Enjoy the company."

If you own a big house, hosting the party at home is fine as long as you restrict certain parts of the house and clear out some space for the party.If your house isn't big enough to host a party, see if you could rent a dance floor, a winery, a room at an events center, or something similar for the party.;

Try to choose a weekend date so that people don’t have to worry about leaving the party early because they have to work the next day.

, You don’t want to throw a party that no one can attend because you simply didn’t notify your guests in enough time for them to plan accordingly. Let your guests know at least two weeks before the party so that they can pencil your masquerade party into their schedules.A month advanced notice is preferable.

, Send an email to all of your guests a week or so before the party to remind them about the masquerade party. You can include any pertinent information about bringing snacks or drinks, and even remind them that it is a masquerade party so everyone should come dressed accordingly.This is especially helpful for your guests who aren’t on Facebook and weren’t invited to the event via social media.

Pick a theme.,
Pick out your outfit.,
Decorate accordingly.,
Choose classical music.",How to Host a Masquerade Party2," Consider what theme you want so that you can inform your guests. For a masquerade party, you’ll need a fun theme that everyone can adhere to. This is also a fun element of the party that will help get your guests more engaged and excited ahead of time.You could include a color theme where everyone has to dress in the same colors (like black and white).
You could also choose a Mardi Gras theme for a more casual, relaxed party.

, Since it's a masquerade party, of course you're going to have to wear a mask. If you're a guy, pick out a tuxedo, dress pants, or something else dressy and a hand mask. If you're a lady, choose a fancy dress and a strap-on sparkly mask.Make sure you dress according to your chosen theme.
You can also include fun masquerade accessories like some flashy jewelry or heavy eye makeup (that can be seen while wearing your mask).

, The decorations make the party. Include little masquerade details everywhere – like candlesticks in elegant candleholders (used safely, of course), glitter on some of the tables, masks as centerpieces, etc.You could also hang some masks on the wall.
Consider draping dangly lights from the ceiling and using colorful fabric to cover up any out-of-place furniture.

, Classical music is a great choice for a masquerade party because it goes with the idea of revelry inherent in the masquerade party ideal. Choose music by Beethoven, Mozart, and Vivaldi.You can hire a band or just play songs on your stereo – whatever works.

"
"
Provide refreshments for your guests.,
Choose food and drinks that are easy to consume while wearing a mask.,
Greet the guests as they come in.,
Highlight the big reveal.",How to Host a Masquerade Party3," Make sure to plan for a variety of food and drink for your guests. This should include several appetizers or finger foods, a dessert, and beverages. Decide if you want to serve alcohol at your party, but even if you do be sure to include a non-alcoholic drink for those who wish to abstain from alcohol.


Try serving some food items like mini sandwiches, deviled eggs, pigs in a blanket, or veggie platters with various dips.
For the drinks, consider some kind of cola, water, punch, wine, and/or champagne.

, Some people might have masks with a handle, so the food should not be too complicated (or require both hands to eat). Include finger foods and beverages that go with the theme of your party.For example, if you are hosting a Mardi Gras themed masquerade party, you could include some mini New Orleans styled food like jambalaya and beignets.Provide straws for your guests so they can drink easily, even with a full-face mask.

, When everyone's arrived at your party, make a short opening announcement explaining the rules (don't make too many rules; you don't want to restrict the guests too much) and tell everyone that other than those few rules, they are welcome to do whatever they like.


As the host of the party, it is your responsibility to ensure that everyone has a good time and knows what is going on during the party.

, At midnight, there should be a moment when everyone unmasks themselves to unveil their identities to their fellow revelers. This should be a fun moment for all of your guests as they get to see who has been hiding behind the masks all night.As the host, you should announce the unveiling at midnight and encourage your guests to cheer and laugh as they do so.

Hold the candy with both hands, one end each, and pull as if you're trying to make a rope. Bring the length back in and twist it together. Then pull out again to a long rope.

Pull the two lengths together, gently twisting them into one another to form the stripes.
Use oiled kitchen shears to cut candy cane lengths from the twisted roll (about 8 inches/20cm is adequate).
Shape the hook on top of each cut candy cane.
Repeat with remaining candy mixture. It can be returned to the warm oven at any stage for making it pliable again if needed but never leave in too long or you'll get a melted mess.

Find a striking table centerpiece.",How to Decorate a Room for a Party," The type of party that you’re throwing will play a big role in how you decorate. For example, you’ll probably decorate differently for a festive birthday party than you would for an elegant 25th anniversary party. If you’re hosting a holiday party, such as a Christmas or Halloween get-together, you probably have a good idea of what the decor should look like. Take the occasion into consideration as you start to think about decorations.You should also consider who the party is for. For example, if you’re celebrating a child’s birthday, you’ll probably want to make a bigger statement with the decorations than if you’re decorating for an adult’s birthday.;
, The room that you’re holding the party in may affect the way you decorate. For example, if you’re having the event at a private dining room in a restaurant, you may not be able to decorate as extensively as you would for a party at home. You should also take the size of the room and the height of the ceiling into account because the dimensions may limit the decorations that you can use.If you’re having your party at a restaurant or other commercial venue, it’s a good idea to call and ask what types of decorations are allowed. You don’t want to be surprised the day of the party.

, Some parties, such as holiday gatherings, have ready themes that may it easy to plan a decorating scheme. However, if you’re celebrating a birthday, anniversary, graduation, or other milestone, it often helps to choose a specific theme to help you organize the decorations. Try to come up with a theme that reflects the interests of the guest(s) of honor. For example, if you’re throwing a birthday party for a friend who likes to go sailing, you might settle on a nautical theme. For an anniversary party for a couple who likes to gamble, you might choose a Las Vegas or Monte Carlo theme.Movies, cartoon characters, and TV shows make fun party themes that are easy to customize for the guest(s) of honor.
A tropical or luau theme can be a festive general party theme.
Pick an interesting, distinctive time period, such as the roaring ‘20s or the ‘60s, as your party theme. You can even have guests dress up according to the trends of the era.
If you love to travel, consider giving your party an around the world theme.
If you’re throwing a party for a big sports fan, use their favorite team as inspiration for the event’s theme.

, Before you start planning the party’s decorations, it’s important to know how much money you have to spend on decor. Start by devising a budget for the entire party, and then break it down into individual categories, such as food, beverages, entertainment, and decor. Once you know how much money you have to decorate the room, you can start to deciding how best to invest it.Just because you’re on a tight budget when it comes to decorations doesn’t mean you can’t create a great looking party. You can always get creative and find items around the house that you can use to make your own decorations.
If you’re having trouble coming up with a budget, you may want to use an online budget calculator from party websites, such as Evite, to help., The walls are an obvious place to start when you’re decorating a room for a party. If you’re celebrating a specific milestone, such as a birthday, anniversary, or graduation, you may want to hang a banner for the event on the wall. Photos, posters, artwork, festive garlands, and other signs that you can find the party supply store are ideal options.For an party that honors specific people, you may want to hang photos of them on the wall. For example, if you’re celebrating your parents’ anniversary, decorate with copies of their wedding photos or other meaningful moments in their lives. If you’re celebrating a friend’s birthday, you may want to use baby photos to decorate.
If your party has a specific theme, you can use photos or artwork that fit the look, such as photos of your favorite movie stars for a Hollywood theme, on the walls.
You don’t have to ruin your walls to hang photos or other artwork on the walls. Use removable mounting tape on the backs, or run a piece of string or ribbon across the walls and use clothespins or binder clips to attach the photos to the string.
If you have scraps of ribbon at home, make a fun garland to decorate the walls or any columns or railings in the room. Loop the small scraps around the longest piece of ribbon and tie them off in bows for a festive look.

, You don’t want to overlook the ceiling when it comes to decorating the room for your party. Simple streamers and balloons are usually the best way to go. Hang the streamers across the ceiling so they all meet at the center, where you can arrange a cluster of balloons to hide the tape. You can also place balloons at the ceiling’s corners for added color.When you’re hanging streamers across the ceiling, you can keep the crepe paper straight or twist it as you go to give them a spiraled effect.
While you can arrange balloons in haphazard bunches, it’s also fun to create flowers out of them. Gather five or six balloons in the same color to serve as the petals, and place them around a yellow balloon that be the flower’s center. Tie all of the balloons together, and use tape to attach the “flower” to the ceiling.
You don’t just have to hang the streamers across the ceiling. Instead, try having them hang straight down from the ceiling to create a curtain that guests can have fun passing through.
In addition to simple latex balloons, you may want to add a few foil balloons. They come in a wide variety of shapes and themes, so you can probably find some that fit your party’s look to a tee.

, It’s an easy detail to overlook when you’re decorating for a party, but the right lighting can make a room feel more festive in a hurry. Simple string lights usually used at Christmas come in variety of colors, including multicolored, and you can hang them across the walls, windows, and ceiling, or wind them around railings and columns. You can also hang colorful paper lanterns from the party supply store to help dress up the room.If you want a more elegant look for your party, opt for white string lights instead of colored strands.
String lights are also available in fun shapes, such as hearts, stars, seashells, and chili peppers, so you may be able to find a variety that fits your party’s theme.
You can also use candles to give the room a more sophisticated feel. Just make sure to place them in locations where they won’t be knocked over and keep them away from flammable materials.

, Once you’ve hung some banners, streamers, balloons, and lights, it’s time to add a few decorations that help bring the party’s theme to life. For example, if you’re throwing an Oscar or a Hollywood themed party, you want to create a red carpet for the room by laying down a piece of red fabric for guests to walk across. For a dance themed party, you may want to hang a mirrored disco ball in the center of the room. For a child’s birthday, a pinata that fits the theme makes an ideal decoration.At your local party supply store, you can find inflatable decorations in a variety of fun shapes that fit an array of themes. For example, you might place an inflatable palm tree in the corner of the room for a tropical party, or an inflatable treasure chest in the corner for a pirate themed party.

, You might not think tablecloths make a big difference in readying your room for a party, but they can add some fun color to help tie the entire look together. They also protect your table or other surfaces in case there are any spills during the party. Choose a bold or bright color that matches the other decorations at the party.Consider laying tablecloths in two or more different colors for a festive look. Make sure to choose one that’s slightly larger than the others so the bottom will peek one from underneath the top layer.
For a casual party, disposable plastic tablecloths are the best option. They are inexpensive and come in a wide range of colors, so you can some that match the rest of your decorations.
For an elegant, sophisticated party, you may prefer fabric tablecloths. They can be somewhat expensive, though, so if you’re only going to use a certain color for the party, you may prefer borrowing one from friends or family members.

, Whether you’re having a sit-down dinner or a buffet style meal at your party, it helps to have an eye-catching decoration for the center of the table where you’ll be serving food. A floral arrangement is a traditional option -- you can purchase fresh flowers or use artificial or dried flowers to create a centerpiece for the table. If you’re not a fan of flowers, you can substitute balloon or create a custom centerpiece that fits your party’s theme. For example, if you’re throwing a zoo theme party, you might use stuffed animals to make a centerpiece for the table.For a Christmas party, a large bowl filled with fruit, pine cones, ornaments, and garland can make a simple but beautiful centerpiece. For a Halloween party, a jack o'lantern is the ideal centerpiece.
For a child’s birthday party, you can put vases or jars filled with colorful candy, such as gumballs, rock candy, gumdrops, and lollipops, in an arrangement to create a centerpiece for the table.
Create a simple centerpiece for an elegant party by filling a large bowl with water and adding floating candles.

Shape your outfit.,
Find or make shoulder pads.,
Mix and match colors.,
Try an 80s punk look.,
Wear athletic clothes.",How to Dress for an 80s Party1," The 80s were a time of experimentation with many different styles. Women’s styles tended to be big on top and small on the bottom. An oversized shirt was often paired with a miniskirtor tightly-fitted pants or leggings.


If you have an oversized sweatshirt, cutting the neck out of it so that it hangs off the shoulder will give it a more 80s look. Wear a tank top or sports bra underneath, preferably in a bright color.
If you do not have oversized tops or undersized bottoms, try looking in your parents’ closet (they may even have actual clothes from the 80s). Younger siblings may have tight clothes that are too small for you that you can borrow for the bottoms.;
, Shoulder pads were very popular in women’s clothing. The bigger the shoulder pads, the better. If you do not have a shirt with shoulder pads, try stuffing your shirt with some kind of padding., Many 80s fashionistas went for bold, bright color combinations. Neon colors were particularly popular.


Match your top and bottom and add a pop of contrasting color. For example, electric blue pants and top can be accented with a bright yellow or pink belt and chunky earrings.
Contrast your bright colors. If you do not have a matchy outfit, you can also put different bright colors together.Try to mix three or four different colors that are all different but all bright.
Bright tights can be worn underneath a miniskirt and topped with legwarmers of a different color.

, Another approach is to go for more of an 80s punk look, which would involve mostly black and denim.


Wear at least two different denims. Men typically wore denim pants with denim jackets.Women wore denim miniskirts with a denim jacket. Men and women typically wore a tight shirt underneath the denim jacket.
Combine denim and lace. A classic 80s look is a lace top paired with denim acid-wash jeans or a denim miniskirt. The contrast of drastically different materials is a key feature of 80s style.

, Athletic clothes were also popular in the 1980s. However, they tended to be far more matchy than modern athletic clothes.


Puffy athletic pants and a matching jacket paired with some sneakers can be a perfect 80s look. Though they may be hard to find, velvet or velour sweat sets are preferable.
Another approach to athletic wear is the iconic 80s woman workout look: a leotard, tights, and legwarmers. All in contrasting bright colors is preferable.

Ask older relatives about 80s clothing.,
Look for specific clothing items that were popular.,
Look for materials that were popular in the 80s.",How to Dress for an 80s Party2," The best way to find great 80s-style clothing is to find authentic clothing from the 80s. Thrift stores can be treasure troves for tacky, outdated styles, so they should be your first stop.

, You may be surprised about what people will keep stored in their attic or basement. Ask any family members or neighbors who were in their teens or early 20s in the 1980s (born in the mid 1960s) if they have any of their old clothes for you to borrow.

, A few iconic 80s items to look for specifically are Members’ Only jackets, parachute pants,acid washed or dyed jeans, shirts with large logos on them, miniskirts, leg warmers, stretch pants with stirrups, one-piece jumpers, and denim jackets.

Go big or stay home.,
Crimp or curl your hair.,
Wear a mullet.,
Wear a side ponytail.",How to Dress for an 80s Party3," The 80s was characterized by big hair.People with straight hair often got perms, which permanently curled their hair. However, hair can be temporarily made big with a comb, hairspray, and some patience if you tease your hair., A crimper is a special type of flat iron that crimps waves into your hair with high heat. Crimping can be somewhat time consuming, but it will give you a definite 80s flair, and it will make even the flattest hair much more voluminous. Curling your hair with a curling iron or curlers then tossing it with your fingers and applying hairspray can also be a good way to make your hair bigger., Though the mullet is most thought of as a men’s hairstyle (exemplified by iconic country singer Billy Ray Cyrus), in the 80s men and women wore their hair in mullets.


If you do not want to cut your hair into a mullet style, you can find a mullet wig at a party store. You may also be able to cut a long wig into a mullet style.
Be sure to tell everyone that your hairstyle is “business in the front” and “a party in the back.”

, Whether your hair is straight or curly, a side ponytail is a classic 80s hairstyle. Bigger is always better, so if you can curl or tease your hair before putting it into a side ponytail, it will look even more authentic.

Cut the fingers out of gloves.,
Wear big earrings.,
Find chunky necklaces.,
Wear big sunglasses.,
Apply 80s makeup styles.,
Wear a sweat band.",How to Dress for an 80s Party4," Fingerless gloves were very popular, especially when paired with a more punk look with denim and lace.Lace gloves are preferable, but any gloves will work.

, The earrings do not have to match each other. Wearing two different large earrings—for a man or a woman—was quite popular.If they are a bright color that either matches or contrasts your outfit, even better! If no chunky colorful or feather earrings are available, gold hoop earrings will work.

, Repeat. Layering on many different chunky necklaces will help create a punk 80s look. Thick chains or beads were popular, and the inclusion of a crucifix was common as well. The more necklaces, the better. You may also want to layer on several different types of bangle and chunky bracelets in contrasting metals.

, Large sunglasses with plastic rims were very popular in the decade, even indoors or at night. Cheap children’s sunglasses with bright earpieces are very similar to popular 80s sunglasses. Gold-rimmed glasses were also popular and can often be found at party stores., Classic 80s makeup included dark lipstick (for women and for punk men!) and very bright eye shadow.The eye shadow can be applied over the entire lid of the eye, to the eyebrows. Some 80s celebrities experimented with multiple eye shadow colors at one time, making two to three blocks of color.

, A wide sweatband over your hair (preferably over a mullet) will give you an 80s look. This accessory works best with the 80s workout attire: either a matching velour sweatsuit or leotard/tights/legwarmer combination.

Make use of ceilings, banisters, and fireplace mantles if this is a house party.",How to Decorate for a Party," Whatever the occasion is, you are likely throwing the party for a person or a group of people. Are they children? Adults? Are they close friends, fellow classmates, or co-workers? Knowing who your guests will be will give you a better idea as to what sorts of themes, colors, and decorations you should use. For example:


If your guests are mostly children, you'd want to use lots of bright colors, balloons, and streamers.
If your guests are older, you might want to limit the colors and use simpler decorations for something more elegant and/or sophisticated.
Is this a dinner party? If so, you'd want to focus more on the table itself, as this is where your guests will spend most of their time. Get some nice plates, napkins, tablecloths, centerpieces, and so forth. Focus less on extras, such as balloons and paper cutouts.;
, This will also help you decide what sorts of colors and decorations to use. It will help make the party more personal and special. For example:


If it is baby shower, consider whether it is going to be a boy or girl. Use lots of blues for boys, and lots of pinks for girls.
If it is a birthday or Quinceanera, use the birthday girl's favorite colors. Try to stick with one main color, and white as a secondary color.
If it is graduation party, consider using the school's colors.
If it is for a holiday (New Year's, Halloween, Christmas, etc), use colors associated with that holiday. For example, if it is a Halloween party, you might want to use orange and black. If it is a more formal Halloween party, use white and black.
If it is a wedding party, consider the wedding's theme colors. These will usually match the cake, wedding bouquet, and the bridesmaids' dresses.

, The theme will be most likely something that the person(s) you are throwing the party for is interested in. If you don't know what the person is interested in, then choose something that is currently popular (such as rustic, vintage, or antique). Here are some ideas to get you started:


Consider the person's interests. Do they like fish? Monsters? Ponies? Choose decorations that match these interests.
Do you and your friends have a favorite book or movie? Base your party off of that. If the book or movie is new, you might find the right decorations in your local party shop.
Try other general themes, such as rustic (lots of burlap and galvanized steel) or antique (lots of lace).
Take your guests away to another time and/or place. Try a Tiki, Luau, or Paris themed party. You can also try another time era, such as the 1920s, 1950s, or the 1970s.

, Take a look at the calendar, and note any upcoming holidays. If you feel that the holiday might get in the way of your party, then take note of the season: fall, winter, spring, or summer.


If your employee-appreciation party is set during October, you might want to give it a fall or Halloween theme. Use lots of orange, pumpkins, and bats for your decorations.
If your birthday is set during December, you might want to stay away from a Christmas theme, but you could consider a winter theme. Use lots of blues, whites, silvers, and snowflakes for your decorations.

, If you have a large budget, you can get elaborate with your decorations. If you have a very tight budget, however, you may have to use simpler decorations, or make your own.


Store-bought party decorations can get expensive. You can save lots of money by making your own banners, pennants, and centerpieces.

, Are you hosting the party in the classroom, office, or at home? Is it going to be in a restaurant or rented party room? Depending on where you host the party, you may have to limit your decorations. Some places, such as offices ad restaurants, simply don't have the space. Other places, such as rented party rooms, may have specific guidelines that you must follow.


If your space is small, focus on simpler decorations, such as balloons, paper cutouts, napkins, and paper plats.

, If you want to have a tropical-themed party in a few hours, and you will be the only one setting the party up, a full-blown Tiki bar and hula stage may be a little bit too much for you to handle. Remember, it is always better to start with fewer decorations, and add more if you have extra time, than to start with too much and end up not finishing.

, After the party is over and your guests go home, you will likely be exhausted. Cleaning up would be the last thing on your mind. If you are a person who does not like to clean or take down decorations, you might want to go for something simple—such as a few balloons or a centerpiece—as opposed to something that will take ages to take down—such has streamers, cutouts, banners, etc.

, These are the most popular decorations, but sometimes, they just don't fit the occasion, theme, or budget.

, Attach them to your wall using tacks, clear tape, or poster putty. Try placing the shapes at a slight angle, instead of straight up-and-down. This will make them appear more ""active"" and interesting. They are ideal for holiday-based parties, such as Valentine's Day and Halloween. They are also great for classrooms and offices because they don't take up much space.

, Choose a solid-colored table cloth, and cover it with a patterned table runner. If you don't have a table runner, scatter some confetti down the middle of the table, or use wrapping paper.Finish off by placing a pretty floral arrangement in the middle of the table.


The centerpiece doesn't have to be flowers. For example, if it's a Halloween party, you could use a jack-o-lantern or a creepy candelabra as the centerpiece.
Avoid scattering the confetti too close to the sides, where people will sit.
Add some light with pillar candles. Arrange your candles in groups of three, and use varying heights. This will make the table look more interesting., Use tacks or clear tape to hold them up. You can also make a simple ""streamer"" curtain for your doorway:


Cut several long strips of streamers.
Tape them in a row above your door.
Gather half of them by the middle, and tape them to the left side of the door.
Gather the rest, and tape them to the right side of the door.
Cover the tape with big ribbon bows.

, Choose balloons that match the color and theme of your party. For example, if this is a Halloween party, choose black and orange balloons. Blow them up with air or helium, and hang them around the room. Focus on the corners and tables.


Fill clear balloons with colorful confetti for a pop of color.If you have a helium tank, tie streamers to the ends of balloons instead of ribbons.If you don't have a helium tank, tie ribbon to the balloons, and tape the ends of the ribbon to your ceiling. The balloons will hang down above your guests., If you can, try and match them to your theme and color scheme. Even if you don't have many decorations, they can really take your party to the next level. They are great options for those on a minimal budget.


For a rustic theme, consider serving drinks in mason jars.
For an elegant theme, choose gold or silver colored plates (they can be plastic).
If you have a tight budget, get plain white napkins, and present them in colorful mason jars.
Instead of using plain straws, try paper straws, or straws with funky decorations on them.

, If your guests are allowed to go to other parts of your house, you will need to make sure that everything looks festive. This will help extend that party beyond the living/dining room where most of the guests linger.


Drape garlands across fireplace mantles.
Tape streamers and balloons to ceilings.
Wrap garlands around banisters.

Drink tea or hot water in the morning.,
Hydrate with lemon or cucumber water.,
Go for oatmeal and other light breakfast options.,
Plan light, nutrient-rich meals.",How to Detox After a Holiday Party1," The morning after your holiday party, start your day with an eight ounce mug of any kind of tea. Alternatively, try hot water with lemon and a dash of cayenne pepper.The hot tea or water with lemon and pepper will help settle your stomach and provide antioxidants. That way, you’ll start your day with a source of hydration that will also help reduce inflammation and bloating.;
, Drink as much water was possible throughout the day after your holiday fun to help your kidneys and liver flush your body. Try to drink around 64 to 100 fluid ounces per day for the week following the party. Add slices of lemon or cucumber to your water to continue rehydrating while providing your body with antioxidants.You’ll definitely want to hydrate with water, fruit juices, or juiced veggies, but do remember that detoxing doesn’t mean cutting out food and nutrients. You’ll need a well-balanced diet and regular meals in the days after a holiday binge to help get your body back in its groove., You’ll want a good source of fiber that’s light on your stomach to get your digestion back in order. Make a bowl of plain oatmeal, and add a dash of cinnamon and vanilla for flavoring. Stir in dried cranberries for additional nutritional value.If you don’t like oatmeal, consider eating a cup of light Greek yogurt. Try topping it with chopped almonds or pistachios.

, If you’re feeling rough the morning after a holiday party, you can get through the day on lots of water, a light breakfast, and healthy snacks like fruits or veggies. However, going more than a day without regular meals will affect your metabolism. Plan healthy, detox-friendly meals and be sure to eat three times regularly after too much holiday fun.For example, make a lunch like a garden salad topped with avocado slices and a lemon juice and olive oil dressing. Then for dinner, have salmon with steamed broccoli.
For the next few days, keep up with light, fiber-rich breakfasts while splitting your lunch and dinner calorie intake between proteins and veggies.

Get your sleep cycle back on track.,
Do stretches and light aerobic exercises.,
Take epsom salt baths.",How to Detox After a Holiday Party2," Do your best to get at least seven or eight hours of sleep for the week after your big holiday party. Go to bed and wake up at consistent times. If you stayed up too late making merry, you might find that both your quality of sleep and regular sleep cycle have taken serious blows.Sleep and rest will help your body devote energy to the organs and glands responsible for detoxing.
Getting the right amount of sleep will also help get rid of those dark circles under the eyes that always seem to appear the morning after a big party.

, While you certainly want to get your beauty sleep, exercising will help your skin and muscles sweat out your holiday indulgences. Stretch out your muscles, hop on a treadmill, or go on a brisk jog around the neighborhood.Make sure you don’t overdo it. No need to get into heavy lifting or sprinting - stick to stretching and cardio.

, Round up your rest and relaxation routine with a nice hot bath. Add a cup of epsom salts and a couple tablespoons of an essential oil, like lavender or rosemary. In addition to soothing you and helping you relax, the salt and oil will help pull toxins out of your skin.If you think you might be allergic or sensitive to any oils, it’s a good idea to test it out by dabbing a tiny amount on your forearm beforehand. If any redness or swelling occurs, don’t put it in the tub!

Know your alcohol limits.,
Eat a small, healthy meal before heading to holiday parties.,
Increase the amount you exercise before the holidays.,
Choose your cheats wisely.",How to Detox After a Holiday Party3," If you overdid it during the last holiday, think about how much you drank. Don’t try to break the record, but instead do your best to scale back so that you won’t be feeling rough the next day or two. When you’re drinking and start to feel pretty good, it’s time to switch to water, not pound shots.


If you’re worried about looking like a party pooper, there are plenty of ways to look like you’re drinking without actually consuming alcohol. For example, grab a cranberry juice or sparkling water over ice and add a lime wedge. You could also consider volunteering to be the designated driver.
Remember, never be self-conscious about obeying your limits or turning down a drink. It’s a sign that you’re resolute, and your body will thank you the next day!

, If overeating is your vice of choice, avoid going to parties on an empty stomach. Have a great garden salad, brown rice and grilled fish, or whole wheat pasta with a lean ground turkey sauce.If you’re on a specific diet, make yourself a small meal in accordance with your diet so you’ll be less likely to dig into the party’s treats.
In addition, drink a couple glasses of water beforehand so you’ll be less likely to be hungry.

, A 2016 study sponsored by the American Physiological Society showed that increasing exercise the week prior to overeating can reduce inflammation and increase metabolism. That means exercising more in advance will help your body deal with all the extra fats and calories that come with holiday overindulgence, which will help avoid the need for a detox.However, this and other studies also suggest that even a brief period of overeating can affect how your body metabolizes food.  

, Don’t get down on yourself if you sneak some cheat foods or have an extra drink. However, try to plan ahead and give yourself permission to indulge in something you’d really appreciate.For example, if you set reasonable expectations for yourself, you’ll be more likely to stick to them. Say to yourself “It would be best if I didn’t have any dessert, but having a small slice of Aunt Sue’s apple pie would be much better than going for grandma’s glazed sugar cookies. I know I love apple pie, and I can definitely stop after one slice. But I’ll just keep going in for cookie after cookie if I get started with those!”
The same goes for alcohol: think about your personal preferences. For instance, you might be more likely to drink two beers and stop, but if you drink wine you could end up going for the whole bottle.

Set out candles.",How to Decorate a Buffet Table," Your table will be much more cohesive if there is a theme to your decorations. The theme can be either a color or an event, such as a birthday, a season, or a specific holiday. If the theme is a color instead of an event, limit yourself to 2-3 colors that go well together.If the theme is a holiday, choose colors that correspond with that holiday. For example, if it is a Christmas buffet, use decorations that are red, green, and gold.;
, Create a centerpiece that incorporates your theme using fruit, flowers, props, or candles. You can then choose items that hint at that theme for the rest of the table, such as edible garnish, flowers, fruit, leaves, or cinnamon sticks.


Some other ideas for table decorations, depending on your theme, are ribbons or seashells., You want the decorations to be classy, not gaudy or overwhelming. Ideally, the food will be on display and any décor around the table will enhance the look of the food, not hide it or overwhelm it.


Also, avoid sprinkling the table with glitter or other non-edible decorations, as these often end up on people's plates or in their mouths.

, Choose either a tablecloth or a table runner to place beneath the food on the buffet table. Napkins are a must as well. Placemats are optional, but can be a nice touch to have beneath your serving dishes. When choosing these items, be sure that they are within your color scheme and that they go well with one another.


Consider oversized cloth napkins in colors that match your theme. For a more casual buffet, paper napkins are just fine. No matter what, supply plenty of spare napkins in case of a mess.Table runners should hang about 6 inches (15 cm) down the table on both sides.

, Make labels for each dish that you will have on the table. Use cardstock or paper folded in half, with the name of the dish written on one side. Write or type in a bold, clear font that is large enough for any guest to read.


Write whether a dish is vegetarian, vegan, or gluten free on the label, beneath the name of the dish.

, For an extra touch, you can create a menu of all the different foods that will be served. Display the menu either using a small menu easel on the table or a stand beside the beginning of the table. That way, guests will know what they will find further down the table and can make more informed food choices., This will prevent you from wasting time rearranging it. Decide which decorations you want to use, where they will go, and what direction you want the guests to follow.

, Imagine yourself starting at the beginning of the table, picking up a plate, dishing up an appetizer and a salad, and then moving down to the main course dish. Think about the order that you would eat a meal in, and arrange the food dishes in that order.

, It needs to be visible, but not in people’s way. If you have a lot of guests and your room is large, set the table away from any walls so that your guests have access to the table from both sides. If the room is smaller, place the table against a wall, out of the way. If possible, leave space for people to stand on either end of the table to avoid too much crowding in the front.

, Either of these will create a lovely base for the buffet table, and can mask a table that you may not want to be shown. If you use a table runner, position it in the center of the table and make sure that it runs the full length of the table., Plates are the first thing your guests will need, so they should be at the beginning of the table. Set out more plates than you think you’ll need, since guests often take a new plate each time that they return to the table.

, Having the utensils at the end of the table relieves people from having to hold them while trying to hold their plate and serve themselves food. With only two hands, that can be a difficult task! You can also have utensils at both the beginning and the end of the table, if you would prefer.


Provide all of the utensils that will be needed for the food you’re serving. For example, don’t forget the soup spoons if you’re serving soup!

, Wrapping the utensils can make it easier for your guests to grab the whole bundle at once, instead of having to pick up each utensil individually.

, Since hungry people can be very eager to get what they need and sit down, it is best to have multiple stacks of plates, cups, utensils, and napkins. That way, many people can grab one at the same time without needing to wait in a line or push into each other., This step is often missed but is very important. If a guest needs to grab another napkin or adjust something, you want them to have space to set their plate down for a moment. When arranging your table, try to leave small pockets of space where a plate could fit.

, This will help you to visualize the end result and see if anything needs to be adjusted. Make sure that the table isn’t too crowded, and that your decorations aren’t going to block any food. Do a trial walk down the buffet table as well, pretending to serve yourself. Make sure that everything is placed logically and within reach.


At this stage, adjust anything that needs to be fixed and remove any decorations that are cumbersome or unattractive.

, Adding height to some dishes is aesthetically appealing and adds life to your table. You can easily elevate areas by covering secure objects such as boxes and upside down containers with cloth. Just don't exaggerate the elevation, as this not only looks chaotic, but it can be dangerous. You table should have subtle rises and dips.


Place all the serving dishes that will be used on the table as you decorate. This will help to ensure that you have enough space for everything that needs to be on the table.

, Now that your dishes are placed, go ahead and fill in the spaces with the decorations that you've chosen. Be mindful of not placing items in front of food dishes, or in areas where they will get knocked over by elbows. Try placing larger items at the back of the table, and smaller items between dishes and around the edges of the table.

, Candles are a wonderful decoration for any buffet table. Consider placing tall candles at the back of the table if the table is against the wall, so that they will not get knocked over. Otherwise, you can decorate small jars with candles inside and place them around the table. If having flames seems dangerous for your event, consider using flickering electric candles."
"
Get the party under control.,
Open the door, step outside, and close it behind you.The conversation with the police should take place outside.,
Politely ask the police why they are there.,
Remain calm and respectful while addressing their concerns.,
Assert your right not to allow them to enter your home.,
If the officers insist that you must comply, let them inside.,
Keep the party under control once the police leave.",How to Deal With the Police when They Come to Your Door at a Party," When you hear that knock, which is likely the result of a noise complaint filed by your neighbors, your first step should be to turn off the music. If there's another source of noise - say, party revelers laughing and screaming - alert them to the situation and tell them to quiet down.


Do this quickly, but calmly. Don't yell at your guests; this will make the situation seem fishy, and possibly arouse the police officers' suspicion that something illegal is taking place.
If illegal things are taking place, move them out of view of the front door immediately. Intoxicated party guests should go to another room.;
, They are not allowed to enter the home unless they have a search or arrest warrant, they have reason to believe there's an emergency inside, or you invite them in.By stepping outside and closing the door, you make it clear that you have not granted them permission to enter your home.
Note that local laws regarding the rights of police vary. Be aware of their rights in your particular situation.
You might want to bring a friend outside with you, to serve as a witness for whatever goes down.

, Your tone with them should be conversational, but not overly friendly or casual. You are not required to speak to the police, but it can help defuse the situation if you're straightforward and easygoing about their visit., If they mention that neighbors complained your party was getting out of control, assure them that you will see to it that the problem is addressed. If this is the first time that evening that they have received this complaint, it is unlikely that they will be obliged to take further action, such as issuing a citation.


Avoid giving the police unnecessary details when answering questions. Say no more than you need to when you're discussing the situation.
Do not lie to the police. If they ask you a question you're not comfortable answering, especially if it may get you in legal trouble, politely say that you decline to answer.In most states you are not required to show your ID to the police unless you're driving or being arrested. However, if the police ask for your ID and you feel comfortable showing it, there's no harm in making the process go more smoothly by handing it over.
If you admit to any controlled substances being used other than alcohol, that may be enough probable cause for the cops to obtain a search warrant.

, In some cases the police may say they'd like to step inside and take a look around. They do not have the right to do this without your consent. State clearly and politely, ""With all due respect, I do not consent to having you enter my home.""If they ask ""Why not?"" then reply by saying that ""I can't let you inside without a warrant"". This politely but firmly demonstrates that you know and exercise your right to privacy inside your home.
If you are uncertain about whether the police are giving you an order or making a request, ask them if you have to comply.
If you are not obliged to comply, do not give verbal or written consent to let the police come in your house. Once you give them permission, they are allowed to thoroughly search the premises.

, If you don't comply with the order you risk getting arrested and/or entry being gained by force. By opening the door you're giving implied consent for them to enter, but in the end it's better to have your privacy invaded for half an hour than to be arrested and put in a cell overnight.

Do not admit to anything that would incriminate you. You have the right to remain silent; you should comply with the officer's request, but know when to stop talking.
Never raise your voice or get belligerent with a police officer. This will certainly make things worse.
If the police find illegal substances, know your rights. Tell them you want to speak to a lawyer.

, Send people home if you have to. The police are far less likely to be understanding if they are asked to come back a second time. If that happens, you can expect to get ticketed, if not arrested. They may even come back with a warrant in hand and some backup to raid the house. Don't risk it.

Make an effort to learn names.,
Exercise good manners at all times.,
Don’t get too drunk.,

Don't get caught.,
Offer to return the favor.",How to Crash a Party," At a bare minimum you should make yourself clean and presentable. The next step is to wear the appropriate party attire, so that you look the part and don't draw attention to yourself. Everyone appreciates a well-dressed party guest, but appropriate attire will depend on the type of party you are trying to crash.


If it’s a house party, go for smart casual.
If it’s a formal event, black tie is appropriate. A dark suit for men and dress for women. Black is always a good look and will help you to blend in.If it’s a fancy dress party, you’ll want to figure out the theme and try to wear an acceptable costume.;
, Alcohol is always appreciated at a house party, and a bottle of wine is a standard choice. Bringing something to offer around will ensure that you are a welcome addition to the party.

, It's a good idea to find out what kind of party you are trying to crash. For example, is it a formal event? Is it a birthday party?


Ask other guests about the event, particularly those standing around and chatting outside the venue.
Pay attention to the decor as this can give you vital clues. Are there any signs giving information about the event? Or balloons and a birthday cake?

, This is key to getting into the party, you have to act as if you belong there. If you have nerves about getting in, do your best to hide them. Appearing hesitant can mark you out as a crasher.Walk in with confident body language and a smile.

, You want to arrive at the party when it’s in full swing. Don’t go too early or too late as things are winding down. Arriving at the peak of the party means you are less likely to be noticed as an uninvited guest., This can be a useful way of getting inside the party. Join a big group as the enter and you might be able to slip in without attracting attention., This is particularly useful if you are trying to crash a more formal party or an organized event.


Try the back door, which may not be manned by security or the person with the guest list.
You may have to go through the kitchen, so make sure you are polite to the kitchen staff but don't linger, walk through quickly and with purpose.

, Some parties, like those held at conferences or business events, require all guests to wear badges. Here are a few ways you can get hold of a badge.


Ask a friend if you can borrow their badge. If you already know someone attending, this is a great way to get in. Even better, make a new friend and they may give you theirs!
Ask someone who is leaving to give you their badge. Don't begin by asking for their badge, engage them in conversation first. Perhaps start by asking if they enjoyed the event. Eventually, work your way up to asking if they would give you their badge, you can say you misplaced your own.Check the trash can. Often as people leave events they throw away their badge. Look in the floor, and, if you are really keen, the trash can, for any discarded badges.

, This applies particularly to house parties. If there is a crowd gathered outside, strike up a conversation with the friendliest looking person and ask them how they know the host. Once you know the host’s name you can use this to get into the party.

, Be mindful that you are an uninvited guest, possibly in someone's home, so show respect to the host and don’t be obnoxious to other guests.

, No one wants to look after a messy drunk. Drink responsibly and stop drinking or leave when you feel like you have had too much. Make sure you get home safely. Don’t drive and don't allow your friends to drive home drunk, call a cab if necessary.

, Once you’re inside the party, don’t just be a wallflower. Try to make friends and strike up conversations with other guests.


If you see a group of interesting looking people, go up to them and introduce yourself.
Don’t be obnoxious and interrupt. Wait for the most opportune moment in the conversation to say your piece.

, If you follow all of the steps outlined above, you should have a good chance of enjoying the party without being caught out. However, if you are caught out, it might be time to confess your true identity. If you've been a charming guest who has contributed to the party atmosphere, it's unlikely you'll be asked to leave.


Express your gratitude, remark on the excellent party the host has put on and tell them how much you are enjoying yourself.
Remember, if the host tells you to leave, then it's time to leave.

, Ideally you will have a wonderful night of party-crashing and you'll make many new friends. Get their contact details and return the favor by organizing your own party and inviting all the new people you've met.

Decide what type of balloons will best suit the occasion.,
Consider how you’d like to decorate with balloons.,
Assess the party room to help you with your balloon design.",How to Create Unique Party Balloon Decorations1," For some occasions a regular latex balloon that you and your friends blow up at home will suffice. For other parties you may want helium or even Mylar balloons.


Your party type should dictate what type of balloon size you will need as well. You could also use a few larger balloons surrounded by smaller balloons for interest.;
, Will you need to glitter or draw on the balloons or will you add props like hats or faces to your balloons.


Assemble supplies based on your party. That means picking up glue, glitter or any other accessories you required to decorate your balloon.
Decide on how you will anchor or hold your balloons. This includes using ribbon, sticks or adhering the balloon directly to a piece of furniture or the wall. You may also partner the balloons with a flower arrangement too so plan accordingly. Having access to a clear tape dispenser would be a good idea.

, Especially if you plan to hold your party outside, you may want to take weather conditions into consideration (such as wind and/or rain).

, Consider using acrylic paint pens instead of the paint and brushes for a more precise design.

, For example, if you are painting stars on the balloons you could place the template on top of the balloon and then paint within the template.

, Helium or blown up balloons will work for this project. Be sure you secure the ends by either tying a knot or using a clamp.

, Hold the balloon in your hand or secure it in an area so the balloon doesn’t float around while you are working on it.

, Read manufacturer instructions for dry time for best results.

",How to Create Unique Party Balloon Decorations3," Look for a smaller arrangement that sits neatly in a basket or small box. You will be transforming the arrangement into a hot air balloon in a basket so you want the basket of flowers to be smaller than the balloon you use.

, You want balloons that are larger than your flower arrangement and can be blown up with helium. Both Mylar and latex balloons will work well. You will want to use one balloon per arrangement.

, You will need ribbon or string to create the hot air balloon effect, plus glue to hold it in place. Regular white glue should do the trick.

, Tie and knot the bottom or clamp in place.

, You will want ribbon to reach from one corner of the arrangement to the opposite corner and over the balloon. You will need approximately two pieces of string.

Select plywood.,
Get a polyurethane sealant.,
Set up a space to seal the boards outside.,
Follow the specific directions on the sealant.,
Get two pieces of 4x8 ft (1.2x2.4 m) plywood.,
Determine which sides will be your dance surface.,
Attach the plywood sheets to one another with a hinge.,
Consider adding rounded trim.,
Cut the trim to meet at the corners.,
Glue the trim to the dance floor.,
Nail the trim down.",How to Build a Dance Floor1," Plywood comes in several different types of wood and thicknesses. The type of wood does not matter too much. A ¾ in (2 cm) thickness is ideal, especially if you live in a apartment and there are folks who live beneath you. If noise is not an issue, ½ in (1.3 cm) thick plywood will work.Plywood usually comes in 4x8 ft (1.2x2.4 m) boards. Two of these boards positioned side-by-side is usually ideal for a home dance floor.;
, Sealing your dance floor will help make it much more resilient and help it last longer. You’ll apply sealant to the wood you’re using for the dance floor's surface before assembling the dance floor. Sealants are available at the hardware store or online., The easiest option is laying the boards down flat on a tarp. If you have a couple saw horses, you can also position the board on the saw horses with a tarp on the ground to catch any dripping sealant. , Most likely, you will be directed to sand the board, clean it with mineral spirits, apply a coat of the sealant with a brush, allow it to dry, and do it all again. Be sure to follow the directions of your sealant closely, as they will help ensure a good, smooth seal.Apply three or four coats and sand the surface before each coat.
Once a coat has dried, walk around the board and look at from several angles. Pay extra attention to any patches that aren’t shiny when applying the next layer.

, When assembled side by side, two sheets of plywood will make the perfect sized dance floor for home use in a carpeted room. If you want the dance floor to be lighter and a bit easier to move, have the hardware store cut each sheet down to 3.5x8 ft (1x2.4 m)., Before fastening the boards to one another, inspect each side of your plywood boards. Position the boards on the floor with the side that will be the dancing surface facing down. The sides of the boards facing up will be the bottom of your dance floor, which will allow you to attach a hinge and fasten the two boards together.When positioned snugly side by side, the boards will make an 8x8 ft (2.4x2.4 m) dance floor.

, Including a hinge on your dance floor will keep each half together and will make the floor easy to move and store. A five or six foot piano hinge is ideal, but you can also use multiple smaller hinges instead.Use wood screws to fasten the hinges to the sheets of plywood. Make sure the screws are shorter than the thickness of the plywood.
Position the hinges so that the boards rest snugly side by side when the hinges are open.

, Rounded trim on the edges of your dance floor will improve its appearance, reduce stubbed toes, and allow you to more comfortably step on the edge of the floor. When selecting pieces of trim, make sure individual pieces are slightly longer than the sides of the floor, and that they are the same thickness as the plywood you used., In order for the pieces of trim to meet snugly at the corners of your dance floor, they need to be cut at 45-degree angles. Take care to account for this angle when measuring your piece. For instance, for a 8 ft (2.4 m) side of the dance floor, you’ll need a piece of trim that’s 8 ft (2.4 m) long not including the angled portion of the trim.If you’re using ½ in (1.3 cm) plywood and ½ in (1.3 cm) rounded trim, the outside edge of the trim (which will include the angled portion) will be 8 ft (2.4 m) and 1 in (2.5 cm) long.
Note that you’ll need to cut the trim in half on the sides that have the split to allow the dance floor to fold.

, Use wood glue to fasten the trim to the edges of the dance floor. Make sure you’re putting the halved pieces of trim on the right sides of the floor., Once the glue has dried, hammer finishing nails into the trim about a foot apart. Make sure to position the nails to angle slightly downwards, so they don’t angle up and penetrate the surface of the dance floor.Don’t skip the nailing step. Even if the trim seems extremely well-attached after the glue has dried, it will eventually come off if you don’t nail it down.

Get a shock absorbing subfloor.,
Try foam mats with a stiff middle layer of flooring.,
Buy pre-built sprung floor panels.,
Select a dance surface to top your subflooring.",How to Build a Dance Floor2," If you’re hoping to install a dance floor on a hard surface, such as concrete, the dance floor will need to be “sprung” or otherwise cushioned for comfort and safety. There are many ways to do so for professional floors. The easiest option for a home dance floor employs a layer of dense foam that is often referred to as “closed-cell” subflooring.There are lots of options even within closed-cell foam subflooring. The foam can be purchased in individual, connectable squares, or in a roll. Contact your local hardware store or look for dance floor subflooring online.

, Some flooring companies provide especially easy-to-install materials that are designed for use in cushioned dance floors. Look online for close-cell foam subflooring and clip-together athletic tiles that provides a middle layer between the foam and whatever dance surface you finish your dance floor with.The cost of both of these layers together comes up to about $5/sqft (roughly $15/sq meter).

, You can by panels of “sprung” flooring, such as that found in high-tier dance studios and performance halls, that can be attached together and covered with a dance flooring surface. They are easily assembled and can be taken apart and moved. This is an especially convenient route if you plan to build a commercial dance floor yourself., Subflooring simply provides the cushioning necessary to absorb the impact from dancers, provide elasticity, and prevent injuries. However, you still need a layer of dance flooring to go on top of the subflooring. Depending on the type of subflooring you use, you may also need a stiff middle layer in between.


There are plenty of different dance flooring materials to choose from, such as Marley flooring. Most will be a thin, durable material similar to that of a yoga mat.
This top layer usually costs $2-4 per sqft (0.2-0.4 meters squared).

Meet up with someone before the party and go together.,
Take notice of who is at the party.,
Find an outgoing person.",How to Be the Life of a High School Party1," There are multiple benefits to going to a party with someone rather than on your own. It will give you the added confidence when you first walk in because you will know someone else is just getting there too. Plus, as you start up conversations and meet new people, you will have an extra voice to keep things going.Make plans ahead of time regarding whether you will stay together the whole time or if you plan to split off. Having a friend can be a great way to get started at the party, but you may not want to be stuck together the whole time. Plus you will avoid hurting each other’s feelings if you decide ahead of time that it’s okay to separate while you are there.
You will also want to make sure of the plan on when you will leave and if you’ll go together or not. Keep in contact so you know if the other person is ready to go.;
, If the party is more than a small group of close friends, you will likely find a wide range of people from different grades and social cliques. When you first get to the party, take a few minutes to really scan the room and see who is around. Finding someone you know can be a good place to start, rather than being stuck somewhere alone.Catch the eyes of a couple of different people when you first arrive. Smile and wave at them. Give them a gesture that says, “I’ll come talk to you soon.” Establishing a couple different people you want to talk to can make it easier than waiting around for people to come to you.
Parties are also a great place to meet some new people or make connections with people you rarely see or talk to. Think of the person you have multiple classes with but you never get much of a chance to spend time with. Parties are the perfect place to have a first conversation that can lead to friendship down the road.
It is also always good to find the host quickly, since they are most likely the reason you are there. Tell them thanks for the invite or mention what a great party it is. You can also ask them if they need help with anything.

, You may know someone who has a reputation already for being the life of the party, so go find them and watch what they do. You can learn a lot from their actions and begin to apply those in your own way. It can also be helpful to start up a conversation with them or get involved in what they are doing. They can help you meet more people and get into the center of the party.If you don’t have much party experience, you can be honest with this person and ask them to help you get the most out of it. Ask them if they can introduce you to some people or maybe show you around the party. It’s okay to let people know you are new to the party scene.
Once this person has shown you around a little and you get more comfortable, you can then use what they have given you and start to become the person who helps others get used to it. Seek out people who are on their own and pass on the favor of getting them into the mix of meeting people and mingling.

Smile as much as possible.,
Tell a joke.,
Try to dress well.,
Clean yourself up before any party.,
Keep moving.,
Go up to people and chat.,
Keep the conversation interesting.,
Remember people's names when you are introduced.,
Don't drink too much.,
If you feel a bit shy about starting up a conversation, try some of these ""tricks"" to get the talking started:


If you have another friend there, or somebody you recognize, they should be able to introduce you.",How to Be Fun at Parties," Smiling is attractive and causes other people around you to smile too. Most of all, smiling encourages others to see you as approachable, making them willing to talk to you.;
, Go ahead and be a comedian and tell a couple of jokes. Everyone loves a funny person, it will get you to open up and let people see your vibrant personality.

, To be honest, everyone knows what looks good on them and what doesn't, so you should already have a good enough wardrobe. Confidence is the key!

, Keep clean and smell nice, so maybe invest in some aftershave or just get some good smelling deodorant. Put enough on to make you smell nice and cover the sweat prone areas (armpits). Don't douse yourself, otherwise you will repel instead of attract!

, Be a social butterfly and try not to get sucked into long and involved conversations (unless that's what you want). You'll create more fun at the party by talking to more people.

, If they come to you, fair enough, but try to ""mingle"". It's really easy once you've got it and it's a great way to meet new people.

, Unless it's been really unusual, don't talk about the weather. An easy way to start a conversation is to compliment a part of someone's outfit. If they want to talk, they'll tell you about it. It can be an opportunity to flirt as well. Be natural and easy-going. No one likes forced conversation.

, There are tricks for this. Every one is flattered when you know their name because it makes them feel special and wanted.

, Everyone will remember you, but maybe not in a good way. Alcohol may be the ultimate social lubricant, but it can really hold you back, too.

,
Pretend to drop your phone near someone. As you either get down to retrieve it, or they do, apologize for being a bother but then start a conversation.
Ask someone if they have change for a note. This can be helpful for an initial exchange but you'll need something more interesting to keep the conversation flowing.
Pretend to ask somebody if they're a certain person, for example, ""Joshua Holmes"" or another name. This is a great way to start conversation but have a quick save to reply with when the person says no.

"
"
Focus on the moment at hand.,
Put your phone away.,
Help the host or hostess.,
Interact with more people by moving around.,
Initiate a fun activity.,
Put yourself out there and be part of the party.",How to Be the Life of a High School Party2," At large parties with a lot going on, it can get overwhelming and your natural reaction might be to space out. Trying to pay attention to everything means paying attention to nothing. Actively fight this tendency. Be in the moment you are in, and find a way to shut out all the other people besides the ones you are specifically with.If you go through the whole party trying to focus on everything that is going on, you won’t actually experience any of it directly. Allow yourself to forget about all the extra stuff that’s around you and enjoy the thing you are currently doing.
Once you find someone and are hanging out with them, don’t look around the rest of the room to see what everyone else is doing. Pay attention to only what you are doing, at least for a while.

, It’s a good idea to have your phone, and you can even check it periodically, but don’t spend the whole night looking at the screen. You can watch your phone sitting at home alone, but you don’t always get to be out with people doing stuff. Rather than thinking of all the other stuff you could be doing, enjoy the party you are at.


Plus, if the party is rowdy at all, there’s always the chance you could lose or break your phone and you don’t want to do that.

, With people all over the place and the host or hostess often busy keeping things going, offer to help them out by getting people food, refilling the punch bowl, or keeping tabs on the music situation.


If there is an iPod or something playing, see if you can play DJ for a while and pick the jams for everyone to dance to.

, Bigger parties tend to span across multiple rooms and could even include the porch, patio, or the back yard. Making sure that you move throughout the various spaces of the party will increase the number of people that see you there. This gives you the opportunity to interact with as many people as possible rather than just those in one spot.If you have been in one place for a while, mention that you are going to check out another room or go outside. You can specifically mention someone that you want to go talk to, or you can say you are going for food or a drink. The people who you are talking with will be less likely to think you are just ditching them. They may even think that you are more important because you have other people you plan to see.
It may feel more comfortable to stick with the location and group of people that you already secured, but being the life of the party means being seen by more people. Later on, the guests will most likely not remember the person who sat on the couch the whole time, but they will remember someone who they saw moving throughout the entire party the whole night.

, High school parties can range from everyone kind of standing around trying to figure out what to do, to everyone being really drunk and acting crazy. You have to take stock of which one you are at, but starting something fun can be adapted to either one. You could lead in getting people dancing, get people to jump in the pool, start a game of truth or dare, or form an arm wrestling competition.People want to have fun at parties, and while that may involve just drinking and hanging out, a lot of people also want something active to do. If you start up a fun trend that everyone ends up getting really into, you’ll be looked at as someone who is fun to have around.
This may seem a little risky and it may take a little extra courage, but the payoff of getting people to have more fun can really be worth it.

, The most important thing to remember is that parties are meant to be a fun place to let off some steam and let yourself de-stress. So you don’t want to get so focused on being the life of the party that you end up not having any fun. Be yourself, but push yourself just a little farther than usual.If people are dancing, dance. If there is karaoke going down, hop up on stage. People will probably not remember the party guests who sat on the sofa the whole time, but they will remember those who were involved in the happenings.
Don’t try to be someone that you aren’t, but take the opportunity to step out of your comfort zone. Say yes to things you normally wouldn’t (but still be responsible).

"
Start conversations.,
Talk about something interesting.,
Ask people good questions.,
Listen to people’s answers.,
Take a chance.",How to Be the Life of a High School Party3," This one really depends on what kind of party you are at. If there is loud music and talking is barely an option, you may have to adapt. If it is quiet enough to talk, you can always join conversations that are going, but you should also try starting some with people who aren’t talking. Seek out people who aren’t talking to anyone and start a conversation with them.


You can start with a simple greeting, but add something specific as well. Instead of saying, ""What's up?"" try saying, ""Hey, how long have you been here?"" Or, ""Hey, what have you been doing since you got here?"" Anything that gives the conversation a place to go besides both people saying hello.

, If lots of people are standing around talking, it’s likely that the conversations are pretty basic and may not be more than boring small talk. You can stand out at the party by being someone who keeps conversations interesting and by being the one everyone wants to talk to.Find some common ground and share your thoughts on the topic. Ask them if they are a movie buff, know any obscure facts, or have a talent that most people don't.
If they don't readily have something, offer a story of your own like something unusual that happened on a family vacation. Interesting conversations will involve more than talking about school or just what is happening at the party. Use your imagination to think of topics.

, Find ways to go beyond the small talk level conversations. Don’t be vague, like asking, “How’s it going?” Instead try starting up a conversation by asking something more specific. Some examples would be: “Did you have to lie to your parents to come here?” “Did you see_____(insert something crazy that’s happening at the party)?” “What were you going to do if you didn’t come here tonight?”

, Being great at conversation means listening to what the other person says, not just waiting for your turn to take over and talking non-stop. If you get short answers at first, keep leading the person on and try to get more information out of them. Take their answers and build the conversation off of them rather than steering it in your own direction.

, It may seem risky, but try starting a really deep or totally weird discussion to get people interested and involved. Examples would be asking if people think that dinosaurs still exist somewhere, or if they would ever be willing to colonize another planet. It feels risky to start up a crazy conversation, but the payoff could be having a lot fun talking with people about topics they never thought of.


Ask them, ""If we made some advancements in space travel and found a planet just like earth, would you be willing to go live there?""
Or say something like, ""You know, I've read some news stories fisherman who pull out these fish that no one can identify. Do you think there are still creatures living in the ocean that we don't even know about?"" The possibilities for interesting conversations are endless, but you have to be willing to give it a shot.

Ask yourself a few questions to get your bearings: What is the size of the party/get together.,
Consider bringing some Alcohol: A nice bottle of wine for a holiday party (try ""Layer Cake"") Or beer for a barbecue.,
Bring Flowers: Flowers seem to be something people just don't use anymore.,
Help with the Entertainment: Think appetizer plates, wine cork decorators, cookbooks, napkin rings, glass rings (the kind that people use to tell their drinks apart).,
Bring some nice bon-bons or chocolates.,
If all else fails buy a gift certificate to a local store (like a bookstore or a coffee shop) and fold them into a handwritten thank you note.

",How to Bring a Good Host Gift to a Party," A larger party requires more work and a nicer gift would be in order... Has the host(ess) spent a lot of money or put a ton of work into it? If so maybe you should too... How well do you know the person hosting? Is their something you know they like (golf, games, wine, cooking).;
, Alcohol in any form can get expensive when buying for many people. To provide some for the masses is a gift in itself.

, Pick up some fresh flowers (in or without a vase) and the host(ess) can put them in the middle of their table or to brighten up their room. Always an acceptable gift so long as they are tastefully chosen (don't reflect funerals such as white roses).

, Cocktail napkins.

, Or some gourmet coffee, tea, or even hot chocolate

Don't Skip the Party


Thinking of not attending?,
Do not Forget to Wear Your Smile and Make a Positive Impression


This is the time to make those around you feel comfortable and enjoy getting to know you.,
Remember to leave the Uninvited Guests at home.,
Never Make Assumptions About Who You Are Talking To


Are you certain of this person's position or alliances within the company?,
Remember where you are at.,
Absolutely, do not get Drunk and Tell Your Boss How You REALLY Feel


Cocktails make for loose lips that sink ships!,
Don't Limit Your Conversation to ""Shop Talk""


You approach the Manager of Test, introduce yourself and then, well, what do you say?,
Move around.,
Remember.,
Never Assume People Will Forget Your Blunder


So, you stepped in it.",How to Avoid Holiday Office Party Blunders," Think twice. Your presence is mandatory if you expect to attain or maintain visibility within your organization. If office parties are your idea of a root canal approach the party as a task that you will succeed at making into a worthwhile investment of your time.;
, Appear approachable in your body language with good posture (no slouching!), eye contact and a warm smile. Appear relaxed even if you have to fake it, as no one wants to spend time with someone ill-at-ease or nervous. You participate in activities, devote time to hobbies, maybe you like sports and travel. You might even have attended the same school as someone you work with. This is the time to find out. Anyone will be delighted to learn that members of their team are actually multi-faceted human beings.

,


Get a babysitter! Odds are great that your colleagues do not share in your delight for your children's company. It has become less common to have family members at parties due to budget cuts. Bring your spouse or partner if it is clear that is the expectation. Never make assumptions.

, Probably not, so skip the gossip and negative comments of any kind. Prepare by reviewing a company directory in order know people's names and be ready for introductions

, Don't Wear Your ""Cup Runneth Over"" Cleavage or Your Tattered Harley Davidson T-Shirt.


Despite encouragement from the executive suite that the office holiday party is a great time to ""enjoy"", ""relax"" and ""just have fun,"" odds are that does not mean wear the clothes you are the most relaxed in or have the most fun in, be it skimpy tops, or the jeans you wore to the Blink 182 concert. Imagine how unsettling it is to see extra skin on the boss or cubicle buddy, or what an unprofessional lasting image those jeans left behind. And its an image not quickly forgotten when you are at your next quarterly revenue meeting requesting additional budget increases.

, Watch your intake to insure your mind moves faster than your mouth. Abstinence for this party is a wise and risk free plan.
Anxiety is directly related to increased alcohol intake so if you must imbibe, just take a few sips, or water down your drink so it lasts a lot longer. As friendly as your boss is at the office party this is not the time to ask for a raise, mention a friend who is looking for a job, or offer your opinion about the lousy coffee provided the break room.

, Guess what? He or she is probably is not hoping for an update on the project your team is in the thick of. If you like, you can keep the conversation work-related, just not specific to the current work you are doing: ""Tell me about your career path in human resources..."" or some favorites opening for these occasions: ""What keeps you busy outside of work?"" or ""Tell me about your holiday plans..."". People enjoy talking about themselves, especially when they perceive a genuine interest.

, Don't just Mingle Only With Your Best Office Cronies


It is tempting to remain in your comfort zone, talking with the people you meet regularly within your department or enjoy lunch with a couple times a week. Instead, your company party may be the only time you have all year for a face to face conversation with the CEO. The office party is an opportunity to get to know new people and enjoy the chance for others to get to know you. Invest the effort in making sure the people who should know that you are there, know that you are there. Circle the room and say hello to your boss, her husband and other decision makers and executives. Push yourself and introduce yourself to people you don't know.

, You're not at the local bar.


If the invitation requires an RSVP, promptly respond either way; if the office party is being hosted at a home, bring a host/hostess gift; and even if the party is in a grand ballroom, thank your hosts or boss before you leave. If the boss is accompanied by his or her spouse do not wait to be ""properly introduced"" or you will be taken for a snob. Treat the service people as you would members of your family with graciousness and kindness. And do not be the last to leave a party, you do not want to be remembered as the last person to take leave of the party.

, You insisted that children in private schools gained a far better education. You expressed your disgust with those that purchase foreign cars rather than American made and she's drives a BMW. You shared an anecdote that is inappropriate. Now make amends. Apologize. Let your boss or teammate know what happened before they hear it through the grapevine. Get out in front of the problem. The mistake might not matter as much as how you handle what comes after it, experts say. So deal with it and move on.

Preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C).,
Place the almond pulp into a large mixing bowl.,
Add the oil, ground flax or chia seeds, salt, herbs, and minced garlic.,
Add some water, if needed.,
Roll the dough out between two sheets of parchment paper.,
Score the dough into squares.,
Poke some holes into the center of each cracker with a fork.,
Bake the crackers for 20 minutes.,
Flip the crackers over and bake them for 15 to 20 more minutes.,
Let the crackers cool before you serve them.",How to Make Almond Pulp Crackers1,";
, When you make a batch of almond milk, you will usually end up with about 1 cup (225 grams) of wet almond pulp. What you have leftover is just enough for this recipe.

, Stir everything together with a wooden spoon. You don't have to add the garlic, but it will lend the crackers a nice flavor. If you don't have any fresh herbs, use 2 teaspoons of dried herbs instead.


Great herbs to use include: chives, parsley, and rosemary. You can use just one type, or you can mix-and-match.

, Your pulp might be wet enough to mold. If it feels too dry, stir in some water, 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) at a time. Keep adding water until you can press the dough between your fingers.

, Cover your work surface with a sheet of parchment paper. Place the dough on top, then cover it with more parchment paper. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out until it is ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeters) thick.


You can roll the dough out thinner. The thinner it is, the more crispy your crackers will turn out.

, Peel off the top sheet of parchment paper. Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut the dough into equal-sized squares. You should have enough dough to make about 20 crackers.


Don't worry about cutting the dough all the way through. You want to cut it deep enough so that you can easily break it later on, however.

, This will help the crackers bake more evenly. You can make as many or as few holes as you want. One prick of a fork for each cracker will be enough, however.

, Use the parchment paper to transfer the crackers onto a large baking sheet. Place the baking sheet into the oven. Let the crackers bake for 20 minutes.

, Gently break apart the crackers first. Use a spatula to flip them over. Place them back into the oven for another 15 to 20 minutes. They are ready when they turn golden and crispy.

, If you have any leftovers, store them in the fridge in an airtight container.

Bake the crackers in a pre-heated oven at 375°F (191°C).,
Let the crackers cool before you serve them.",How to Make Almond Pulp Crackers2," Place the almond pulp into a large mixing bowl. Add the rice flour, ground cinnamon, baking powder, and salt. Stir everything together, making sure to break up any large chunks.


You can try using ground flax seed or chia seeds instead of rice flour.

, Continue stirring the mixture until it starts to come together. Don't worry if it looks a little crumbly at this point.


If you are vegan, you can use olive oil, coconut oil, or even vegan/dairy-free butter.
If you are vegan, try agave nectar or maple syrup instead of honey.

, If the mixture is still too dry, stir in some water, 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) at a time until it starts to stick together.

, Place a sheet of parchment paper on your work surface. Set the dough on top, and form it into a disk using your hands. Use a rubber spatula to scrape everything out of the bowl, if needed.

, Loosely wrap the parchment paper around the dough, and secure it with a piece of tape, if needed. Place the wrapped dough into the fridge, and leave it there for 20 to 30 minutes. This allows the dough to firm up and makes it more workable.


Towards the end of the chilling process, preheat your oven to 375°F (191°C).

, Once the dough is firm again, take it out of the fridge and set it down on the counter. Unwrap the dough, and place another sheet of parchment paper on top of it. Use a rolling pin to roll it out flat until it is 1/8-inch (0.32-centimeter) thick.

, Remove the top sheet of parchment paper first. Use a sharp knife or a pizza cutter to slice the dough into squares or rectangles. You should have enough dough to make about 20 crackers.

, This will help make the crackers bake more evenly. You'll need to prick each cracker at least once. Since these crackers taste similar to graham crackers, you can make several rows of holes to make them look more like graham crackers.


For something even more graham cracker like, sprinkle the tops of the crackers with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar.

, Use the parchment paper to transfer the crackers to a baking sheet. Bake them for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until the edges turn golden brown. If you want them to be crispier, you can bake them a little longer.


Turn the pan around about half-way through the baking. This will help the crackers bake more evenly.

, Store any leftover crackers in an airtight container in the fridge.

Use a flax mill.,
Try a coffee grinder.,
Try using a spice mill.,
Use a food processor.,
Use a blender.,
Use a pepper mill.,
Use a mortar and pestle.",How to Grind Flax Seed," A flax mill is a specially designed electric appliance similar to a coffee grinder that is used specifically for grinding flax seed. This is a good option if you want to avoid getting flax seed in your coffee grinder or blender, but it is a bit pricier. Simply plug in the mill, add the amount of seeds you want, and turn it on! If there is confusion about this process, refer to the directions specifically for your mill., This is the best choice for those of us who don’t want to buy an entirely separate appliance for grinding flax seeds, but also want the best results. Coffee grinders are made to thoroughly blend small, oily beans, making them perfect for grinding small, oily flax seeds. Measure out the amount of seeds you want, and pour them into the grinder. Adjust the settings to the finest grind, and then turn it on. It should only take 10-15 seconds to get the seeds refined to a small, evenly ground meal.Be sure to thoroughly clean your coffee grinder before and after use if you also use it for coffee. Otherwise, you run a flavor cross-contamination risk.

, If you’re not afraid of a bit of elbow grease, a spice mill is a great option for grinding flax seed. It is a small appliance with a hand-wound blade/crank mechanism. That means that you are responsible for grinding the seeds, because it is not electric. Pour your flax seeds into the mill, and if you have the option adjust the setting to ‘finely ground’. Then, crank away! It may take a few minutes, but your flax seeds should be ground perfectly.

, Food processors can be used to grind flax seeds, but because of their typically large size it is difficult to grind the seeds very small and takes a long time. Pour your flax seeds into the food processor, and adjust the settings accordingly. Turn it on, and let it go; it may take several minutes to grind the flax seeds completely., Similar to a food processor, using a blender to grind flax seeds is not as effective as using a smaller appliance with a smaller bag. Use the smallest blender you have with a double blade, and pour in the flax seed you need for the day. Turn it on a medium or high speed and allow it to run for several minutes until all the flax seed is ground.

, That’s right; use one of those fancy pepper-grinders you sometimes see in nice restaurants to grind your flax seed. This option is best for grinding only small portions of seeds at a time, as it is a time-consuming process. Fill your pepper mill with flax seed, and then twist the head or crank at the top to grind the seed. The amount you will get out of it is not exact, so refrain from using a pepper mill when you need very specific amounts of flax seeds.

, Go old school and use a very traditional tool, the mortar and pestle, to grind your flax seed. This isn’t the easiest option, but it will give you the best results. Pour your flaxseeds into the mortar, and use a combination of bashing and muddling to grind them finely. Bashing involves hitting the seeds with the pestle to break them down, while muddling is the process of grinding them finer and finer by moving the pestle in concentric circles."

Make sure your home is safe from trip, slip and fall hazards.,
Know your pet.,
Make sure dangerous or deeply personal items are out of sight.",How to Be a Responsible Party Host1," You are used to that not-quite-even set of porch stairs, the wobbly railing, and sure footed as a goat on the icy walkway. However, your guests could end up hurting themselves if these things are not addressed. In the USA, you could unfortunately find yourself sued. Such safety issues include:


Make sure stairs are safe, or guests do not have access to them.
Fix anything that is not as it should be.
Make sure that walking surfaces are reasonably safe. This is especially important for those with limited mobility, such as those on crutches or the elderly. For example, be sure that ice has salt and sand placed down for traction.
Be sure to have adequate outdoor lighting.
Be extremely careful with swimming pools. Drownings are more likely to occur when alcohol is served. Also, young children are sometimes not monitored as carefully when parents are distracted.;
, Many dogs and cats enjoy company, and thrive on all of the attention. But having so many strangers can make pets frightened and anxious. It may be better to confine an animal to a crate, a bedroom, or the garage until the festivities are over.


If there will be small children, pets may get treated roughly.
Do not allow people to feed pets ""people food"". It is not good for them. Even more so for alcoholic beverages - many dogs like the taste of beer but it is not good for them. Unfortunately, some people enjoy trying to make animals inebriated.
Keep animals away from very loud noises. This includes loud music or fireworks. Your dog's hearing is much more sensitive than yours.

, This does not mean locking up the kitchen knives or taking down family photographs. But some things to consider:


Make sure firearms or other weaponry (such are archery equipment) are secured.
Medications should be discreetly put away. You may not want people to be able to easy see you are taking anti-depressives, or be able to steal your grandmother's painkillers.
Make sure bathroom medicine cabinets have nothing embarrassing in them. People do open these, whether it is to look for a cotton swab or for snooping.
Very valuable items. Unfortunately, sometimes people steal. It is unlikely your big-screen TV will be swiped during the party, but your grandfather's gold pocket-watch could be.

If you don’t have access to this type of zester, use a nutmeg grater or a small zester. You need a very sturdy grater with small, hard holes to adequately grind the hard seed.;
, Make sure they are sold in the shell. Once the shell is broken on the seed, the expiration date moves from nine years to three years.

, Smash it between the cutting board and a strong knife or plate. Don’t worry about breaking the seed itself.

,, Grasp it on the plastic handle and rest the other end on the cutting board.

, It is best to try to keep your fingers as far away from the grater as possible.

, Repeat until you have a small pile of ground nutmeg on your cutting board. You can turn the Microplane over and wipe the back of it with your finger to harvest any nutmeg grounds that become stuck.


For a light dusting on top of a cold or warm drink, hold the grater above a cup and use shorter motions.

, While this is the guest's responsibility,(you cannot demand a person be a designated driver), but making polite inquiries will make people consider the post-party strategy.


For large parties, some people give designated drivers specific bands to indicate they are not supposed to be drinking. While this is not a fool-proof system it does make people make a promise that is visible. People will also avoid offering alcohol to such people.
Consider having everyone turn their keys over. They would have to be sober to pick them up later. Either that, or everyone would agree to be staying the night with no driving. If so, make sure that there is a place for everyone to sleep (or pass out).
Be aware of the increased personal liability that there will be for whomever is returning key. Be sure of the potential driver.
Have a cab ride fund for whoever wants, or needs, one. They might need to get home, sooner than later. You're better off covering all your bases.
Have the number handy for the cab service. If you think that there is a chance that you will be using their services, you might call them and give them a heads up.

, In countries with legal drinking ages, you can be held criminally liable if your under-aged party-goer gets intoxicated at your party.


If adults are drinking at a party, it is relatively easy for teenagers to sneak alcohol. So consider carefully if you will provide alcohol for adult guests at your teenager's ""Sweet 16"" party.
For large teenage or young adult parties, be careful that you check the drinks regularly. Sometimes young party-goers will ""spike"" the drinks with alcohol such as vodka.

, People sometimes feel pressured into drinking if it is clear that only alcohol is served at your party. Also, if people choose to drink, it is always a good idea to have other drinks to ""pace"" oneself and avoid a hangover. Ideas include:


Water: not only bottled or ice water, but sparkling water or flavored waters.
Soda. Many people enjoy soft drinks, whether popular brands, energy drinks, or even premium quality sodas or even homemade soda.
Juices. You can offer plain juices, or offer sophisticated drinks like blood orange, pomegranate, or other ""fancy"" mixes.
Coffee or tea. At dinner parties, offering coffee or tea at dessert is traditional.

, Food will not stop a person from becoming intoxicated, but drinking on an empty stomach will get a person drunk very quickly. A party with only alcoholic beverages also send a subtle message that this is a drinking party.

, As a good host, you will want to make your guests feel that you are attending to them. But do not get insistent about constantly getting them drinks. Unintentionally, you could be sending the message that to please you, the guests must drink. Try instead:


Let them know where beverages are located, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. That way, the guest can make his or her own decision with less pressure.
If a person says ""no thank you"" leave it there. Do not insist.

, You will need to be able to recognize all phases of drunkenness. This includes:


Slurred speech
Impaired movement
Marked difference in behavior, such as the normally person loudly singling karaoke off-key, or the boisterous friend sitting in a corner acting quiet and withdrawn.

,, This is generally a rare thing and should be a last resort. If that is what you have to do to stop a drunk driver, then do it.

, For one thing, simply having one may raise uncomfortable questions about why you brought a breathalyzer to your own party. At drinking parties, such devices tend to become a tool in order to determine who is the most drunk; this is not conducive to responsible partying.

"
"
Provide a place for the smokers to smoke that is well away from the non-smokers.,
Try to offer items that all guests can enjoy.",How to Be a Responsible Party Host3," People with asthma and other health conditions should not be exposed to second hand smoke.


You, as the host always have the option of not allowing any smoking on or around your premises. However, you may want to make this clear before the party.
Smokers will usually be happy with an outdoor space such as a balcony, porch, front steps, or garden.

, If you know your friends fairly well, you will likely know if people are vegetarian, or on a low-calorie diet, or allergic to peanuts.


Label items. Make labels to sure your friends know which one is the vegetarian chili. An ingredient list can be helpful, too. You may not know a person has an allergy.
Leave labels out. It allows the person to be able to make more informed decisions. It is easy to overlook ingredients, additives, and so on.

If you have store-bought items, it can be a good idea to cut out the ingredient label and any allergen warnings and have it near the food items.
For informal parties, having chip bags and drink bottles out allows people to easily look up this information


Offer vegetable plates, fruits, low-fat dips, and low-calorie options. These are all normal party food items which allow those watching calorie intake to gracefully bypass the chips.
Ask those with special food requirements what works for them. Not sure what to have for food for your co-worker who eats a Kosher diet? Or your friend who is gluten-free? Or your niece who is severely allergic to eggs? Sometimes all it takes is a quick e-mail or phone call. Sometimes such people are happy to bring a dish to share.

Add the almond extract.,
Add the egg white.,
Wrap the almond paste in plastic wrap.,
Store in the refrigerator.",How to Make Almond Paste," Fill a small saucepan 2/3 full with water. Warm this water on the stove on high, heating it until it reaches a rolling boil.


You need to blanch the almonds in order to remove the skins. Do not leave the skins on when making almond paste, since the final product will be coarser and grainier if you do.
Note that if you buy pre-blanched almonds, the skins will already be removed and you can skip over this entire portion of the process.;
, Place your almonds into the water and blanch them for 1 minute.


It is absolutely crucial that you do not boil the almonds for any longer than this. If you do, they will start to soften. You only want to loosen the skins from the almonds, not cook them completely.
Add all the almonds at once instead of working in batches.

, Immediately remove the almonds from the heat and pour the contents of the saucepan through a colander or strainer. Rinse them with cold, running water to stop the cooking process.


Blot the almonds dry with a paper towel once they cool down. They do not need to be perfectly dry, but they should not be dripping wet.
Note that the skins of the almonds should look shriveled at this point, but the almonds themselves should still feel hard.

, Pick up an almond from one end of the nut, pinching it between your index finger and thumb. Carefully squeeze the bottom of the almond, forcing the nut up and out of the loosened skin.


Repeat this process with each almond.
Do not squeeze the almonds with too much force. They can easily shoot out of their skins and across the room if you aren't careful.

, Spread the almonds out on a clean kitchen counter and let them air dry for a few hours, or until they feel completely dry.


To speed up the drying process, pat them with clean paper towels to remove most of the excess water. Instead of laying them directly on the counter, spread them over one or two layers of clean paper towels to help absorb any of the remaining water.

, Place your blanched almonds in a food processor, cover the machine, and process at high speed until it develops a smooth consistency.


The consistency of the ground almonds should be similar to a coarse-grain flour. They do not need to be a fine powder, but you should not be able to see any noticeable chunks of almond.
If you notice that the almonds are grounding unevenly in the food processor, pause it and stir with a spatula before starting the machine back up again.
Use a blender if you do not have a food processor.

, Add the powdered sugar, egg white, almond extract, and salt to the food processor, along with the ground almonds. Cover the machine again and process at high speed until smooth and evenly blended.


Depending on the strength of your food processor, it could take 10 minutes or more before an actual paste forms.
When you are finished processing the ingredients, a thick clay-like paste should form inside the machine.

, Scoop out the almond paste in 1/2 cup (125 ml) portions. Use your hands to shape these portions into balls or loaves.

, Center each portion in the middle of a sheet of plastic wrap and wrap the almond paste tightly. Place each wrapped portion into an airtight container and label it with the contents, amount, and date.


Labeling the container will make it easier to keep track of how long the almond paste has been in storage.
You could simply use a covering of plastic wrap, or you could skip the plastic wrap and place the almond paste in a resealable plastic bag or plastic container. Doubling up is not necessary, but it does improve the freshness and longevity of the almond paste as time passes.

, You can either refrigerate or freeze almond paste. In the refrigerator, it should last for 1 month. In the freezer, it should last for 3 months.

, Butter is not an essential ingredient, but adding it into the almond paste can make the final product smoother and less sticky. Wait until you are ready to use the almond paste before kneading the butter in.


Soften the butter and cut it into small cubes.
Roll out the almond paste and scatter the butter on top.
Fold and knead the almond paste and butter to combine them. Stop once you can no longer see any visible traces of butter left behind.

, Place the almond flour and powdered sugar into a food processor and pulse it quickly to blend the two ingredients together.


In doing this, you should also be able to break up any clumps, which will ensure that your final product is as smooth as possible.
Note that you could use almond meal instead of almond flour if the former is all you can find.
Alternatively, you could sift the almond flour and powdered sugar together to blend them and remove any lumps. Since you will still need to use a food processor, though, using a sifter may be more work than it is worth.
If you do not have a food processor, a blender could used instead.

, Add 1 tsp (5 ml) almond extract to the food processor and pulse to combine it with the almond flour mixture.


Taste the mixture. If the almond taste is not strong enough for you, add another 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of almond extract.
It is important that you balance the flavor of the almond paste now before moving onto the next step, which involves the use of an egg white. Uncooked eggs are hazardous to consume.

, Lightly beat the egg white with a fork or whisk. Pour it into the contents of the food processor. Process the ingredients at a medium speed for a full 2 minutes.


When done, the almond paste inside the machine should be smooth and naturally formed into a clay-like ball.
If the dough still feels sticky, add another 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of almond flour and process until thoroughly combined.

, Take the ball of almond paste out of the food processor and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Place it into a resealable plastic bag or airtight container, and label the container with the contents and date.


You do not need to double your packaging if you do not want to do so, but doubling the packaging can keep the almond paste fresher for a longer period of time.
If you anticipate using the almond paste in batches, you can divide it into individual portions ahead of time and package those portions separately. This is not necessary, though.

, Place the wrapped almond paste in your refrigerator and store it there for up to 1 month.


If you want to save the almond paste for a longer period of time, freeze it. When frozen, almond paste retains its quality for about 3 months.

The texture of a hickory nutshell may be smooth, with minimal veining, or considerably irregular and furrowed.
Husks split open at the base once the fruit (nut) inside has fully ripened, although some species partially encapsulate the hickory nut even after splitting.
Husks vary in thickness from 2 mm to 9 mm, depending on the hickory nut species;
, When separate from the husk, hickory nuts may measure anywhere between 0.5 inch (13 mm) and 2.56 inches (6.5 cm) long and equally as wide, depending on the species.

, Look for circular, heart-shaped or oblong nuts that are either slightly flat or rounded. Depending on the species, hickory nuts can have any of these shapes.

, Several hickory species yield a sweet, edible meat, while others yield bitter meat that one should not eat.

, The inside of a hickory nut's shell is veined, which can make it difficult to remove the nut meat.

, The 16 species of hickories each product slightly different nuts. Find out which species live in your area so you'll know exactly what to look for and you can determine whether the nuts you find are edible., You may find these nuts alone, or in a pair. They may be anywhere from 1.2 inches (3 cm) to 2 inches (5 cm) long, and slightly less wide. The brownish-black husk is a medium thickness, and easily splits open to reveal a light brown, heart-shaped, textured and thin-shelled fruit. The kernel of the shagbark is brown and sweet.

, The husk of a southern shagbark is 0.12 inch (3mm) to 0.35 inch (9mm) thick, and the egg-shaped shell is smooth, relatively thin and easy to crack open. Southern shagbark nut meat is a light-brown color, and sweet to the taste.

, The shell of a bitternut may be anywhere between 0.8 inch (2 cm) to 1.6 inches (4 cm) long. It is a rounded, light-brown nut, enclosed in a thin, yellow-scaled husk. The kernel of the bitternut is bitter, as the name suggests.

, Pignuts generally mature to be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long and 0.8 inch (2 cm) wide. The husk is thin and dark brown, and must be split manually, as it rarely splits on its own. The pear-shaped pignut shell is thick, smooth and grayish brown. Pignut meat is bitter and slightly bland.

, This nut measures approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 1.2 inches (3 cm) long and 0.8 inch (2 cm) wide. The dark husk is about 0.08 inch (2 mm) thick and splits freely on its own to reveal a light brown, rounded and thin shell. The meat of the red hickory is small and sweet.

, This is the largest of the hickory nut species, growing to between 1.8 inches (4.5 cm) and 2.6 inches (6.5 cm) long, and 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) wide. The oval-shaped shell of the kingnut is very thick, light brown and slightly furrowed. Because the shell is so thick, there is little room for the meat, which is sweet.

, This is the smallest of the hickory nuts, averaging between 0.5 inch (13 mm) and 1.45 inches (37 mm) long. The husk is light brown and thin, and splits only partially to reveal the shell, which is oval and slightly flattened, light in color, smooth, furry and relatively thin. The kernel of the sand hickory is sweet.

, The mockernut is 1 of the larger hickory nut species, growing anywhere between 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) and 2 inches (5 cm) long, and with a thick husk, between 0.12 inch (3 mm) and 0.24 inch (6 mm) thick. The mockernut shell is rectangular in shape, reddish brown and smooth. The meat is edible and sweet, but difficult to remove because of the thickness of the shell.

, Hickory nuts that are ripe will blow off the tree in a brisk wind and land on the ground with the husks already open. After you collect all the nuts you want, remove the husks and discard them.

, Nut weevils bore holes in the shells of hickory nuts and eat the meat inside. If you see small holes in the nuts, you might as well throw them away instead of taking the time to crack them; the meat is sure to be ruined by a grub., Most hickory nuts have tough shells that can't be cracked with a standard nutcracker. You can buy a special cracker used for walnuts, use a vise, or crack them open with a rock. Try not to damage the meat inside.


If you use the rock method, place a nut on a piece of flat concrete, then slam the nut with a wide rock until the shell cracks.
It's hand to use a nutcracker to finish the job once the shell is partially open.
You can save the shells and burn them along with wood to help a fire last longer.

, Hand pick shards of shell from the nut meat, so you have a clean bowl of nut halves and pieces. Try to save as much of the meat as you can.

, Hickory nuts can be used the same way as any other type of nut. Snack on them raw, use them in pies and baked goods, or try them roasted and salted. If you're feeling adventurous, try making hickory nut butter.


Leftover hickory nuts should be kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They will keep for a few months before rotting.
Or you can freeze the nuts for up to a year. Pack them tightly in freezer-safe containers, removing as much of the air from the containers as possible. Label the containers and store them in the freezer.

However, if you have a more formal or professional event in mind, focus more on the mystery and less on the dressiness of the characters. For the latter, a haunted manor theme would be suitable.;
, Clue-based mysteries are appropriate for groups of under 30 people. Above 30 people, you really should consider hiring actors to act out a script-based mystery to the rest of the group. If you tried to have more than 30 characters that had plot twists, it might be too chaotic for the guests!

, Make sure that the party is flowing properly by encouraging your guests to mingle in character as they would in real life. Check to be sure they are using their clue cards for information to discuss with the other guests:


There are typically some sort of icebreakers on the round one clue cards that the guests can 'break the ice' with - like trivia questions or riddles within the theme of the party. This can get your guests to start talking!
Once you see that everyone has implemented all of the actions and topics on their clue cards, you can progress the game to round two.
Round one should take about 45 minutes to an hour. Never rush this round! This is a common mistake for newbies and can prove very confusing for the next round if clues were rushed during round one. Round one is used to set up the mystery and lay the foundation of the characters and their motives. Most games will have side bonus games within the theme of the mystery to play - these are optional but fun!

, Choose a dinner menu that can be cooking during Round One and be ready to go at the start of Round Two! Dishes such as lasagna, roasts, roasted chicken, etc., work perfectly for mystery dinners.


During dinner, there might be a side bonus game to play, or if not, just instruct your guests to remain in character until dinner is over.
Some games have the victim already disclosed before the mystery party begins and the guests arrive knowing who was or will be murdered. You can increase suspense and excitement by making one of your guests the victim. Some mystery games have one of the guests as the victim. This guest will be notified via their clue card to go to the nearest restroom and 'become the victim.' It can be as simple as putting on a 'victim sign' or they also sell props such as a victim t-shirt, white face makeup, and crime scene tape. Now, that is hysterical when a party guest comes back into the room in full force as a victim! So, after the victim arrives, the investigation begins. No worries as the victim still plays the game, but as a ghost, so that they can only communicate by sign language or writing (this is optional - you can also just ask that they speak like a ghost).
Some games will have a forensic analysis report (a certain guests called upon a favor from a detective friend) and other games might have additional evidence like emails, contracts, etc. that were found. Once everyone has completed their investigation and filtered through the information, round three can begin.

, At this time, serve coffee and dessert to the guests and ask them to sit in a circle.


One by one, allow them to accuse who they believe the murderer is and tell them to include the motive in their accusation.
After the accusations, pass out the final clue cards for round three. These will typically have the solution in it and one-by-one, the guest will read their solution which will contain any involvement that their character had with the murder.
The murderer will confess at this time and will disclose all of the details. Yes, the murderers are always honest in the end!
There is typically another side bonus game, like charades, within the theme of the party to play as the finale. After that, your party is done and your obligations as the host are over!

Confirm what time you can expect them, and ask what time they need to leave your home. Even if they don't have an appointment after dinner, most missionaries wake up extremely early in the morning and go to bed early.


During the same conversation, you should clarify whether either missionary has any allergies or foods he can't stand. This will prevent any embarrassment on your part, as well as helping you show courtesy toward the missionaries.;
, You will be dealing with college age boys and girls, who for the most part will eat anything, and in large quantities. Since they do a lot of physical work everyday, and don't make many complicated meals at home, gear your dinner towards something hearty and nutritious. Don't go with anything too complicated or that you haven't made before.

, Last minute trips to the store will upset your scheduling.


Be aware that missionaries are not allowed to drink alcohol, coffee, or tea (and some may avoid all caffeine). If you want to offer them a beverage other than water, you can choose sodas, juice or milk.

, During their time in the field, missionaries are not allowed to watch television, listen to popular music or keep up on current events. If you want to break up the silence, soft classical music is an appropriate choice. Or, look for free online streaming of music by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

, When the missionaries arrive, make sure that they have a secure place to park their car or bikes, and invite them inside. ""Checking"" their coats and backpacks is a nice gesture as well.

, Have anyone not in the kitchen (such as children) attend to the missionaries, offering them water or another beverage.

, When the meal is ready, the missionaries will ask you (or your spouse) if you'd like to offer a prayer over the food. You can accept, or you can ask if one of them would do it.

, Once the prayer is said, you can conduct yourself as you would at an informal dinner with friends. The discussion doesn't have to be about the LDS Church, but you can ask the missionaries about their families, where they are from, hobbies, and the like. Just avoid topics such as current trends or politics.

, The missionaries might want to offer you a small spiritual message after dinner, and dessert provides a good segue. Even something as simple as ice cream will be welcomed."

, If you prefer, create a table in Word and type out each dish name in a box on the table. A table with about three columns will create about the right width for the ""flag"". Print and cut out each box.

, Use a little tape to adhere the tag to each toothpick. Put all the finished tags onto a plate for distributing later when the dishes are laid out.

, Stick the flag guide into the center of each dish. Or, if you do not want it in the food, use tape to attach the flag to the side of the bowl, plate or other dish.

Appoint someone likable to serve drinks.",How to Have a Fancy Dinner Party," If you are inviting your boss or your co-workers, your house will make a big impression. Make sure that it is immaculately clean and well decorated (a few vases of tasteful flowers, a lace tablecloth, etc.);
, This is the most important step. The guests will decide the success or failure of your dinner party. As a general rule, don't mix your acquaintances. If you are inviting colleagues, it is okay for your wife or your immediate family to be there, but your best friend should probably stay at home.


If you do invite one friend who is not part of the larger clique, just remember that it's your responsibility to work them into the clique. If your friend is shy, they will probably have a difficult time participating in the conversation.
Don't invite five friends and five coworkers. It will be difficult for them to truly mingle and there will be an ""elephant in the room"" kind of feeling.
Don't invite more people than your home can comfortably handle. Everyone there should have more than enough room to sit, walk, chat, and feel comfortable.


, Fancy dinners are usually served in courses. It is a good idea to have one person dedicated to kitchen tasks (cooking, serving, clearing, washing, etc.)


Cook or have catered some fancy appetizers like mussels, clams, oysters, bruschetta, spinach dip, a vegetable platter, or whatever the tradition is in your culture.
Have at least a few courses planned out. The simpler the better. All of the food should be somewhat communal. Fondue, assorted meats, shrimp, scallops, and sausages are all good ideas. After one course is finished, allow some time for people to chat and get hungry again before serving the next one.
Keep the dessert simple and serve small portions. Cookies, small scoops of sorbet, bread pudding, and assorted fruits are all good options.
For an extra special touch, add a course of port wine, dark chocolate and exotic cheeses (brie, blue stilton, sharp cheddar, etc.) after dessert.

, There are few greater pleasures for guests than an open bar. Everyone will want to drink something different, so keep a well-stocked bar, wine collection and fridge full of beer.


Cocktails - At the very least, your bar should have ingredients for a Martini (gin, vodka, dry vermouth, green olives), a Margarita (tequila, Cointreau, Grand marnier, limes, Margarita salt), a Daiquiri (Rum and sour mix), tonic water, and club soda. You should have a shaker, cocktail (martini) glasses and a few tumblers for those who like it on the rocks. Swizzle sticks and fancy toothpicks are a nice touch and don't forget to buy good high-quality ice.


Spirits - If you have no passion for fine spirits, your collection should consist of the following to satisfy your spirit-loving guests: Johnnie Walker Black Label, Glenlivet 18 Years Old, Laphroaig 10 Years Old, Crown Royal Special Reserve, Jameson 12 Years Old, Hennessy Cognac VSOP, Remy Martin Cognac VSOP, Wild Turkey Rare Breed, and Booker's Small Batch Bourbon. Keep a collection of snifters for the Brandy, tulip glasses for the Scotch, Bourbon glasses (like a mini champagne flute), and tumblers for those who take it on the rocks.

Champagne - You will need flutes and good quality Champagne (don't forget to chill it well). On the cheaper side, Mumm Napa and Roederer Estate are excellent. If you must go French, Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label is a crowd-pleaser. Champagne is traditionally served as an apertif (before any food).

Wine - Wine is perhaps the most expensive investment you will have to make for your fancy dinner party. If you want to impress the wine snobs, you need good stuff. Read up on magazines like Wine Spectator if you plan on becoming a connoisseur. Otherwise, just go to Beverages and More and pick out some highly rated (90+ point) wines. Have lighter bodied wines like Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay for younger taste buds. Keep a good, strong collection of Merlot, Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon for seasoned wine drinkers. It is a good idea to have a good collection of stemware--red and white wine glasses. If you really want to overachieve, get the proper glass for each varietal.

Beer - Some popular choices among the upper middle class are Corona, Dos Equis Amber, Becks, and Samuel Adams. Also chill some microbrews for the beer connoisseurs - Hefeweizen, Blonde, IPA, or Guinness will all do. Keep a collection of pub glasses for those who refuse to drink from a bottle.

Fortified/Dessert Wines - The best wines to serve with dessert are Port, Sherry and Riesling. Shopping for Port can be intimidating, but Fonseca Bin No. 27 is an excellent choice. Remember that dessert wines should be served in a different glass than dinner wines (dessert wine glasses are smaller).

, It is good to have one person in charge of serving drinks, making introductions (if necessary), leading the conversation and announcing the courses. Most likely this will be the host/hostess or someone close to him/her. This person should be relaxed and charming with a good sense of humor. People will be engaged in conversation the whole time and you need to let them know what's coming next without interrupting them. Also, if the conversation topics get dull or head in the wrong direction, this person needs to steer it back to pleasurable things.

Never be afraid of making others work harder than you.",How to Delegate Preparations for a Large Meal," Sit down and go through your recipe collection, cookbooks and online recipe sites. Select the recipes that you know you (and others) can cook, that will appeal to everyone and that are suitable for the occasion. As part of your planning, account for special dietary needs.


Aim for a balance between hot and cold foods. Cold foods can often be prepared by many other people, including children, and they're appreciated as a contrast to lots of hot food. Salads and coleslaw, sushi, cold meats, pate and dips, cheese platters, etc. are just some cold options.
Plan how you'll spread the workload, both for yourself and for others you'll be delegating chores to.
Know at this stage who you will be asking to collect or make items off site, from turkeys to cheesecakes. Ask them to do this with plenty of notice before the event. Not only does this give them time to plan but it also saves you if they say no and you need to find someone else to help.;
, Enlisting your children in the preparation does a few good things––it involves them directly, it teaches them cooking and preparation skills, it teaches them that helping the family is important and it makes them feel useful. Things that children can do include setting the table, arranging decorations, mixing batters, decorating food, making cold food and some basics like sauces, fetching things you need at the last minute, etc. Match the activities to the age of the children, from the very young to the teens.


A hint: Don't name the things needing to be done as ""chores"". Give them important significance by naming with care. For example, call setting the table a ""decorating responsibility"".

, For example, set aside collection of the poultry, seafood and meat/freshly baked bread and cakes/last minute items to one responsible adult who is familiar with where they are being asked to go. Make the timing absolutely clear, including when the market or stores are open, when you need the item delivered by, what name the items are being held under, and so forth. Leave nothing to chance and add your cell phone number to any lists you give out, in case people forget or have difficulty working out exactly what is expected of them.


Consider whether you're willing to let someone else use your car, line of credit, shopping bags, whatever, to facilitate the purchase and collection of items.

, Setting up and cleaning up tend to be ideal teamwork delegation opportunities. Be clear about what's expected by way of setting up, decorating and arranging seating, then simply respect that the people involved will get it right. For cleaning up, usually most people know what's expected but be sure to point out what can't go in the dishwasher!

, For example, if Great Aunt Miriam loves to carve the turkey each year and Grandfather Fred has always made sugar mice each holiday season, indulge in their passion by asking them to do it and standing aside.

, If you don't want your own kitchen space invaded by the hordes of well meaning but ""in-the-way"" relatives and friends, clarify boundaries early on. Tell your helpers where it's okay to stand and where you need clearways. If Rachel is working on whipping the cream and Tim is peeling the peas, set them up in an out-of-the-way corner and give them all the objects they need to complete the task. That way, they won't be bobbing up and down looking for things.


Make it clear how much is needed from each person. This helps to stop constantly being asked ""What next?"", which can cause frustration despite its good intent. For example, outline exactly what you'd like your helpers to do and then add, ""and after that you're free to rejoin the party"", or whatever. They know then that they don't need to ask for more chores but if they do, you can simply assert that they've done all you needed them to do and reassure them that they are now free.

, For example, have helpers for before dinner preparation, then change to different helpers for each course of the dinner, and finish with different helpers again for the clean up. That way, nobody gets left out and everybody gets to do their bit (whether or not they can be bothered). This fosters a sense of everyone sharing in the event and helps to minimize resentment.

, A good delegate is actually an excellent manager, able to get everyone doing what they're good at, working together smoothly and not caring a whit that they're really putting some effort in. Just so long as you keep an eye on everything working out smoothly and on time, the act of management itself can be your most important role for the meal!

",How to Make Bagel Chips," To help infuse the oil with the garlic flavor, heat them together in a saucepan on low heat for about 15 minutes.Don’t let the oil get too hot, as you just want to heat the garlic and oil, not cook them.


Alternatively, you can also puree the garlic with the oil in a blender or food processor. In this case, you can even add spices like rosemary to the mix to give the oil an even more powerful flavor.For additional flavor, you can also add minced onion or chives to the oil.
If you plan to deep fry your chips as the method of cooking, skip this step.;
, To make small, round bagel chips, slice your bagels into disks that are between one-eighth and one-quarter inch (31mm to 64 mm) thick.You can use any type of bagel you like to make your bagel chips, including: plain, sesame or poppy seed, everything, cheese or pretzel, or even dessert bagels, such as chocolate chip, blueberry or cinnamon raisin.


Bagel chips are most often cut by slicing small disks out of the loop of the bagel, but you can also make large chips by cutting lengthwise disks instead.
If you are going to use dessert bagels for your chips, consider omitting the garlic and savory flavors from the oil.

, Lay the chips out on a flat surface, such as a tabletop, counter, or baking sheet. Use a pastry brushor the back of a spoonto coat both sides of each disk with a thin layer of oil.


This step is unnecessary if you plan to deep fry or pan fry your bagel chips. Instead, skip this step, and go directly to frying. Season the chips once they are fried.
To pan fry your bagel chips, fry them in your seasoned garlic oil instead of spreading the oil over the chips, and season them after they are cooked.

, Even if you added spices to the oil, you can still add more flavor to your bagel chips by sprinkling them with herbs and spices. For most spices, start with ½ to 1 teaspoon (2.5 to 5 g) and add more if needed. Popular choices for bagel chip seasoning include:


Salt and pepper, to taste
Onion or garlic powderItalian seasoningPaprika or cayenne pepperThyme, oregano, or rosemary¼ cup (25 g) Parmesan cheese
¼ cup (56 g) cinnamon sugar (for dessert bagels like blueberry)

, Bagel chips are most often baked, but they can also be slow baked, deep fried, pan fried, or dehydrated. See part two for more information about cooking methods.

, Once the bagel chips are cooked, they can be served with guacamole, salsa, sour cream, chip dip, hummus, or any other of your favorite dips.

, If there are any bagel chips left, transfer them to a re-sealable plastic bag, an old jar, or an airtight container for up to two weeks., Preheat your oven to 350 F (177 C).Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and spread the bagel chips out in a single layer.Bake them for eight to 10 minutes, flipping halfway through.Cook them until they are crispy and golden brown. Remove the chips from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet.


The parchment paper in this method is strictly optional.
You can also bake the chips in a baking dish instead of on a baking sheet.
Since you are cooking in single layers, you may need to bake these in several batches, or use multiple baking sheets at a time.

, Preheat your oven to 250 F (121 C). Spread the chips out on a baking dish or sheet (lined with parchment if you wish), and cook for 45 minutes, until crispy but not hard. Flip the chips every 15 minutes while they are baking.While this method takes a little more time and effort, the advantage of the slow, low bake is that it gives the flavors of the oil and spices more time to infuse into the bagel chips.

, Heat your fryer on medium, between 350 and 360 F (177 to 185 C). When the fryer is ready, drop in a batch of chips and cook for one to two minutes.If necessary, flip the chips after the first minute. When they are golden brown, remove the chips from the oil and place them in a bowl lined with a clean towel or paper towel to remove some of the excess oil. Remove the towel and season the chips to taste, shaking them around gently in the bowl to evenly distribute the spices.

, Heat your seasoned oil in a frying pan over medium–high heat. When the oil is hot, lay down a single layer of bagel chips. Flip them every one to two minutes, and cook for about five minutes, until crispy and golden. Remove the chips from the pan with tongs or a spatula and place them in a towel-line bowl. When the excess oil has been absorbed, remove the towel and season the chips to taste.

, This can be done in a proper dehydrator, or in an oven. Set your dehydrator or oven to 115 F (46 C), or set your oven to its lowest temperature.Line the dehydrator trays with single layers of bagel chips, or lay the chips out in a single layer on a baking sheet. Dehydrate them for three to four hours, or until crispy.,"

Know where your guests stand on political issues.,
Create a “winning” seating arrangement.,
Lay down some ground rules.,
Inject fun into your dinner party by serving famous politician’s favorite foods or mimicking a White House dinner party.",How to Host a Dinner Party With Guests Holding Opposing Political Views," Before you formulate your guest list know where each guest stands on politics and whether political issues are a hot topic.


Identify which side of the aisle each guest falls. You don’t have to ask them point blank, but recall the last political comment that was made by each guest. This may also be a good time to consider whether your guest gets hotheaded when discussing politics, doesn’t really have an opinion or seems to be able to gracefully discuss politics with just about anyone.
Make sure your party doesn’t turn into a one-sided affair. Of course if all your friends are from the same political party or hold the same political values, it’s a no brainer, however if you have a few friends with differing opinions, don’t invite seven guests who believe strongly in one party and only one or two who have other beliefs. This could not only create an uncomfortable situation for your two guests, but if the conversation becomes heated, guests in the minority could feel ganged up upon.;
, Strategic seating will get you through an evening with people who may have opposing political views.


Consider if some of your guests can actually get along even though they have differing opinions. Although your first instinct is to group people together with similar opinions, consider if you can seat two people together who have opposing views. If both guests have historically been able to keep their cool and sense of humor when discussing politics or enjoy a rousing discussion they may make for exciting dinner companions.
Create a table dynamic so you partner more peaceful people around negative naysayers. Diffuse any negativity that may plague your party by seating the positive, peace making guests near those who may be heat headed or looking to pick a political fight.
Pepper neutral or nonpolitical guests between the strong opinionated diners. If you seek the quell political discussion, have guests who seem to not really care about politics sit near folks who tend to take their political discussions through the roof. Once the political banter begins, the neutral guest may steer the conversation toward other topics.

, If you know that this group is going to ultimately turn the conversation to politics make sure everyone knows what is on or off limits.


Debate is good, however name calling or being mean spirited is not. Make sure everyone at your party knows that basic playground rules apply. No name calling, low blows or fist fights (may be worth a mention considering the group). For example, just because one guest may completely disagree with another’s political opinion is no reason to call him/her a moron or an idiot.
Set aside a certain amount of time the group can spend on politics. If this group loves to dive into politics but you really don’t want it to take over the entire party, lightly announce (with a smile) that the group should only focus on politics for the next 10 minutes and then you are hijacking the conversation to talk about something else.
Turn politics into a funny game. For example, if you know the conversation could go south insist that every guest end his or her serious political statement with “in bed” or something ridiculous to keep the mood light.
Have a moderator from each side keep emotions in check. Pull a few folks aside who seem to have their head on their shoulders and can act as a peacemaker or can steer the conversation away from an ugly situation. If possible find two people who have opposing political opinions so each can talk to “their own people” if necessary.
If you believe this group can’t keep emotion out of the conversation when dishing politics, insist on there being no political talk during your dinner party. It’s better to ban political snarkiness from the evening than allow a few comments to ruin the party for everyone.

, Political discussions can drag down the overall mood of your dinner party, robbing your title of “Hostess with the Mostest.” Don’t let your guests make your party the site of an infamous disagreement or the night that fell flat, set your party up for fun and levity even before guests arrive.


Do your research to find various past President’s favorite foods. You could go with a total French menu loved by both Kennedy and Jefferson or more of a “log cabin” type meal relished by the earlier Presidents like Adams or Lincoln. For dessert, you could serve a few fun jellybeans as a nod to Reagan along with cherries jubilee to honor Washington.
Recreate an inaugural meal. No matter which side of the aisle you sit, any political junkie will scarf up the recreation of an inaugural meal. Pick and choose from different past President’s first meals--you could even create an inaugural mash-up and include what several Presidents ate.
Set your table as if it’s the White House. You could even peruse former First Lady china patterns and settings to see how they threw a dinner party. Select your favorite First Lady to use as your dinner party model.

Plan your guest list around who you would like to spend a silent 2-hour dinner with, and how many people you can comfortably feed and seat at your home. Give guests at least a week’s notice in advance of your silent dinner; if possible, invite guests two weeks or a month in advance.


Although it may seem an obvious choice to invite guests who are mutual friends and know each other, this is not mandatory.;
, You may do this in whatever manner you choose. If you’re sending out a traditional paper invitation, this could briefly state that the party will be a “silent dinner” and concisely state the dinner rules. If you’re doing less formal invitations—by email, text, or in person—you’ll have to inform each guest of the silent dinner rules.Alternately, you could plan to surprise your guests with the silent dinner. Invite your guests to an “experimental” dinner and, once they’re at your house, explain the rules of the silent dinner party.
You could also consider handing out small note-cards to your guests as they arrive at the party. Each note-card could state the rules of the silent dinner.

, You’ll need to clarify in advance how long the silent dinner is going to last. Silent dinners commonly last for at least two hours.If you’re planning to send an invitation to invite your guests, specify the duration of the silent dinner on the physical invitation. If you’re going to inform your guests about the rules to the silent dinner when they arrive on your doorstep, make sure that you clarify to them how long the dinner will last.


If the idea of a time limit seems too rigid or arbitrary, you could build the evening around a playlist. For example, put together two hours of music, and explain to guests that, once the music has concluded, they may finally speak., When planning the different dishes which will constitute your dinner, plan to provide items that do not require verbal communication to serve. You could plan to bring each guest a fixed plate of the evening’s meal, or allow guests to serve themselves in the kitchen before the dinner begins.


Alternately, plan to serve only one main dish so that guests will not need to pass serving plates or bowl around the table.

, The first rule that guests should be made aware of is that, during the course of the silent dinner, speech is not allowed. Guests may not use any form of verbal communication with one another, including subdued or whispered speech.Hang a small sign on your front door which reminds incoming guests that they will not be permitted to speak once they’ve entered the silent dinner party.
Naturally, all types of sound cannot be suppressed. Guests may laugh, sneeze, cough, etc., when appropriate. However, ask that guests strive to make as little sound as possible during the dinner.
However, ask that guests make as little sound as possible—verbal or nonverbal—during the course of the dinner. This includes things like tapping fingers, scuffing chairs on the floor, etc.

, Just as guests should be discouraged from speaking to one another, you also need to make clear that guests cannot read or write. This includes passing written messages, texting on a phone, or reading from a book or magazine.The lack of writing and reading will allow guests to be more present during the meal. You and your guests will be better able to enjoy the reflective, subdued atmosphere of the silent dinner if no one writes or reads., Guests at your silent dinner should immerse themselves fully in the experience. A guest pulling out their cell phone or tablet would not only distract other guests (and the host), but would indicate a lack of interest in the dinner itself. So, ask guests to put their phones on silent or turn them off for the duration of the dinner.The lack of phones, tablets, and other technology at the table will allow guests to better experience the meal, the silence, and the company they’re spending a silent evening with.

, The silent dinner is meant to create a communal space between yourself (the host) and the guests you have chosen to invite. It may take guests some time to acclimate to the uncommon dinner requirements, but they should stay until the end. The dinner will be diminished if one or more guests gets up to leave halfway through.Whether you mail your guests a physical invitation or explain to them the rules of the silent dinner once they walk in your front door, make it clear that guests are expected to stay for the full two hours.

, Although speech and written language are not permitted at a silent dinner table, guests are not obligated to sit in their chair without any interaction. Guests may communicate with one another non-verbally through eye contact, hand gestures, applause, or any other body language.If you have invited individuals who do not know one another, the guests can communicate and begin getting to know one another through nonverbal cues, glances, and hand gestures.

, Your silent dinner should be a peaceful, relaxing event, without any of the noise-induced stress that accompanies many typical dinner parties, not to mention eating out at a restaurant. The atmosphere and the food should be your guest’s main focuses.That said, don’t feel like the food you serve will be under any special scrutiny or needs to be exquisite. A silent dinner should allow guests to focus on the experience of dining and the company around them, regardless of what’s on the table.
Unlike, for example, a typical business dinner, guests should not focus on networking or other interpersonal connections.

, Once the two hours has expired (or, if you’re timing the dinner with a prepared playlist, once the playlist has ended), you and your guests are free to speak. If any guests do not know each other, ask them to introduce themselves. Encourage light conversation around the table before guests begin to leave.This will eliminate any lingering awkwardness and encourage guests to get to know one another.

Add some favor boxes or bags so that your guests can take their candy home.,
Create some signs and labels for your candy.,
Hang a backdrop or banner on the wall behind your table.,
Add color to the table.",How to Make a Candy Buffet," If the party or event that you are making the candy buffet for already has a color scheme, you should use the same colors. If the party or event does not have a set color scheme, you should come up with one; choose 3 to 4 different colors.Use the color scheme when buying your candy. Many party stores and online stores sell candy in specific colors, such as white and turquoise.;
, If your party has a theme, you would want to replicate some of that theme for your candy buffet. While you may not always find candy that matches that theme, you will certainly be able to find plates, trays, banners, tablecloths, and other decorative items that do., The more different types of candy you get, the more interesting and appealing your candy buffet will be. Consider candies such as: hard candies, lollipops, chocolates, rock candy, and mints.You will need about ½ pound (225 grams) of candy per guest. The more guests you have, the more different types of candy you should get. Here are some numbers to get you started:For large events and weddings (100+ guests), plan on getting 8 to 10 different types of candy.
For small events (fewer than 100 guests), plan on getting 5 to 8 different types of candy.

, Your candy buffet doesn't have to contain just candy. Don't get carried away, however; include one or two non-candy items; you are making a candy buffet after all! Here are some ideas to get you started:Cookies, cupcakes, and macaroons
Marshmallows
Nuts
Popcorn
Pretzels

, You should have large, medium, and small containers. This will not only make it easier to hold different types of candy, but it will also help create depth and make your buffet look larger and more interesting. Clear, acrylic or glass jars and vases are the best for letting the bright colors of the candy shine through, but you can also use other items too. Here are some ideas to get you started:Clear, glass or acrylic apothecary jars and vases
Trays and platters
Cake stands and cupcake stands
Baskets, bowls, buckets, and pails

, Some types of candy, such as lollipops, can be grabbed by hand, but other types should be served with a scoop or tongs. Not only do these make the buffet look more elegant and interesting, but they also make it more hygienic. Here are some ideas to get you started:Clear or metal candy scoops
Colorful spoons
Small, clear or metal tongs

, The larger your party will be, the more candy you will need. This does not necessarily mean that you should get a huge table, however. You want the table to be big enough to fit all of your containers, but not so big that the table looks sparse. Your guests should be able to reach around the different jars and vessels without knocking anything over.

In terms of candy buffet tables, smaller is better., It would be best to stick with a solid-colored tablecloth, as a patterned one will make the table look too busy and take attention away from the candy. It does not have to be anything fancy either—a cheap, plastic tablecloth will work well!, Your table should have three zones: front, middle, and back. The front zone is the area at the front of your table, and will contain the items that get handled the most. The back zone is in the back of your table, and will contain the items that will get handled the least. The middle zone is the space in between and will contain everything else., Go through your container first, and sort them by shape and size. Then, place them in the different zones. Try to place the taller containers towards the center of the table, and the shorter ones towards the side edges. Here is what containers work best in the three zones:The front zone should contain your trays, short/low containers, and decorative boxes.
The middle zone should contain your apothecary jars, vases, small baskets and buckets, and candy dishes.
The back zone should contain your largest, tallest containers, including cupcake stands. You can also use crates to elevate shorter containers.

, Now that you have your containers in their zones, it is time to fill them. Here are some ideas on how you can fill up your different containers based on the zones that they are in:Fill the small zone containers with large, bulky items, such as: cookies, cupcakes, and larger candy bars.
Fill the middle zone containers with scoop-able candy, such as gumballs, gummy worms, candy canes, and chocolate-covered raisins. Be sure to include tongs or scoops with these.Fill the back-zone containers that are easy to grab, such cupcakes and foil-covered candy. Avoid unwrapped candy, as that requires scooping, which will be tricky as the candy nears the bottom of the container.

, Adding things like banners, labels, and centerpieces is not absolutely necessary, but it can really take your candy buffet to the next level. You do not have to use all of the suggestions in this section—instead, choose a few that appeal the most to you, and use them in inspiration!


Don't overdo it, or your buffet will look cluttered. There should be enough space on your table so that your guests can reach for the candy without knocking anything over., You can use the same centerpiece that the rest of the tables have, or you can use a fancy cupcake stand, and fill it up with cupcakes (decorated to match your party's theme, of course). If your event has a cake, you could even use the cake as the centerpiece! If cupcakes aren't your thing, you could use some floral or candle arrangements instead., Keep in mind, however, that the bigger your favor boxes/bags are, the more candy you will need; people usually like to fill their favor boxes/bags most of the way. Another option would be to include some bulky items on your candy buffet table, such as large lollipops, cookies, or cupcakes; these items will fill up those large boxes/bags.Choose paper, organza, or cellophane bags in colors that match your party's theme.Choose mini take-out boxes, gift boxes, or favor tins in colors that match your party's theme., Write or print out the name for your candy (ie: Chocolate Kisses, Gumballs, Gummy Worms, etc) on pretty labels that match your party's theme. You can also write the labels on mini chalkboards, mini wooden pick signs, clothespins, etc. Choose something that works with your decor.Don't be afraid to get creative with your labels either; you can match them to the theme of your party. For example:

If your party's theme is Harry Potter, you can label red licorice as ""Licorice Wands."" Gold-foil Lindor chocolates could easily become ""Golden Snitches.""
If your party's theme is pirates, you could call chocolate coins ""Pirate's Booty"" or ""Pirate's Treasure."" Seashell-shaped chocolates could be called ""Mermaid's Favor.""
If you are having a Halloween party, you could call chocolate raisins ""Beetle Eyes"" or ""Troll Boogers,"" and haystack cookies ""Witch Hair.""

, The walls are often a forgotten, but very important, part of a room's decor. If you want to draw the focus to your candy buffet, consider hanging a garland or banner on the wall behind the table. You could also hang up pictures or paper cut-outs instead. Whichever you choose, make sure that the colors and themes match the theme of your party.A great example of a matching banner would be a poster that says ""Honeydukes"" for a Harry Potter themed party. Honeydukes was the name of a popular candy shop in the books.
A great example of matching cut-outs would be paper snowflakes for a winter wonderland themed party. You would also hang long tinsel around the edge of the table to mimic icicles!

, Some colorful confetti scattered across the table can add color without taking up much spaces. You can also use small items, such as flower petals, rhinestones, strands of curled ribbon, or sequins. Whatever you end up using, make sure that it matches the theme of your party. For example, flower petals would work great for a wedding, while rhinestones would work well for a pirate themed party (to resemble treasure).

Confetti comes in many different shapes and colors. Choose one that matches your party's theme. For example, blue and white snowflake confetti would work great for a winter wonderland themed party!

Begin planning the food for your party as early as you can.,
Make a list of everything you'll need for food.,
Purchase non-perishable foods as soon as possible.,
Prepare food ahead of time when possible.,
Purchase food and ingredients in bulk from a wholesale distributor.",How to Buy Food for a Party1," If the party is less than 6 weeks away, begin planning immediately. If the party is more than 6 weeks away, however, you can wait until approximately 6 weeks before the date of the party.;
, Decide what kinds of party food you will be serving. Are you planning a simple party with snacks and dips? Will you be serving a full dinner meal with appetizers and dessert? Make note of any recipes you'll need when it comes time to cook. Keep in mind your guests requirements. Not everyone loves junk food so make sure to have some healthy food on offer as well. If you have a friend that you know is highly allergic to a specific food, it is a good idea to not serve this food or let everybody know to stay away from that person while consuming that food.

, If you plan on using canned foods as part of your recipes, purchase them ahead of time and store them somewhere safe. Other non-perishable foods include frozen food, pasta, dry beans, and bottled beverages. By purchasing non-perishables ahead of time, you cut down the size of your shopping list significantly, allowing you to focus only on purchasing perishables before the party.

, There are plenty of food recipes that can be prepared days or even weeks before the date of an event as long as you freeze and store the food properly. This will take a huge load off your shoulders in the days preceding the actual event.

, This is less important if you're only hosting a party for a handful of people, but can save you a lot of time and money if you're hosting a large party. Wholesale distributors allow you to purchase items in bulk quantities at a reduced price.

Determine how many guests you expect to be serving.,
Calculate appetizers.,
Calculate chips and dip.,
Calculate pizza.,
Calculate dessert.,
Use the general rule of thumb in all other cases.",How to Buy Food for a Party2," It is very difficult, almost impossible, to calculate or estimate how much food you're going to need to prepare if you don't know how many mouths you'll need to feed. This is a good reason why you should begin planning the food for a party weeks ahead of time. When you know how many guests you'll have, the rest is simply a matter of mathematics.

, If your party is only serving hors d'oeuvres, then you should use the following estimates: an average guest will consume 5 hors d'oeuvres per hour for the first 2 hours of a party and 3 hors d'oeuvres per hour for every additional hour. If you plan to serve a meal after the appetizers, cut the estimations down by a third or a half.

, If you're offering chips and dip--or chips and no dip--as a snack, you'll want approximately 1 lb. of chips and 1 pt. of dip for every 10 to 12 guests. Increase the amounts if you do not plan on serving a meal later.


Pita and tortilla chips weigh more than potato chips, which means that 1 lb. of pita or tortilla chips will actually be less food than 1 lb. of potato chips. If you're going to serve pita or tortilla chips, be sure to compensate for the disparity by buying a little more.

, For non-formal parties, pizza is a quick and easy way to satisfy the hunger of guests. When serving pizza as the main meal, you can estimate that a large (10 in.) pizza will feed 2 to 3 people. If you're serving other food alongside the pizza, you'll only need approximately 1 to 2 slices per guest.

, If your dessert is a cake or pie, plan to serve 1 slice per guest. If your dessert is cookies or pastries, plan to serve 2 per guest. If your dessert is ice cream, then you should have 1 half-gallon for every 5 to 8 guests.

, If you're preparing a dinner meal from scratch and you need to know a general rule of thumb for how much food to prepare, then you can safely estimate that you'll need 1 lb. of food per guest not including dessert or drinks.

, 150 watts is good amount. If your starting out doing little house parties for younger kids. You really need to get an amp that has 300 watts per channel and speakers that can handle the power output. The more shows you do, you want to have two or more amps and a mixture of speakers including subs. Even bigger shows more watts and more power handling speakers.

, Either ask people what music they like and get it, or just have a mixture of genres. Mainly popular music on the charts would work, but just in case, get some old classics to balance it out.

Preheat oven to 350° F (177° C).,
With a pastry brush, lightly cover a baking tray with vegetable oil.,
Lightly brush the pre-made tortillas with a vegetable oil such as grapeseed or canola oil.,
Cut your stack of tortillas into wedges.,
Place the tortilla chips without overlapping onto the baking tray, and sprinkle with sea salt.,
Bake the tortilla chips for 8 to 12 minutes, checking after 8 minutes.,
Let cool for several minutes and serve immediately.

",How to Make Tortilla Chips1,";
, Only a thin coating is needed. This will ensure that the chips do not end up sticking to the tray.

, With the same pastry brush you used to brush your baking tray, hit your tortillas with a neutral cooking oil. If you want to brush both sides, go ahead. There's also another, quicker method for applying the oil:


Brush only one side of a tortilla with oil. Place the oiled-side of the tortilla face up on a cutting board. Oil only one side of another tortilla and place it on top of the previous tortilla, oil-side up again. As you continue to oil your tortillas and stack them, the oil on one side of your tortilla will transfer to the un-oiled side of the next.This leaves you with a stack of perfectly-oiled tortillas: fully-covered but not drenched in oil. Your tortilla chips will be crispy but slightly, deliciously chewy.







, If you have your own idea of how you want to chop your tortillas, go for it. Get creative. Otherwise, tortilla chips are ordinarily cut into either triangles or squares. Here's how to do each:


Triangles: Cut the round tortillas in half to create two semi-circles. Cut one half in half again, and then do the same with each resultant half. Cut the other semi-circle in the same manner.






Squares: Cut off the rounded edges of the tortilla first. This should leave you with a stack of tortillas in the shape of a square. Make two cuts lengthwise, and then make two cuts perpendicularly.







, If possible, place the un-oiled sides of the tortillas facing down so that they come in contact with the oil applied to the tray.

, They are done when their edges lift slightly from the tray and feel crispy. The center of the tortilla chips may still be slightly soft, but should crisp up when it begins to cool.

,"
"
Fill a large frying pan with an inch to two inches of oil.,
Heat the oil in the frying pan until it reaches 325° F (163° C).,
Fry the tortilla chips in small batches at 325° F for 3 minutes.,
With a slotted spoon or spider, remove the batch of tortilla chips from the oil and place directly onto a paper towel.

,
Salt the chips immediately upon removal.,
Serve immediately.",How to Make Tortilla Chips2," Use a neutral oil, such as vegetable, grapeseed, or canola oil.

, Oil that is heated to below 325° F will not produce browned or charred tortilla chips. Although frying the tortilla chips at 325° F will mean a longer frying time, it produces the most consistent results.


If you want to heat the oil up to 350° F (177° C) or higher, expect to cook the tortilla for less time and be vigilant against browning or burning. If you decide to cook your tortilla chips at 350° F, check them for doneness at around the 45 second to one minute mark.If you don't have a candy- or other thermometer to check the temperature of the oil, use the back end of a wooden spoon. Dip the handle of a wooden spoon into the oil. If bubbles just start to form, your oil is probably hot enough., There's little need to flip them or move them around.

,, Salting immediately after removal is best, since the salt sticks to the excess oil on the chip, adhering better.

, If not serving, store in an airtight container. Homemade tortilla chips are particularly susceptible to getting stale if not stored properly.

Finished.

",How to Make Tortilla Chips3," Spread the tortilla wedges out evenly so that there's about an inch of space between each wedge, if possible.

, At this point, your tortilla wedges should be fairly soggy, and still in need of love.

,, Pay special attention to the wedges at this point, and be especially vigilant of browning at this point.Check for doneness at this point. Depending on your microwave, your chips may be done at this point.

, Watch very closely, as chips might burn if microwaved too long..

, If desired, brush lightly with a neutral oil and sprinkle with sea salt.

Play games.,
Host an awesome party.",How to Have a Cookie Party," What is the theme of your party to be? Sure, it's cookies but what exactly about cookies? There are lots of fun possibilities here, including:



A cookie exchange party: At this party, all guests are invited to bring 1 to 2 dozen of their favorite cookies to share. These can be homemade, purchased or ordered from a local bakery.

A cookie decorating party: At this party, all the guests get a chance to improve on plain cookies by making them decorative and adding tasty things like sprinkles and edible glitter. You can even involve the guests in baking cookies from scratch and have them choose what shapes to cut the cookies.

A Cookie Monster party: Guests all have to come dressed as a cookie monster and bring a giant cookie with them to share. Or, you could simply have guests turn up to a party at which everything is themed on the Cookie Monster, such as Cookie Monster posters and images, large cookies and a cookie cake. Games could include chasing monsters and finding hidden Cookie Monsters inside things.

Cookies of a particular style or theme: Maybe you like animal crackers and all things animal? Maybe you like chocolate cookies and all things chocolate? Or perhaps you like only cookies from Germany or Sweden? There is nothing to stop you from having just one type of cookie in many variations.

Around-the-world cookies: Ask guests individually to make a cookie that comes from a pre-chosen country. Also ask the guest to be prepared to talk a little about the cookie, where it comes from and what meaning it has in that country. You could either have guests bring these cookies along (suggest a recipe or let them find their own online) or you might bake the cookies at the party itself.

None of the above; just lots of cookies: Tell your guests that when you mean cookies, that's all that there will be to eat, along with drinks. You could find games that feature cookies, or change standard party to games to include cookies, and award cookies as prizes. Cookie costumes are a must.;
, Colorful and bright or classic and formal, it's up to you. However, do give serious consideration to either making cookie shaped invitations or somehow include images of cookies on the invitations that you send out. There's also no harm including a cookie recipe inside, just for fun!


As with all invitations, be sure to include the date, time, place and detailed requirements.

, You could bake all of them, buy them, order them or do a combination of any of these options. If you've asked guests to bring cookies, it's a good idea to include those cookies in your catering estimate.


Variety is the spice of enjoyment at a cookie party.
Find out if there are any dietary restrictions, such as needing some nut-free cookies, some vegan cookies or some gluten-free cookies.

, For example, the cake could be made to look like a cookie, or you could make a cake with a cookie filling.

, Hot cocoa, cold lemonade and cold (unflavored or flavored) milk are perfect drinks to have with cookies. However, you could also make drinks that incorporate cookies, such as an Oreo milkshake or a cookies and cream milkshake.

, Use balloons, streamers, posters, etc. to decorate your party. Bonus points for decorating it with cookie-themed items, if possible. You could also consider leaving packages of cookies around, just as decorations.

, These could include cookies from the party (especially if the guests baked and/or decorated their own cookies), little packages of cookies (homemade or purchased), recipes for cookies, cookie-themed toys and other party trinkets.

,, There are lots of ways to go about this, pick and choose from the following suggestions:


Set up an area of a room or under a garden tent outside for decorating. Put a tablecloth over the table (disposable ones are ideal for this) and set out all the decorating requirements on the table. Place chairs around the table, with plenty of space for excited elbow movements.
Choose decorating goodies. The most basic requirement is frosting in pots with spreaders (use a variety of colors for the frosting). Then you'll need edible decorations such as: sprinkles, chocolate chips, edible glitter, candies, nuts (if nobody has nut allergies), cracked toffee pieces, etc. Place these in containers around the table. Make it easy for everyone to grab and share things.
Consider whether you'll also include the kids in making the cookies from scratch. You could make the dough in advance and set up a rolling and cookie cutter station near the oven and have a teenager or adult supervise all baking once the cookies are cut. Put out plenty of different cookie cutter shapes, and have baking sheets already prepared for adding cookies to. The supervisor needs to keep an eye on timing of each batch of cookies, as burnt cookies result in tears.
Allow all creations to be eaten by the makers. Any disputes over who owns what requires sharing or going back and making more!

, Set aside some time for each guest to talk about their cookies and why they made/brought them along.


Allow the guests to pick a few cookies to take home. Supply take-home carry boxes just for this purpose. Be sure to write the child's name clearly on each box once the cookies are chosen, to avoid fights later on.

, Throw some games to keep everyone active.

, Make sure your guests are happy, full and occupied.

Loosen up.,
Dress appropriately.,
Wear comfortable shoes.",How to Dance at a Rave1," One of the most important things to remember when dancing at a rave is to keep your body loose. Rave dancers tend to wave their arms and hands and use their whole bodies when they dance, so do the same. Shake out your stress and warm up your whole body so you're relaxed and at ease like the rest of the dancers.;
, You can wear whatever you want to a rave, but it’s often considered appropriate to wear some more exciting clothing too. You can wear shirts with LED lights, or tutus, or giant furry costumes with wings, or just jeans and a t-shirt. Loose, casual attire was what was originally worn when raving started. It’s the easiest to dance in.
Kandi clothing that fluoresces under ultraviolet light has become very popular too.

, Regardless of what kind of clothing you decide to wear to your rave, you absolutely must wear comfortable shoes. First of all, there are going to be tons of people dancing around you. There’s a good chance someone will stomp on your feet if you are wearing sandals. Secondly, you’ll be dancing yourself the whole night. You want to be comfortable. "

She'll be thrilled to have a second opportunity to wear her prom dress. She will also be able to earn a few extra dollars and you will be helping kids.
, She can wear her hair down naturally and add pretty flowers and butterflies in it., If you don't have any wings left over from the holidays you can buy them at thrift stores, costume stores or even dollar stores. They can be decorated with flowers and butterflies as well. You could also make heart-shaped fairy wings from balloons., Fairy shoes are usually delicate looking shoes., A face painting kit can be purchased at an arts and crafts store for about $12. The kit includes a book on face painting., The girl could also make the heart-shaped fairy wings using the article mentioned in step 3., Talk about fairy dust, that her fairy dress is made of special fairy material using fairy needles and that she eats fairy food. The refreshments at the party could also be labeled fairy food. She knows fairy spells and has a fairy wand., It can be very confusing when you call around for prices and get all the same prices. The quality of the work plays a big part. Some companies are sending out young girls and give them a token fee as opposed to an experienced professional who earns and keeps the full amount. The person who works for $25 will do a $25 job while the person who works for $150 will do $150 job. You need to know who's doing the job and how many years experience they have. Hire the entertainer and NOT the company so you know you are getting what you are paying for or save your money and do it yourself

Part time entertainers. Some entertainment companies hire young girls and dress them in fairy costumes and they do many of the same things mentioned above in this article. They mostly provide a decorative function at the party and do very basic work which is similar to what you babysitter can do. One of the problems is that the costumes are not modest and give the wrong message to the little girls. It’s a known fact that those with less talent show more skin.
Professional entertainers. If you are looking for more elaborate face painting or balloons you will need to hire a professional entertainer. A professional entertainer will provide a much higher quality show. If you choose to hire a professional entertainer be sure they have liability insurance and a business license. The entertainers should show you their insurance certificate and their business license before they are allowed to enter the party. If the business license is in the company name, the entertainer should provide personal identification to you so you know who they are.

, What games will be played?


A good relay race game is called ""Fashion Run"". There are two teams, and each team gets shirts, pants, glasses, hats, jewels, and shoes in a suitcase. The first person puts on everything and runs to the other side of the room and says, ""Happy Birthday, !"" and runs back and takes off everything. When she reaches her team, the next girl goes and does the same. The first team to finish is the winner.
Another game is ""Fashion Hunt"". Divide the guests into teams. Give each team a stack of fashion magazines and a list of fashion items to find in the magazines (Gucci bag, yellow flip flops, etc.). The first team to find all the items on the list is the winning team.
Another activity you can do is designing! You and the other guests at the party can give out paper and have the guests design an article of clothing. The best design wins and can get a prize!
Fashion runway! You can either ask guests to bring something that may seem ""in style"" or ""trending"" at the moment and make some sort of runway for them to display their finds. The runway could be in a hallway, or put a carpet or rug as if to make a runway.

, At a bake store, you can find cookie cutters shaped like shoes, purses, bows, etc. Use them to make fashion-shaped pizza, sandwiches and/or cookies. Remember that little girls can be picky or may have food allergies, so it's important that you have several options. At most kid birthday parties, you'll find juice boxes, mozzarella sticks, veggie/fruit/cheese platters, and some grown-up foods for the adults.

, If you choose to make your own, you could use a shoe-shaped cake pan or plastic Barbie high heels to decorate. Be creative! Add jewels, pink crystal sprinkles, etc.

, Another good idea would be if you made shirts for them with some sort of logo and gave it as a goody bag gift. Or you could make actual shirts at the party. The process is actually really simple. You can get some t-shirt transfers (Avery is a good brand) which can be ironed onto shirts. You design some sort of logo or find an image and print it onto the transfer, but be sure to flip the image so that it's reversed! Then iron on the image onto the shirt. It's a creative idea and lets the guests go home with a memory from the party.

Don't forget the diaper cake!",How to Decorate for a Baby Shower," Before you begin planning, it is necessary to decide on the location of the shower. Knowing how much space is available and what facilities you have to work with will help you to plan your décor.


Showers are often held at the mother-to-be's house, as this makes thing more convenient and comfortable for her (especially if she is heavily pregnant). This leaves you plenty of decorating opportunities, but you may need to discuss your ideas with the mother-to-be and her partner - especially if you plan on doing anything crazy!
If you are hosting the baby shower in a restaurant, be aware that some restaurants will put a limit on how far you can go with decorating or rearranging the furniture, so make sure to speak with the restaurant manager before you make plans.;
, Having a theme for the baby shower can help you to focus your ideas and make your décor look professional and well thought-out. What theme you choose is completely up to you, but here are some ideas:



Jungle theme: A jungle or safari theme is popular for baby showers, where the room is decorated in a mixture of greens and yellows and stuffed lions, monkeys and elephants are used to decorate.

Movie theme: Pick the mother-to-be's favorite childhood movie and use it as the theme of the party. For example, a ""Wizard of Oz"" themed party could have a ""yellow-brick road"" leading to the party room, which could be decorated in green for the Emerald City. You could even present the expecting mother with comfy ruby slippers upon her arrival!

Carnival/circus theme: A carnival or circus theme could be decorated with bright colors, have popcorn and candy-floss makers and have games like ring toss and rubber duck races.

, If a theme seems like too much effort you could simply choose a color scheme for your décor.


Staying within a particular color scheme can help to focus your party planning, making it easy to pick the color of decorations, from table clothes and napkins, to flowers and candles, to cakes and confetti.
You could go with a classic theme of ""It's a boy!"" or ""It's a girl"", where you turn the room into an explosion of pink or blue. Some mothers-to-be will like this traditional approach, while others might prefer something a bit different.
If this is the case (or the sex of the baby is unknown) go for a more gender neutral color like yellow or green, or decorate with an even mixture of pink and blue.
Going with an all-white theme is another very classy option, perfect for outdoor garden parties or understated restaurants.
You could also consider matching the color scheme of the shower with the color scheme in the expected baby's bedroom.

, The next thing you have to consider is your budget, as this will dictate (to an extent) how elaborate you can afford to be with your decorations.


Make sure to take everything into account - food, drinks, gifts, party favors, balloons, games - the more detailed your budget is, the lower the chance of overspending.
When shopping for decorations, make sure to shop around. There can be a huge variation in the price of baby shower decorations, depending on where you buy. Look in party supply stores, dollar stores and online before you make a final decision.
Think about where you can save money - borrow any cake stands, candle holders or other tableware from friends and family - maybe your grandmother has an old china tea set you could use for an English tea party theme?
Or if you're particularly crafty, you could consider making some of the decorations yourself. You could knit some baby booties, crochet a baby blanket or make a photo collage from pictures of the mother and father-to-be as babies.
Even if you're on a tight budget, you can still host an amazing baby shower -- you just need to be a little thrifty by shopping around, making and borrowing!

, All of this planning and preparation takes time - so make sure to start getting organized well in advance of the day itself. The last thing you want is to stress yourself out by leaving everything until the last minute.


Being disorganized will only lead to stress-shopping, where you will inevitably spend a lot more money than you originally intended. You may also have difficulty finding the things you need at the last minute, which could throw the entire theme of the party off.
You should also be sure to leave yourself enough time on the day of the party itself. Get to the location well in advance of the starting time. If you're hosting at the mother-to-be's house, try to make sure she's out of the house or at least stays in another room.
Consider the possibility that you may need to vacuum, dust, mop and clean bathrooms (or hire somebody else to do it) before the event, as you don't want the mother-to-be stressing about having a clean house.

, Aside from the room the party is being held in, you should consider decorating the outside of the house (or restaurant, if possible) to mark the location of the baby shower for guests and to get the party atmosphere started from the get-go.


Make a cute picket sign that says something like ""This Way to Baby Shower!"", ""Ashley's Baby Shower"" or even ""It's a Boy/Girl!"".
Place bunches of colored helium balloons (fitting with the theme of your party) around the sign, or at the front door.
Hang door banners above the front door and the door leading to the party. You can get personalized ones with the mother's name (or the baby's, if she has chosen it) at your local gift shop.

, Beside the entrance to the party you will need two things - a baby shower guestbook and a table for gifts.


The baby shower guestbook (which can be a special store-bought one or just a cute notebook) is an important feature of the party. In it, each guest can write their best wishes for the mother-to-be and her baby, along with any parenting tips or funny anecdotes about their own experiences as mothers.
Place the guestbook, along with some nice writing pens, on a small table just inside the door. Leave it propped open so guests can easily see what it's for (or maybe even make a little sign to explain).
Cover the table with a nice cloth and decorate it with baby shower confetti, a vase of flowers, a hurricane with floating candles, some baby toys or whatever fits the theme of the party.
You will also need a separate, larger table where guests can set their gifts down as soon as they walk in the door. You can decorate this table as you see fit - just make sure there will still be enough room for the gifts.
As an alternative to the gift table, you could place a crib or baby stroller beside the door for guests to place their gifts in instead. The crib or stroller could be borrowed from somebody else, or be a gift to the mother-to-be itself.

, The walls and ceiling are the next thing you'll need to think about. Things like streamers, wall hangings and mobiles can really transform the look of the room and make the baby shower extra special.


Themed baby shower streamers are available from most party supply stores, in a vast array of colors and designs. Alternatively, you could make your own flag garland from scraps of colored or patterned fabric, for a more personal, traditional touch.
Another very cute idea is to hang a clothesline from one side of the room to the other and use safety pins or old-fashioned clothes pegs to hang baby clothes such as baby grows, booties, socks and bibs.
Another option is to hang mobiles from the ceiling - these can be actual baby mobiles, or paper ones in the shape of flowers, hearts or baby accessories like rattles, baby bottles and pacifiers.
For the walls, you can hang more banners or flag garlands, put up framed photographs of the mother and father-to-be as babies, or hang posters related to your theme, such as stills from specific films (for movie themes), or images of baby animals (for jungle themes).
Another great idea is to hang swathes of tulle along the walls, from floor to ceiling. This creates a pretty, almost ethereal effect which transforms the entire room. Stringing fairy lights across the tulle will add to this effect even more.

, The table is the centerpiece of the entire shower, so you should put special effort into making it look good.


Make sure the table is large enough to comfortably seat all of the guests and cover it with a nice tablecloth and possibly a table runner in a contrasting color. Sprinkle baby shower confetti over the tablecloth.
Lay any pre-prepared cakes and desserts out on the table, buffet style. Use pretty tiered cake stands to display any cakes, scones, muffins or other treats. A layered cupcake stand filled with frosted cupcakes makes a great centerpiece.
Aside from the food, you can decorate the table with flowers and votive candles. The flowers can be elaborate arrangements from the florist's or simple but beautiful cuttings from the garden, depending on the theme of the party and the time of year.
If you are serving hot food at the party, one cute idea is to place any necessary condiments, such as mustard, mayonnaise or salad dressing, in baby bottles. Just cut the tops of the teats for easier pouring.
Make sure you have enough plates, knives, forks, spoons, glasses and napkins. Polish the silverware if necessary.Then you can either formally set the table, or stack everything to one side until needed.

, As the mother-to-be is the guest of honor, it is important to place her at the head (or center) of the table and to ensure that she is comfortable.


Put her in a larger, more comfortable chair -- preferably one that reclines or has a footstool -- and provide her with as many cushions or pillows as she needs. She will really appreciate this, especially if she is heavily pregnant.
Decorate the chair by tying ribbons or streamers around the legs and by attaching some helium balloons to the armrests. If you like, you can throw a baby blanket over the back of the chair.
One thing that is frequently done at baby showers is to hang or stand an open umbrella above the mother-to-be's chair. Then blue streamers or ribbons are attached to the edges of the umbrella to make ""rain"". It is a baby ""shower"" after all!

, In addition to the visual effect of the decorations, it's important to create a good atmosphere through sound and smell.


Soft, soothing music is usually best for a baby shower. Classical music is always a good option, though certain types of country music can also work. You can even buy or download CD's containing music specifically chosen for baby showers on Amazon.
However, you could also match the music to the theme of the shower. For example, you could play the soundtrack from a movie for a movie-themed shower. Or instead of music you could play sound effects, such as animal sounds for a jungle themed part or the sound of waves and seagulls for a beach themed part.
You can create pleasant smells by burning scented candles or incense, or using oil-based diffusers or air-fresheners. Again, try to match the scent to theme of the party, whether it's the smell of exotic flowers, the seaside breeze or freshly washed cotton sheets.

, Party favors are small gifts you can send home with your guests to thank them for coming. These gifts can be anything you like, though how fancy/expensive they are will depend on your budget and how many guests will be attending the shower.


If you're looking for a more personalized, DIY approach to party favors, you should start collecting mason jars before the shower. Then you can fill each jar with a selection of chocolates (preferably ones that are wrapped in pink or blue foil), wrap a colored ribbon around the lid and attach a label with the guest's name written in calligraphy or cursive script.
As an alternative to chocolates, you could fill the mason jars with colored bath salts. This makes a nice gift, but the jars will also look pretty laid out on the table during the shower.
Another idea is to get each guest a fancy bar of soap, wrap a ribbon around it and attach a note that says ""From our shower to yours"". This is a cute play on the word ""shower"" which is sure to have guests oohing and aahing in appreciation.

, A nice way to add to the baby-centric theme of the party is to decorate the room with toys and other baby accessories.


Scatter things like rattles, plastic keys, bottles and sippy cups, pacifiers and teething rings around the room. Not only will these look cute, the mother-to-be will also find them extremely useful once her baby finally arrives.
You could also use things like alphabet building blocks, train sets, teddy bears and dolls, which the baby will appreciate once he or she gets a bit older!

, When you're busy hosting a baby shower, organizing games, dealing with gifts and making sure everyone has enough to eat and drink, it can be difficult to find the time to take pictures.


Therefore, it's a great idea to buy a bunch of disposable cameras and leave them in strategic locations around the room. At the start of the party, tell the guests to feel free to take as many pictures as they like.
This is a great way to ensure that all of the guests feature in the photos, while also saving you the trouble of trying to chase everyone down. As people won't be able to delete photos they don't like from these non-digital cameras, you're also sure to end up with some hilarious results!
After the shower, you can collect the cameras and have the pictures developed. Pick the best ones and put them in a photo album. Give the photo album to the mother-to-be as a final gift, then she can treasure the memories from her baby shower forever!

, A classic feature of most baby showers is the diaper cake - a tiered masterpiece made almost entirely from diapers. It's not edible, but it will certainly come in useful when the baby arrives!


You can buy very sophisticated looking diaper cakes online, but these can be quite pricey. It's actually pretty to make a diaper cake yourself - all you need are diapers, rubber bands and some decorative ribbons and bows. See a how-to guide here.
Another, similar idea is to create a baby sock bouquet. This is done by rolling up tiny baby socks, attaching a piece of wire and wrapping it in green tissue paper to form a ""rose"". Like the diaper cake, the baby sock bouquet makes a fun yet functional centerpiece. See a how-to guide here.

Don’t get so lost in playing the host that you forget to have fun. Remember, this is your celebration so enjoy!;
, No need to exclude them from all the fun. Involve the spouse and even the kids when considering ideas. Perhaps they already had some thoughts in mind, but if not, think of ways everyone can be part of the big day.


Head to a beautiful park and have the event catered by the best restaurant in town. This way, kids can go wild while the adults visit and reminisce.

Pick a theme.,
Talk to everyone.,
Tell jokes.,
Include the kids.",How to Breathe Life Into a Boring Party1," Throwing a theme party is a great way to liven things up from the get go! If you didn’t plan for this ahead, let your guests help pick a theme for the night. This is an easy way to get people talking and set a creative and fun atmosphere for your party. Later on you can keep the fun going by holding a contest for best costume or most enthusiastic guest!


Break out some extra sheets and turn your boring party into a toga party, or pull out Halloween decorations and turn the party into a costume party.;
, If things are getting a little too quiet, it’s both polite and helpful to touch base with each of your guests. You can be the social mixer that gets everyone engaged in good conversation. Try to get different groups of people to talk to each other, the more intermingling between guests, the better the conversation flow tends to be.


People love to talk about themselves. Try sparking conversations with questions like ""How are things at work?"" ""Did you see the latest blockbuster?"" Or ""How did your vacation go, would you recommend the hotel you stayed in?""
People also love talking about food. Try asking different groups of people things like ""Where is the best pizza joint around here?"" Or start a debate about the best restaurant to take a first date. Either way, things like this will definitely get people chatting.

, Everyone enjoys a good laugh, quickly liven things up with a few tasteful jokes. Encourage your guests to chime in, or have a quick contest to see who can come up with the best wisecracks. With willing participants, you can even hold your very own roast session on someone. Someone with a great sense of humor can save any dull situation.

, If applicable, kids are natural born entertainers and can work wonders for a lull in party entertainment. If your party is turning into a gathering of awkward silences, divert everyone’s attention to the kids as they put on a play, sing, or dance for you. Who can resist a youngster's rendition of the Frozen soundtrack?

Chase up any stragglers to confirm their attendance or otherwise.;
, Know what you're making from scratch and what you're buying ready-made. List the ingredients needed and the items to buy, in readiness for the shop prior to the party.


If ordering anything, such as a cake or dessert, book it early in the week, with the day of the party as the pick-up date.
When planning food to make at home, favor items that can be made the day before. It makes your party day a whole lot easier.

, If it needs a wash or clean, deal with it now. If accessories are missing, such as tights or headbands, get them now. If you need new anything, buy them early in the week.


If buying new shoes for the party, wear them in a little each day before the party, so that they won't hurt your feet at the party.
If your hair needs styling or cutting, get this organized. Either do it earlier if it's just a cut or book an appointment very early on the morning of the party if you want a style for the party.
Check your makeup supplies and replenish as needed.

, If you don't have the decorations, write a list of what's needed, then head out early to collect these. Getting this out of the way early saves last-minute stress.


If making your own party decorations, start early and finish them on time.

, If these are going to be collected by someone else, let that person know in advance what they need to get––email or text them the list. Set a firm time for delivery, preferably the day before the party.

, Pull it all together before the day of the party, ensuring that there is plenty of music and it's all music you want heard.


Organize the music playing device and speakers, to be sure it's all available as needed.

, This includes DVDs (and player), a movie selection off a movie service provider (and TV), video games (and consoles), party games, prizes for games, dress-up clothes, goody bags, etc.


If making goody bags, plan what is to go inside them, what sort of bags you'll use and decorative additions. Purchase these items early in the week rather than when shopping for food.

, This also includes drink space.

, Using the list you created, buy the items needed to make food. Doing this a day ahead gives you plenty of time to find substitutes or visit other stores if anything you need is missing. It also takes the weight off you on the day of the party.

, This relieves a lot of pressure as the food will be ready to simply place out on the day of the party.


Warn other members of the house not to touch any of the party food.
Have a simple meal the night before the party, or even takeout, to avoid making more mess in the kitchen.

, It should be completely ready by now, cleaned, ironed, etc. Place it somewhere safe in your room and forget about it until the next day.


Check that you have makeup, hair accessories, etc., as needed too.

, If it's possible, do it the day before as it gives you plenty of time to make it perfect. If you spot anything missing, you've still plenty of time to fix this.


Ask other members of the household to stay away from the decorated area and be sure to keep the pets out too.
If planning a sleepover, clear out the space intended for the sleeping bags and guests.

, If you're having goody bags, make these up the day before. These can be a bit finicky, so they're best done while you still have plenty of time.

, Do a test run of playlists, DVD player, video game equipment, etc., just to be sure it's all in good working order. Set these items up as needed.

, This will give you plenty of time to relax and wake up refreshed for party day.

, Do this as early in the day as possible, to get it done and to allow for time to mend any stuff-ups.

, Do this as early as possible or at least set up stations for preparing last-minute foods that only work when made fresh. Have everything arranged neatly.


Double check space for drinks. If you need iceboxes with ice, have someone go out and fetch the ice just prior to the party and stick the drinks inside.

, If you've already decorated, just check that you're happy with it.


At this stage, also set up anything needed for the party games and activities. This might include setting up a game-playing area, a salon/makeover area, a movie-watching area, a board game area, etc.

, If you're having music, playing video games or DVDs, set these items up a few hours before the party starts.

, If you wear makeup, plan your time accordingly.

, You'll enjoy taking photos of the set-up of the party, then of everyone having fun at the party.


Upload the photos to Facebook, Instagram or anywhere else you prefer.

, With all of your careful planning, you should be calm and collected by now, and ready to meet your guests with enthusiasm. It's a great way to get the party started.

, You've earned it.

Follow along with the music.,
Enjoy being in the crowd.,
Learn a few break dance moves.,
Use your whole body.,
Follow the other dancers.,
Learn a basic rave move to fall back on.",How to Dance at a Rave2," You can take dancing inspiration from yourself and others. Raves are supposed to allow for spontaneous outburst of energy. Dance the way the music tells you, not the way others think you should.


Some rave music is fast and encourages quick, fast-paced moves, while other rave music is more trance-like and is good for swaying more slowly. Let the beat of the music at the rave inspire how you dance and follow the basic beats of the music to stay in time.

, Try to be one with the crowd. Dance in a similar rhythm and style to the rest of the crowd.The more you worry about the way you look the less fun you will have. You don’t need to copy what everyone else is doing but it’s good to stay in rhythm with the crowd. Many ravers use a drug called MDMA. MDMA (short for 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine) is a powerful stimulant drug that produces intense feelings of euphoria and bliss. Legality of MDMA use differs depending on where you live, but it's generally an illegal drug. You will find that the desire to move around and dance comes naturally while under the influence of this drug, but remember to stay hydrated as it does increase your body temperature and encourage you to exert yourself more than you may be used to. Amphetamines are a powerful drug and could send you driving off across Nebraska if you aren’t careful.

, Lots of dance moves popular with ravers are based on break dancing moves, so learn a few basic break dance moves to dance at a rave like a veteran. Raves tend to be crowded, so don't plan on performing any moves that require you to be on the ground or on your hands. Focus on getting a few hand and head movements down and learning a few basic steps.


For example, one popular move is the toprock. Starting walking in place. Now with the beat, start walking in place while rocking back and forth between your toes and your heels. Once you've done this, start crossing your legs in front of each other as your walking. Think of it as an exaggerated walk.

, Unlike other styles of dance that use only the lower body and require the upper body to stay still, rave dancing incorporates your arms, legs and whole body. Put all of yourself into your dancing and don't be afraid to move your whole body to the beat.

, Rave dancers often imitate one another and cause a dance craze that encompasses the whole rave, so look to the other dancers around you for inspiration. If there is a specific arm movement that the other dancers are doing to a particular song, give it a try. You might like it, and at the very least you'll look like you know what you're doing.

, The whole point of a rave is that it is unscripted street dance. For that reason, it’s sort of silly to describe certain moves to use. However, you might feel comfortable knowing one dance move that you can always do if you feel lost. The Melbourne Shuffle is a popular move that involves a fast heel to toe movement as you shuffle side to side. Watch a video of the dance and imitate! The Melbourne Shuffle is easy enough. Start by doing the running man, which is just an exaggerated walk where you do a quick back leg lunge on each step. Now, instead of doing a back leg lunge, take your planted leg and hop back. As you hop back, tap the toe of your lifted foot to the ground. Those are the basics of the Melbourne Shuffle.

"
"
Try to remain in the liminal space.,
Respect your fellow dancers.,
Don’t take your shirt off.,
Never get physical.",How to Dance at a Rave3," Everyone should have their own dance experience. Enjoy the moment without interfering with others ability to enjoy it too. Don’t try to rub up against someone or dance so wildly that you run into others. Rave dance floors tend to be packed and other dancers could dance enthusiastically, so respect their space as you'd like them to respect yours. Bumping into other dancers is unavoidable, but try to keep your arm and hand movements in a proximity that still allows dancers around you to move freely.

, You have to respect peoples personalities as well as their space. Don’t make fun of anyone or pass judgment on a fellow raver. You’re all in this together.

, You wouldn’t want to accidently rub against anyone else’s sweaty body, so don’t subject a stranger to that. Keep your shirt on.

, Even if you feel like someone is violating your space, just walk away. Don’t push someone or initiate violence. In such a small crowded space that can lead to a lot of people getting hurt, not just you and your opponent. "

Leave the country.,
Hop on a cruise ship.,
Take in a concert.,
Book a fishing trip.,
Indulge in the extraordinary.",How to Celebrate a Fortieth Birthday2," Many get to 40 and realize they never got a stamp in their passport. Whether it be to Rome or London, Tokyo or Buenos Aires, now is the time to go! You may already have a place in mind but if not, do some research. Peruse traveling blogs and ask lots of friends and co-workers for suggestions.


Figure out if there will be any special festivals or holidays happening around birthday time at the desired destination. When you arrive, it will feel like the whole country is celebrating with you.
If you’re nervous about venturing into the unknown, take a couple of friends with you. Who would turn down a vacation to an exotic spot?

, Cruises are one of the easiest ways to travel and are a ton of fun. Find the company that offers the accommodations you’re looking for. Consider adult-only or child-friendly ships, for example, depending on preference. Cruises are great as they can be short 3-day excursions or a couple of weeks long. Plus, they’re like a city on water complete with casinos, shopping, clubs and multiple dining options.


With this choice, you can visit more than one city and get more bang for your buck.
Not sure what to take on board? Ask lots of questions before booking a ticket.

, Research where your favorite band will be playing and meet them on the road. You could even follow them for a few days and relive your groupie days.


Dig out the old t-shirt you've kept in the garage for just this occasion.

, What a relaxing way to spend your birthday. Imagine hanging out on a gorgeous boat in the middle of the ocean all day with those you care about most and reeling in dinner.


After fishing, camp under the stars and cook the day's catch on the grill.

, You only turn 40 once so go all out if that’s your personality. Find something that will get your blood pumping and really make you feel alive. Head to the jungles or Africa for a safari and get up close and personal with an elephant. Feel the need for speed? Head up to the top of the stratosphere in Vegas and bungee jump! The pictures will be hilarious and the experience unforgettable.

Get a tattoo.,
Change your look.,
Give yourself a present.,
Volunteer.",How to Celebrate a Fortieth Birthday3," Mark the milestone with permanent ink. Whether your first or 15th, what a great way to remember this time in your life. Choose something that truly fits your personality and be creative.


Find something you like but personalize it to make it special and unique.Ask the artist to design a one-of-a-kind piece. This could involve lots of time, but you want to be absolutely happy with it…forever.

, If you have had the same haircut since junior year in college or the same pair of glasses, switch it up a bit. Making a small tweak like this will give you an added boost of energy you didn’t know you were missing.


Don’t get carried away and reinvent who you are (unless you want to). A small change will do the trick.

, Rather than waiting on others to spoil you, treat yourself to a phenomenal gift. It’s your birthday and you deserve to have exactly what you want.


Think outside the box too. Maybe all you want for your birthday is to finally finish writing that novel you started 10 years ago. Dig it out, dust it off and get to work.
This doesn’t have to be extravagant to be special. Instead, adopt a pet from the local shelter or splurge on a killer pair of heels or golf clubs you’ve had your eye on.

, As a mature adult who is closing in on 40, you understand the benefits of giving back to the community. It’s also a fantastic way to meet new people and create experiences you might have missed out on.There are dozens of organizations out there that can use your help and skills. Find something that fits your personality and schedule.
Volunteering doesn’t have to be a boring chore so do something fun. All work and no play will make for a dull birthday.

Play drinking games.,
Pull out some board games.,
Change the music.,
Shake a leg.,
Put on a fashion show.,
Finish with a flourish.",How to Breathe Life Into a Boring Party2," If you’re hosting a party with alcoholic beverages, drinking games are a great way to break the silence and get people to interact with other guests. There are many kinds of games to choose from, or you can make up your own! Either way they are sure to break the ice and bring on the laughs.


If no one at the party knows a game off hand, create your own by turning on a movie or TV show and taking a sip whenever the main character says a particular word. Or, designate a certain word or phrase commonly used to be off limits. Anyone who says the word or phrase has to take a sip.
If you have a deck of cards the possibilities are endless. Try piling the cards face down in the middle of your guests to draw from. Have your guests help create a rule for each card. For instance, drawing a King means that person gets to decide how many sips the guest to their left has to take, drawing a 2 means the person who drew the card has take two sips, etc. Get creative with the rules and have fun!

, Games in general bring life to any dying party, you don’t have to have alcohol for a good game to shake things up! Go for unconventional methods of playing conventional games. Or simply buy a fun game from the store, there are many affordable party games to choose from such as Pictionary, or Cards Against Humanity. Of course you can always have fun creating your own game together!, Music sets the mood for everything! Finding the right kind of music can act as a shot of adrenaline for any flat-lining party. Pay attention to your guests, change up your playlist until they start to react. Some of your guests might even start to dance or sing along to a certain song or artist, that’s how you’ll know you’ve hit the right tunes to turn things around!


If you've been playing your favorite country songs, try switching to pop or contemporary. If you're hosting an older crowd, rock or hits from the 80's might be a hit.

, Once you know you’ve got the right music for your party, encourage your guests to get up and dance, this will help guests at a stuffy party loosen and really let their hair down. The easiest way to accomplish this is to be the first one on the dance floor!

, Many people enjoy looking their best for any social gathering, chances are you've got some fashionistas in attendance. Try to spice up a drab party by having your guests put on a silly fashion show and strut their stuff down a makeshift runway, then vote for the best model. This will keep both participants and nonparticipants well entertained and makes for a great photo opportunity to look back on!

, An impressive party is one that has a memorable conclusion. A warm goodbye and invitation to future events makes your guests feel welcome and sends them home feeling they had a great time, even if things needed some reviving along the way.


A memorable farewell can be as simple as a toast to the end of the party, a warm hug goodbye, or sending everyone off with a small parting gift (a bottle of wine or a small bag of candy.)

,  For more permanent installations, use a pulley system and cleats on the wall so the line can be lowered.

,  Purchased in various colors from party supply store in 25 foot rolls.

, Start with the center colors and staple the gossamer around the cord.  Space next roll approximately 6-8"" from the first (~2 fist lengths).

,  Lay 2 strips of black gossamer (19"" wide) side by side and attach together with tape or staples.  Lay another 2 strips on the ground and attach together.  Place the created strips on top of each other.

,  Curling ribbon can act as scaffolding or a support for the gossamer. Tye it to the arch and tape it to the wall above the door.  Use staples and blue painter's tape where necessary.  For stability, tie the arch to a folding chair and/or the door frame for stability.


The purpose of the covered arch was to prevent the guests from being able to see the room decorations until they walk through the entry.

,  Criss-cross gossamer over the top of the tent so that it drapes down over the legs of the tent or just tie it to the framework and let it hang down the legs.

,, Let them hang down along the back and/or sides.

,  Hang paper lamps with small battery powered lights from the center pole of front of the tent.

,  Place scrunched up gossamer in the center of the table.  Small cardboard boxes can be used as risers and covered with similar colored gossamer.

Find friends and family willing to have a tailgate party with you.,
Ensure that at least one person going has a car large enough to cope with all the things you're likely to need to take.,
Figure out a list of food, drinks, and other items that people will be bringing.,
Plan the food.,
Get to the parking lot early.,
Set up any equipment.,
Have fun, get into conversations with other tailgaters, and enjoy the party.,
Clean up after the party.",How to Throw a Tailgate Party," Be sure to tee this up with them in plenty of time to ensure you can all get tickets to the game. It also helps if you're able to all show up at the venue at roughly the same time, or even together, so you might like to arrange to meet at one house first and drive to the venue as a group.;
, The type of things needed will include folding furniture, keg, etc.

, This part is important because good planning in advance will ensure that everything goes smoothly and that all people participating are catered for adequately. It also means that the effort gets to be shared around as each person brings along something.


Check the rules of the venue as to having alcohol, glass containers or kegs. Rules will vary depending on the venue. Plastic cups are probably a safe bet if alcohol is allowed.
Find out if there are going to be any kids so that there can be juice or soda for them, along with any food they'd prefer eating.
Use containers to keep everything in the right place. All of the dry items such as plates, napkins, and utensils can be carried in a plastic bin.
Don't forget to bring along bottle openers, garbage bags, ice, water, sun protection, and small plastic bags for taking home leftovers. Condiments, mustard, sauces, and salt and pepper are important items to bring along too!
Keep all cold and cooked foods in a cooler or thermal tray to keep them at a safe temperature. Perishables like meats should go into one cooler. Veggies and drinks should go in a second cooler.
If you're in the dark, consider using night lights.

, While it's up to you what you'd like to have, it's recommended that the foods chosen either be ready to eat or take no more than 15 minutes at the most to cook - keep it quick and easy. Suggested suitable foods for tailgate parties include:


Barbecued steak, chicken, hot dogs, sausages, hamburgers, kebabs, one-pot-meals (chili, macaroni cheese), etc.
Snacks such as buffalo wings (pre-made), hero meatball sandwiches, dips, corn chips, nachos, pretzels, etc.

Potato salad, coleslaw, bean salad, or other salads.
Goodies for the kids, such as football shaped sandwiches, football cookies and football cupcakes.
Soda, juice, water, alcohol, hot drinks - hot drinks are as important as cold in the cold weather; coffee, mulled cider, hot cocoa, etc.
Cook or bake ahead where possible. Items such as baked potatoes will benefit from being cooked in advance and only needing to be heated up rather than cooked on the day.

, It's nice if two vehicles come together and pick parking spaces right next to each other. Call the people who are coming and tell them where you are if they're not already with you.


Be aware that it does need to be in the parking lot of the designated event, not any random parking lot.

, Start the barbecue grill so that when people show up, the charcoal will be ready to cook straight away.

, Play your favorite music, have a few games like beer pong, and generally live it up. Just don't drink so much that you can't enjoy the game!

, Plan to have enough time to clean and store everything back into the vehicles before the gates open for people to enter the event.


If you didn't manage to get into the event, have a TV or radio with a power converter so that you can continue to enjoy the game from your tailgate party, if permitted. Alternately, you may simply have chosen to not go into the game but to enjoy it from outside the stadium; this allows you to party on for longer!

Plan the food.,
Decorate the venue.",How to Celebrate Your Girlfriend's Birthday1," If possible, you’ll probably want to have the party on your girlfriend’s actual birthday. However, if the day falls during the week, it’s usually best to move it to the weekend so guests don’t have to worry about getting up for school or work in the morning. You can choose the weekend before or after her birthday, depending on which is closest to the actual day.If you’re planning to throw a surprise party, try to pick a date before your girlfriend’s birthday. The further away from the actual day, the less that she’ll be expecting it.;
, In most cases, it’s easiest just to have the party at your or a friend’s house. However, if you want a more formal party, you may want to rent a catering hall or hotel function room. Many restaurants have party rooms available too, which can be convenient if you just want a simple party.You can also opt for a destination party by celebrating your girlfriend’s birthday at a venue that hosts a specific activity, such as a bowling alley, an arcade, or a pottery studio.

, To make the event special for your girlfriend, it helps to come up with a fun theme for the party. It can be something simple, such as her favorite cartoon characters, or something more elaborate. In warm weather, you might hold the party outdoors and go with a tropical theme where all the guests wear Hawaiian shirts. If she’s a fan of gambling, you might choose a Monte Carlo or Las Vegas theme. Tailor it to your girlfriend’s specific interests.After you choose a theme, don’t just make the decorations match it. Have all of the elements, including the food, entertainment, and music, fit it as closely as possible.
If there’s a movie that your girlfriend loves, make that the theme of the party. Have all the guests dress up as characters from the film.
A carnival theme can be fun. Make fair-worthy foods, such as corn dogs, snow cones, and popcorn, and set up some games, such as a ring toss.
A murder mystery party is a fun idea if your girlfriend likes detective stories. Let the guests know ahead of time, though, so they can get in character and dress up.

, Once you have the date, venue, and theme decided, you can start to invite guests. Create a list of all the people that your girlfriend would want at the party, such as family, friends, co-workers, and classmates. It’s a good idea to get her input on the list so you know that everyone who she wants to celebrate will be there. The easiest way to send invitations is through an email invitation site, such as Evite, because you don’t have to worry about postage.For a surprise party, ask your girlfriend’s close friends and family to help you come up with the guest list so you don’t miss anyone.
If you’re going with email invitations, make sure that you have email addresses for everyone on the guest list.
You can also invite guests more informally, such as through phone calls or text messages.

, When it comes to food for a party, a buffet-style setup is usually the best bet. If you’re doing a theme party, you may want to tailor the food to fit the theme. You can also create a menu based on your girlfriend’s favorite foods.Making the food yourself can add a personal touch to your girlfriend’s party.
If you don’t want to cook for a large group, consider having the party catered from your girlfriend’s favorite restaurant.
You can also opt for easy to prepare foods from the grocery store, such as frozen appetizers.
If you’re on a budget, just go with simple snacks foods for the party. Put out bowls of chips, pretzels, and some dip. A platter of vegetables is also a good option.
Don’t forget beverages. Set up a bar area with bottles of soda, water, juice, some alcoholic beverages if your girlfriend and the guests are of legal drinking age, ice, and plastic cups so guests can help themselves.

, If you’re holding a theme party for your girlfriend, you can choose decorations that help bring it to life. For example, for a tropical theme party, you might hang tiki lights outside. For a general party, you can’t go wrong with the old standards of balloons and streamers.Party supply stores have decorations to fit a wide range of themes, so you can find the perfect options for your girlfriend’s party.
If you’re going for a low-key party, you may want to forgo decorations and just hang a Happy Birthday banner.

"
Send out invitations 3-4 weeks before the party.,
Tidy up your house and yard.,
Borrow additional seating, if needed.,
Develop a contingency plan for inclement weather.",How to Throw a Fourth of July Party1," Avoid waiting until the last minute to invite friends and family. They might have made other plans for the day and won’t be able to make it.


If you are mailing your invites, send them at least 4 weeks in advance to allow for potential delivery delays.
Alternatively, you can send free electronic invitations through an online site like Evite.Electronic invites are great when time is running out because they’ll arrive almost immediately!;
, Make sure your guests will be comfortable by cleaning your home and completing any necessary yard work a few days prior to the party.

, Depending on how many people you’ve invited to your Fourth of July celebration, you might need more seating or tables. Save some money and borrow what you can from friends or neighbors.Lawn chairs and folding tables work great both inside and outdoors.
You can also encourage your guests to bring picnic blankets to sit on outside.

, Make plans ahead of time to move the party indoors in case the weather turns bad on the Fourth of July.


Push furniture against the walls, if needed, to create more space for guests to mingle inside.
Choose an alternate cooking method for any food that would have been grilled outside. Indoor griddles or grill pans are one option.
Plan to watch a televised fireworks display if rain or thunderstorms prevent you from doing your own fireworks or attending another live show.

"
"
When your guests arrive, greet them warmly at the door - take their jackets and compliment their appearance.,
When introducing them to one another, add a small piece of personal information about them.,
When you are planning a menu (a meal or just snacks), make sure you consider your guests dietary needs, even if it means offering an alternative dish - the thought will go far and will leave a much more pleasant feeling than an empty belly.,
Same considerations should be shown for beverages.,
Make an inclusive toast that mentions the friendships in the room.,
At the end of the meal/party, present each guest with a token favour.,
Ensure each guest takes their coat and bag.,
Ensure they have a safe way to get home.,
Finally thank them for coming.",How to Honor Your Party Guests," Thank them for attending - in particular, if they have traveled a long distance to help celebrate (considering the event - across town is far for a dinner party, from the country areas is far for a birthday party while interstate or overseas is distant for a wedding, etc.) Remember, if they weren't there, it wouldn't be a party.;
, (eg. instead of ""Sarah, this is John; John, this is Sarah"", try ""Sarah, this is John, he likes to rock climbing and watching grass grow; John, this is Sarah, she has a pet rock and plants grass in her back yard"".) Memorable and relevant information is better than ""John this is Sarah, she is a vegetarian. Sarah, John is a butcher who could probably show you the best way to slaughter a cow.""

, This goes for dessert too - if you have a gluten intolerant guest, think about having meringue for dessert rather than cake, etc.

, If you have a friend who doesn't drink alcohol, consider buying some top range juice cocktail or cafe blend coffee beans. If you are happy to spend $20 on a bottle of wine for 4-5 glasses, why not spend $10 on some good coffee beans, which will have leftovers after the party (and could assist in the recovery the next day)?

, Keep it short and simple but make sure you think about it.

, Truffles, as suggested by Cassi from Chocolate Creations (see above), are a good option; mini cakes or little cup cakes are a good idea, too; but once again, consider dietary needs.

, Nothing worse than getting home to find you left your house keys in the pocket of your jacket in your friends dining room on the other side of town.

, Offer them a lift to the train station or a few of you walk them to the bus stop and wait with them. Don't let friends who have been drinking drive home; order them a taxi or a place to sleep.

, Your party/celebration wouldn't have happened without them. Make sure they know they were appreciated, not just another number to fill the house.

Figure out what type of party you want.,
Invite your friends, making sure you only invite as many people as you can manage.,
Let people know what to expect in the invitation, often with a dress code.,
Clean the house thoroughly before people arrive if you are not hiring a venue.,
Make sure you have enough food for the entire party if you are serving food.,
Have a variety of drinks on hand.,
Give yourself 1-2 hours more to prepare than you think you need.",How to Host a Good Party1," Having a guiding principle will make all the rest of your decisions simple and easy. Are you hosting a themed dinner party, or a blow-out with all of your friends? Do you want something small and intimate or the big banger that no one forgets. Ask yourself what kind of party you want to host before doing anything else -- this will help you decide who to invite, what to buy, and what to prepare., When sending out invitations, assume everyone is going to say yes instead of inviting tons of people and hoping only a set amount can make it. You can always send out more invitations later. Asking for an RSVP is a great way to help you plan food, drinks, and party events.


Let people know if they can bring their families or friends with a ""plus one"" or ""family and friends invited"" attached to the email, card, or event notification.
Consider the type of party you want when sending invitations. If you want close conversation, you may want to limit it to 8-12 people. If you want a big, raging party you'll go much bigger.

, If you're having a classy party, let them know that it is ""black tie,"" or ""formal."" If it's a loose, casual party, you can tell them to ""come as they will,"" or ""be ready to party."" Try and use language that conveys the type of party you want so that no one gets surprised.


For example, if you're throwing a Halloween party, most people appreciate knowing upfront if they should wear a fancy dress costume or not.
You don't have to be obvious with the dress code. Describing the party as a ""evening to catch up and share a nice dinner"" clearly lets people know that they shouldn't wear glitter and a crop top, unless they want to., Don't give your guests any reason to think they're imposing or intruding on your life. If you don't want people in certain rooms, simply close the doors, and leave the rest of the doors open. Stock the guest bathroom with extra toilet paper, in plain sight, and make sure that there is a clean room where people can put their coats and other things. Finally, if you're using your own dishes, make sure they are all clean and ready to eat off of.


Make sure there is ample seating for everyone unless you're having a rave up dance party or an outdoor picnic party.
Decorations aren't required for a good party, but they help create the party atmosphere. If you're going to put them up, however, make sure they are up well in advance.
If you're throwing a big party, remove anything delicate or breakable in advance to avoid costly and embarrassing mishaps., You should have food out for the entirety of the party, especially if there is drinking involved. This can be simple, like bowls of chips and dips, cheese and crackers, and pre-made veggie plates. If you're hosting a meal, put out these little snacks to hold your guests over while the courses come out. Don't feel, however, like you need to cook all day to throw a great party. You can always buy pre-prepared foods or simple things that you just warm up in the oven.


Don't put out all of your food at once. Fill up a few bowls, then refill them as the party needs.
Anticipate any dietary restrictions in advance. If you're unsure, make sure you have a gluten-free, (like veggies or rice crackers) kosher food, halal food, and vegetarian substitutes available. Consider anything containing nuts is labelled for those with nut allergies.
If you're cooking, give yourself ample time to prepare, and always cook more food than you think you'll need. Plan for an extra 2-3 guests to prevent running out., If you're having a mixture of ages, a couple of sodas and juices should be with the alcohol. It is often best to have at least two types of alcohol available as well to accommodate different tastes, such as beer and wine, mixed drinks and champagne, beer and spirits, etc. Ice and lemon can be appropriate too.


Depending on the type of party, you may want to think about where the drinks go. It is often best to keep hard alcohol out of sight but accessible, with less alcoholic beverages like beer open and in plain sight to prevent over-drinking too early., At the end of the day, you'll realize you forgot napkins, the appetizers might burn, or you'll forget that you need to shower and get dressed as well! Take the stress off yourself by building in a nice little buffer between your first guest arriving and your final preparations. If you seem relaxed and together when the guests arrive, they'll be relaxed too."

Start early.,
Decide what food to serve.,
Use word of mouth to tell friends about the cookout.,
Email and call friends you don’t see regularly.,
Get friends of friends on board.,
Use social message to get out your message.,
Find a couple of people to judge.",How to Hold a Cook Off1," Invite friends and family to the cook off at least two weeks before you are planning on hosting it. This way they will be more likely to attend, and they will know not to make other plans for the day of the cook off., Before inviting guests, you should decide what dish or dishes you want for your cook off. You can either ask your guests to make a variety of dishes or you can hold a cook-off that features only one kind of dish. There are upsides and downsides to both.If you are holding a cook off with only one kind of dish, it makes it easier to judge the dishes against each other, but there won’t be as much variety for your guests.
If you host a cook off with different dishes, it makes it harder to judge, but your guests will leave feeling that they have had a full, satisfying meal.
Common cook off foods are chili and barbecue. Try to pick food that is tasty, but that isn’t that difficult to make.
You can make categories like “sides”, “entrees” and “deserts” to judge by if you don’t want everyone to cook the same food.

, Tell any friends or family that you see at work, school or social events. Say that you are interested in organizing a cookout. Give them the date for the cookout and ask if they can make it.


Say something like, “I’m thinking of hosting a cookout on Saturday the 14th! It would be great if you could be there, either as a cook or a guest. Do you think you’ll be able to come?”

, You might not be able to see all your potential cookout guests in person. If there are people that you want to invite but don’t see on a daily basis, email or call them. Tell them about the cookout as well as the date and time you have in mind, and see if they want to come., It could be that your friends know people who are fabulous cooks! When you are contacting friends and family, tell them to feel free to invite anyone they think would be interested., Make a post on Facebook or another social media site to spread the word about your cook off. Even if you have contacted all of your closest friends, there probably are other people that you can reach through social media who would be interested.Post something like, “I’m holding a cook off scheduled for Saturday the 14th! Let me know if you’d like to participate or come as a guest to sample some delicious food!”
If you want to keep the cook off small and you think you already have enough people coming, you can hold off on posting on social media.

, Since the cook off is a competition, you will need to have someone to judge. Find someone, or a couple of people, who are chefs, restaurant owners, or have some kind of job or experience in the food industry. You can offer them an incentive like a gift card or small amount of money to judge the cook off.If you cannot find anyone, instead plan to have all your guests act as judges by casting their votes for their favorite dish.

Visit the outdoors.",How to Celebrate Your Girlfriend's Birthday2," If you want to keep your celebration quiet and simple, plan an evening out at your girlfriend’s favorite restaurant. To make the occasion special, though, don’t choose a place that you go to often. Opt for a fancier restaurant that the two of your don’t get to go to as often as you’d like.Depending on the restaurant, you may need reservations, so it’s important to plan the celebration with enough advance notice.
When you call for reservations, you might arrange to have the table set up in certain way. For example, you might have flowers sent over so they can be waiting for your girlfriend when you arrive.

, If your girlfriend wants a celebration that’s a little bigger but still low-key, arrange to meet some of her friends at a local bar or club. You can choose a locale that has special activities, such as karaoke or trivia contests, that she enjoys, or go with a spot where she can dance the night away if that’s what she prefers.Make the evening more special by planning a “pub crawl.” Pick three or four of your girlfriend’s favorite bars, and map a plan to hit all of them in one night with your friends. Give a copy to everyone in case someone gets lost along the way.

, Plan an evening at a bowling alley, or laser tag or paintball facility. You can leave it just the two of you, but it may be more fun to organize some friends and family to come along and play.If there’s a particular sport that your girlfriend enjoys, such as softball or volleyball, arrange a birthday “tournament” at a local field with friends and family.
Keep things simple by taking a trip to the local batting cage or putting green.

, A special event is an ideal way to celebrate your girlfriend’s birthday. Buy tickets to a concert for a musician that she’s been dying to see, or take her to see the play or musical that she’s been interested in. If she is a sports fan, get tickets to her favorite team’s game.It’s usually more fun to keep the event that you’re going to a surprise until the night that you’re celebrating.
At some venues, such as a sporting event, you may be able to get a message on the video board wishing your girlfriend a happy birthday to make the night even more special. Check the stadium’s website to learn how to request a message.

, If your girlfriend is someone who loves the outdoors, plan a day where she gets to spend plenty of time out in nature. Plan a hike along a trail that offers spectacular views, or take her to the beach so you can enjoy the sand and surf. If you both enjoy cycling, map out a long bike ride that allows you to see some spots that you don’t visit often. Depending on the season, you might go apple picking or spend the day skiing. Even a picnic in the park can be fun.You don’t just have to stick to an outdoor celebration during the day. Take her out in the evening for some star gazing.

Plan the menu.,
Set the table.,
Prepare the meal.,
Create the right mood.",How to Celebrate Your Girlfriend's Birthday3," The easiest way to decide what to make for your girlfriend’s birthday is to think about her favorite foods and find recipes that you think you can handle. If you’re not an experienced cook, it’s usually best to keep it simple by making a basic pasta dish. To get some inspiration, visit a few cooking websites and skim the recipes until you find the perfect options for your girlfriend.Steak and baked potatoes is a relatively simple meal to prepare, particularly if you cook the meat on a grill. Make the meal a little more special by adding a marinade to the steak, such as soy sauce, lemon and garlic, or a balsamic vinaigrette.
Roast chicken can be an easy recipe to follow if you swap a whole chicken for several individual skin on, bone-in pieces instead. Place them in a baking dish with your favorite marinade and roast until they're brown. Add your girlfriend's favorite vegetable or starch side dish, and you have an elegant, but simple dinner.
Once you have selected the recipes you’ll be using, make a list of ingredients and head to the grocery store. You don’t want to find out that you’re missing an ingredient when you start to prepare the meal.
Don’t forget the cake! If you’re feeling overwhelmed by preparing the meal itself, go with a store-bought option that you know she’ll love.
You don’t necessarily have to make dinner for your girlfriend’s birthday meal. Surprise her with a delicious, homemade breakfast in bed instead.

, It’s not just about the food when you’re planning a birthday dinner for your girlfriend. Make it special by dressing the table up a little more than you would for a normal meal. Use a tablecloth and cloth napkins, and set out the best dinnerware and glasses that you can find. You may also want to add flowers or balloons.If you don’t have a nice tablecloth, napkins, dishes, and glasses, ask a friend or family member if you can borrow some for the evening.
Make the table setting even fancier by learning how to Fold a Cloth Napkin in elegant shapes.

, It’s important to give yourself plenty of time to cook your girlfriend’s birthday meal, so you don’t feel overwhelmed at the last minute. Make sure you know when she’s going to arrive, and consult the recipes to see how long it should take to prepare the food. Add an extra hour or so to the time in case you run into any trouble.If you’re nervous about cooking the meal, ask a friend or family member who has experience in the kitchen to help. Just make sure that your assistant leaves before your girlfriend shows up.

, As the food is cooking, take the time to make sure that you have the right mood to celebrate your girlfriend’s birthday. Dim the lighting, and light some candles on the table and around the room for a more romantic feel. Make a playlist of your girlfriend’s favorite songs, and have it playing when she arrives.If you don’t want to light candles, you can opt for string lights. Hang a few strands throughout the room for soft mood lighting.
Help maintain the perfect mood by making sure that your phone is turned off or on vibrate during the meal. You don’t want any interruptions to ruin the celebration.

Figure out a budget.,
Think of a special destination.,
Make reservations.,
Create a gift box that goes with the destination.",How to Celebrate Your Girlfriend's Birthday4," Trips can be expensive, so it’s important to know how much money you have to spend on a birthday trip for your girlfriend. It’s not just hotel costs that you should think about too -- you’ll need to consider transportation, food, and entertainment expenses as well. Set a firm budget, so you can start to narrow your destination options.You don’t need to have a lot of money to plan a special birthday trip. Even one night away at a bed and breakfast can mean a lot to your girlfriend.

, When you’re choosing a place to take your trip, budget will play a role. However, you should also try to find a destination that will be special for your girlfriend. That may mean taking her somewhere that she’s always wanted to go or taking her back to a place where you’ve shared happy memories before. It can also be as simple as taking her for a weekend to an amusement park that you know she loves. Make the trip all about her, so you know that she’s sure to enjoy it.If you’re having trouble coming up with ideas for your getaway, talk to your girlfriend’s friends and family to see if they have any ideas.

, Once you’ve settled on a destination, you can make hotel reservations and arrange for transportation, such as airline or train tickets. Use a travel site to find the best deals for the area, so you’re sure to stick to your budget. You should also figure out if you need any other reservations for the trip, such as for dinner at a trendy restaurant, tickets for a show, or admittance to a local attraction.Make sure to plan ahead, so you’re not making reservations at the last minute. You may wind up with limited options if you wait too long to plan the trip.
If you’re not sure if you need other reservations, speak to the staff at the hotel. They can usually help you figure out what you might want to plan ahead.

, You’ll want to have something to give to your girlfriend on her birthday, so put together a gift package that hints at the trip’s location. For example, if you’re taking her for a weekend of vineyard tours, put together a basket that includes a map of the area, a couple of bottles of her favorite wine, and a monogrammed wineglass. For a weekend away at the beach, put some sunscreen, sunglasses, flip flops, and a towel inside a beach bag for her.If your destination doesn’t lend itself to a gift box, just print out your itinerary or reservation confirmation, place it in a box, and wrap it for your girlfriend to open.

Spend some time with each guest.,
Keep your guests engaged by checking in periodically.,
Adapt to the party as it evolves.,
Leave the dishes until the next day.",How to Host a Good Party2," Above all, you want to be warm, confident host. Your guests shouldn't feel for a minute like they're stressing or taxing you, or else they will start to feel stressed as well. Drinks will spill, conversation will occasionally stall, and food may run out. That's fine! Just stay friendly and welcoming the entire time, helping your guests feel like they a part of your house and not some burden you have to shoulder., Set the tone of the party with a warm greeting when people arrive. Offer to take coats or jackets and direct them to the right room. It is usually best to let any guests who haven't been over before know where they can get a drink or some food, and point out the guest bathroom. If you can, take some time to talk and converse. If you're cooking or moving around a lot, lead them into the party, hand them a drink, and excuse yourself with a smile., Make an effort, once things calm down and the party is in full swing, to talk with each guest. You'll do a lot of drifting to make sure everyone is engaged and happy, but your guests will be happy that you took the time to see them. This doesn't have to be a systematic movement through the crowd. Just try to have one good, memorable moment with each guest before the night is over., Mix up the conversation groups by introducing people to one another and sliding from one group to another. Find ways to engage shyer guests, or those on the fringes looking at their phones, through conversation and activities. It is your job to steer conversation to new topics if someone is monopolizing the crowd or leaning into unsavory topics.


A good way to mix up groups is to ask someone for some help with something. You can then steer them to a new group when you're done, or make space for someone else to move in.
Enlist very shy friends as assistants. Ask them to help keep the food filled with you or prepare a dish for dinner. They'll appreciate the attention., Everyone may love dancing, loud music, and drinking in the first half of the evening. After dinner, you'll likely notice more people sitting and talking in intimate conversations, or moving away from the dance floor. Feel free to adapt accordingly, putting on calmer music and moving the chairs closer together. Put on a pot of coffee or tea after dessert to entice people to relax. You could also go the opposite direction, too, keeping things calm and conversational until people get a little tipsy, then upping the music to get people out on the dance floor for the second, raging half of the party.

, No one wants to see you scrambling around, cleaning the house while they're still trying to have fun. Make sure that any major messes, like spills, are cleaned up and that there are trash cans for people to deposit empty bottles, cans, and cups, and then relax. Enjoy your own party for a bit and don't worry about cleaning until later.


Cleaning usually signals to others that the party is wrapping up and it is time to go. This could be a nice, subtle way to start pushing people out the door."
"
Always have higher-tempo, upbeat music playing in the background, if appropriate.,
Dim the lighting.,
Provide activities to stimulate conversation and loosen people up.,
Let the vibe grow organically instead of pushing your guests to have fun.",How to Host a Good Party3," For some, choosing party music may be the most difficult decision of the entire party. These days, however, DJing is getting easier and easier with iPods, apps, and music websites. Pick music that is upbeat but not pounding. If you want people dancing, clear out space and play something you want to dance to -- such as electronic, swing, or pop. Moreover, don't be afraid to mix it up if people seem bored, or let a trusted, musically-inclined friend take the reins. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with a Pandora or Songza station set to these classic party genres.



90's Hip-Hop and RnB: If the party is younger-skewing, this is almost always the right move.

Motown and Soul: There are very few people, of any generation, that won't get down to some Temptations or Stevie Wonder. Best for a varied, larger crowd.

Big-Band Jazz and Swing: If you're having a classy dinner or conversational party, Frank Sinatra and Count Basie will get you through every course with aplomb., Use candles, a fireplace, or even Christmas lights to cast a dim, warm glow around the room. Bright lights have the tendency to make people self-conscious, especially if it is not natural sunlight. Good, dim, lighting is one of the best ways to loosen up the party and let people know they can relax and let their hair down.If you can double up your lighting with some nicely scented candles, the smell factor will enhance your party mood even more.

, Games and events bring people together, especially in the awkward early stages of a party. Of course, the activity will depend a lot on the group and the party, from drinking games like pong and king's cup to more tame games like Apples to Apples (or Cards Against Humanity, for raunchy crowds) or a pool table and dart board. You can put the big game on TV or simply play a slideshow silently, giving people something to talk about if conversation lulls. Other ideas include:


Tasting tests or contests with the appetizers.
Introducing people who may have not before.
A set-aside dance floor near the speakers.
Truth or Dare, Never Have I Ever, Desert Island, and similar conversational games.

, The best parties happen when everyone feels comfortable, contributing to the party in their own unique ways. This won't happen if you're constantly trying to make people dance, asking ""are you having fun,"" or pushing games on people who just want to talk. Things will likely not hop into party mode right off the bat, but if people feel comfortable, well fed, and able to drink, the party will kick off on its own.

Pick a location.,
Come up with an entry fee.,
Calculate the cost of the event.,
Make sure you will have the proper cooking equipment for the cook off.,
Make sure you have the rest of the supplies you need.,
Make sure you have access to outlets.,
Send out invitations.",How to Hold a Cook Off2," Another important decision to make is where the cook off will take place. If you feel comfortable hosting the cook off, it may be the most convenient location, since you will be able to prepare and set up in advance. You also can see if there is anyone else attending who would be willing to host.You may want to hold the cook off somewhere outdoors. Cook offs can be messy, so consider doing it outdoors if the weather permits. Some foods like barbecue can only be prepared outdoors on a grill.
You can also rent a space at a local venue to hold the cook off, but it will be quite expensive.

, Most cookouts have an entry fee, which can help you cover costs. This fee makes sense, since you are providing your guests with a hot meal. Make sure that the fee is appropriate for the type of cook off you are planning. For instance, if it is a small casual cook off, consider a fee of around $15. If it is a fundraiser or larger event, consider charging more.

, A cook off can be pricey. Calculate about how much it will be to hold the cook off. This includes equipment as well as cooking supplies. If you find that your estimate is higher than what you can afford, there are several ways you can cut the cost.


You can go to stores like Costco that sell ingredients and supplies in bulk, which can save you money.
Think about upping your entry fee if you are worried about expenses.

, Outdoor grills, crock pots and portable heat sources to cook on are among the most common equipment needed for cook offs. You can ask your guests to bring the equipment that they will need, such as a portable grill or a crockpot, so you don’t have to provide them all yourself., Either buy or ask your guests to bring any other things you may need for the cookout depending on your budget. These could include plenty of tables and chairs, paper plates, cups, utensils and napkins. These details can sometimes slip through the cracks but they are essential to the cook off’s success.Don’t forget to buy condiments like sour cream, ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise if needed.
You also may want to provide drinks like soda or alcoholic beverages. You may want to consider buying a cooler and ice if you are providing cold drinks.

, You will need to use outlets to plug in equipment like crockpots. If you are far away from a power source, either buy extension cords or ask your guests to bring them., Now that you have all the details finalized, send out invitations either by email or mail with the exact time, date, location and food that will be served. Include any information about what equipment your guests should bring. Also ask guests who aren’t cooking to bring snacks like chips, cheese and crackers and drinks.There are online sites that you can use to send invitations and keep track of RSVP’s.

Start at least two hours early.,
Meet with the cooks and run over the plan.,
Divide the chefs and the rest of the guests.,
Signal the beginning and the end of the cooking.,
Give additional time for cooking on site.",How to Hold a Cook Off3," Begin setting up the event two hours before it starts. This way you won’t be waiting until the last minute, and if you realize you are missing something you can find a solution before the cook off starts.

, Once people start arriving at the cook out, you will want to talk with the chefs. Round up everyone who will be cooking and tell them everything they need to know. This could include things like where they should be stationed as well as the start and finish times of the cooking.

, You don’t want the guests or the judges to see which chef is making which dish. Have your guests step away from the cooking by having the drinks and snacks in a separate area, where guests can mingle and talk as the chefs are cooking. This way the entries will be anonymous., Signal the start of the cooking by making an announcement or blowing a whistle. Make sure that the chefs have an appropriate amount of time to either cook or warm up their dish. Blow a whistle when the cooking period is over.Walk around during the cooking and check in with chefs to see if they have any questions or if they need more supplies.

, If your chefs are all cooking their dishes entirely on site, make sure to give them enough time. How much time it takes may vary depending on the dish they are cooking. Having access to a kitchen is often a good idea if the cooking is happening on site.

Label each crock pot or serving container.,
Label plates.,
Let everyone eat.,
Supervise the judges.,
Announce the winner of the cook off.,
Give out prizes and thank everyone for coming.,
Clean up.",How to Hold a Cook Off4," Give each chef a number. After the cooking is over, have each chef make a sign to put in front of his or her serving container with the number of their dish and a brief description.


For instance, a possible sign could read ""3: Spicy Red Bean Chili.""
Make sure this sign does not have their name.

, Once the chefs have their number, have the chefs divvy up small portions of their food into small serving containers so everyone can enjoy. Make sure that these containers are labelled with the chef's assigned number. This will make it easy for judges and guests to pick a favorite dish, still without knowing which chef cooked what., Have the chefs step away from their station so that no one can tell who cooked what. Make sure judges get the food immediately after it's cooked so it's still hot. Also distribute food out to the rest of your guests.

, Let the judges know what rating system you want them to use. Many times a scaled numbering system from one to ten works best. Have the judge write down their scores and any comments they have on the food. Then gather these up and see what chef received the highest score.If your guests are acting as the judges, give them all a ballot where they can write down their favorite dish or dishes.

, After everyone has had a chance to eat, announce which chef cooked which dish. Then reveal the winner of the cook off as well as second and third place. Announce the scores of the top three chefs, and read any comments that the judges or guests have left for them. This is best left for the end of the event., Give out prizes to the top two or top three winners. Make sure that the prizes you are giving out could be appreciated by anyone, and are not gender specific. Gift cards are a good thing to give if you cannot think of anything that all your contestants would appreciate.You could also give away food items, like artisan olive oil or good wine.
After the winner is announced and the cook off is winding down, thank your guests for coming. Let your chefs know that you appreciated all their hard work, and thank your judges for their time.
Also remind everyone to take all their equipment and supplies home so you won’t have to return them later., You likely will have a lot of clean up to do after the cook off. If you feel comfortable, ask a couple of friends if they can stick around and help you. You probably will have a couple people who will volunteer to help. It may be the least fun part of the cook off, but you can feel good that you hosted such a successful and enjoyable event."

During the game, gather your guests and play a variety of commercial-related games.",How to Throw a Super Bowl Commercial Watching Party," And, since this is an ode to the ads, remind your football-loving friends that the commercials come first and the game a distant second (unless of course you are a die-hard fan of one of the teams playing). If it’s a small party with close friends, a simple phone call will do. For larger parties, or if you really want to set the commercial-watching mood, consider filming your own faux-commercial/invitation (don’t worry about high-quality production techniques, the low-brow effect adds to the charm). Then upload it to YouTube or another online video sharing service, and send a link of the video to your friends via an e-mail invitation. Set an RSVP date that allows you enough time to prepare for food, drink and other requirements.


If you have friends whose favorite football team is actually playing the Super Bowl, give them plenty of warning that this is a commercial-watching party. If their team starts winning the game, they’ll be in good spirits, but if their team starts losing, you might have a mood dampener on your hands. In other words, invite these types of people only at your own risk.;
, Instead of footballs and team colors, consider displaying the logos of this year’s Super Bowl advertisers.

, With all those commercials for snack foods, soda and beer, your guests are bound to get hungry. Have fun with the menu, and consider stocking the snack table with products that have bought airtime in recent Super Bowls. Don’t forget to stock plenty of alcoholic drink options, as these are generally advertised during the Big Game.

, Of course you do. Since most sheet cakes are conveniently shaped like a TV, consider having your local cake decorator create an ode to the ads with a semi-high definition rendering of a TV displaying your favorite Super Bowl commercial (with or without the cool photo-converted-into-icing technique).

Or maybe you were just thinking of throwing a Friday-night house party to get together with your friends. Things to consider with each reason: age appropriateness, decorations, theme for dressing, location, food, beverages, who you should invite, and just how many people you'd like to invite.



Birthday parties: Some examples of prominent ages to celebrate with a great party are: 10-12, 16, 18, and 21.

Holiday parties: These parties are centered close to or on the date of a national holiday. New Year's Eve, St. Patrick's Day, and Halloween are the most prominent of holidays that are celebrated with a wild party!

After-parties: An after-party is just that--a party that is thrown after a concert or show.

Mixer/Singles parties: These parties are for the single and ready to mingle!

Sports parties: A sports party is often placed on the day that the Super Bowl takes place or generally during certain sports seasons.

House parties: House parties are simple, laid-back parties to just get friends together and to have a good time. These types of parties are often thrown on Friday and Saturday nights.;
, With each type of party, it is important to keep in mind the age limit and attitude of each party. For example, a birthday party for a 16-year-old is very different than a singles party or a New Year's Eve party. When throwing a party for someone who is under the age of 18, keep it clean, non-sexual, and with several fun activities to do. Or, better yet, throw it at a place that hosts young and teenage parties such as an amusement park, an arcade, a pizza place, etc.


The age of the attendees should determine just about everything. Fewer guests should be in attendance (can you imagine 20 8-year-olds running around your house?), there needs to be more scheduled things to do, and the length of the party should be shorter as the attendees get younger.

, According to the idea behind the party, consider where you are going to throw this shindig. Some options include your house, a friend's house, somewhere outdoors, at a bar/club, at a restaurant, etc.


If you are looking to throw a party in a neighborhood area, make sure that your neighbors or your friend's neighbors are okay with what you're doing in case of loud music or a large amount of people.
If you are throwing a party at a facility such as a bar, a club, a restaurant, an amusement park, or anywhere else that is owned and managed, call in advance before showing up, ask about the number of people allowed, and book a slot in the facility's schedule.

, You'll want to make sure you invite your closest friends first before your acquaintances. If you are looking to throw a large party, consider adding a +1 to the invite, meaning your guests have the option to bring a friend that you may or may not know. This can be a little risky because you will not be able to tell who will get along with who, but it's also a great way to meet new people.


If you are having family over at your party, keep it to your closest friends (unless it is family that is very close to your age). You don't want to have to explain unknown party attendants to your grandmother.

, Unless you know a very large amount of people, your party attendance may be a little small and therefore you will not have to worry about it. If you do know a fairly large amount of people, say 30, or you have decided to go with the +1 option, then consider keeping it at that. Parties that accumulate more than 30 people tend to become out of hand. To help with this situation, ask a couple of your closest friends to help maintain the party alongside you.


The bigger your party, the more help you'll need -- especially if you're the one covering all the food, drink, and entertainment. Ask a few friends to help pitch in at least with set-up and clean-up or turn it into a potluck so the financial burden isn't all your own.

, Themed parties make it easier for your guests to feel comfortable and included in the group. Sometimes, when one does not know what to wear to a party they tend to be a little uneasy when they show up. Also, themed parties are fun! If you are throwing a holiday party, then ask your guests to dress according to the holiday. If you are throwing a themed birthday or house party, some common themes are 1980s, toga/Greek, black & white, masquerade, jungle/amazon, and Western.


If you are 18 or older, consider throwing a ""sexy"" costume party. Most adults refer to this as a ""costume party."" Only some transfer students from abroad won't know the connotation.

, Party food is usually junk food and junk food is usually sugary, starchy, salty, inexpensive, and easy to maintain. Common foods are cake, ice-cream, chips, salsa, dip, chex mix, candy, brownies, and cupcakes. But of course you can switch it up according to the motive of the party. Get creative!


Plenty of people use parties as an excuse to get fancy. If you're having more of a formal event, none of that processed stuff is even going to touch your spread. Only hors d'oeuvres of fancy cheeses, breads, and vegetables will grace your soiree.

, When you think of drinking at a party, you probably think of beer and shots, but it doesn't have to be just that. Stock up on fruit punch, water and different kinds of soda while you're out party shopping. For alcoholic drinks, beer is the least expensive of your options and you may want to consider buying a keg depending on the amount of people. Also, it will cut down on the amount of garbage (if you've ever been left picking up aluminum cans after a big party, you know how that goes). Popular party beers are Guinness, Keystone, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Miller, and Bud Light. You might also want to pick up some hard liquor, wine, and mixers.


If there is drinking at your party, your guests are your responsibility. You must make sure they have rides home and that some people are designated drivers. Be prepared to take peoples' keys if need be. Have plenty of water and other drinks to encourage people to either sober up or stay sober in the first place.

, Decorations are always based on the theme and the motive for the party. Most party decorations can be found at your local party store or an online party store and are relatively inexpensive. Make sure you decorate your party well if it is themed. The more, the better. If your guests feel like they really are in the jungle or that they really are in the 80's, they will have even more fun.


If your place is hard to find, also purchase signage to help people direct themselves to the right spot. Balloons or streamers are eye-catching; you could also light up your walk with party lights or torches.

, So you've got your food, your beverages, your decorations, what else?


For starters, you'll need containers to keep your food and beverages safe and at their required temperature. Keep food out in large amounts on trays, in bowls, and on plates where your guests can easily access them.
You will want to keep your beverages cold and in an easy-access place as well. Invest in a large ice chest to put canned soda and beer in. For hard and bottled liquor, keep these out on or behind a counter that you can easily regulate and maintain. You may want to invest in a wine cooler for keeping wine cold.
If you have a keg, you're going to want to have a trusted friend stand by it or take turns with one another to refill peoples' cups.
You'll want to get paper or plastic cups, plates, and bowls. You do not want to pass around your mother's favorite china at a party because it WILL get dropped.
Go for plastic when purchasing knives, forks, and spoons so that you can recycle them along with the paper dishware at the end of the party.
Other supplies are: a large trashcan or recycling bin for dispensing these items and a large bucket or two filled with water for cigarettes (otherwise your guests will litter cigarette butts all over your front and backyard and possibly inside your home) or several large ashtrays.

, After they arrive, your guests will most likely be amazed by your attire and your selection of food, beverages, and decorations, but they will want something to do after they've gotten through with the greetings. Here are some ideas to literally get the party started:


Pool (if you are in possession of a pool table)
A dartboard and darts
A ping-pong table
A beer pong table
Music and a wide area set aside for dancing
If you have a pool and/or hot tub keep it/them clean and running.
There are other activities to play that don't involve anything (games, etc.) and can be played throughout your party. Keep some in mind if a lull ever extends over the crowd.

, One of the biggest questions you're probably thinking about is what music should you play at your party. It's possible to book a DJ or have a musically inclined friend DJ your party if there's a large amount of people, but since the invention of iPods and computers, you can be your own DJ! You can use iTunes and have it playing through your speakers on your computer, or you can setup an iPod-compatible stereo system in the same room as your dance floor and play music from there.


Think about the entirety of your guests and what music you think they would like. Or, play different types of music throughout the evening if your guests have a wide difference in music tastes. Popular party music is often rap, hip-hop, dance, electro, house, and basically anything that has a beat that your guests can dance to.

, Inviting 30 people over to your house for beer pong is probably a good reason to bring your ancient Roman vase collection to the attic. Anything you don't want touched, messed with, or potentially broken needs to put out of sight. Shut the doors to rooms you don't want entered, lock them, tidy up the bathroom, and get your home in party condition.


You'll probably want to have garbage bags and cleaning supplies at the ready, too, just to make everything easier.
Have games and alternative choices of music out just in case the party needs a little revamping.

, Get a couple of your closest friends together to help prepare your house for the party. This is also a plus for when guests start showing up; it looks like people are already there and in case someone not so well-known shows up early, it'll save you from an awkward situation. Direct each guest as they show up to the designated food, beverage, and entertainment areas. You want them feeling comfortable right off the bat.


Mingle and get to know the people you might not know so well. If there's alcohol involved at your party, make sure everyone who wants to drink has a drink in their hand. Turn the music up enough so that you can still comfortably hear one another.

, Make sure your guests are comfortable with one another by introducing those that aren't known that well to your group of friends. You may also want to start with the party activities and turn the music up louder to enforce a party atmosphere. Monitor the alcohol counter to keep anyone from overdoing it with hard liquor. For groups that don't know each other, you may need to start conversations rolling. That's why you're the host!


If the party starts reaching a lull, feel free to call it a night. Just start cleaning up and telling people thanks for coming and they'll get the hint. If they don't, just tell them the party's over! They don't have to go home, but they can't stay there.
Make sure everyone gets home okay. Do they have your number? Are they okay to drive? Does anyone need a ride? If they can't drive, do you have a sofa or bed they can crash on?

, If your entire living room is a pyramid of aluminum cans and delicately placed paper plates, you have more than enough right to ask your guests to help clean up. It's their mess, too! If that thought makes you nervous, ask a few of your closest friends to tackle the beast before they leave. You'll pay them back when they host next time!

Match your food and drinks to the type of party you’re having.",How to Have a Good House Party," An easy way to throw a great party is to have a themed party. By creating a theme for your party, you can easily make the decorations, food, music, and activities match each other making the party cohesive. Themes can be anything from a certain time period like the fifties to colors like a red and black party. You can also theme a party on a certain holiday like Valentine’s Day or The 4th of July.;
, Another great type of house party is a party focused on a specific event. Invite your friends over to watch a television event, or throw a house party for someone’s birthday or a holiday. When you throw a house party focused on a specific event it’s easy to base the theme off of this as well.Have a Superbowl party for everyone to watch this year’s Superbowl game. Theme your decorations and food on football or the teams playing in the Superbowl.
Throw a house party for a friend’s birthday or for a holiday like New Year’s Eve.
Invite a group of friends over to watch an award show like the Oscars. Create an elegant feel by using the colors black, white, and gold for your party.

, You can throw a house party that’s based on a specific activity to let all of your guests have fun as a group. Activities like karaoke and dancing are great to focus a party on. Another fun activity focused party is a murder mystery party where each guest is given a role to play and gets to try and figure out the answer to a mystery.

, The amount of people you have at your party will determine the feel of your party. If you only have a few guests the party will be much more intimate and lend itself to more in depth conversations. However, if you have lots of guests the party will have a different vibe. A party with a lot of people is a great way for people to make new friends and tends to have lighter conversations. The amount of space you have in your home will also determine how many guests to invite. You don’t want a house that is so crowded that people can’t move around easily.You need about 8-12 square feet per person for a comfortable cocktail party, and about 5-8 square feet per person for a comfortable larger party. To figure out how many people you should invite, divide the number of square feet in the part of your house the party will take place by the number of square feet per person you want to use.

, There are several different ways to invite people to a house party. You can send out invitations in the mail, email an invitation, or invite your friends over social media. You should send your invitation out several weeks in advance so your friends can plan to attend the party.There are many different online companies that let you pick an invitation and send it to your friends’ email addresses. Many of these invitations are designed to look just like paper invitations so they can match your theme. They also let you track your invitation and give guests an easy way to R.S.V.P.

, You should include the date, time, and address of the party on your invitation to let guests know when and where your party is taking place. You should also include other important details like your contact information for people to R.S.V.P. or get in touch with you if they have a question. Anything that you want your guest to bring should also be included on the invitation.


If you want your guests to leave at a certain time, you should include an end time on the invitation.
Another important detail to include is if there is a dress code. If you want your guests to dress in a certain attire make sure you indicate this on the invitation. An example of this would be if you want your guests to dress in a costume matching the theme of your party.

, The lights you use can create a certain ambiance at a party, so choosing the right lighting is very important. You should have adequate lighting in the entrance to welcome guests as they arrive. The main area the guests will be in should have lower lighting to create an intimate environment. A space where party guests will be dancing should have very low lighting or lit with party lights like black lights and glow sticks. Different kinds of lights can create a different vibe so think about the type of party you want when picking your lighting. Candles and fancy lamps can create an intimate, upscale feel. Tiki torches and christmas lights create a festive environment for a party.

, Consider making a few friends the V.I.P. of the party and invite them to come over early to help set everything up. Set up your lighting in all of the rooms the party will be happening in. Put tablecloths down where the food will be served. Try hanging balloons or streamers that match the colors of your theme. You can hang posters and banners to decorate for the party.Have centerpieces on all of your tables the reflect the parties theme or vibe.
Use items you already have as decorations. For example, for a woodland themed party, you can fill a vase with pinecones to use as a centerpiece.

, It’s important to create a flow within your house to get guests to naturally go where you want them to. You should have the lights off and doors closed in rooms you don’t want the guests being in. There should be a natural pathway from the entrance to the room with the food and the room you want your guests to be in. You should keep the bar, food, and music in separate areas with space in between them. There should also be separate spaces for guests to have intimate conversations or dance in., You want enough music to have music playing during your entire party so it’s important to think about the length of the party when you make a playlist. The music should start with mellow songs that give a relaxed feel as guests arrive. As the night goes on, the music should start to pick up with faster music to encourage dancing. You can end the night with music that’s a bit slower and more calming.Try using an online radio to create your own station and play music all night long.
You can also tell your guests to create their own playlist and take turns playing them at the party.

, It’s important to think about the type of party you’re having when you consider what music to play. If you want people to be dancing, you should play fun, upbeat music and include songs that have their own dance like the Silento’s “Watch Me”. For a smaller more intimate party, have the music playing softly in the background.

, When you’re having a larger house party, it’s a good idea to hire a DJ or have a live band perform. A DJ will play continuous music to keep the fun going during your party. A live band is a great addition to a house party and makes guests feel like they’re at a private concert. This will help achieve a lively party vibe where everyone is having fun.

, You can add fun to your house party by having party games for your guests to play. Lawn games like cornhole, croquet, and volleyball are great games to have available for party guests to play. Having a ping pong, foosball, or pool table are also great additions to a house party. There are many party card games you can buy as well to have out for your guests to enjoy playing.

, A great activity to have at your house party is karaoke. Party guests will have fun singing songs and dancing to the music. The great thing about karaoke is it provides music as well as fun! You can rent a karaoke machine at a party rental company or you can use an app on your phone for karaoke., If you’re going to have multiple activities you need to make sure there is a separate space for each. You want enough space for your guests to easily participate in the activity. You can have some activities outside on a porch or in a yard, and others can be inside in the living room or a basement.

, An easy way to have drinks available for your guests and not have to be the bartender is to set up a drink station. You can use a side table or drink cart to place alcohol, mixers, ice, glasses, and stirrers on for guests to create their own fun party drinks. It’s a good idea to have a small recipe books of drink ideas for your guests. They can flip through the book to find their favorite drink and then be their own bartender mixing it to perfection. Make sure you have all of the necessary ingredients for every drink in your book.

, Having appetizers or finger foods set out for your guests to eat at leisure is a great way to serve food at a house party. Guests will be able to eat as they get hungry throughout the night, so they will stay happy. Make the appetizers ahead of time so that you don’t spend the whole night in the kitchen cooking. Cook enough food so that you can replenish items that get eaten quickly.Make sure you have plenty of finger foods that are like main dishes in addition to snack foods. You want to make sure your party guests stay satiated. Appetizers like meatballs, pigs in a blanket, bean dip, or chicken wings are a good idea to serve.
You can make the finger food fun by serving it in a unique way. For example, serve cupcakes in plastic martini glasses or use mini pretzel sticks instead of toothpicks for appetizers.

, If you don’t want to worry about the food so you can enjoy your own party, you can hire a caterer to prepare and serve the food. Although this is a costly option, it will allow you to be able to join in the fun more. Another great idea is to hire a bartender to mix and serve your drinks. Having a professional bartender to serve your guests will make them feel special and allow them the opportunity to order whatever drinks they desire.

, If you’re having a themed party, you can match the food and drinks to the theme. You can use specific colors for your theme and only serve food and drinks that match those colors. If you’re having a time period party, consider serving food and drinks that were available and popular during that time period. "

Hold the Bake-Off.",How to Hold a Bake Off," There are many options for a bake off: pies, cakes, cookies, and pastries are just a few ideas. Do you plan on holding a large, one event bake-off? Or, would you prefer holding something with many, smaller events?;
, This can be a difficult step, especially if you plan on opening the contest to many people. The location will need access to common kitchen equipment for many such as ovens and sinks. You will need to be creative when searching for your ideal locale.

, People rarely want to do something for nothing, so you'll need good prizes to motivate people to enter the bake-off. Prizes could include cash, savings bonds, kitchen and baking gear, or gift cards to stores and restaurants. Ask various businesses if they would like to donate prizes.

, The best route to take is to allow anyone to submit recipes, and then to choose a select number of contestants from all of the entries. This allows you to have the best possible competition possible, and to make sure everyone is up to par.

, Since this is the first year of the event, any entrance fees, if any, should be fairly low. Perhaps second level winners (those who make it into the live competition) could be charged five dollars. Experiment. Test price ideas on friends and family.

, Your initial publicity should focus on getting enough entrants. In any ads, specify age ranges, experience levels, judging criteria, and contact info. Be smart about this. For example, if you expect a lot of older adults to participate, don't only leave e-mail contact information. You should use a ""snail mail"" address. It is exactly the opposite for any young adult or teen categories.

, You should have a set criteria for judging, so you won't only be focusing on personal tastes. If there are many entries, consider having a few friends help you out.

, Browse other bake-offs and their criteria online to get an idea of what yours should look like.

, These will be your tasters. Your panel should consist of between three and five people, a mixture of men and women, cooking/baking professionals and non.

, Contestants should all be given information pertaining set-up, ingredients, breaks, time limits, and anything else related to the bake off. Judges should be given any judging criteria, break time information, and when they are supposed to be anywhere. Also, make a rough schedule you can use to create your advertisements.

, Most people won't want to pay much to go to a first year event, so a small fee like a dollar or two could help take you from out of the red.

, You should send any press releases to local newspapers, magazines, websites, and television stations. Consider sending out a few free tickets to some of the press members. If you're lucky, they will cover the event in their publication, and this could increase interest for next year's event.

,


Have extra copies of the judge and contestant schedules on hand. People are forgetful, and they could be a life saver for the timely bake off.
Set an adequate amount of time for baking, judging, and breaks, but don't leave to much ""dead time"" in the day.
If it is an all day event, make sure to plan a way for contestants to eat lunch and/or dinner. An hour should be enough time if they are allowed to leave to eat. If you would prefer them to stay on the premises, plan to find a caterer for the meal.

Avoid doing post-mortems on the exam with your friends. There is no point and at least one of you is bound to be completely wrong.

, Do not feel guilty about not studying. It can be hard to come off the study treadmill initially but let yourself do so quickly. Sleep in if you can, take longer to get ready in the mornings and relax often.

, Choose books, comics, magazines and papers that interest you so that you can enjoy yourself when reading. None of this should be a chore.

Choose a t-shirt.,

Go shirtless.,
Wear a hoodie.,
Opt for shorts.,
Wear jeans.,
Think about a costume.,
Don sneakers.,
Skip the flip flops.,
Never go barefoot.,
Take a backpack.,
Wear a hat.,
Don’t forget sunglasses.",How to Dress for a Rave  (Guys)," You can never go wrong with a simple t-shirt as they will work for any rave whether indoor or outdoor, day or night. They have a relaxed feel which is what raves are all about. Find one that suits the occasion and your personality. Perhaps one with a funny saying like “Keep Calm and Rave On” would work or “Eat, Sleep, Rave.”Try to stay away from an all-white tee. It will probably be 3 shades of brown before the night is over due to sweating and accidental spills.
T-shirts made of breathable material are the best way to go. Something like pure cotton will allow you to stay cool and comfy.;
, Tank tops are great as they allow you to stay cool while still being shielded from the sun. Plus, if you've been spending countless hours in the gym and want to show off those guns, a basic tank top is the best choice for you.


There are lots of options out there so pick a crazy, stand-out color like neon green, yellow or orange.
You and your buddies can even get similar tanks. This is a good way to spot each other in the crowd.

, Try going shirtless if you'll be in the sun the majority of the time. If you're going to a beachside rave, for example, or if you'll be in direct sunlight at an outdoor venue, consider ditching the shirt altogether.


Don’t forget the sunscreen if you dare to bare.
Bring a small towel along to wipe off some sweat.

, Raves taking place during cooler months or in colder climates call for a hooded sweatshirt. While you may be warm in the middle of the day or while dancing, evenings may be a little chilly. This is especially true for parties taking place in the desert.


Avoid a plain, boring one that’s gray or black. Find one that still speaks to your personality and is covered in LED lights or a wild animal image.Don't put anything important in your hoodie pockets unless they're on the inside of the jacket. Losing a glow stick is one thing but losing your ID would be a nightmare.

, Wear a pair of shorts if you plan to show off your crazy dancing footwork. Shorts are also a good choice if you're concerned about staying cool. There’s no need to go conventional here. Pick something outrageous like disco ball patterned shorts.


Cargo shorts are always a good option. All the extra pockets will come in handy for carrying a cell phone and wallet.

, Jeans are made from a pretty durable material and can usually take a beating. Stick with this option if planning to hang out at a rave for several days without bringing a bunch of extra clothes. Jeans are also the classic option for events like these.


If you decide to go this route, remember to wear a pair that are wide-legged and loose-fitting so you can still move around easily. Anything snug will just get uncomfortable after a while.
Be sure to wear a ratty pair you won't mind getting dirty or torn. This is definitely not the time to wear the designer pair you just bought. They will be ruined before the sun sets.

, Whether you're a rave veteran or a first-timer, certain events like Coachella, for example, call for a costume. In general, raves are about embracing who you are and indulging in the quirky and outrageous. Showcase this side of yourself and do absolutely anything you want! Whether it’s a costume of a giant owl or a robot, there’s no right or wrong answer. Go with what you feel inspired by.Consider the particular rave you’re going to. For instance, if it’s around election time, make a political statement with your get-up.
It’s a ton of fun to coordinate costumes with friends. You guys could pick something like video game characters.

, You’ll be on your feet the vast majority of the time while at a rave. Wandering around for hours, sometimes even days can wreck havoc on your feet. To keep them from aching, wear a comfortable pair of sneakers. Make sure that they are really broken in, loose fitting and light weight.


Keep in mind that they don’t have to look good. No one will be looking at your feet.
If you want them to coordinate with your ensemble, jazz them up with brightly colored or LED shoelaces.
Remember to bring an extra pair of socks or two. You will be glad you did if yours become soggy from sweat.

, Flip flops are great for most occasions but this is not one of them. They don’t offer any support for your feet and your toes will get trampled by partiers.


This is true even if you’re on the beach in Miami or Ibiza.

, People drop all sorts of things on the ground, spill things and who knows what else. You will regret going barefoot immediately. Since there is no way to do so safely, stick with shoes at all times. You could step on something really dangerous and ruin your entire trip. Plus, the blistering sand or concrete will be unbearable.

, You will want to keep some crucial items with you at all times as it's not really convenient to run back and forth to the car or tent (if you have one). You can keep your hands free to snap pictures and items safe while dancing by carrying a backpack. You won’t need a huge one, just something small for the essentials.


Bring along an extra cell phone battery and/or charger, chapstick, water canister and ID., If you'll be attending a daytime rave, it would be a good idea to put a hat on to protect your dome from harsh sun rays. As long as it’s cool and helps shield your face and head from the sun, you're in good shape. Even if it's a nighttime rave a sweet baseball cap will be fashionable.


Cowboy or trucker hats will do the trick as well.
Think outside the box here as well. This is the perfect time to wear that wild wig you’ve had in the closet.

, Just imagine partying all night long and waking up without sunglasses. Ouch. Not only will they protect your eyes from the blinding sun, they are cool. Choose inexpensive ones in case you lose them.


You don’t have to save them for the following morning. These can really set your outfit off during the day too so pick ones with a fun colored frame and reflective lenses."

Think of the color scheme.,
Decide whether to use Mylar or latex balloons.,
Think of quantity and size of the location.,
Decide between helium or non-helium balloons.,
Think of different ways to hang them.,
Form them into shapes.,
Decorate them!,
Fill them with things other than air.,
Use them with a purpose.",How to Decorate With Balloons," Balloons come in a wide array of colors. Do you want to go for the entire rainbow, a two-toned color scheme, or maybe an ombre effect? Do you want to simulate the bubbles of champagne? The hues of a fire? How many colors will you need?;
, Mylar is better for outside events -- it's the kind that's crinkly to the touch (and often comes in different shapes and with designs and sayings); latex balloons pop more easily, especially outside and with children on the scene. However, latex balloons are a lot more versatile and easier to work with.


In the next section (where we discuss ideas), we'll be talking about latex balloons mainly. Mylar works...but not nearly as well.

, The bigger the place or the more scarcely decorated it is, the more balloons you'll need. Latex balloons will be much cheaper, and they'll cost you mere pennies if you blow them up yourself. Do you want a few for a nice touch or do you want your guests swimming in them? And as always, get a few more than you think you need to be safe!

, You can totally decorate your space with non-helium balloons, no problem. It's fast, cheap, and super easy. But to open up the plethora of balloon options available, you'll need helium balloons. Or a mixture of both!


You can get your balloons blown up at party stores or you can buy an at-home helium kit. If you have tons of balloons, you may want to opt for the latter.

, Regardless of whether or not you have access to helium, you don't have to relegate your balloons to floating on the ceiling or bouncing around the floor. There's a number of ways you can get your balloons to float outside the box:


With helium balloons:






Tie strings on the end and attach to golf tees in your garden
Tie strings on the end and tape to various heights on the floor, forming a wall


With non-helium balloons:






Pin to the wall in different sizes, like bubbles
Put a marble or penny in the balloons, tie on strings, and hang them upside down from the ceiling



, You probably want a whole bunch of balloons, so why not combine their decorative powers and form them into big, impressive shapes? Here are some ideas:


Form a balloon arch. With helium balloons and string, they do most of the work themselves.
Form flowers. Four balloons of one color make the petals; a balloon of a different color in the middle forms the eye.
Form streamers. Take a needle and thread a string through rows of balloons, forming your not-so-average streamer.

, Heck, this could be part of your party it's so fun. With a few artsy mediums, you can turn your balloons into veritable canvas for your next masterpiece.


Two words: glue and glitter. If you have a bowl of glue, you can dip your balloon in glitter, forming a two-tone effect
Permanent markers. Your friends' faces, anyone?
Paint, felt, and anything else you can whip up from your art drawer.

, Because that's totally 2013. And we're not talking water balloon fights, though that's cool, too.


Well, fill them with water, but then freeze them. They'll keep your party drinks cold and be totally decorative and fun.
Fill them with LED lights or glow sticks. If you have a night party, these are an amazing way to get people excited.

If the LED lights are tea lights, you may need to cut off the base of the balloon. They'll look kind of blobby, but they'll still be awesome light-up blobs.


Fill them with beans for homemade bean bags!

, Balloons are decorative, sure, but they can also be useful. When people ask why your house is littered with balloons, it'll be because you needed them. Here's a couple reasons why:


Use them as place tags! Fill them up with helium, tie and tag on the end of a string, and tie the string to your chairs. Then people can take them home after, too!
Using streamers or thick tape, tape them against a shut door. When the special guest of honor opens the door, balloon avalanche!
Make crafts with them! Time to get your paper mache on or make a mold that can be turned into a vase or a mini lamp shade.

Choose the right table.,
Place the table in a good spot.,
Make the most of lighting.,
Use a tablecloth or placemats.,
Use appropriate dishes.,
Arrange silverware appropriately.,
Coordinate napkins.",How to Decorate a Table for a Party1," Make this decision based on the number of people that it needs to accommodate, the amount of food that will be on it, and the type of party. For example, an outdoor party needs a table that will be weatherproof. The table itself plays a powerful role in setting the ambiance of the meal. A table made of exposed wood can set a more rustic tone, while a table of glass can appear more elegant.


The table does not need to be expensive to set a good tone for the party. It is more important that it accommodates the people and food well. Even a scratched table can look elegant if properly adorned with a beautiful tablecloth.
Different tables are appropriate for different types of parties. A low table can allow guests to be seated on the floor for a cultural theme or even a beach party. A picnic table can work well for a child’s birthday party or a summer party.You might want to consider using a separate table for food and for eating. This can help keep the table from becoming overcrowded. This is an especially helpful technique for a buffet dinner.;
, Ideally, the table will not be difficult to access or hinder guests from being easily seated. Placing a table by a window can allow your outdoor surroundings to inspire guests. You could place the table by a fireplace for a cozy party in winter. Consider placing your table in or near the kitchen for easy cleanup.For an outdoor party, consider placing the table in the shade or under an umbrella or canopy. This will allow for some protection from the sun and other natural elements.

, Pay attention to the light for your table. A chandelier creates a different ambiance than natural light. Candles can set an intimate tone for your party while bright overhead lights are more energetic. Make sure your lights go with the rest of your table decor., This isn’t always necessary if you want to show off your table, but it can add a beautiful decorative touch. It is also important for protecting your table, which you will probably want to do with a kid’s table. Tablecloths can also make cleanup much faster and can add refinement to an old, worn table. It simply depends on the look you are going for.Choose your fabric wisely. Different fabrics evoke a different tone. Lace feels delicate and elegant, as does satin. Cotton is a great multi-purpose fabric for a variety of themes. Polyester cleans well and can have a nice sheen to it.
A table runner is another way to add visual interest. Choose one that complements your color scheme or theme. Place it directly on the table, or even on top of a tablecloth for a layered look. You could choose an oval-shaped one to add an interesting design.

, Your dishes will vary depending on the type of party you are having. Dishes at a tea party and a luau-themed party will certainly have different requirements. For a holiday party, dishes can even coincide with the theme. For example, a fun turkey-shaped platter will set the tone for Thanksgiving. Tailoring the dishes to the occasion makes a decorative statement and adds sophistication to an ordinary item.


This is also true of glasses. They need to be appropriate for the type of party. A holiday party might have wine glasses while a kid’s birthday party would not. A formal dinner or dessert party might even have champagne glasses.

, Forks go to the left of the plate while knives and spoons go on the right. Arrange them to be used from the outside in. You would have the salad fork farthest to the left and the dinner fork next to the plate. The spoon will be on the outside and the knife on the inside., Finding cloth napkins that complement your color scheme is a great way to add visual interest. They don’t have to match exactly, but they should go with your general theme. You could try using patterned napkins for contrast or something simple for a more delicate look.


If you want to get fancy, you could even try folding your napkins into a fan or a swan. It isn’t terribly difficult yet it adds something special.

Choose a midi dress as a longer option.,
Wear a suit.,
Choose shoes for style and comfort.,
Choose a minimal handbag.,
Pick one standout accessory.",How to Dress for a Cocktail Party2," Opt for one that is flattering to you. Since there is an overwhelming number of styles, a good rule of thumb is to choose simple, elegant styles over revealing ones.The little black dress (LBD) is usually a safe bet for cocktail parties due to its timeless look and conservative aesthetic., Before choosing a minidress, consider the event you are attending. Have you been acquainted with everyone? If not, you might opt for something longer.If you do choose a mini, pay attention that the hemline is not too short by standing straight up with your arms at your side. If your fingers pass the hemline, you should reconsider if it’s appropriate., Be careful with this dress because its hem, which sits between the ankle and knee, can appear unflattering on some people. To break the long lines up, add dressier accessories, like a large necklace.Dresses that drop below the ankles become gowns and should be saved for very formal events, like white tie parties., The best outfit will showcase your personality and confidence, and sometimes dresses don’t do that. Opt for a slimmer suit with a womenswear jacket, which will hit at your waist instead of below it. For a less fitted style, choose a relaxed, slouchy style instead of boxy.Alternatively, wear tailored pants with a detailed top, but avoid fabrics like jersey and denim, which can be too casual.

, Unless the shoes are used to highlight or accent something, choose heels or boots that don’t distract from your outfit.If you don’t wear heels, try ballet flats, but don’t wear sneakers.If your outfit is black, choose colorful shoes for a pop of personality.

, You should only bring the essentials to a cocktail party. Large purses packed full can both feel and look weighty.Go easy on yourself and lighten your load.

, Avoid over-accessorizing since it can be too distracting for people you’re talking to. Choose something that complements your clothing choices and your personality.It could start a conversation.


Cocktail rings have colorful precious jewels (either real or reproductions) that make a bold statement. However, the size of the stone can look gaudy when combined with a necklace, earrings, and a bracelet."

Wear a dark suit for formal gatherings.,

Wear dark leather shoes.,
Accessorize modestly.",How to Dress for a Cocktail Party3," The more formal an event is, the more pieces you should include with the suit. Pressed pants, an ironed dress shirt, and a tie function well for most events.


If the weather is cooler, wearing heavier fabrics, like wool can add physical weight and stylistic weight to the outfit.
Avoid the tux. Tuxedos should only be worn a very formal events, like black- or white-tie events., Jeans should be well-fitted and not have any holes or rips, and they should be paired with a nice, crisp dress shirt. Ties are not mandatory with informal gatherings.


For warmer months, wear a light-colored lightweight jacket like linen. Pairing it with a knit tie mixes interesting textures without weighing down the attire.For cooler months, wear a nice V-neck sweater or sweater vest with a tie.

, Oxfords are the most popular and versatile shoes to wear to dressy events.Dark brown, black, and navy are all safe colors, but be sure to complement your clothing.


Loafers are an acceptable option, but they tend to appear less formal than Oxfords, Brogues, or other heeled shoes with laces.

, Pocket squares are an effective way to add a pop of color.If you wear a tie, ensure that these two items complement each other in style and color.


Wear socks that match your trousers and that are long enough to cover your calves when you sit.Easily stand out without showing off with small details like a set of cufflinks or a nice watch.

Choose a color scheme.,
Add a centerpiece.,
Incorporate natural elements.,
Add relevant holiday decor.,
Add a special homemade detail.,
Arrange the food well.",How to Decorate a Table for a Party2," The color scheme is a big part of setting the tone for your dining experience. Consider what type of gathering you are having and what feel you would like it to have. Light colors will come across as more delicate, bold colors appear more fun and energetic, dark colors can add romance and sophistication.


Mix it up and try using some fun patterns. A bold geometric design will add artistic flair while a soft floral pattern will add elegance. With patterns, a little goes a long way. Consider using them to provide an interesting accent, such as with the napkins or a table runner.
Each season has a distinct feel to it that can be reflected with the table’s color scheme. For spring, pastels or floral patterns are a safe bet. For a winter theme, you could go cream colored or ivory and add in some darker browns or maroon. In fall, jewel tones can beautifully complement the rich shades of harvest. In summer, bright colors will make a bold statement.

, You can buy one to match your theme or use a general one. A floral arrangement always looks nice. Just make sure it isn’t too large. You don’t want to block the line of sight of your guests.


If you are feeling artistic, try making your own centerpiece. You could add glass stones to an elegant bowl or decorate a small pot of flowers. Even food can be arranged into a centerpiece when placed strategically on a small pedestal. This works especially well with seasonal items., Bringing in nature is a great way to add warmth to your table. In winter, you could arrange a few pinecones and a couple of small evergreen branches. In spring, you could decorate with a few flower petals sprinkled on your table. Fall is a great time to add some seasonal foods for decor, such as pomegranates, corn, and squash. You could put out a bowl of fruit in the summer, such as oranges., This will define your theme and add festive flair to your table. For a Christmas party, you could fill a clear bowl with ornaments and use that as the centerpiece. For a Hanukkah party, you can use a menorah as the centerpiece. For a Thanksgiving party, you could incorporate a cornucopia and a couple of decorative candles.For a Halloween party, try using a few small pumpkins placed strategically around your food. If it is a Halloween party for kids, you could even include a few markers with the pumpkins so that they can decorate them.

, A personal touch goes a long way. This shows the effort you put into creating a special experience for your guests. You could try making customized name cards or even a homemade centerpiece. Arrange your own flowers or have fun making DIY placemats. When you make things yourself, it also helps to save money.


Don’t overdo it. The table should never appear cluttered. You want your guests to have enough space to move and breath without worrying about hitting something or knocking things over.

, The food should be evenly spaced in the center of the table. You could try to add style to your arrangement by placing dishes according to size or you could arrange food by type. If it is a large table, setting the food closer to guests so that they can pass it around is helpful.


Set up food in different heights. If you have a lot of dishes, levels can help fit more without being overcrowded. Try using a stand for your bread platter or placing an entree on top of a covered box. If you don’t enough horizontal space, vertical space always helps.Use a separate table if there isn't enough room. Sometimes there is more food than space at the table. Don’t let this deter you. Set up a serving table near the dining table and have guests help themselves. This will create a buffet style dining experience. You could do something similar for dessert or even for drinks. It doesn't have to all fit at one table.

Include something fun.",How to Decorate a Table for a Party3," This will add to the fun of the party. Let your kid help you decide or surprise them based on their interests. You could do a sports theme or a certain color scheme, you could incorporate their favorite superhero or tv show. The possibilities are endless!Go to a local party store and see what options they have. A lot of times, you can find all of the decor you need that goes with your theme. They might have table cloths, plates, cups, and even goodies that will set a very fun tone for the party.

, It is important to protect the table from spills or other incidents. You could use a tablecloth that goes with the theme of their party. The kids will love it and it will make your life much easier.


Consider using a plain sheet of paper as a table covering. Then place crayons on the table so that the kids can draw and enjoy themselves as they wait for food.

, You probably don’t want to give your best china to a five year old! If it is a casual birthday party, paper and plastic utensils are perfectly acceptable. If it is a more formal party such as a holiday party that requires a kids’ table, try to tie in the theme of the adult table so that they feel included. You could use the same napkins as the adult table and perhaps even the same tablecloth. That way it will every bit as important as the adult table.


This also depends on the age of the kids and the style of the party. Use your judgment to know what they can handle. For young children, use plastic cups instead of glasses and don’t set knives out.

, Especially if it is a kid’s birthday party, try to make it special. Include a noise maker or funny hats or a small game. Even a little pouch of treats for each child will put a big smile on their face. It is a party, after all.

Decide what kind of DJ you are looking for.,
Figure out your budget.,
Consider where the DJ is from.,
Know who you're getting.,
Understand your package.,
Consider how long the DJ service has been in business for.,
Find out whether the DJ service has performed at the venue in which you are having your event.,
Read testimonials and reviews.,
Find out the DJ service's policy on additional hours, should the event require more hours on the day of the event.,
Consider whether the DJ offers customizable music made by the hosts.",How to Find the Right DJ Service for Your Event," Do you want a DJ that is very talkative on the microphone or do you want a DJ who focuses the attention more on the hosts? Do you want a DJ service with professional lights? Turntables? Karaoke? Write down what you envision your event to look like and how you see the DJ performance.;
, Some DJ services will charge next to nothing for their services. Be careful. If the DJ service is less than $100 per hour find out why the DJ service is so cheap. You pay for what you get.

, It's not uncommon for large DJ services to hire out other DJ services to perform events for them. This is a huge red flag! It's best to hire a DJ service that lives close to the venue of which you will be having your event at.

, It is very important to know who your DJ will be. Make sure the DJ service states in the contract who will be your DJ. Find out who your DJ will be for your event and setup a time to meet with the DJ prior to the event.

, Some DJ services have “hidden” costs: setup, takedown, travel, meeting, preparations, etc. Ask the DJ service exactly what will be included in your package. All-inclusive deals are a great option especially if you want to avoid unknown fees.

, The longer the DJ service has been in business the better. Five years experience and greater is a good indicator of a DJ service with good experience.

, If they have, this will be a huge benefit, as the DJ service will know how the venue operates and where the best place to setup is. If the DJ service has not performed at the venue, make sure the DJ service and the venue are on the same page and that the DJ knows where to setup.

, Testimonials are very important. Ask the DJ service for testimonials or three references of past persons they have performed for. DJ websites typically have testimonials somewhere on their page. If you can’t find any, ask the DJ service for three references.

, Many events end up going longer then they were previously planned to end. Some DJ services take advantage of this and charge a very high price for additional hours. Some DJ services will not go beyond their contracted times. Ask the DJ service if they allow for additional hours and how much it would cost. If they charge more than $25 per hour more than the contracted hourly rate, you may want to go with a different DJ service.

, Many DJ services like to play their own music that they deem appropriate for the event. Ask the DJ service if they have a form to request the type of music for the night and a listing of songs you would like to hear for the night.

, Ask them if they require anything special in their introduction. Ask them to pronounce their full name, so that you can say it with ease., Go to their website, listen to their music, read their blog or ask for their resume. You should be able to talk about the person in-depth and off-the-cuff.

, Learning about intricacies in the event will help you stay on tone as you present.

, A theme will connect each of your introductions and improve event cohesiveness.

, Don’t improvise or you are likely to say the wrong thing or take up too much time. The following are good rules to follow when writing your script:


Don’t use inside jokes. If the whole audience doesn’t get them, they can ruin the cohesive feeling in the group.
Don’t use offensive language or stereotypes. If you can’t tell a joke without offending, avoid humor and be sincere.
Avoid hyperbole when you explain the presenters. Don’t say “She is the best person in the world,” say, “She won the Community Leader Award for the last three years.” Let the resume speak for itself when possible.
Keep it short.
Spend the same amount of time and care on each presenter.

, You need time to get comfortable, learn the layout and practice. You are the representative of the event, so it should feel like your home for the next few hours or days., Make sure you have an AV person who will troubleshoot for you if something goes wrong.

, This should include both the people running the venue and the event. They will be your support if something goes wrong.

, You may be considered “the boss” during the event, and you must be able to direct people about how they should exit the venue.

, If someone doesn’t show up, you will need to streamline the schedule or fill a gap. Tell the presenters their order of appearance.

, This old cliché is extremely important for an emcee because you must look professional, well groomed and poised. Establish whether you should be in formal, semi-formal or business casual clothing before the event starts.

, If you are in a noisy setting, now is your chance to get people’s attention. You can do so with a carefully rehearsed shout, a clinking of a glass or an exclamation like, “Give me a thumbs up if you can hear me in the back.”, Start with a friendly and sincere tone. Answer the question, “Why are we all here?”

, Feel free to start with a quick, funny anecdote to set the mood.

, Recognize anyone who helped put on the event. If the producers of the event want to identify big donors, now is the time to sincerely thank them.

, From the time you start presenting until the event finishes, you should be in good humor and have a smile.

, To control the event, you will need to be at the ready. If you need water or a bathroom break, plan your timing in advance.

, You are the timekeeper of the event. If something goes wrong, figure out ahead of time if there’s something you can cut.


Have a short story you can tell if you need to fill time.

, If people have been sitting for a while, they will take a cue off of your mood. Let them know how important a raffle, auction or presentation item is.

, Thank the organizers, presenters and staff again.

, If this is a promotion or there is another event, announce it and tell people one thing they should do to get involved.

Serve walnuts on salads.,
Add crunch to vegetable sides.,
Serve walnuts with cheese dishes.",How to Serve Walnuts1," Adding a few walnuts to any salad increases the salad’s fat content slightly. You need a little bit of fat in your daily diet, and adding walnuts to what’s otherwise a really healthy meal can help you get that daily amount without going overboard. Walnuts pair best with salads that include fruit and cheese.


For example, you can throw together some mixed greens, sliced pears (use fresh, not canned, pears for this recipe), dried cherries, and raw or candied walnuts to make a great salad.;
, If you’re tired of serving up plain vegetables, add walnuts to the recipe. In a lot of cases, the mild flavor of the walnuts actually enhances the flavor of the vegetables.


For example, you can toss ¼ cup (2 oz) crushed walnuts with blanched brussel sprouts, sautéed shallots, champagne vinegar, and Dijon mustard., Walnuts pair really well with cheese. Adding them to any cheese appetizer is a great way to punch up the flavor. It also adds a different texture to the smoothness of the cheese.


For example, you can top brie with roasted walnuts. Crush the roasted nuts into small pieces and serve them over the brie with a few tablespoons of honey and spices.For a more individual cheese dish with walnuts, stuff a date with one tablespoon of goat cheese, then stick a walnut half into the cheese. These are a great option if you’re looking for a way to serve walnuts at a less formal dinner or cocktail party because they’re easier for your guests to handle as they mingle."
"
Replace fats with walnuts.,
Use walnuts instead of breadcrumbs.,
Use walnuts as a meat substitute.",How to Serve Walnuts2," You can create healthier versions of recipes that call for fats like butter by using walnuts instead. Walnuts are high in fat content, but it’s much healthier fat than what you find in butter, so you don’t have to feel so guilty about those recipes!


For example, replacing the butter in pesto with walnuts gives you a creamy, delicious texture and taste with less calories. Blend basil, olive oil, finely chopped walnuts, and garlic cloves in a food processor. Add a bit of Parmesan cheese and blend for five to 10 seconds more.You can also use walnuts to make walnut butter. Walnuts are generally better for you than peanuts (and people are often allergic to peanuts but not walnuts), so this is a great substitution. Blend equal amounts roasted walnuts and raw walnuts in the food processor for about 30 seconds. Add honey and a pinch of salt and blend until smooth., A lot of recipes call for breadcrumbs, and walnuts that have been crushed very finely are a great substitute. Walnuts give you all of the flavor but less of the fat that breadcrumbs do.


For example, you can make a great walnut coating for fish. Simply crush walnuts very finely and press onto the top of your fish filets before you roast them. You can spice up the coating by adding garlic, salt, and pepper., This one sounds a little crazy, but using walnuts alongside other ingredients like cauliflower can give you the taste and texture of meat while keeping your dish vegetarian. This type of substitution is great if you’re vegetarian or vegan and miss certain flavors or if you’re just trying to save some money at the grocery store.To make a vegetarian meat substitute with walnuts, cook a finely chopped mix of cauliflower, mushrooms, carrots, yellow onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium high heat for about 5 minutes. Add a finely chopped meal of walnuts and sundried tomatoes to the veggies on the stove and cook for 1 minute. 2 cups (16 oz) of this mix will replace 1 pound of meat.

"
"
Serve them plain.,
Dress them up.,
Use them in a snack mix.",How to Serve Walnuts3," Walnuts make a great snack all by themselves. The high fat content can also help you to feel fuller longer. You can keep raw walnuts in a container on your counter for easy access or throw a handful in a plastic bag or container to take to work.

, If raw walnuts aren’t your style, try dressing them up a little. Walnuts are great candied or dipped in chocolate and make a nice addition to an hors d’oeuvres table, especially during the holidays.


Make maple candied walnuts by quickly adding 1 cup (8 oz) raw walnut halves, 2 tablespoons (1 oz) maple syrup and a pinch of salt to a hot skillet that’s been sitting over medium high heat. Stir constantly until the nuts are coated and the syrup has evaporated. Be careful not to let the syrup burn. Let them cool on wax paper, pulling them apart as they do so. Store in an airtight container.You can also simply melt some chocolate – dark or milk – and dip the walnuts in about halfway. Lay them on wax paper to dry completely and then store in an airtight container., Walnuts are a great addition to any snack mix you might want to whip up. Add them to your choice of dried fruit (cranberries, pineapple, and banana chips are great options) and a handful or two of coated chocolate candy for an easy snack mix."

The freshness of your walnuts will ultimately determine how much oil you will extract. , Using a hinged nutcracker, place the whole nut between the two metal hinges and squeeze tightly. , Separate the walnut meat from the shell, including the thin seed jacket. Don't worry about breaking the meat, as you will be grinding it in the next part., Collect your shelled walnuts in a bowl as you go, and throw out the shells., The walnuts should be ground using a meat grinder, a food processor, or even a Nutribullet, whichever you have access to.When using a food processor or Nutribullet, make sure blades and nuts are at a cool room temperature before grinding. This will prevent overheating, and keep the nuts from turning into a paste., It's important not to overfill food processors, as this will cause an uneven consistency during processing., “Pulse” grind your walnuts by turning your machine on for a couple of seconds and then off again., Continue the pulse method of grinding until your walnut meat is a fine nut meal consistency.

Do not blend continuously, or the oils will release too soon., After grinding a cup of the meat, put it aside in a bowl while continuing to grind the remaining walnuts., Pour your ground walnuts into a pot big enough for you to add water and still stir comfortably without spilling., Pour just enough water into the pot to cover walnut meat., While the mixture is heating, it needs to be stirred continuously. Once the moisture has evaporated, it is ready to be pressed., Every oil press is different. Some presses don't require the grinding step, while others don't require heating. Make sure you know what type of press you’ll be using in advance, and follow the instructions for your appliance., Have a clean container prepared to catch the oil as you’re pressing., Following the directions on your appliance, begin putting small amounts of the heated walnut meat into the press and squeeze until you get oil. Once you’ve gone through all of your walnuts you should have approximately two quarts of oil, depending on the quality of your nuts. , Run the cheesecloth under cold water to remove any lint that may be stuck., Shake open the cheesecloth and line the inside of your colander/funnel with it. The cheesecloth is doing the filtering, but the colander/funnel gives structure, making the process easier., A pitcher will make it easier to dispense into bottles for storing., Take the bowl of oil you caught from the press and pour the oil through the cheesecloth colander/ funnel and into the pitcher. The cheesecloth will catch any debris remaining in the oil., Use small to medium sized brown or stainless steel bottles. These are better at protecting the oil from heat or damaging light. , Dispense the pitcher of oil into your chosen bottles., When you’ve filled a bottle, make sure to seal it to maintain freshness., Put the date of production on your bottles, so you always have a time reference when you use it., Refrigeration is the best step in prolonging the life of your walnut oil.

Walnut oil will be fresh for about two to three months."

Add the walnuts, sugar, and butter, and cook.,
Remove the nuts from the pan and separate.,
Allow the nuts to cool and serve.",How to Make Candied Walnuts1," On your stovetop, place a medium size non-stick skillet on the burner. Turn the heat to medium, and allow the pan to fully heat, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes., When the pan is heated, stir in 1 cup (108 g) of shelled walnuts, ¼ cup (50 g) of white sugar, and 1 tablespoon (14 g) of unsalted butter. Allow the mixture to cook for approximately 5 minutes on medium, stirring often to ensure that it cooks evenly.You want to cook the walnut mixture until the sugar melts and all of the nuts are coated with the syrup.
It’s especially important to stir the mixture near the end of the cooking time because that’s when the nuts are most likely to burn.
You can easily double the recipe if you want.

, When all of the walnuts are coated in the sugar and butter syrup, take the pan off the burner. Transfer the nuts from the pan to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Make sure to separate all of the nuts as you lay them out because they will stick together in a clump if they’re touching when they cool.Use two spatulas or wooden spoons to separate the nuts quickly so they don’t have a chance to stick together.

, Once the walnuts are spread out in a single layer, let them cool for approximately 10 minutes or until the coating on the outside hardens. Place them in a bowl, and serve as a snack.If you don’t plan to eat the candied walnuts right away, be sure to store them in an airtight container.

Next, grease a large baking sheet with a nonstick cooking spray and set it aside.Make sure that you know how your oven indicates that it’s reached the desired temperature. Many models flash an indicator light or beep to alert you.

, Add 1 cup (108 g) of shelled walnuts, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of light corn syrup, 1 tablespoon (12 g) of granulated sugar, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground black pepper, and a pinch of cayenne pepper to a medium size bowl. Stir together to ensure that all of the nuts are fully coated.If you don’t have light corn syrup on hand, you can substitute maple syrup.

, Once the nuts are coated, transfer them to the greased baking sheet. Place the nuts in the oven, and allow them to bake until they are golden brown and the coating is bubbling, which should take approximately 15 minutes.The nuts may clump together, so use a spatula or wooden spoon to separate them when you place them on the baking sheet.
Because the coating may spread as it heats, it’s a good idea to check on the walnuts at regular intervals during baking. Separate any nuts that wind up clumped together.

, When the walnuts are golden brown, remove the pan from the oven, and allow the nuts to cool completely on the sheet, which should take approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Place in a bowl for serving, and transfer to an airtight container to store them.The candied walnuts can be made up to three days in advance.

, When the butter is melted, stir 2 cups (216 g) of shelled walnuts, ½ cup (100 g) of brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons (4 g) of ground cinnamon into the pan. Let the mixture heat on medium until the sugar dissolves, which should take approximately 3 to 4 minutes.Be sure to stir the mixture constantly as you’re waiting for the sugar to melt so it doesn’t burn and the nuts don’t stick together.

, After the brown sugar has dissolved, remove the nuts from the skillet with a spatula or slotted spoon and set them on a silicone baking mat. Let them cool for an hour, so they’re completely cooled and the coating has hardened.If you don’t have a silicone baking mat, you can use a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Store the candied walnuts in an airtight container. They can last for up to two weeks.

",How to Harvest Black Walnuts," Some walnut trees are very tall so picking them off the branches is out of the question. Plus, picking them can sometimes damage the tree limbs, so just wait for them to fall and gather them up. Be sure to wear heavy duty rubber gloves as the cheap disposables will not work.;
, As black walnuts ripen, the husk changes from solid green to yellowish green. Walnut juice leaves a dark stain, so wear gloves or use tongs when you handle un-husked walnuts. Press on the skin of the walnut with your thumb; ripe nuts will show an indentation. Removal can be done by just taking a small jack knife and cutting around the hull and peeling off, or you can lay them on the driveway and run over them with your car! It often is just as easy to roll them under your foot until the hull is cracked open, pick them up and peel the hull off. The video below shows the hull being taken off in an antique corn huller. Any of these methods will work.


For an easy way to separate the hulls, put them in water. The hulls float, the nuts don't. See the video for a demonstration.

, Black walnuts contain juglone, a compound that inhibits growth in many species of plants. Juglone degrades with exposure to heat, sunlight and air, and should break down completely after several weeks or months in a compost pile. Finished compost from a well-structured and maintained pile will be safe to use to grow even sensitive crops, such as nightshades (tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, eggplant, etc).

, You can lay them out on a layer of newspapers to dry for a few days or longer. Some people leave them for much longer. The dryer the nut, the easier the nut meat is to remove. You also can store them in the shell in a dry, squirrel proof area. Do not lay them out where the squirrels can find them. They will take every one they can.

, The vise does not do as much damage to the walnut meat inside. This part can be a bit tricky and can take some time. If you don't have time on your hands you will not like doing the harvesting of these nuts. You cannot be in a hurry in this step or you will damage the nut meat.

, If you can and if it is stubborn, you can use a commercial nut pick (usually can buy these and the nutcracker around holiday season in grocery stores or any time of the year in cooking supply stores). If you are just using the nuts for a black walnut cake, it does not matter if they are broken up badly. This is perfect for the cake.

, Remember these things are really hard and can be sharp so don't leave them where someone can step on them. The discarded shells make a fine polishing medium that can be used in a rotary tumbler, and are often used to polish brass objects. If you have a large enough walnut harvest, you might consider using the shells as a timely source of winter heat in your wood stove.

, Some species of walnut trees have different flavors. Some are stronger than others.

,, Your hands will be stained for days!

,, It won't take much effort. Then peel it right off the nut.

Harvest nuts when the outer husk is still green.,
Husk the nuts.,
Wash the unshelled nuts.,
Dry the nuts in a well-ventilated area.,
Check the walnuts to see if they're dry.,
Store the nuts until you're ready to use them.,
Crack the nutshells.,
Let the nutmeat sit out for two days.,
Store or use the nuts.",How to Dry Walnuts," It should be soft enough for you to indent it with your fingers, but still green, rather than brown or mottled. This indicates that the nut has fully formed and is ready to be used.


Black walnuts usually become ripe in September or October.
You can harvest them from the ground or shake them off the tree with a pole.
Wear gloves when handling black walnuts, since they stain clothes and skin.;
, Even when walnuts are mature, it's a little difficult to remove the husks; they can't just be peeled off. The goal is to get them off without breaking the nuts inside. There are a few popular methods for husking the nuts, so choose the one that works best for your needs:


Roll the nuts under a heavy boot to dislodge the husks.
Roll the nuts under a wooden board or another heavy object.
Place the walnuts on a driveway and drive back and forth over them. The husks will come off, but the nuts won't break.

, Fill a bucket with cold water and use it to wash off the nuts, which will be covered with juice and dirt. Discard the ones that float, since this means they don't have meat inside (in other words, they are ""unfilled"")., Spread them in a thin layer on a tarp or another clean surface in your garage, basement, or another area that gets plenty of good circulation but is out of direct sunlight. Leave them there for two weeks, until the shells are completely dried out.


If there's no threat of rain, you may dry your walnuts outdoors.
Stir them occasionally to promote circulation., Open up a nut or two and check the meat inside. A walnut is ready when the meat inside is brittle, and is surrounded by a brittle tissue. If it's still rubbery and moist, continue drying the nuts. Storing them before they're properly dried will result in mold issues and rotting.

, Once they're completely dry, place them in mesh bags or baskets. Store them in a cool, dark place, such as a cellar, or freeze them in your freezer. They'll keep for one to two years, depending on the quality of the nuts.

, Since walnut shells are so difficult to crack, nutcrackers don't typically work (in fact, you're more likely to break your nutcracker than the shell). People have developed a few different techniques for getting to the meat:


Pre-condition the shells to make them easier to crack by soaking the nuts in water for two hours, then placing them in a covered container overnight. Crack when the shells are soft.
Place the walnuts in a bag and use a hammer to smash the shells. You'll have to hand-separate the meat from the broken shells.
Crack them one at a time by wrapping them in a dish towel and banging them with a hammer.

, During this time it will dry out a little further. This step is essential if you plant to store the unshelled nuts, since they'll spoil if they're still holding a lot of moisture. Place the kernels on a baking sheet or tray and let them sit in a well-ventilated spot until they're dry.

, If you plan to store them, place them in an air-tight container and store them in the pantry or the refrigerator. If you prefer, roast the nuts until they're golden brown before storing.

Determine your design.,
Create or download a heart template.,

Wash and dry each piece of fruit.,
Cut/peel and remove the fruit’s skin.,
Cut out larger or base designs.,
Slice heart shapes using template(s).,
Assemble fruit arrangement.,
Finished.

",How to Make Heart Shaped Fruit Designs," Before you even purchase the fruit, you’ll need a “blueprint” to help you decide what kind of fruit to purchase, how much, and the overall design scope.


Decide how you will present the fruit. You could lay out the heart-shaped fruit on a platter or you could line hearts up on a wooden skewer. Additionally, you could “mix and match” fruit shapes (i.e. cut out a heart shape inside a slice of watermelon and then replace the cut space with a heart that was cut from a mango).






Select your serving bowl or platter. The size will dictate the amount of room your arrangement will take up on the table or display.





;
, In order to ensure each shape is perfect, you should have a variety of heart sizes on hand. Either freehand draw or download the heart shape onto a regular piece of paper. Then transfer the shape template to a piece of parchment paper so it won’t whither or tear during use (or interaction with the fruit). Remember to cut out the template too.

, Avoid mushy (or overly ripe) fruit. That way, the fruit will taste better. Make sure that when you hold the fruit in your hands, you can gently squeeze it so it doesn’t dent.


Examine fruit for molding or browning. Even though you may not be using the rind or external section of the fruit, browning may indicate that the flesh may be compromised.






Consider choosing fruit that is in season. Purchasing fruit is not only for freshness, but fruit that is in season will save you a good chunk of money.







, Make sure the fruit is completely dry before cutting into it so that it doesn’t slip from your hand and open you to being cut.

, When it comes to fruit with eatable skin like apples, make a personal decision whether you want to leave it on (to add more color or contrast) or you like your apple completely naked.

, This includes a fruit base that might hold wooden skewers or larger fruit slices that will display smaller hearts. This step will most likely not involve cutting out heart shapes.

, Lay the template over the pre-cut fruit and follow the template lines with your paring knife. Re-use or discard surrounding fruit as you work.

, Using toothpicks and wooden skewers, put hearts together and/or fill empty heart spaces with cut fruit.

, Decide on an invitation that goes with the theme of the party and send them out (or email if you've chosen e-vites) about 2 months before the event. This gives guests plenty of time to save it on their calendar and purchase gifts if they are customary for your specific event.


Be sure to include an RSVP card or number to call and give guests a timeline so that you have ample time to prepare. (Usually 2 weeks before is enough time for you to get your menu together and grocery shop).

Make sure that your bathroom is clean (shower doesn't have unsightly hard water stains, mirror doesn't have toothpaste spots). Stock the bathroom with plenty of soap, hand towels, toilet paper, room spray, maybe a small basket of feminine products, and some lotion on the counter.
Adding a little bowl of wrapped mints is a nice touch too. Your bathroom is a very personal area so creating a space that is welcoming and refreshing is comforting to guests, especially if they've never been in your home before.

, For instance, if it's a bridal shower you can have everyone write their name and their relationship to the bride. If it's the type of party that you're playing games, you could encourage guests to play a name game to get to know each other a little better. Make your guests feel welcome by introducing yourself when they arrive and offering to take their coat/hat/purse and get them a drink.

, It's always a bummer when a guest points out that the punch is too low. Save the embarrassment on your part and keep a mental note to watch food and drinks. If you're hosting a full-on dinner party, then you should keep track of timing with when dinner will be served.

, Remember to thank everyone for coming at the end of the event. If the occasion calls for it, giving out little party favors are always a nice touch. If gifts were involved, be sure to keep a list of the gifts received and the person who brought it so that thank you notes can be sent out about a week following the event.

,, Use tongs or wear disposable gloves to hold the peeps. You might find it helps to also use a spoon to spoon over melted chocolate, as well as the simple dip. This is helpful because the sugary texture of the peep can cause the chocolate to drip off in parts, so you'll need to keep spooning the chocolate back in place.

,


If you have a marble slab, the peeps can set on this; cover with wax paper first.

, Either sprinkle over or roll quickly in a saucer or wide bowl of sprinkles.

, An array of chicks or bunnies can look very cute when packaged in this way.

, If placing in an Easter basket, wrap in clear cellophane first, either individually or in a line.

, Use such items as chopped jelly beans, small pieces of shoestring licorice, carefully chopped M&Ms, etc. These items must be stuck on the peep while the chocolate is still wet; be aware that if the candy item is too heavy, it risks sliding down the face of the peep and making a mess.


Cake frosting or icing in a tube can be more effective and less heavy than adding candies if you want to decorate further.
For bunny peeps, the addition of just one thing can be very effective––namely, a tail. To make this, use small marshmallows cut in half. Stick onto the base of the back of the wet chocolate coated bunny and dry facing downward, with the tail sticking up. These are very cute.

If not, you may have to fall back on creating a doggy theme without the real dogs spreading their paw marks everywhere.


Consider whether the dogs (and humans) can all get along. Like people, dogs have different temperaments and some just can’t get along with others. Do some detective work to see if all your guests’ dogs will be able to cohabitate during the party. If you're not sure, that needs to be put down as a ""no.""
Consider implementing a few ground rules in case trouble starts brewing. This might include having a safety place designated for each dog (a room, crate or owner's car for immediate return home) if things get out of hand. Another useful rule is asking owners to keep their pets on leashes; that way, the owner remains in control, not the dog.
Evaluate the space where you plan to throw the party. Can it accommodate both dogs and people? An outdoor, dog-friendly space is ideal for a party that includes both dogs and people. A fenced-in backyard or even possibly a dog park might work for a setting. Indoors is probably not ideal unless it's a really large space with places off the side that owners can take their dogs to keep them calm. Another idea is to host the party at a pet supply shop (some stores host dog friendly parties) or through a dog trainer. Call and ask about the options such places offer.;
, The reason behind the party will clearly impact what you're planning on doing by way of decorations, invitations to relevant guests, etc. Is the surprise party for your dog loving friend’s birthday or are you celebrating a victory from a dog show or a promotion at work? Perhaps the party is for your friend's dog!


Birthday. Include the traditional elements of a surprise party with dog themed flair. If you're planning a surprise birthday party, consider having the event on a day other than your friend’s actual birthday for the added element of surprise (for instance, a week or a few days leading up to the birthday). However, if you're able to enlist the help and acquiescence of close family and friends, the actual day is perfect, provided they play roles of throwing your friend off the scent of what is really happening.
Celebration. Find ways to punctuate the specific celebration within your party by including elements such as inviting guests who are part of the reason why you're celebrating (for example, a promotion at work, inviting coworkers or even the boss). If the event is because the dog has won a prize at a show, see if you can have a judge or other show entrants appear too.
Holiday. Celebrate dogs in general by throwing a party on “National Dog Day” in August or throw your party during May, which is “National Pet Month.”

, Determine when is the best time and day for not only guests, but most importantly for your guest of honor. If the guest of honor has upcoming events or plans, work around his or her schedule to arrive at a date that works well for him or her and then ask friends and family members. If you aren’t sure of his or her schedule, inquire about planning an outing for the two of you and then put your covert operation in place using that day and time. Of course, asking close family and friends to help out with the date (and other aspects) is another sensible approach so that they can be in on the event and help with covering up what is happening until the last moment.


If you're accommodating both humans and dogs, identify a day (or evening) and amount of time that would be best for both. In many cases, dogs are a bit like small children––after an hour or two, they’ve had it and start to either get tired and possibly cranky or start getting into trouble. Also, their owners will probably be tired of keeping an eye on them for too long.
In some cases, it might be appropriate to hire a professional dog walker to keep the dogs amused when the owners have had enough and want to just enjoy the party for themselves. This person might even be trusted to drop off dogs at their respective homes or to simply take the dogs for a walk to a local park for another hour, giving guests enough time to chill out without their pet charges.

, If you’ve identified the spot, reserve the space or inquire about whether it allows pets for a party. Take all factors into consideration including the time of day and the guests (including the dogs) when making the decision. If the part is to be in the guest of honor's own home, you'll need to work this out with the other household members.


Identify a pet-friend spot if dogs will be attending. Make sure the spot is pet-friendly so that guests can relax and have fun. Areas that are unfenced or restrictive may not be the ideal place for a pet party.
Consider the number of people in relation to space. You may have more location options if you keep the guest list small, however a dog park or someone’s home may be ideal for any group size.
If you plan to host the party at the guest of honor’s home, clear your plans with his or her spouse, family or roommate. If the guest of honor lives alone, ask his or her close friend to weigh in on your plans––would he or she enjoy a party at home and would inviting dogs be okay?

, Determine how you will surprise your friend for that real “gotcha” moment.


Devise a clandestine plan. Decide how you will get your friend to the location or out of his or her home and back if the party is going to be thrown at his or her house. Consider asking your pal to walk dogs together or run an errand at the pet store. If you plan to include dogs and the party location is elsewhere, you’ll need a pet friendly excuse to get both your friend and his or her pooch out of the house together.
Find a place for everyone to hide––including the dogs. Evaluate the room to determine how everyone will hide for the surprise. Also, consider asking each owner to bring the dog’s kennel/crate or at least a leash to keep their pet quiet or restrained during the big reveal. One all-too-possible way to blow the surprise if care isn't taken is to have your guest of honor enter the room and be attacked by a pack of over-excited dogs.

, No dog party would be complete without pet-friendly and human food inspired by man’s best friend.


Consider pet-safe food if dogs are in attendance. Even though the dogs may be getting special dog treats, be sure to eliminate any food from your menu that could pose a toxic hazard to dogs such as chocolate, grapes or onions. Find dog treats from a local pet food store instead and keep all human food safely away from the dogs.
Have plenty of bowls of water around for the dogs to drink from.
Create a dog or bone shaped food to accentuate your theme. Whether it’s a birthday cake or a congratulatory dessert, ask your baker (or do it yourself) to create a doggie inspired centerpiece dessert. Cookies made into the shape of bones can be a lot of fun too, although make it clear which are for the dogs and which are suitable for human consumption!

, Depending on where you're throwing the party, have a small wading pool available to dogs for a quick swim or set up a dog obstacle course. You could also have “pin the tail on the dog” for human guests or have a contest where guests eat their cake like a pup (no hands). A fun activity if children are involved is decorating cupcakes with dog designs.


Provide guests with “doggie” bags as party favors. Both dogs and guests could go home with fun favors such as a new dog toy or special homemade treats for the pups. A dog- or bone-shaped picture frame might be a nice party favor for the humans.

, You may have quite a mess, especially if you have included your four-legged friends.


Consider hiring someone or a company to help make the food, serve and clean up. If you plan to host a big surprise party, splurge for a little assistance. If hiring a catering company isn’t within your budget, ask neighborhood teens if they’d like to make some money helping out.
Ask close friends to help with the party. From planning to clean up, ask close friends or family members of the guest of honor if they wouldn’t mind lending a hand.

Consider how you wish to handle the situation before you speak to the party crashers.,
Do you simply wish the party crashers to leave?

,
Are you open to allowing the party crashers to stay if they were invited by another party guest?

,
Are you open to allowing the party crashers to stay regardless of who they know at the party?

,
Approach the party crashers politely and calmly.,
Pay close attention to the party crashers and note their demeanor.,
Ask the party crashers how they came to know about the party.

,
Were they invited by another guest?,
How the party crashers learned about the party can help you to decide whether to allow them to stay.,
Decide how you would like to handle the situation.,
Remain calm.,
Take your earlier assessment of the party crashers into consideration in how you handle the situation.,
Explain to the party crashers that the party is by invitation only, and that you would like them to leave.,
Expect a little resistance.,
Begin escorting them to the door while you calmly continue explaining the situation.,
If you have a few friends around, they can help guide and contain the party crashers on their way to the door.,
Try to avoid physical contact, but a firm hand to the shoulder can help encourage someone turn around and depart.

,
Be prepared for, but do not invite trouble.,
Keep an eye on the party crashers as they leave, but don't follow them off your property.",How to Deal With Party Crashers,";
,,,, Introduce yourself as the host or hostess of the party. You may wish to do this with a few level-headed friends who can help provide support.

, Do they seem calm, friendly, intoxicated or aggressive? How they look and act will be important to your handling of the situation.

,, Did they overhear others discussing it at another event? Did they just happen to walk by?

, This information can also help you to know whether to expect others.

, If the party crashers are friendly and you would like them to stay, all you need to do is make them feel welcome. If you would like them to leave, read on for some suggestions about how to do that.

, Use non-confrontational but confident body language while doing this. You are not attempting to start a fight.

, If they appeared intoxicated, threatening or aggressive, make sure you have friends to back you up and that someone is able to call for the police in case of trouble.

, Do this politely but firmly. Most people are not seeking trouble, and your handling of the situation can go a long way toward avoiding any.

, Party crashers are usually looking for a good time – or possibly trouble – and may not want to leave. Explain that the party is private, and that while you are sorry, they will need to leave.

, You can also just place them right on the grill, with the cut side facing up. Sprinkle them lightly with water to help them roast.

, Roast them until they're tender and the shell comes off easily. While they're roasting, use a spoon or spatula to move them around every few minutes so they don't burn. When they're done roasting, remove them from the oven.

, Wait 2-3 minutes for the chestnuts to cool off and then wrap them in a towel and squeeze them until the skin is crushed. Leave them in the towel for another five minutes.

, Do this while they're still warm to make the process easier. Take out the inner skin along with the shell. If any nuts are hard to peel, you can heat them briefly for a few more minutes until they're ready.

, Enjoy these nuts on their own while they're nice and hot.

Gather tools.,
Grasp the nut in the vise.,
Place the gripped nut against the metal bar.,
Pound the nut with the hammer.,
Release the nut from the vise.",How to Crack Macadamia Nuts1," You can make a makeshift macadamia nutcracker with a vise grip, an iron bar to set the nut against, and a flat hammer.Vise grips are common tools available at any hardware store. If you love macadamia nuts and plan to shell them often, it's worth buying a vise grip for this specific purpose (though you'll probably find other uses for it as well).
Be sure the hammer has a flat end, rather than a round one. You'll need to exert force evenly on the nutshells.
If you don't have an iron bar, any tough, metal surface will do. Other hard surfaces like marble, glass, concrete or wood could get damaged by the pounding, so make sure you're working over metal.;
, Lie it up so that the seam of the nut is facing upward, rather than against the inside of the vise. Set the vise to grip it tightly.

, Hold the vise handles tightly and make sure you've got a good grip, since you don't want the nut to slip when you bring the hammer down.

, Try to hit it square on the seam so that it cracks cleanly. Let the hammer bounce back toward you as the nut cracks open.You may have to try this a couple of times before you learn exactly how much force to exert.
Letting the hammer bounce or pull back slightly is important, since it keeps the hammer from smashing the nut inside.

, The shell will fall away, and the intact nut is now ready to be popped into your mouth or used in a recipe.

Find a rock with a hole in it.,
Set the rock in the hole seam-side up.,
Pound the nut with a rock.,
Extract the nut.,
Finished.

",How to Crack Macadamia Nuts2," This method originated in Hawaii, and is still commonly used there to crack into macadamias. The rock provides a hard surface to stabilize the nut. Look for a small hole that's deep enough to hold the nut in place, but shallow enough so that it sticks out over the hole a bit.


If you live near volcanic rock, you'll likely find some with holes just the right size.
If you don't live near volcanic rock, locate some limestone or shale with natural, small holes in it. Some people have found success using a crack in the sidewalk; be careful, though, since you could damage the sidewalk with this method.

, Carefully place it so that the seam is facing up and you'll have a clear shot when you pound the shell open.

, Any heavy, flat, hard rock should work. Grasp the rock tightly, lift it over your head, then smash it down on the seam of the macadamia nutshell. The shell should pop right open.


Let the rock bounce back toward you slightly after you pound it down. If you continue driving it into the shell you'll smash the nut inside.
If you have trouble breaking open the shell, experiment with different angles and rocks of different shapes and sizes.

, Take a look at the nut to make sure it doesn't have gravel or other rock particles attached to it. You may want to rinse it off before consuming.

Examine the characteristics of the source for the oil.,
Target a particular set of end products:


Common edible oil
Senior edible oil
Special grease products
Industrial oils
Other classes analogous to petrochemicals

,
Realize that the process design is highly dependent on the targeted output oil grade.,
Specify the pre-treatment process.,
Consider carefully the process elements for your targeted input and output.,
Consider the entire oil processing stream - procurement to packaging and distribution as well as each of the side streams:


The by-products
The waste created (disposal/re-use)

,
Provision for unique characteristics of the seed variety and the oil extract.,
Choose special oil making processes in order to keep original oil flavor and preferred characteristics of the oil.,
Eliminate waste.,
Build into the design the appropriate temperature monitoring and control.

,
Perform an initial ""economy of scale"" analysis.

,
Provision for quality analysis.,
Perform selection review.,
Realize that the process of selecting and configuring equipment is iterative.,
Test a prototypical process implementation.,
Analyze scalability and flexibility.",How to Choose the Best Process for Oil Extraction (Plant Sources)," Proper choice of the oil pressing, extraction and refining process can greatly improve the quality and yield as well as the unit production cost.


The vast majority of oil seeds simply utilize oil-pressing method.
High oil content seeds adopt pre-pressing and extraction.
Low oil content seeds adopt direct oil extraction.
High acid content oil seeds use physical refining.
Some oil seeds (olive, palm fruit and rice bran) contain high level of lipase which can easily result in lipid rancidity.;
,,


Common edible oil uses a simple oil pressing and oil refining process and the equipment is fairly easy to design, maintain and clean.
High-grade edible oil requires complicated oil processing and requires a high quality standard.
Government and local oversight must be considered in the design and also properly accounted for as a production cost.

,


Cleaning
Peeling
Expansion or heat treatment technology (for high-grade cooking oils)

,


Oil refining processes utilize many sub-processes and technologies:

De-gumming
De-colorization (clarification)
De-odorizing
De-acidification
Steam distillation


Special oil processing equipment may be needed to meet specific application requirements:

Hydrogenation (E.G. to prevent rancidity)
Fractionation (dividing the process stream into components)
Trans-esterification (catalyzed by an acid, base, or enzyme)



,,


Often, the goal is to preserve the special flavor of the oil and the to retain the chemicals in a minimally altered form. This allows retention of the oil protein which imbues the final product with the unique flavor loved by customers.

,


Sesame oil, fragrant peanut oil and cocoa oil cannot use solvent extraction. This process will alter the chemicals which impart the flavors and physical properties.
The best approach to get olive oil is cold oil press method.
Most special oil seed processing lines should control temperature by providing cooling. Low temperature pressing and oil refining is preferred. Avoid consideration of high temperature steam distillation methods as experience has shown that these methods create an inferior end product which is only marginally saleable.

, It is best to design a configurable line so that inefficient and uneconomical methods can be scrapped and alternatives put in place. Also, keep an eye out for the scrap created during the process and provision for separately processing that part of the production stream or selling it to other processors.

,,,


Feedback to the production system must be integrated. Here, the more immediate the feedback, the better the process control and resulting finished goods quality.
Sensors and control logic units should be strategically located.
A modular design is preferred so that the line is easily configured.
Set up a calibration and oversight schedule as a part of the quality assurance program, making sure to specify a quick, reliable SOP (standard operating procedure) for this oversight.
Quality data must of a form that allows appropriate adjustment of machine parameters (process parameters) to achieve the desired quality.

, Look at the proposed design and ask:


Is the processing flow reasonable?
Have oil quality as well as oil yield optimized with respect to cost?
Have the preliminary targets been met for both quality and yield?
Are the chosen process elements optimal for the raw material?
Have provisions been made for processing waste and all sidestreams?
Are cost estimates exhaustive and accurate?

, It may take several passes to finalize the design elements.

, Analyze existing operations and identify weaknesses and strengths of the process components, product flow and information flow.

, Provide plans for alternative uses of the proposed equipment.

Make a good choice to eat nuts everyday, no matter what nut you choose to eat.,
Know what the best serving size is.,
Check the sodium content on pre-packaged nuts.,
Eat a few as snacks.,
Add them to meals when cooking.",How to Choose Healthy Nuts (for Women)1," Nuts are full of mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (the good fat), protein and fiber. Replacing another protein with nuts helps balance the diet and increase micronutrient intake, such as B vitamins. Vitamin pills do not contain enough of the many micronutrients called phytonutrients; you get them from unrefined/whole foods. However, since nuts are high in calories and often come salted, it is important to understand serving size and nutritional information.;
, Nuts can contain 150 to 180 calories per 1 oz. and 10 to 22 g of fat per 1 oz. They also contain approximately 4 to 7 g of protein in 1 oz.


Subtract the amount of protein consumed in the nuts from daily protein needed. The average adult female needs approximately 46 g of protein per day.
Subtract the amount of calories and fat from total consumption for the day. The average adult female needs approximately 2,000 calories a day and 20% to 35% should come from fat calories, limiting saturated to less than 10% of total calories.
Try to consume 1.5 oz. of nuts daily. According to scientific evidence, 1.5 oz. is the optimal amount of nuts for heart health, especially in women with Type II Diabetes.

, Many pre-packaged nuts are roasted and salted or seasoned. These seasonings often contain msg or salt and can add a considerable amount of sodium to your diet. To avoid excess sodium, go for nuts without salt or seasoning. If you need the salt or seasoning for flavor, try to buy the nuts lowest in sodium. Excess sodium can lead to water retention and may increase the risk for hypertension.

, Nuts make great snacks because they do not need refrigeration and can be eaten quickly. Also, they are filling and help keep unhealthy snacking between meals to a minimum. The extra protein provides a longer lasting source of energy than a simple carbohydrate would.

, If you are having trouble getting enough nuts into your diet or don’t like the flavor of them plain, try adding them to meals. Cashews and peanuts go well in a stir fry or chili. They cook like a raw whole bean, so the longer they are cooked the softer their texture becomes.

"
"
Buy shelled nuts.,
Toast your nuts gently.,
Crust fish or meat with nuts.,
Use nuts on salads or as garnish.,
Customize your recipes with nuts.",How to Cook with Nuts1," Nut shells have no nutritional value and cannot be consumed. Doing so could cause them to lodge in your throat, and you could choke. Therefore, always buy shelled nuts, or shell them yourself. In either case watch out for the occasional shell piece that might be left behind.If you shell nuts yourself, crack the nuts over a clean bowl or container to contain the mess of flaky shell bits. Discard of any shell bits after you’re done.;
, Toasting nuts in a dry skillet or in the oven can enhance the flavor. You could even toast nuts in the microwave. The length of time you spend toasting your nuts depends on how flavorful you want them.To toast nuts in the oven, lay them in a flat, even layer on a baking sheet. Set the oven to 325° F (162° C). Place the tray in the center rack for as long as wish your nuts to toast.
To toast nuts in the microwave, place them in an even layer on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave them in one-minute intervals. Taste-test them after each minute-long round to see if they have attained the desired crunchiness and flavor.
To toast nuts on the range, place them in a large frying pan over medium heat. Don’t add any grease or oil. Stir the nuts frequently until fragrant and golden-brown in appearance.
Different nuts require different toasting times to bring out their most delicious flavor. Almonds, for instance, require about 10 minutes in the oven. Peanuts, on the other hand, require closer to 20 minutes in the oven. Experiment with different toasting methods and times to identify how long you want your nuts toasted.

, Crusting fish or meat with nuts basically means coating the fish or meat with a layer of crushed or sliced nuts mixed with other ingredients. The oil in the nuts adds to the flavor of the meat and gives the final dish a pleasing crunch.For instance, to make a simple spicy cashew crust, blend 100 grams of crushed cashews, four mild red chilies, 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon of cumin powder, six large, peeled garlic cloves, and a thumb-sized piece of finely-chopped ginger.
Pat a 140-gram fish fillet with paper towel until relatively dry. Take a handful of the cashew crust and press it into fish. Place the fish on an oiled baking tray, then bake in the oven at 375° F (190° C) for about 13 minutes.

, Nuts are a delicious way to give your salad a healthy dose of lean protein. You can add nuts to many kinds of salad, including Caesar salad, blueberry chicken salad, apple cranberry salad, and house salads. Just choose your favorite type of nuts and toss a handful over your salad of choice.You could also sprinkle a handful of crushed nuts over a savory butter squash or pumpkin soup to give it texture and flavor.

, Some recipes might call for nuts you don't like or can't have. For instance, if you dislike peanuts but love cashews, you can substitute cashews in most – if not all – cases with little difference. You can use chopped cashews or even almonds in pad Thai if you have a peanut allergy. You can also customize your recipes by adding nuts to recipes you already love. For instance, you could toss a few handfuls of walnuts into a muffin or brownie recipe you already like."

There were very impressive results of a review of the evidence linking nuts and lower risk of coronary heart disease, published in the ""British Journal of Nutrition"", by Kelly JH, and Sabate J. In this study, researchers looked at four large studies—the Adventist Health Study, Iowa Women's Study, Nurses' Health Study and the Physician's Health Study. When evidence from all four studies was combined, subjects consuming nuts at least 4 times a week showed a 37% reduced risk of coronary heart disease compared to those who never or seldom ate nuts. Plus an additional serving of nuts per week was associated with an average of another 8.3% reduced risk of coronary heart disease, for your health!, Walnuts are extremely healthy nuts having multiple benefits for consumption. They have almost as much omega 3 fatty acids as salmon and more than is recommended for a daily serving of linoleic acid and alpha linoleic acid (omega 3 fatty acids). These fatty acids have been shown to increase brain function, protect against Type II Diabetes and decrease risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition to omega 3 fatty acids, walnuts contain high amounts ellagic acid, which promotes immune health, and vitamin B6. In clinical research, walnuts slowed the development of breast cancer in mice.

, Peanuts, although technically not a nut, but a legume, have the highest amount of protein at 7 g per oz. They have also been shown to keep cholesterol levels low and protect against cardiovascular disease. A unique nutrient in peanuts is resveratrol, the antioxidant found in red wine with anti-aging properties.


Roast peanuts to increase their health benefits! Research conducted by a team of University of Florida scientists, published in the journal Food Chemistry, shows that peanuts contain high concentrations of antioxidant called polyphenols, and that roasting can increase peanuts' p-coumaric acid levels, boosting their overall antioxidant content by as much as 22%:, Pistachios are high in protein at 6 g per oz and the highest fiber-containing nut. The amount of fiber in pistachios is equivalent to the fiber found in oatmeal. These have also been shown to protect against cardiovascular disease. They contain high amounts of plant sterols that lower LDL cholesterol levels.

, Almonds are the most nutrient dense nuts and contain very high levels of vitamin E and vitamin E boosting compounds. Vitamin E has been shown to protect against stroke and cancer, including breast and colon cancer.

, Brazil nuts are high in selenium. Selenium has been shown to lower the risk of breast cancer.

, All are high in monounsaturated fatty acids. Pecans have the highest amount of unsaturated fatty acids and the lowest amount of saturated fatty acids compared to other nuts. Cashews also offer high iron.

, Hazelnuts are high in folate, which protects against birth defects. They also are high in vitamin E and B vitamins and evidence suggests they may help delay dementia. They also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by lowering blood pressure.

, In the supermarket you will be able to find nut mixes made for heart health, energy or just flavor.

Understand the different forms nuts come in.,
Know the types of packaging and what will work best for you.",How to Choose Healthy Nuts (for Women)3," Nuts can come whole, with or without shell or in pieces. They can also come roasted, with or without flavors and/or with salt added. By knowing the forms and checking the nutrition labels, you should be able to choose the best for you.


Whole nuts are good for snacking on plain. They tend to stay fresh longer as well. Nuts without the shell are more convenient for eating on the go.
Pieces are usually better for cooking. The smaller pieces help reduce cooking time and save you the trouble of having to remove the shell.
Roasted nuts are roasted to bring out natural flavors and come without the shell. Roasted nuts generally contain salt and seasoning, so check the label for sodium content.

,


Purchase nuts in bulk if you plan on eating them everyday, plan on sharing them or cooking with them. This is the most cost effective option. They should be stored in a sealed container and in a cool dark place for the longest shelf life. Usually, nuts only last about three weeks when stored properly.
Purchase nuts packaged, such as in a canister if you plan on consuming them within three weeks and are not sharing. These are packed for freshness and in a small enough amount that you will be able to consume them all before they go rancid.
Purchase portion controlled packs if you are worried about over eating. Portion controlled packs are good for ensuring you only eat what you need. They also stay fresh for longer amounts of time because each pack is opened and consumed in entirety.

Make cashew tofu.,
Make a cauliflower soup.,
Make a coconut cashew crunch.",How to Cook with Nuts3," Cashew tofu is a great source of protein, which is abundant in both the cashews and the tofu. To get started, heat 1 teaspoon of oil over medium heat. Add 1/3 cup of cashews and – if you enjoy a little spice – 4 or 5 red dried chilies, broken up into small bits. Stir almost constantly until the cashews are golden brown.Toss 4 or 5 cloves of finely chopped garlic into the pan, along with ½ an inch (or about 1 teaspoon) of finely chopped ginger. Mix the garlic and ginger into the nuts and chilies for about two minutes.
Next, add ½ of a chopped green bell pepper, ¾ of a cup of chopped broccoli (or carrots, or some other vegetable you enjoy). Increase the heat to medium-high and stir frequently.
Add about 8 ounces of very firm cubed tofu. Cut the tofu into cubes with edges of 1 centimeter (1/2 an inch). Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon of black pepper onto the whole mixture and let it cook for about three more minutes.
Finally, in a separate bowl, mix ¼ teaspoon of toasted sesame oil, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, ¼ cup of vegetable broth, 3 tablespoons of hoisin sauce, ¼ teaspoon of sugar, and 2.5 teaspoons of rice wine vinegar. Add the mix to the skillet and cook everything for about one minute.

, Cauliflower-cashew soup is the perfect thing to warm you up on a cold winter’s day. You could also serve this creamy soup cold if you want something cool.In a large, deep pot, heat ¼ a cup of olive oil. Slice 4 large shallots and toss them in. Next, thinly slice 2 garlic cloves and add them, too, along with 2 bay leaves and 2 teaspoons of thyme leaves. Sprinkle a few pinches of salt. Add as much as you like, but remember, the more salt you add, the saltier the soup will be.
Pour ½ a cup of dry white wine to the mix and bring the pot to a boil for about four minutes.
Chop a head of cauliflower into medium-sized chunks and add all but ¾ of a cup of it to the pot. Additionally, add ¾ of a cup of cashews and ¼ teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Cover the pot and reduce heat to low for 20-25 minutes.
Stir contents occasionally. If you see anything browning, reduce heat further.
Add 6 cups of vegetable stock and bring the soup to a boil. Then, reduce heat and simmer for another 20 minutes or so. Remove the bay leaves and discard.
Spoon the mixture into your blender and puree until very smooth. You’ll probably have to work in batches by blending two or three cups, then pouring them into another pot, then adding more of the soup mixture to the blender, until the entire mixture has been blended.
In a separate, smaller skillet, add 2 tablespoons of chopped cashews, 2 tablespoons of buckwheat groats, and the rest of the chopped cauliflower to ¼ cup of olive oil. Heat the mixture over medium heat until cauliflower and nuts are golden brown.
Let your soup cool, then spoon some into a bowl for yourself. Drizzle the olive oil cashew mixture you made in the second, smaller skillet over the soup. One or two tablespoons is probably enough.
This recipe should produce eight servings of soup.

, Mix 9 cups of a puffed rice cereal (such as Rice Krispies, for instance), 2 cups of dried coconut flakes, and 8 ounces of salted cashew pieces in a large baking bowl. Then, in a large sauce pan or skillet, mix ½ a cup of light corn syrup, 1 cup of brown sugar, and ½ a cup of butter. Bring the mix to a boil over medium heat while stirring it.You’ll probably need to stir for at least five minute for everything to be blended properly.
Once the butter mixture is blended, stir in ½ a teaspoon of baking soda and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
Pour the mixture into the larger mixing bowl containing the cereal and coconut mix. Stir everything together with a spatula. Once the dry ingredients are completely coated with the hot, bubbly mixture, scoop everything out and into two foil-lined baking pans measuring 15 inches by 10 inches (38.1 centimeters by 25.4 centimeters).
Set your oven to 250° F (121° C). Place the pans in the oven for about 55 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes to mix the contents of each pan.
Remove each pan when 55 minutes has elapsed and let each pan cool on top of the stove. Use your coconut cashew crunch as a topper for ice cream, fruit, or yogurt.

Decide what you will be predominantly using flax seed for in your daily diet.,
Determine how much flax seed you will need.,
Research reputable brands and flax seed producers to determine which brands provide the best quality of flax seed.,
Research local grocery stores and health supplement stores.,
Take notice of the way the flax seed is packaged.,
Invest in opaque, sealable bags if you plan on purchasing whole flax seed and milling it yourself using a blender or coffee grinder.,
Locate a cool, dark and dry place where you can store your flax seed or flax seed meal.",How to Buy Flax Seed,"


Flaxseed comes in a variety of forms including whole flax seed, crushed flax seed and milled flaxseed. It also comes in the form of linseed oil, which is the extracted oil from the seeds themselves.
Whole flax seed can be used as a healthy, crunchy breading or as a textured topping for frozen yogurt.
Milled flaxseed is more commonly used as a flour substitute or a thickening agent. It can also be added to bread dough, pancake batter, and waffle batter.
Linseed oil is typically consumed as a daily health supplement.;
,


Purchase only what you need, as purchasing too much flax seed at once will increase the likelihood that it will spoil or rot before you can use it all; purchasing too little is an inconvenience. Avoid making either mistake, as both may waste time and money.
Calculate the amount of flax that you and your family expect to consume on a daily basis. Because flax seed should not be kept longer than two weeks in the refrigerator or freezer, you can multiply this amount by fourteen to determine how much flax seed you should purchase when you stock up at your local store.

, Discover which brand produces flax seed with the highest nutritional concentrations.


There are two types of flax seed, yellow and brown, and both types have different nutritional contents. You can choose a brand that grows and packages only one type, or vary between two different types.
While brown flax seed is edible for humans, it is more typically used in animal feeds because of its tougher texture. Golden flax seed is widely considered to be the best variety for human consumption.
Research brand history to determine how long a specific manufacturer has been producing flax seed. This type of research will also help you find information about how the flax is grown. Organic flax that is grown without the use of growth hormones or pesticides is always preferable.

, Determine whether or not they carry flax seed, and if they do carry it, which brands they carry and in what quantities.


You may choose to evaluate prices if that is a consideration for you. Calculate the price per weight by dividing the weight of the flax seed by the total cost. This will help you compare different brands by price.

,


Purchase flax seed meal in opaque, vacuum-packed bags. Avoid flax seed that has been exposed to too much air or light, as it may spoil more quickly.
Purchase whole flax seeds in light colored or clear bags.
Milled flax seed must be preserved in a dark container and kept in a cool temperature. Be wary of purchasing milled flax seed that has not been refrigerated at your local store.

,


Decide if you prefer coarse or finely milled flax seeds. Depending on your preferences, you can adjust the grinding process accordingly.
The finer the flax seed grind, the more easily it can be used as a flour substitute. However, many consumers prefer the raw texture of some whole flax seeds in their milled flax seed mixture.

,


You may opt to store flax seed in the freezer or refrigerator, though the seed should be consumed in no more than two weeks from the purchase date regardless of whether it has been frozen. Flax seed that is stored for longer than this may become rancid resulting in a very bad flavor and potentially causing illness.

Make a beef and almond zucchini boat.,
Use almond flour.,
Create a nut butter.,
Brew some almond milk.",How to Cook with Nuts4," A beef and almond zucchini boat is basically a zucchini sliced lengthwise with its innards scooped out and filled with beef, almonds, and a spicy seasoning. Kids and adults will love your almond zucchini boat.To begin, preheat your oven to 375° F (190° C). Toast 1/3 of a cup of slivered almonds for about three minutes, stirring occasionally.
Cook one small onion in 1 tablespoon of olive oil for about three minutes. Then add two large, minced garlic cloves and stir for another minute.

Place the zucchini boats on an oven tray and cover with foil. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake for 10 more minutes. Remove and allow to cool. Consume the tasty zucchini boats with your friends.

, Almond flour is perfect for deserts and baked goods. You could also incorporate it into pancakes or any other dish you want to lend a mild, nutty flavor.For instance, you could try an almond flour blueberry muffin. Pre-heat your oven to 350° F (176° C). Place 2 cups of almond flour, 1.5 teaspoons baking soda, ¼ cup applesauce, ¼ cup maple syrup, 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, a dash of salt, 2 tablespoons of coconut oil, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract into your food processor and blend until smooth.Pour the mixture out into a large mixing bowl and mix in the blueberries.
Spray a muffin tin with a non-stick cooking spray. Scoop the batter into the recesses of the tin to a level that does not exceed the edge of each recess.
Bake the muffins for 25 minutes. Remove and allow the muffins to cool before consuming.
To make two cups of almond flour, soak two cups of almonds briefly, then remove and let them dry. Once dry, place one cup of almonds in your food processor and blend on high using the pulse feature. Remove the first batch, then add the second cup of almonds. Store your almond flour in a resealable container if you don’t want to use it right away., Almond butter is great on toast, waffles, or pancakes. The best almond butter will have a hint of sweetness in addition to the savory nut flavor.To make 1.75 cups of almond butter, preheat your oven to 325° F (162° C), then toast 2.25 cups of almonds for 12 to 15 minutes in the oven. Let the almonds cool slightly, then dump them in your food processor and process them for about two minutes. The almonds should look dry, like almond flour.
Add ¾ teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of safflower oil. Turn the processor back on for another minute. If you want a sweeter almond butter, you could also add 2 tablespoons of honey or maple syrup at this point. If you like cinnamon, you could also add ½ a teaspoon of cinnamon.You can refrigerate your nut butter for up to four weeks in an airtight container.

, If you’re lactose-intolerant or trying to cut down on your cholesterol, drinking almond milk instead of cow milk is a great way to go. You can easily make almond milk at home.To make about 3.5 cups of almond milk, soak one cup of almonds in a large bowl and fill the bowl with water to a level that covers the nuts by two inches. Leave the nuts in the bowl overnight, or for at least 12 hours.
Drain the water from the bowl, then put your nuts, 1/8 teaspoon of salt, 4 teaspoons agave syrup, and 4 cups hot water (but not boiling water) into your blender. Blend on high for about two minutes.
Strain the nut pulp from the liquid using a fine-mesh strainer. Simply place the strainer over a large bowl, then pour the blended mixture slowly into the bowl. Discard the nut pulp that accumulates on the strainer surface.
If you don’t want to make your own, almond milk is available at most grocery stores.

Place the almonds in the boiled water for exactly one minute.,
Drain off the hot water and rinse the almonds.,
Dab the almonds dry.,
Carefully pinch off the skins.,
Leave to dry.,
Finished.

",How to Blanch Almonds," Make sure the almonds are completely plain - they shouldn't be roasted, oiled or salted.;
, Once boiled, take the saucepan off the heat and place on a hot pad.

, If you leave the almonds in the water any longer they will lose their crispness.

, Drain the almonds using a colander or strainer and rinse well under cold water until they are cool enough to handle.

, Use a little paper towel to dab off any excess moisture. The skin of the almonds should look slightly wrinkled.

, Grip each almond between your thumb and index finger and pinch. The almond should slide right out of its skin.


You can prevent the almond from flying across the room by using your opposite hand to form a shield and catch the slippery little almond!






Sometimes the skin won't come off so easily and you'll have to you your thumbnail to scrape off any remaining skin.







, Depending on the recipe you're using, you may need to leave the blanched almonds to dry. If this is the case, simply lay them on a baking sheet for a few days, shaking the pan to turn them occasionally.


Avoid drying the almonds in the oven, as this will end up roasting the nuts, which is not what you want.

Sprinkle the seeds with salt and bake for 20-30 minutes, or until golden brown.",How to Cook Pumpkin Seeds1,";
, Remove any strings or pulp that are still attached to them. It's easiest to clean the pumpkin seeds immediately after they have been removed from the pumpkin.

, You can either use olive oil, vegetable oil, or cooking spray to coat the baking sheet.

, Stir the seeds after about 10 minutes so that they cook evenly.

Remove the seeds from the pumpkin.,
Clean off the removed seeds.,
Roll a rolling pin over the seeds.,
Boil the seeds in water for about 5 minutes.,
Remove the seeds and let them cool.",How to Shell Pumpkin Seeds1," If you want fresh pumpkin seeds, you may take the seeds straight from a pumpkin you purchase at a grocery store. To start, carefully use a knife to cut a circle around the top of the pumpkin near the stem. Then, remove the section you cut out.


Use your hands, or a spoon if you'd prefer, to scoop out the insides of the pumpkin.
In addition to scooping out seeds, you'll find some orange pulp. You will have to wash this off the seeds later. Collect the seeds and pulp in a bowl.;
, When you've fully cleaned out the inside of the pumpkin, you should clean the seeds until they're free of any pulp and juice. You can clean them by placing the seeds and pulp in a strainer. Then, run the strainer under cool water in your kitchen sink until most of the pulp is removed.


It's okay to leave some pulp on the seeds, as some of it can be stubborn to get off. However, you should make sure to get most of the pulp off of the seeds, especially if you plan to roast the pumpkins later. Excess pulp could burn in the oven., Now, you can begin the process of removing the hard exterior shells from the pumpkin. These shells are non-toxic, so it's safe to leave them on, but many people prefer the softer seeds within. To start, spread the seeds out on a hard surface, like a counter top or cutting board.Try to spread the seeds out evenly, so there's little overlap between seeds.
Take a rolling pin. Gently roll the pin over the seeds, using enough force to produce light cracks in the shell.
Do not use too much force here. You do not want to damage the soft seeds within. Just roll hard enough to lightly fracture the surface of the shells.

, Boil a pot of water big enough to hold all your pumpkin seeds. Take your seeds and pour them into the water. The boiling process should cause the shells to gradually fall off.Keep an eye on the seeds as they boil and remove the seeds from the heat once most of the shells have shed. You'll notice the shells have slipped off of the seeds and are floating in the water or congregated at the bottom of the pan.
This process generally takes around 5 minutes, but it may take slightly more or less depending on how many seeds you're boiling. Less seeds may be ready in a couple of minutes, while more seeds may take closer to 10 minutes for the shells to shed.

, Once the shells are gone, remove the seeds from the heat. Strain them over the sink, using a sifter or strainer, and then set them out to dry.


You can set the seeds over tray or countertop covered in paper towel to absorb the water.
If there are any small bits of shell left on the seeds, you can pick these bits off using your fingers once the seeds are dry to the touch. Make sure to wash your hands first.

Harvest or buy some in-shell pecans.,
Sort the pecans.,
Consider boiling the pecans.,

Clean off any shell material.,
Leave the pecans in a perforated container or a colander for 24 hours.,
Store the pecans in a sealed container.",How to Shell Pecans," Choose a variety that is uniform in size and shape, and feels heavy in your hands. Stuart or Moneymaker pecans are two common and popular varieties.;
, Sort through the pecans and dispose of any that have cracks or holes, that feel considerably lighter than the others, or that rattle when you shake them. These nuts have likely gone bad.

, Some pecan-lovers claim that boiling the pecans before cracking helps to loosen the shells.


Bring a large pot of water to the boil on the stove top. Gently add the pecans to the water and leave to boil for 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the pecans and leave to cool before cracking.
Alternatively, you can place one cup of water and two cups of pecans in a microwaveable bowl and heat on high for 5 to 6 minutes.

, Shelling pecans can be a messy job, as bits of shell are likely to fly everywhere during cracking. As a result, it may be best to set up your work station outside, to minimize clean-up.

, A general purpose, squeeze-style nutcracker can be used to crack the pecan shells.


Place the nut between the arms of the nutcracker and squeeze gently until you hear a crack. Don't squeeze too hard, or you will break the nut meat inside.
Rotate the nut between the arms of the nutcracker and squeeze again. Continue rotating and squeezing along the length of the nut until the shell becomes loose enough to remove.

, This is another quick and easy method for shelling pecans, which uses a side cutters and pliers.


Take your side cutters and use them to snip off the two pointed ends of the pecan shell, into a bowl beneath.
Then take your pliers (any type will do), place the nut between the jaws, and gently crack around the middle of the shell, rotating the nut until the shell comes loose.

, If you need to crack a large quantity of pecans, it may be worth your while to invest in a specialized pecan cracker, which looks kind of like a tabletop vice.


These devices allow you to crack pecans quickly and efficiently, without cracking or breaking the nut meat.
While most household pecan crackers are operated by hand, you can also purchase motorized pecan crackers (from brands like Kinetic Kracker) for even faster shelling.

, If you do not have any tools, you can use the squeezing method to crack the pecan shells.


To do this, take two nuts and place them in one hand. Close your fist around the nuts, squeezing them together until one shell cracks enough to peel off.

, One of the simplest methods of cracking pecan shells is just to use a hammer and a hard surface.


Place the nut on a hard, solid surface and hit it with the hammer. You may need to rotate the nut to hit it in a second spot. Mind your fingers!
Although this method is quick, it tends to break the nut meat, leaving you with fragmented pieces of pecan. If you're looking for whole pecan halves, you'd be better off using another method.

, Once you have cracked the shell using your chosen method, you will need to carefully remove the nut meat from the broken shell, keeping the pecan halves as intact as possible.


Use your fingers or a small pair of pliers to peel the shell away from one half of the nut. Then use a nut pick to pry the two pecan halves out of the remaining shell.
Pecans are ideally removed from their shells in halves, but it's not a big deal if they break -- any nut meat you can salvage from the broken shell is usable.

, Use a pick, a toothpick, or even a narrow piece of pecan shell to scrape the woody shell material and lining from the fissures in the nut meat. Even a small amount of this material left in the nut can leave a bitter taste in the mouth of the person who consumes it.

, This will allow the nuts to dry out and season, giving them a better flavor when eaten.

, Place the seasoned pecans in a sealed container and store them in a cool, dry place. They will keep for up to a week on the kitchen counter, for several weeks in the refrigerator, and for up to a year in the freezer.

Remove the section you cut by lifting the stem and then scoop out the pulp and seeds using your hands. To clean, you can place the seeds in a strainer and run them under cool water in your sink.


Be sure to get most of the pulp off, especially if you're cooking the seeds in the oven. You do not want them to burn.
Set the seeds out on an open surface and pat them dry with a paper towel. If they're still slightly wet, you may have to wait a bit before you begin shelling them.
You can roast the seeds before shelling them if you prefer them cooked.

, You may not want to shell a large amount of pumpkin seeds for a big recipe. If you just want to eat the pumpkin seeds, you can shell them as you go. To start, pick up a single pumpkin seed. Fold the seed slightly.To fold, hold one half of the seed between your thumb and index finger. Grasp the other end of the seed using your thumb and index finger with your other hand.
Fold the seed in half. Keep folding until the shell cracks slightly. This should not take too much effort, and pumpkin shells are not particularly rough.

, Once the shell has cracked, you can simply pluck the shell off using your fingers. Dig your thumb into the crack you made and pull upward until the shell cracks in half completely. Pull one half of the shell off, and then the other.If there are any small bits of shell remaining, consider running the seed under water to remove.

",How to Shell Pumpkin Seeds3," Many people enjoy eating pumpkin seeds raw. They're a fairly nutritious food as they are rich in fiber and a good source of magnesium, copper, selenium, and zinc. If you're vegetarian or vegan, pumpkin seeds can be a healthy snack as they're rich in protein.Most people can eat pumpkin seeds without a problem, especially if the shells are fully removed. However, if there are small traces of shells remaining on the seeds, you may get a slight stomach ache.
If you're serving pumpkin seeds to kids, it's a good idea to be extra cautious about removing the shell to prevent choking.

, There are many different ways you can prepare pumpkin seeds. One way is to fry them in olive oil. Spread out some olive oil over a frying pan. How much you will need depends on how many seeds you are frying, but it should be enough to coat the pan.Allow the oil to heat for a few minutes and then throw in your seeds. Cook the seeds over the oil until they begin to make a popping noise.
From here, add about a tablespoon of table sugar. Continue frying until the seeds pop again. Remove the seeds from the heat, let them cool, and enjoy.

, You can also roast the pumpkin seeds in an oven heated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Then lay the seeds out on a baking pan.If you like your seeds plain, you can put them in the oven as is. Some people prefer to sprinkle them with curry powder, chipotle flakes, or cayenne pepper. Clove, cinnamon, or nutmeg can be used for sweet pumpkin seeds.
Bake the seeds for about 20 minutes, or until they're golden brown.

Preheat an oven to 350ºF (177ºC).,
Decide whether you want shelled or in-shell peanuts.,
Spread the peanuts on a baking tray or cookie sheet.,
Bake the peanuts.,
Remove the nuts from the oven.,
Cool and season before eating.",How to Roast Peanuts1," While you wait for your oven to warm up, you can proceed to the next few steps.;
, The procedures for roasting both types of peanuts are very similar. However, there are just a few things to consider before beginning:


Shelled peanuts are much easier to use for peanut butter and baking recipes because you don't need to remove their shells later. If making peanut butter, use Spanish peanuts, which have higher oil content.If you wish, you can peel shelled peanuts' skins off with your fingers before beginning, though it's also easy to do this after roasting (see below).
In-shell peanuts should be rinsed in cold water briefly to remove excess dirt.Pat dry with a paper towel and allow to dry for about five extra minutes on a wire rack.

, The peanuts must all be sitting flat in one layer to ensure even roasting. If you have too many peanuts to make just one layer, cook them in batches.


For easier clean-up, line the sheet with baking paper or foil. This isn't required like it is with other recipes, however — the peanuts won't stick to the tray.

, Place the baking tray or sheet on the middle shelf of the oven. This will help ensure they are cooked evenly throughout. Set a timer and relax — there's no need to turn peanuts while they cook. Depending on which type of peanut you're roasting, cooking times will vary:For shelled peanuts, cook 15-20 minutes.
For in-shell peanuts, cook 20-25 minutes.

, The peanuts will cook a little bit more after you take them out of the oven. Be careful here — both the tray and the peanuts themselves will be extremely hot (especially shelled peanuts). Set the tray somewhere safe where it can cool, like on top of the stove.

, When the peanuts are cool enough to hold in your hands, they're ready to eat. Roasted peanuts taste great plain, but you can also toss them with a light sprinkling of salt at this point (you shouldn't need more than a teaspoon or two). Enjoy!

Decide on the formality of your occasion.,
Seat people who have common interests together.,
Pair people together.,
Seat guests of honour in order.,
Put out place cards.,
Have a seating list for large dinner parties.,
Be a good host.",How to Seat Dinner Guests," Are you having business associates over or friends? Relatives from out of state or your immediate family? The relationship that you have with the people attending your event will determine the formality. As a general guide, a silver service sit-down event should be reserved for professional or very special occasions; a buffet is far more informal and you are less able to control the seating arrangements.;
, This is the most helpful starting point. Consider the following:


Do they have a need to discuss business together?
Do they have hobbies or interests in common?
Do they have professions in common?
Do they have marital/single status in common? (Perhaps you're into matchmaking, although some would be irritated by your attempt if they were to figure it out)
Do they like one another or not? Be careful of seating people you know have an animosity towards one another unless you want a dampener on the occasion.

, Be creative in your pairings. Sometimes it is customary to pair male/females but this can be stifling to the conversation or uncomfortable for some people. If you know someone to be shy, try to pair them with a caring extrovert. If you think two people who would normally not cross paths will end up having a good yarn, then try it. Being the host calls for exercising some people skills in your choices, as well as during the occasion.

, If you have a guest of honour, for example, a boss, an elderly relative, a visiting superstar, there are etiquette rules as to their seating. A female guest of honour usually sits to the right of the host, while a male guest of honour usually sits to the left of the hostess.

, Write the full name of each guest in fancy print on little cards (if you're creative, this is a fun part; if not, get someone else to do it). You really don't need place cards unless you have more than 6 guests. Below that amount is a little like telling your guests what to do. By tradition, there is no need to provide place cards for the hosts unless you think that omitting them will lead to confusion.

, If your dinner party is so large that it encompasses a group of tables, it is helpful to have a seating list at the entrance to the room. Or, personalise it and tell each guest where their table is. That is always much friendlier than making them line up like they're at a school cafeteria.

, Enjoy yourself but make sure the guests are having fun, too. Make sure that anyone with a disability is seated on a comfortable chair; offer to change it or add a cushion etc., if they appear uncomfortable. Let people know quietly where the bathrooms are located, or assist by making it clear with a discreet sign. If a guest looks put out at where you've seated them, do some discreet legwork and re-seat them as quickly as possible; make an excuse like, ""Oops, I meant to put you over there."" Don't do this if it makes the situation too obvious or you really can't work out a better place for them to sit.

Gather the tools listed below.,
Create a water balloon.,
Take the semi-frozen balloon out of the freezer.,
Slit the balloon to get the rubber off.,
Find a place in the ice that looks good for creating an opening.,
Drain all the water out of the center of the balloon.

,
Make the opening bigger by carving it carefully with the knife.,
Now it's complete.",How to Create an Ice Bowl1," You can also substitute the knife with a blow torch or a lighter.;
, This should be medium size. Put the water balloon in the freezer for about 2-3 hours. You may need to experiment with the timing––the balloon should be frozen only until an outer layer of ice forms. It is very important to still have water in the middle of the balloon.

, Shake it, and if you see bubbles, or hear ""jiggling"" then you did it correctly.

, Run the knife on the edge, and peel off the balloon.

, Poke the knife through the ice and gently create a hole.

,, This can be hard, so either ""shave"" the ice, or use the blow torch or lighter. The fire is easier, but may take more time. You can make the opening big, or small.

, This ice bowl is good for adding food such as fruit salad or melon balls. See the suggestions in the next method for more ideas.

Try skinning shelled peanuts.,
Use creative seasonings.,
Make glazed peanuts.,
Grind your roasted peanuts to make peanut butter.",How to Roast Peanuts2," The thin skin around each peanut isn't harmful — in fact, some people prefer leaving it on to eating ""naked"" nuts. However, if you wish, you can remove the skins easily with a salad spinner. Roll the roasted peanuts in your hands over an open salad spinner, letting them gradually fall out and into the device. Once you've rolled all of the peanuts, close the spinner and run it until most (if not all) of the skins have been separated. You may need to peel a few skins off by hand.Here's another method for skinning peanuts: first, place the roasted peanuts in a jar or container and shake them or wrap them in a clean dish towel and rub them. Pour the peanuts out, then take the jar, container, or towel outside and let the wind blow away the loose skins.

, You only need a little seasoning to make natural, roasted peanuts even more delicious. There's no ""right answer"" here, but just a few seasoning suggestions are included below:


A light dusting of brown sugar and cinnamon makes a delicious sweet treat.
Combining Cajun seasoning mix with a little salt makes for intensely flavorful peanuts.
Cayenne powder, garlic powder, and smoked paprika can give you red-hot Southwestern-style peanuts., Liquid flavorings can be used as glazes to give the peanuts intense, alluring flavors. However, for best results, these should be applied before the roasting process. Paint the prepared peanuts with a thin layer of your glaze and roast them as normal to give them the glaze's flavor. Since you're using liquid ingredients here, lining your pan with foil or baking paper is a wise idea.


Here, again, there are hundreds of possibilities. One easy classic example is honey-roasted peanuts. To make the glaze, just combine equal parts honey and melted butter and stir until uniform. About two tablespoons of each ingredient should be enough for a pound of peanuts. Paint the peanuts with the glaze and sprinkle with salt before they go into the oven. Roast as normal., Believe it or not, making all-natural peanut butter from (shelled) peanuts is as simple as crushing, chopping, or grinding them into a thick but smooth paste. See our peanut butter recipe for step-by-step directions. As noted above, Spanish peanuts are best for this as they contain the most oil. You can use a food processor, a blender, or a manual solution like a mortar and pestle to get the peanuts to a smooth, creamy consistency.


For chunky peanut butter, chop up a handful of peanuts and add them to the finished peanut butter.
Some chefs like to add a dash of honey, molasses, salt, or other seasonings to their peanut butter for flavor. However, it should be fine on its own.

Prepare the flowers or the citrus fruit rounds as follows:

For real flowers, choose edible ones.,
Fill the 2-1/2 quart (2.3 litre) bowl half full with water using a pitcher to pour.,
Place the 1 quart (950ml) bowl over the flowers in the bowl and gently let it drop to the base of the larger bowl.,
Fill the 1 quart (950ml) bowl with ice cubes.,
Put the bowl arrangement into the freezer for 30 minutes.

,
Remove from the freezer and add more flowers inside the gap, if needed.,
Place back in the freezer.,
Remove from the freezer the next day.,
Remove the outer bowl.,
Place the ice bowl onto its own platter or stand.,
Serve.",How to Create an Ice Bowl2," See How to choose edible flowers for ideas of what to choose; you could choose a mixture of flowers or just one type, such as rose petals. Wash the flowers and pat dry.






For silk flowers, choose ones that have non-toxic dyes. If you can't ascertain this, don't use them unless the bowl is going to be used for non-food purposes (such as for holding cans of drink).






For citrus rounds, choose suitably sized oranges, limes, lemons, etc. and cut into perfect round sections. Cut enough to go around the bowl.







, Place the flowers across the top of the water so that it's completely covered. If using citrus rounds, see next step.

, The water should shift up the side gap, which will be about 1 inch (2.5cm) in thickness. The flowers will be caught both underneath and along the sides of the bowl as well; add more flowers to the gap, pushing them in with the wooden skewer. It can be as packed with flowers as you like, or left more sparse.


If you're using citrus rounds, this is the time to slip them into the gap at equal intervals around the gap. Use the wooden skewer to align the citrus rounds.






Large globs of poster tack can be rolled up and stuck between each bowl edge to maintain an exact distance. You'll need to mold the tack over the rims to keep it in place.







, Put freezer tape across the bowls to hold them in place. Alternatively, use crepe bandage––tie two lengths of crepe bandage around the outside bowl and tie tightly at the top of the bowls. The second bandage should be placed at a right angle to the first bandage for best results.

,, Or, simply reposition the flowers or citrus rounds if they've slipped in directions that aren't so aesthetically pleasing.


If adding more flowers or rounds to already frozen edges, wet them a little for added stickiness.







, It's recommended that you check a few more times to reposition flowers or rounds as needed. Then, leave to freeze overnight.

, Take off the tape and scoop out the ice cubes. Leave on a towel for a few minutes. It might come loose on its own. If not, fill the smaller bowl with lukewarm water and gently ease it out.

, If it hasn't already loosened while sitting on the towels, dip it into a basin with a little lukewarm water. Twist the ice bowl to loosen it and gently pull it out.

, Return to the freezer until needed. If you're keeping it in the freezer, wrap it in kitchen foil first to prevent sticking to the freezer or other frozen items.

, There are several things you can do with the ice bowl, such as:


Arrange a fruit salad or single fruit such as hulled strawberries.
Fill with a garden salad full of edible flowers.
Add ice cubes and stick ice confectionery on sticks into the ice cubes.
Add ice cubes and a few small cans of drinks.
Use a container for dips.
Arrange cooked seafood, such as prawns, shrimps, etc. that need to be kept cool.
Use for a cold soup such as a gazpacho.
And saving the best till last–– fill with ice cream!

Select high-quality peanut butter.,
Start using almond butter.,
Try cashew butter.,
Pick up a soy nut butter.,
Consider using sunflower seed butter.,
Eat pumpkin seed butter in the fall.,
Try walnut butter.,
Start using tahini.",How to Add Nut and Seed Butters to Your Diet1," You may be overwhelmed when selecting a peanut butter, since there are so many options. Read the ingredient label and avoid peanut butters that have added oils (especially hydrogenated oils) and sugars. Try to buy a natural peanut butter that just contains peanuts (and possibly salt). Peanut butter is a great source of protein.Hydrogenated oils contain trans fats which can be harmful to your heart.;
, Even if your grocery store has a limited selection of nut and seed butters, you'll probably find almond butter. Almond butter has a mellow and slightly sweet flavor. It's easy to stir into dressings, sauces, and baked goods. Since some brands will add honey or other sweeteners, it's important to read the label.


Almond butter contains vitamin E, calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorous, and iron., If you want a rich tasting nut butter that's a little sweet and buttery, use cashew butter. The natural sweetness makes it a great addition to fruit smoothies. You can easily replace peanut butter or even heavy cream with cashew butter in baked good recipes. It's also great in curries or savory dishes.


Cashew butter is a good source of copper, manganese, and magnesium., Soy nut butter is often sold as a peanut butter substitute which is useful if you or someone in your home has a peanut allergy. It has the same texture as peanut butter and a similar flavor, but it has less fat than peanut butter. Since it has a mild flavor, you can easily add it to meals or baked goods.Soy nut butter is high in protein, omega-3s, protein, and amino acids., Sunflower seed butter is a little thinner than peanut butter and distinctly tastes like sunflower seeds, so you may need to plan on how you incorporate it in your food. For example, sunflower seed works well in savory recipes that call for tahini. You could also add it to vegetables or sauces.


Sunflower seed butter is a little higher in fat than peanut butter, but it contains more vitamin E, iron, magnesium, phosphorus and zinc., As the seasons change, many people enjoy adding seasonal dishes to their menu. Pumpkin seed butter is a great addition to your diet and helps you enjoy the tastes of the season. If you can't find it in the store, you can easily make it at home by mashing up some pumpkin seeds. They taste best mixed with almonds or walnuts.

Pumpkin seed butter is very high in zinc., Walnut butter can help you reach your Omega-3 goals through your diet. It's also packed with other nutrients. If you like dense, earthy flavors or are looking for something to balance a sweet bread, roll, or fruit, walnut butter can be a great option., Tahini is made by grinding toasted sesame seeds into a thin butter. This makes it a good choice for stirring into sauces, dressings, or glazes. Traditionally, tahini is an important ingredient in hummus, the Middle Eastern garbanzo bean spread.Tahini contains unsaturated fat and lignans that have been shown to lower cholesterol. It's also a good source of iron and magnesium.

Decide what courses you’re going to serve.,
Select your utensils and dishes.,
Set the dishes.,
Set your utensils.,
Set your glasses.,
Set the table for soup.,
Set the table for fish.,
Set the table for the main course.,
Set the table for the salad.,
Set the table for dessert.",How to Arrange a Place Setting for a Formal Dinner," The ultimate setting you provide your guests with will depend on which courses you decide to serve; a five or seven course meal is typical for a formal dinner. Decide on your menu, keeping in mind that the typical courses are served in the following order:First course: Appetizer/shellfish
Second course: Soup
Third course: Fish
Fourth course: Roast
Fifth course: Game (for a 5 course meal, the fourth/fifth courses are combined as the entrée of choice).
Sixth course: Salad (yes, salad really does come after the entrée)
Seventh course: Dessert
Eighth course: Fruit, cheese, and coffee (optional)
Ninth Course: Nuts and raisins (optional).

, Prior to setting your table, you’ll need to make sure you have the proper utensils and dishes prepared. You’ll need one fork for each of the meat dishes (a seafood fork should be used for a seafood appetizer), a spoon for the soup and dessert, knives for the entrée, butter, and fish (if served), a charger, a dish for the butter/bread, and a selection of glasses (a water goblet, glass for white wine, glass for red wine, and a champagne flute are all options).


Each course is brought out of the kitchen on its own dish, so don’t worry about providing the dishes in the setting.
Prepare cloth napkins with napkin rings as an additional decorative element on the table.

, The centerpiece of the place setting is the charger. This is a large dish that goes beneath each of the plates the courses are brought out on. The charger will remain on the table until after the entrée has been consumed, and then it should be removed along with the entrée plate. Place the charger in the center of each setting. The second dish that you should have is the butter/bread dish. This will be placed up and to the left of the charger.


When you remove plates before the entrée, leave the charger and take just the empty plates.
You should have an assortment of bread for your guests to eat, which is the purpose of the bread/butter dish.
Your cloth napkin should be placed on top of the charger.

, Although having three forks, two knives, and two spoons may seem like a frightening prospect, their placement is actually quite simple. With you utensils, you use them from the outside in. So, on the left side of the charger, you should have your fish fork > salad fork > entrée fork. On the right side of your charger, you will place your dinner knife > fish knife > soup spoon. Above your plate aligned horizontally, you should place your dessert spoon and optional dessert fork. The butter knife should be placed diagonally across the butter/bread dish.


Each utensil will be removed from the table once it has been used.
If you’re not serving fish, then there is no need to place a fish fork and fish knife on the table.
If you serve shellfish as an appetizer, a shellfish fork should be placed to the right side of the soup spoon. This is the only fork that may be placed on the right side of the table.
Each of the utensils should be evenly spaced from each other and the charger.

, The glasses you choose to use will vary on what you are serving with dinner. Traditionally, there is at least a water goblet and a glass for wine, but this may vary. Place the water goblet directly above the knife, level with the bread/butter dish. Add your wine glass to the right of that, typically above the soup spoon. If you add a third wine glass (for a different kind of wine), place it above and between the water glass and the first wine glass. An optional champagne flute can be included as well, and should be placed above and to the right of the first wine glass.


Similar to the utensils, your glasses should be placed in order of use.
Water is often served already in the glass, while wine and champagne are poured during the courses.
If you choose to serve coffee (as in a nine course meal), the coffee should be brought out in a demi-tasse (a type of espresso cup) at the end, and removed with the fruit/cheese plates., For the first course of soup, there are two options: bring bowls of the same soup from the kitchen, or offer water or cream based soups and serve them in fresh dishes at the table. The former is served already poured in bowls and brought out from the kitchen. The latter is served (carefully) at the table into clean bowls. The soup bowls should be brought in on serving dishes in case of a spill. When everyone has finished eating their soup, the soup spoons should be placed (bowl-side up) on the right side of their bowl, on the serving plate.


The plate, bowl, and spoon should be removed from the table after the first course.
The bread and butter dish should remain on the table, even if they were used with the soup.

, With the soup removed, the fish course should be brought in on its own dish. This should be placed on the charger, and eaten with the fish knife and fish fork (the utensils furthest from the charger on either side). When the fish has been consumed, the fish fork and fish knife should be placed diagonally across the dish, with the handles of each placed on the ‘4:00’ mark as if the plate were a clock.

, The main course should be brought out on a large plate that has been pre-warmed. This should go on the charger, and is eaten with the dinner fork and knife. When everyone is finished with the entrée, the plate can be removed along with the charger, the dinner fork, and the knife. The knife and fork are typically placed diagonally across the plate, in a similar fashion to the utensils used for the fish.

, The salad is typically eaten after the entrée in a formal dinner. With the charger removed, place the salad plate in the center of the setting. This should be eaten with the last remaining fork. When the salad course is finished, the salad plate, salad fork, and bread/butter dish with the butter knife, and the wine/champagne glasses should all be removed. All that should be left is the water goblet and the dessert spoon (and optional dessert fork).

, The final course of the evening is typically dessert and coffee, unless you’re serving a very formal nine course dinner. Regardless, the desert should be brought in on a plate and placed in the center of the setting, and a demi-tasse or teacup should be placed to the right of it below the water goblet with a teaspoon. Cream and sugar may be placed on the table for use in the coffee or tea, if desired. When dessert is completed, all the dishes should be removed, leaving a bare table."
"
Know that if the potluck supper is small (only a few individuals or families), ask ""What can I bring?"",
Find out if the event is a community-wide feast, ""bring a dish to share"" means enough for twelve servings.,
Bring an appropriate serving utensil: It is unpleasant to watch the town ladle travel from chili to the fruit salad.,
Bring whatever hot pads and trivets may be necessary.,
Put the food in a real serving dish; that is to say: pottery.,
Remember that presentation is important.,
Establish a trademark dish that you can make easily, quickly, and well, with preparation time and ingredients that fit your schedule and your budget.,
Bring something recognizable.,
Know that unless they are offered, don't leave with anyone else's leftovers.",How to Bring Food to a Potluck Dinner," And then bring it. (Don't say you're coming with the Caesar salad and get lazy at the last minute and pick up a box of Milanos.);
, That translates to a 9"" x 12"" (200 mm by 300 mm) Pyrex baking dish, or a salad with 2 heads of lettuce, or 4 baguettes of French bread.

, Buy utensils at the Dollar Store and expect to lose them. On the bottom of your dish, put a strip of adhesive tape with your name and your telephone number written on it. Don't bring something in a family heirloom and spend the afternoon worrying about its safety.

, Don't assume there will be enough -- or any.

, Don't bring it in plastic or in the caterer's aluminum (for those of you who won't be preparing your own lasagna). This may be a potluck, it may be a picnic, but it's not a refugee camp.

, A bit of parsley, some sprinkles of paprika or chili powder on top of the deviled eggs or the macaroni salad... gracious, civil, and kind. Why else are we gathering? Don't show off by bringing an offering that creates work for everyone: rushing in with crock pots of soup that require soup spoons and bowls, bringing a dish so delicate it requires immediate and large-area refrigeration. Never bring something that depends on last-minute whipped cream. (If you call whipped cream ""topping"" or ""Cool Whip,"" go back to square one. That isn't real food.)

, A recipe, for example, that depends on Thai fish sauce, available at a market 30 miles (50 km) away, is a stress-builder and an ego trip, to say nothing of its questionable public acceptance.

, Don't keep people guessing if it's chicken or tuna. (What is that stuff in the rice?)

, When cooking for a crowd of ""unknowns,"" be very considerate: if you include peanuts or anything that may have may have had a passing acquaintance with peanuts, put a little sign by the dish that says so. (Same for any other common allergy: shellfish, e.g.). The same rule holds true for events where different ethnic traditions may be mixing -- i.e., identify the meat in a dish as pork or beef. If a dish is vegetarian, say so; if you know the difference between vegetarian and vegan, you might make a sign that clarifies your ingredients by the standards of those terms. Potlucks are neighborly, giving events: showing concern for the comfort of others is the whole point.

Replace cream in recipes with cashew butter.",How to Add Nut and Seed Butters to Your Diet2," Peanut butter and jelly is a classic combination for a reason, but if you need a change, substitute a different butter. This one change will make a big difference in the flavor of your sandwich. For an even more unusual sandwich, try one of these combinations:Almond butter and sour cherry preserves
Sunflower seed butter and sliced bananas
Cashew butter and fig jam
Pecan butter and apple butter
Soybean butter and sliced apples

, Mix up a savory nut and seed butter dip by combining the butter with cream cheese and a little seasoning (like taco seasoning or harissa). Dip carrot sticks, celery sticks, or crackers into the dip. Or make a sweet dip for fruit. Combine nut or seed butter with honey and a little vanilla or cinnamon.You can even replace traditional frostings with the sweetened butter dip, since it will still be quite thick.

, Hot breakfast cereals are known for being filling, but they don't usually have much protein. Add protein and nutrients by stirring a few tablespoons of your favorite nut or seed butter into your hot porridge or oatmeal. Consider using one of these combinations:


Almond butter and pumpkin
Sunflower seed butter and berries
Cashew butter and bananas

, If you're unsure how to add tahini to your diet, just whisk it into a salad dressing or sauce. You can make a simple starter dressing by combining tahini, water (or lemon juice) and salt. Whisk in your favorite flavorings or thickeners to make a sauce. Try adding:Cumin
Turmeric
Soy sauce
Honey
Olive oil
Garlic
Ginger

, Peanut butter cookies are a classic way to get peanut butter in your diet, but you could use any nut or seed butter. Try adding a few tablespoons of nut or seed butter to oatmeal cookies, pecan tea cakes, classic chocolate chip cookies, or no-bake chocolate oatmeal cookies.


Because cookies are high in fat and sugar, they should be a limited part of a balanced diet.
For a really quick gluten-free cookie, mix together sunflower butter with sugar and an egg. Roll the cookies into balls and flatten them a little. Bake them as you would peanut butter cookies., Most granola bars rely on oats, eggs, and sugar for binding together. To make your own nut bars, combine nuts with dates and your choice of nut or seed butter. You could also make smaller protein balls by just mixing together protein powder with maple syrup and nut or seed butter.The protein balls are much smoother than the nut bars.
Stir in your favorite dried fruit to the nut bars or even add flaked coconut.

, If you enjoy drinking smoothies for breakfast but find that they don't fill you up for long, add nut or seed butter. Add your favorite nut or seed butter to your usual smoothie and blend it until the butter is incorporated. The protein in the butter will help to keep you feeling fuller longer. Some good combinations to try include:Cherry and almond butter
Almond butter and matcha
Chocolate peanut butter and banana
Cashew butter and blueberries
Sunflower seed butter with chocolate and raspberries

, Create an Asian-inspired noodle dish by cooking a pot of soba, udon, or rice noodles. Drain the noodles and toss them with your choice of nut or seed butter. It's a great way to create a healthy and filling sauce. You can also stir in lots of fresh vegetables for crunch.


For example, toss soba noodles with a spicy nut or seed butter sauce. Stir in slices of bell peppers and garnish the noodles with cilantro and peanuts., If you're vegan and want to leave out the cream in a soup or chocolate ganache recipe, you can replace it with some cashew butter. To get a thinner consistency, put cashew butter into a blender or food processor along with enough water to cover the cashew butter. Pulse the blender until the water is incorporated and the butter is thin enough to pour.This substitution works best in recipes where the cream needs to be heated. Avoid trying to use cashew butter in recipes that call for cold cream to be whipped.

Set the mood.,
Dress appropriately.,
Welcome your guests.,
Serve the drinks.,
Introduce people.,
Enjoy the party!.",How to Be a Good Cocktail Party Host," Be prepared with a diversity of drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and hors d'oeuvres or appetizers. Re-arrange furniture so that your guests will not feel cramped, but everyone has a place they can sit down without being isolated. Dim lighting, candles and fresh flowers can create a warm atmosphere.;
, You are the first person your guests will see, so it's important to make a good first impression. It doesn't matter how nicely the party is decorated if you look disheveled or drab. If you indicated on the invitations that it would be a formal event, you should dress up; in fact, you're better off being overdressed than underdressed.

, Greet your guests at the door as they arrive and welcome them in. Offer to take their coats and be prepared with a room set aside to store coats during the party. Tell them where you are putting their coats (and any other accessories, like purses or umbrellas) so if they need something, they know where to look. Send them through to the party room while you put their coats away.

, As the host, you should always make sure everyone has a drink in their hand. Keep an eye on what everyone is drinking, and walk around with a bottle or a jug of water to replenish their drinks. It's best to fill the glasses up to two thirds. As you're doing this, make sure that no one drinks too much. If you spot someone drinking too quickly, fill their glass halfway or less. Likewise, if you see someone is obviously sipping their drink very slowly, perhaps because they don't prefer drinking too much, don't be overly eager to give them more.

, Ideally, your guests will mingle freely without prompting, but more often than not, cliques can form over the course of the evening, with people who already know each other well sticking close together and not engaging others at the party. This can dampen the party spirit, so as the host, look for ways to mix things up a bit. Find two people who you would like to meet each other, and introduce them. Bring up a topic that you know they are both interested in (""Chris, isn't your son applying to colleges? Marly here has a sister who's an admissions officer at Yale. Maybe she can give you some tips!""), or relate one person's experience to the other (""Joan, did you know that Harold climbed Mount Everest last year?). Get the conversation rolling and then move on to mind your other guests.

, Your appearance and your demeanor will set the tone of the party, so you must be presentable and sociable from beginning to end. If they see you look tired and stressed, they might feel as if they are burdens. But if you're lighthearted, relaxed, and talkative, it'll help them loosen up and feel at ease. With good planning and preparation, you should have plenty of opportunity to relax and enjoy the party.

Make sure that the menu you choose for your rehearsal dinner fits the budget that you have allocated for it.,
Establish whether you will be having a sit down dinner or a buffet.,
Contact establishments if you wish to have your rehearsal dinner at a restaurant, and ask if they are willing to provide a restricted menu for your guests to choose from.,
Choose a rehearsal dinner menu that matches the theme of your wedding, but a selection that does not upstage the future reception.,
Consider your guests when choosing a meal for your rehearsal dinner.,
Don't forget to offers drinks as part of your menu.",How to Choose a Menu for Your Rehearsal Dinner," Even with a limited budget, you can jazz up your basic menu selection with a fancy appetizer and dessert. Just make sure that the foods match. For example, begin dinner with prosciutto with melon. Your entrée could be lasagna with salad and hunks of cheesy bread. Then dessert could be scoops of sorbet served in martini glasses garnished with fruit or a sprig of mint.;
, Which ever you choose will determine the type of menu you should have.


Opt for easy to serve dishes if you are planning to serve your rehearsal dinner food buffet style. Foods such as spaghetti can be messy. Additionally, select foods that will stay fresh looking as it sits out. Cheeses usually sweat and harden when they are left out.

, This would guarantee that your guests select items within the theme of your celebration and also your budget, if that is a concern.

, If you are having a formal reception, the rehearsal dinner should be semi-formal, such as a plated dinner in a fine restaurant. A casual reception would call for a casual rehearsal dinner, such as a relaxed buffet at your home. Accordingly, if your reception is based on a cultural theme and menu choice, such as Italian or Indian, then the rehearsal dinner menu should match accordingly, but don't select the same menu choices as the reception.

, Try to include foods that all parties will enjoy. This means choosing a selection that includes both and meat and vegetable options, and if possible, make an effort to take into consideration any dietary restrictions your guests may have.

,


If you are at a restaurant and have a small budget, you may hand out a drink ticket and then have a cash bar for anyone who wishes to purchase more than one beverage. Another option is to provide a red and white bottle of wine at the table.
Offer guests an open bar if your budget allows.

Buy food.,
Take a casserole dish to a fast food place or supermarket deli and tell the clerk, ""Fill 'er up!"",

Bring food that requires little preparation.,

Bring drinks.,

Bring ice.,

Bring non-foods.,

Offer your time and assistance.,

Lend supplies or equipment.",How to Contribute to a Potluck if You Can't Cook," Bring chips and dip, cheese and crackers, bread or rolls (remember butter or a dip), pre-made potato salad, a party platter, a frozen lasagna, or a dessert from a bakery.

If you want, you can dress up store-bought foods by placing them in attractive, real dishes and adding your own garnish or arrangement.
Another way around this is to order food from a gourmet deli or local restaurant that is as good as homemade food; be sure to put in your order several days in advance.;
, They'll laugh, but you'll look good coming in the door. However, this is expensive compared with making a dish yourself., Here are some popular contributions that require little time or skill to prepare:


Make fruit salad, bring seasonal, fresh fruit, or just cut up a watermelon. A bowl of fresh berries is always appreciated.
Place a bag of prepared, frozen meatballs into a crock pot with a bottle of either barbecue sauce or teriyaki sauce. You can transport them separately in their original containers. Turn on the crock pot immediately when you arrive and everything will be warm by the time people eat; just be sure you're going somewhere that has electricity. Place a jar of toothpicks next to the crock pot for easy self-serving.
Make no-bake cookies or peanut butter fudge, melting the chocolate in the microwave.

, You might make lemonade or punch or simply purchase an assortment of soft drinks and juice.

Be sure to coordinate with your hosts, especially if you plan to bring alcoholic drinks.
Don't forget a bottle opener and corkscrew, even if all the drinks you bring are screw-top. It's the last thing people seem to think of bringing to gatherings. If you're given to heroics, you could learn to open a beer with a dollar bill or open a wine bottle without a corkscrew, but you'll still be a hero for bringing the right tools.

, Let your hosts know in advance, and ask how much they will need. They may be very happy not to make the trip to get it at the last minute, and they may not have remembered that they needed it at all., Ask your hosts if you could help by bringing plates, cups, napkins, forks, or decorations instead of food. While this might seem mundane, dealing with these essentials can take extra work off your host's list of things-to-do., See if your hosts need help setting up and taking down chairs and tables. Or, volunteer to do the dishes and clean up after the event., Do you have a patio umbrella or folding chairs you could offer? What about a cooler or tub for the drinks? In warmer months, an extra fan might be helpful, or in cooler months, an outdoor gas heater. Ask your hosts what they might need in the way of equipment."

Dress up in period clothing.,
Copy the dining fare from that last evening.,
Decorate the room with 1912 flair.,
Invite live musicians to fill the room with music that was played on the ship.",How to Hold a Final Titanic Supper Dinner Party," In order to make this dinner party authentic you’ll have most fun if you and your guests come dressed as the passengers who traveled on the ill-fated ship.


Investigate how the upper class and lower class dressed for the voyage. Upper class men wore tuxedos to dinner and women dined in long, silk dresses with puffed sleeves and lace inlays. Men could rent a tuxedo from a local tux shop and women could rent a period costume from a costume rental store or even purchase pieces at a vintage clothing store.
Role play from some of the folks listed on the manifesto. Public record shows not only who was on the ship, but also their age, where they came from and what they did for a living. Learn more about the individuals on the ship and assume their identity for the evening. You could assign the roles to guests as befits their age and interests.
Dress like the star-crossed lovers “Rose” and “Jack” from the film Titanic. While both are fictional characters, they are appealing to lovers of the popular James Cameron blockbuster. If you're hosting a party with a bunch of Titanic film buffs, consider playing “who am I”, and have guests try to guess which character you’ve transformed into.;
, Follow the menu to a “t” by making some of the delicacies actually served on the Titanic.


Go for the entire seven to 14 course meal of select items that strike your fancy. Depending on how you attack this dinner party, you could either stick strictly to the menu, serving each and every course or select a few items you know your guests will enjoy. Some of the food choices are a bit old-fashioned nowadays, so you might want to finesse them a little or drop a few. Also, you might want to add in a vegetarian choice or two, depending on your guest's preferences.
Include an appetizer such as oysters or canapés. Passed hors d'oeuvres were popular, so consider adding caviar and fine crackers or fresh shrimp and cocktail sauce.
The main course was extensive, so unless you can handle making numerous meats and vegetables in your kitchen, in the time you have available, you may want to select one main course and a few vegetables. Choose from lamb with mint sauce, squab, sirloin of beef, chateau potatoes, glazed duck with applesauce, salmon and squab and asparagus.
Serve popular cocktails from the era. Punch Romaine was rumored to have been served on that final evening so tantalize your guests with a round of this enchanting spirit. Combine 6 cups crushed ice, 1 cup simple syrup, 2 cups Champagne or sparkling wine, 1 cup white wine, 1/3 cup freshly squeezed orange juice, 2 tablespoons lemon juice and slivered orange peel. Combine crushed ice, simple syrup, Champagne, white wine, orange juice and lemon juice in a blender and blend until well combined. Spoon the mixture into individual dessert cups, drizzle with rum and garnish with a sliver of orange peel.
Punch Romaine was considered to be a palate cleanser. A palate cleanser is something served to refresh the appetite between courses. Today, you could serve a small portion of sorbet instead.
The tenth course, or dessert course, served Waldorf Pudding, Peaches in Chartreuse Jelly, Chocolate and Vanilla Éclairs and French Ice Cream. You could also serve a small dessert such as crème brulé or a delicate serving of fresh berries and cream.
A full menu can be found in Gary Fisher's article The Last Dinner on the Titanic at: http://www.armchair.com/recipe/titanic1.html.

, Go for the authentic instead of the morbid by ditching any images of ships sinking and instead opting for classy 1912 cruise ship decor. The ship’s décor was a grand affair, which included numerous sparkling chandeliers, endless massive dining tables and the finest stamped china. Even if you're working within a small space, you too can recreate some of the Titanic’s magic that last evening.


Dress table in fine linen. Include well pressed napkins for each guest along with a handwritten place card. Use linens in rich satin and deep colors, which were popular during this period.
Add fresh flowers to the table. Consider lilies or classic roses to create a traditional, elegant arrangement.
Dig out your best fine bone china and silver. Better yet, use your grandparent’s or parent’s fine bone china as it may be more representative of what was used on the Titanic.
Use the full dinnerware serving platters. Present your meal using the finest serving platters and dinnerware––treat this dinner as if you're serving royalty.

, Consider asking local musicians to dress the part of the famous eight man band and play some of the melodies performed while the ill-fated ship slowly began to sink. Documented songs include “Alexander’s Ragtime Band” and “In the Shadows.”


Seek student musicians from a local college. Not only could you get a break on the price, student musicians may be more game to play along with dressing up to match the period.
If you can’t afford or can't acquire live musicians, consider downloading music from a music website that was popular during 1912, in addition to the documented songs. Depending on your theme, you could purchase a copy of the soundtrack from the film, “Titanic” for background music.

Lightly brown the pierogi before serving, if desired, in heated butter in a frying pan.

",How to Make Pierogies4," Divide into 4 pieces.


Use a large amount of flour while rolling. Roll to a thickness of approximately 1/16” (1mm).
Cut 3” (7.5cm) circles from the rolled dough. Coat well in flour.







, Divide the fillings equally centered in each circle. Don't try to overfill – if you do, simply remove some of the filling (use the first successfully filled pierogie to guide filling the rest). About a scant teaspoon is suitable for each pierogie.


Work through filling them methodically; if it's easier, sit down. Have a suitable surface to place the filled pierogie on, such as the clean tea towel shown in this image.

, (Keep flouring your hands.) Pinch really well and firmly, even if you have to do it several times; you don't want the filling to spill out when cooking!


If wished, use a fork to press down the edges neatly.

, Pat some more flour on every pierogie to prevent them from sticking together. If necessary, add some more warm water to the dough, as adding flour makes each pierogie drier.

, Once the water is boiling, drop some of the pierogi in the water. Don't overcrowd the pierogi - allow moving room. When they float to the surface, let them boil for approximately 1-2 minutes more.


Fish them out with a strainer or slotted spoon. Place them on trays lined with wax paper; do not let them touch or they'll stick together.
If not eating immediately, place the pierogi in the fridge if you're eating them shortly; or freeze with wax layers between them, then remove frozen pierogi from wax and place into sealed freezer bags.

, Either add the topping direct, or provide a range of toppings for diners to select from. Some suggestions include: melted butter, fried bacon pieces, fried onions (chopped finely) or sour cream. Some people prefer no topping at all, as they're delicious enough on their own!

Place the appropriately coded label on each of the six containers.

,
Put the labeled vodka containers in a cooler or a bowl filled with ice after all of your guests have arrived.

",How to Host a Blind Vodka Tasting Party1," You will probably want to test at least six brands of vodka to make this a proper tasting experience. If you only test two or three brands, your party won’t last very long, and if you test more than six brands, you and your guests may become too inebriated to rate them properly!;
, You won't be able to just cover up the label of the bottles since even the design of the bottles could give away what vodka it contains.


The containers need to be freezer-proof.

,, Always serve vodka ice cold. If the ice in your sink or cooler starts to melt too fast, return the containers of vodka to the freezer before you pour the next tasting.

, Allow 1 ounce (30ml) of vodka for each guest for each brand to be rated. For example, if you are having six guests, you will need to pour 6 ounces (180ml) of each brand into the respective blind taste test containers.

, Write the codes down on a piece of paper as well so that you won’t forget which code goes with which brand. Keep the code in a safe place where the guests cannot see it.

, Even though you are going to be serving chocolate you will be enhancing these spoons with other ingredients. For example, if you are serving the chocolate spoons following a Mexican fiesta you may want to add some spice or even a slight kick to the chocolate such as a small dash of cayenne pepper. For a kids' party you could reproduce a ""worm in dirt"" on a smaller scale with a small gummy worm and Oreo crumbles.

Add a gift tag or label for each tea party favor you've made.",How to Make Tea Party Favors," It can be easy to overspend on favors simply out of generosity toward your guests but it's important to avoid this by setting a budget and thinking of value ways to save money. For example, you might buy packages or tins of things and divide them into smaller amounts using your own materials, to help make things go further. Obviously, the number of guests will also direct how much you can splurge on favors for them.;
, Tea is an ideal thing to give for a tea party favor and it's easy to make pretty little teabag packs. Here are some suggestions:


Purchase plain teapot shaped teabag holders. These are quite cheap in kitchenware stores and the like. Add a teabag or two of your favorite flavor (or choose interesting flavors or choose according to the color of the teabag cover) to the top of the teabag holder. Wrap in clear cellophane and finish off with a ribbon.
Place a teapot shaped teabag holder onto a single cup tray. Place a teabag on top. Wrap flat with clear cellophane and finish with a ribbon.

, Purchase a pretty teacup or mug. If you're having just a small group of very special friends over, splurge on a nice bone china cup or mug but if you're having a lot of people over, choose plain and cheery cheap versions or go eclectic and purchase used ones from the charity store that are still in excellent condition. Then, try one of these ideas:


Place a few interesting teabags inside the cup and wrap with cellophane. Tie together with a ribbon.
Make the same thing but add a teaspoon.
Grow a plant in a teacup and saucer. Choose fast growing items like cress or grass or buy miniature plants and add to the cup.

, Purchase jars that look like test tubes with cork stoppers in the top. Make a set of three and fill each one with a different loose leaf tea. Label each one and wrap in clear cellophane. Complete by adding a bow or ribbon.

, Choose between cute little sets like the one shown here or single, slightly larger ones. If they're large enough, fill each one with a teabag, then wrap in clear cellophane. Finish with a ribbon. Be aware that some of the miniature teapots can be very expensive, so watch the price!

, If you're handy with crafts, there are lots of lovely things you can make, such as:



Sew a mug mat stuffed with aromatic spices. Sew a pocket on the top of the mug mat and insert the teabag.
Sew a small teabag holder pouch that can be toted anywhere. Look for fabrics with teapot designs on the fabric.
Make felt teacups.
Make green tea bath bombs. Wrap in clear cellophane and tie with ribbon.
Knit a mug warming holder.
Make pincushion teacups.
Make candles in a teacup.

, Make designs such as teapots, cups and teabags. Decorate with pretty designs and place into small clear cellophane bags and tie with ribbons.


If you enjoy cooking jam, little jars of jam make another nice food gift for tea party favors. If you add the jam to a box with teabags and a couple of cellophane wrapped scones, all the guest needs to do is make a cup of tea and they'll have an instant afternoon tea! Bake the scones fresh on the day of giving away this favor and only wrap in cellophane after they have cooled down properly.

, Things such as charms, jewelry, figurines and small teapot sets can all be turned into little favors. Add to little bags or boxes and finish with a bow.


Look for teapot, teabag and teacup items already packaged in pretty arrangements that will work as tea party favors in their own right.

, Line with wax paper or parchment paper and fill with loose tea. Choose loose tea with pretty additions such as petals, etc. Tie together with ribbon and a bow.

, Gift tags shaped like teabags can look really cute.

Create a vodka scorecard for each of your guests.,
Print the scoring criteria on the bottom of each scorecard so that guests don't have to guess what the numbers mean.",How to Host a Blind Vodka Tasting Party2," Make a grid on a sheet of paper with one row for each brand of vodka and four columns.


Label each row with the code for each brand of vodka.
Label the columns ‘aroma,’ ‘smoothness,’ ‘crispness,’ and ‘overall taste.’

, For example, you might state that a score of “1” indicates poor aroma, smoothness, crispness or taste; a score of “2” indicates fair rating of the category, and so on. A score of “5” indicates a superior rating in any of the categories."

Be sure to have plenty of appetizers on hand so that your guests can cleanse their palates between tastings, and so that food can help absorb the alcohol they will be drinking.,
Provide the following sorts of appetizers:


Salty hors d'oeuvres, such as pickled herring and caviar.",How to Host a Blind Vodka Tasting Party3," Although the higher the quality of the vodkas you use, the less there will be a need to cleanse the palate since highly distilled vodkas don’t linger on the palate like other hard liquors.

,, Have each person write down his or her ratings on the scorecards.

,, If you don’t have enough shot glasses for each round of tasting, this gives you plenty of opportunity to wash the first set out while your guests are enjoying their snacks.

, Encourage them to sip and taste, rather than drinking the vodka as a shot.,, Refer to the piece of paper that you wrote the matching codes on when you labeled the containers earlier in the evening.

, Another round can be shared of the winning vodka, just for fun.

",How to Make Sprinkled Chocolate Party Spoons2," Make sure they are level by either propping the spoon handle against a spatula or even a small book. You want the entire spoon area to be filled with chocolate. If you don't have enough spatulas or books for the entire batch at once, work in groups (for example, doing 10 at a time).

, Stir chocolate constantly to avoid having it burn or clump.


Stir and heat until chocolate is nearly 80% melted. Remove from heat and continue stirring until chocolate has completely melted and is smooth.







, Use a small spoon or pour using a spouted measuring cup to dispense chocolate. Work quickly as you don’t want the chocolate to harden during the process.

, If you plan to dip the spoon into a powdery substance (such as crystal sugar or ginger) be sure you carefully dip so that it doesn’t disturb the balance of the chocolate.

, Expedite the process by placing cookie sheet in the refrigerator. Be sure the cookie sheet remains level so the chocolate doesn’t shift or move.

Determine how many guests you can invite.,
Consider which type of people would enjoy the party most.,
Include information in your invitation about bringing friends.,
Make a list of the non-negotiable guests.,
Consider the relationships or “plus-ones” of your non-negotiable guests.,
Eliminate any potential conflicting pairs.,
Invite everyone if you are inviting a majority.,
Invite people you want to invite.,
Use tact and manners when inviting your guests.,
Request and follow up for RSVPs.,
Invite reserves if applicable.",How to Decide Who to Invite to a Party," This will depend on things like the size of the venue, the purpose of the celebration, the amount of food or alcohol you’ll be providing, etc. If you’re throwing a huge bash, you may be able to invite all your best friends, close friends, coworkers, and acquaintances. You won’t need to be extremely particular about the guest list, because the more the merrier. However, you’ll have to be pickier if you’re planning a small gathering.It’s best to determine a range of guests, because there’s always a chance that someone will bail on the party last minute, or do the opposite and bring an unexpected plus-one.
Figure out a budget for your party, and determine how much each guest will cost you.
The venue should provide you with its maximum occupancy, so you can make sure you don't invite too many guests.;
, It makes for a great party when you invite guests who genuinely enjoy themselves. For example, if you’re hosting a soiree at an upscale restaurant, think about your friends who love trying new cuisine or are self-proclaimed “foodies.” If you’re hosting a casual backyard cookout, you may want to invite your more low-key, low maintenance friends. You get the idea!This doesn’t mean to exclude good friends that may not “fit” the atmosphere you’re going for. It can certainly be fun to get them out of their comfort zones.

, If you know you have plenty of room for all your guests and then some, you can include a line about your party being ""the more the merrier!"" This will let your invitees know that they are welcome and even encouraged to bring others along with them.


Proper party etiquette is that the only people who are explicitly invited are the names on the invitation. If you want your guests to bring dates, children, friends, or whoever, specify!, These are people that you absolutely must invite, for whatever reason. These could be your best friends or family members that you couldn’t imagine having a party without, or any people that you feel completely obligated to invite. Typically, non-negotiables are people you desperately want at your party or the people that you must invite to avoid tension. Once you’ve created this list, you can determine how much space you have left to invite others.If you’re having an engagement party, your soon-to-be mother-in-law is a non-negotiable. You may not love her, but there is no way you can exclude her.

, This applies to all ages and types of parties. If you’re a child hosting a sleepover and you invite your best friend, they may want to bring their other best friend. If you’re inviting your favorite co-worker to your dinner party, you should probably expect his new fiancée to join him. These things are important to consider when planning a party both for logistical reasons, such as food, drinks, space, etc., but also for the dynamic and mood of the party as a whole. A party may go more smoothly if everyone feels comfortable, whether they brought a guest or have other friends in attendance., These are any guests that have problems or bad blood with each other. There may be two people you really want at your birthday party, but it won’t be much fun if they’re fighting with each other the whole time. This can be a difficult task, but you need to try your best to avoid potential conflicts or awkward situations.Sometimes you just can't eliminate all potential conflict pairs. If there are two people who are at odds that you absolutely must invite, consider planning a larger-sized party where there will be plenty of other people to divert attention and reduce overall tension.
If you're planning a smaller party where the two conflicting guests will be in contact with each other, let them both know beforehand. Tell them privately that the other person will be there, and you hope they can respect your desire to have a calm and drama-free party.

, In other words, if you are inviting over half of your office or class, you need to invite everyone. Don't alienate a couple of people by inviting everyone else, because it will create an uncomfortable and exclusive atmosphere. Put yourself in their shoes, and give them an invitation if everyone else is getting one.


If you are having a smaller party and aren't capable of inviting everyone, invite only a chosen few. That way, the majority of your co-workers or classmates aren't invited and won't take it as a personal affront.

, At the end of the day, it is your party and you can invite whoever you want. While there is common etiquette to ensure that people don't feel unnecessarily excluded, you are not obligated to invite anyone you don't want to. If you are comfortable with the tension or repercussion that may result from leaving someone off your guest list, then you should. You will not be able to enjoy your event if you are surrounded by people you don't want to be around.This is a trickier issue if you are co-hosting a party. If your co-host wants someone there that you dislike, or vice versa, you may need to compromise.

, If you’re only inviting a few people at school or work, don’t pass out invitations or spread the word there. Sending your invitations via mail or e-mail is a great method. You can send invitations discreetly, and you can also include pertinent information, such as your address, driving directions, dress code, or anything else they may need to know.Send your invitations a couple weeks before a more formal event, and within a week for an informal party.
Websites like Paperless Post make it easy to create cute, custom invitations. They offer an entire section of invitations you can create completely for free., This can be as formal as requesting written RSVPs, or just asking invitees if they plan on attending so you can get a general headcount. Regardless of how you go about doing this, you should figure out who is planning to attend so that you can make sure you are prepared to host everyone. Make sure that when you request RSVPs, you also ask if they intend on bringing a date or friend along with them.

, If many of your invitees are unable to come, you can always send out additional invitations to anyone you may not have considered originally. After you’ve created your list of non-negotiable guests and their potential dates, create a list of reserve guests. These reserves will get invited if many of your original invitees can’t make it."

Use balloons.,
Use candles or lanterns.,
Use potted plants.,
Use arrangements of old books.,
Decorate and arrange branches for a classic, rugged, or winter themed look.,
Arrange candy for a centerpiece that tastes as good as it looks.,
Use fruit for a vibrant and colorful centerpiece.",How to Create Centerpieces for Your Wedding Reception Without Flowers," This may sound a bit like a kid's birthday party, but you can make this work with the most elegant of wedding themes. To keep an elegant feel to the reception, choose colors like whites and creams, and choose different sized balloons. Use balloons with helium and make sure they get filled about 2 hours before the reception. Pick several for each table, varying from small to large and in an assortment of themed colors. Use a central point on the table to bunch your balloons at different heights, even over your guests' heads. Change the colors of the balloons to fit any wedding theme, and arrange colored ribbons around the balloons to finish off the look.;
, This works especially well if you are having an evening reception. Pick candles of various heights and widths to make this theme work well. Also choose colors like white and cream to vary the look for each table, or use different styles and colors of lampshades to create the mood of each table. Drape strings of lanterns across tables or around the room to give the reception your desired mood.

, This option will work well for a more ""green"" wedding, in theme and in color. Again, you can choose different sizes and types of plants. Use a variety of herbs, flowers, cacti, or even vegetable plants, and these centerpieces can double as gifts for your guests.

, This idea works well with wedding themes that are more vintage. Vary your books in color and size to make this work well. Stack a few books at each table and top off the arrangement with a small flowerpot, candles, small framed pictures, or other vintage items. Use ribbons to enhance the look, with colors such as maroon, cream, and navy to work well with the vintage theme.

, Spray-paint thin long branches with white or silver paint, or clean them and leave them bare for a more authentic feel. Put them in long glass vases for extra length, and consider putting white sand in the bottom of the vases to hold them upright. Decorate with stick or wooden ornaments, newspaper flowers, or glass balls, ribbons, and lights. You can also wrap string lights around the branches and add candles to complete the look.

, Pick glass vases varying in thickness and height and put in your favorite candies. Use large lollipops or sticks of rock candy for visual effect and add M&Ms, jelly beans, or another small, colored candy to fill in the vase. You can even get specific arrangements of M&Ms in your wedding's colors, and add messages like your names or initials and a small picture of you onto the candies., Use different sizes of vases and dishes to get the best effect, and choose fruits with strong, vibrant colors. Use whole lemons, limes, oranges, apples, and pomegranates, carve designs into watermelons, or arrange sliced fruit or berries. To vary the décor even more, keep some fruit whole in a tall glass vase, and put cut fruit and water in another.

Introduce your organization.,
Tell them about your product or service.,
Include links to press releases and past press coverage.,
Write an FAQ.,
Write short biographies of important staff members.",How to Create a PR Packet for an Event1," The first section of your press kit should be designed to give a journalist a good working knowledge of your organization all by itself. Think of the introductory section as the Cliff’s Notes version of the rest of your press kit. It should contain:An explanation of what your organization does, why your organization does what it does, and who it does it for.
Very basic facts about the history of your organization, including the date of its founding and its growth over time.
Important statistics illustrating the story of your organization. If the press kit was for a company, this might include growth numbers, if the press kit was for a band, the statistics might be YouTube views, downloads, or number of states (or countries) toured.
A table of contents for the rest of the press kit.
A press contact person and their contact information.;
, In some way, shape, or form, any organization creating a press kit is going to be offering a product or service. Since the product or the service is what generates income, you need to highlight its good points and minimize the bad. If you’re offering an new product, then explain why it is significant.For example, the Exmaster 5000--the culmination of years of research and development--is going to revolutionize the industry. A complete departure from the norm, the Exmaster 5000 can do..."" Regardless of whether you’re touting an old product or rolling out a new one, this section calls for pictures, video, and audio to showcase your offering.
Although bands, theatrical companies, and nonprofits might not think of themselves as offering a product or service, their creative output or their mission constitutes their product.

, Since your press kit is designed to get media coverage on your own terms, you should include examples of the type of media coverage you’re aiming for.This is a standard component of a press kit, and reporters know it’s suggestive of the type of coverage you’re looking for. Let the rest of your press kit serve to demonstrate why the reporter should agree.
If your press kit is entirely digital, a good way to showcase previous media coverage is to quote the lede on your page and link to a PDF of the entire article. If your press kit is physical, edit judiciously. Fifty pages of old articles and press releases is overkill.

, In general, a section answering frequently asked questions (FAQ) serves to keep you from having to waste time answering the same questions again and again. But in the context of a press kit, the FAQ should suggest the types of questions you want the reporters to ask.For instance, if your organization sold a product that had an array of uses, but for whatever reason was buttonholed into a very niche corner of the market, you might pose a question like: “Is that all this widget can do?” and answer it with some suggestions on how to get the most out of your product.

, When it comes down to it, all stories are “human interest” stories. It is people who buy and use products and people who need services. There is always a way to find a personal angle in a story, even one about a product launch. When you write a little bit about your staff, you make it easier on the reporters to find out what that personal angle is.When you’re writing the biographies, cover more than the standard information about where so-and-so went to school and how many degrees they have. Instead, emphasize a unique aspect of the subject’s history, like their reason for joining the venture in the first place. A lot of people have degrees, but very few have exactly the same passions and motivations.
For example, you might say that ""Our CEO, Bob Smith, didn't start out thinking he was going to be the CEO of an industry leader like Widgetech. He started out as a man with a vision--to make a widget like no other.""

Do some research, but try to find something unique to you.,
Consider choosing your décor style based on your dress.,
Take a hint from the time of year.,
Express the history of the bride and the groom.,
Consider basing the location of your wedding in a place special to your relationship, such as where you first met as a couple, where your first date was, or where he proposed.,
Embrace the traditions of each of your families to create a signature event unlike any other.,
Reflect your unique styles and personalities in the Décor.",How to Choose Your Unique Wedding Decor," Start by browsing the web, looking through magazines, or consulting a wedding planner. Try not to copy other people's style completely; try to adapt the ideas of others to come up with something unique. However, if you find something that captures exactly what you want, it is perfectly okay to incorporate that design into your wedding.;
, Letting your dress guide your choices can pull the wedding elements together nicely. The bride is always the focal point of the ceremony, so it makes sense to use the dress as a jumping off point for your décor.Examples:


Formal. You may be leaning toward a more traditional route for decorations, a classic look with draped white fabric, roses, gold accents and lush greenery.
Chic. In that case perhaps a more sleek and modern design might work. One or two colors, simple, classic touches, no balloons or glitter.
Old fashioned vintage flair. A rustic theme might work well in that case.
Fairytale-like. A long, princess-like dress might indicate a storybook themed wedding.

, Plan your Décor depending on what month or season it is. This will accentuate the best parts of that season, like the warmth of summer or the gorgeous winter scenery. Examples:


Winter weddings quite naturally lead themselves to décor that celebrates the season, bright jewel tones for the holidays, wintery white with fur, or pines, snow and icicles.
Spring is a perfect time to incorporate vibrant colors, an outdoor inspired theme with an array of daisies, tulips and daffodils or the Kelly green of St Patrick’s Day.
Summer weddings are a perfect fit for the shabby chic motif with rustic farm décor or perhaps a relaxing ocean theme with cool soothing colors.
The spectacular colors of Autumn go well with a vineyard inspired theme, leaves and grapes accenting the browns, golds and reds of fall.

, Make sure to include special details about your relationship in your decoration choices. After all, this is a celebration of your new life together as a married couple, so this is a perfect opportunity to include the details of your time together.

, For example, if you met at a park, you could weave a garden décor throughout the wedding, using bright florals and lots of greens. Maybe you met at the beach or on a cruise, so including a nautical theme would fit perfectly.

, Whether Irish or Scottish, Hispanic or Hungarian, each culture has indelible colors, tastes and textures that will make your wedding highly personal and meaningful for both families and the friends and loved ones who attend. Don’t be afraid to include meaningful elements from your family’s background.

, Feel free to choose what you both love and weave your personalities into the wedding. Choose the Décor that expresses your individuality.


Have you always loved western music and dance? Use this interest in your decorations, by having from drinks in mason jars, or decorating the altar with horseshoe hearts. Weaving this theme throughout the décor adds a unique charm and flair to the event and makes it highly personal to you.
Have polka dots always been your thing? Do you and your husband to be love watching old movies together? Using a black and white inspired theme can be a fun way to showcase your individuality and have a wedding that is both striking and highly personal.

Give the people what they want.,
Hire Professional Musicians.,
Ask for special requests in advance.,

Always Have A Detailed Contract Signed By Both Parties that includes:When and where (Date, time and location of the performance), How ( How many musicians will be present), Who will provide sound?,A plan ""B"" band (you want to have a back-up plan if a real emergency comes up) Find a band that you like that's not working and send the bandleader the information on your wedding so they're ready to go if anything happens,The ability to communicate with the bandleader

,
Book the band you like as far ahead as the event as possible.",How to Choose the Right Band for Your Event," Some people like Rhianna, some like classical music. Take a survey in your company, or crowd, to find out the common areas of music you can all agree on. Your tastes, like mine, will vary wildly in contrast to you peers, fellow workers, and family members. In other words, don't play only the music grandma wants; your guests will be bored.;
, Many bands are made up of amateurs masquerading as professionals. Find out how long they've been playing weddings, who they worked for. Get references from previous clients. Make sure to see them at a live performance open to the public.

, All of the members of the band must learn and rehearse the song that you require. In order for it not to be a disaster you need to give the bandleader a heads up.

, Have a backup band in place in case of an emergency.


It's worth it to pay good money for a good band. Performing music is a business. Instrument maintenance costs serious money. Microphones break and must be replaced, Guitar strings need to be replaced. Gas needs to be put in the tank, food needs to be eaten. All of these things must be taken into consideration. By going cheap on the band you insure a lackluster performance. By paying the least amount of money you can you jeopardize the overall level of the band. Professional musicians, because of the nature of the business, are often forced to accept the highest bidder.

, It's simple. If the band has no following, no one likes their music. See how the crowd reacts to their music. Are they dancing? Are they applauding?

, An agent adds 15% to the total cost of the band. Communicating with the bandleader can save you money as well as making the music turn out right.

, Client or customer, Who will operate the sound system? The bandleader or a sound man? What is the load in and set up time? What is the dress code for the band? How many people attending event?


Food, drink, and a break room for the musicians is essential so they can maintain their energy throughout the long event.
When is the deposit due?

Include appropriate testimonials.,
Create multimedia specific to the event.,
Send out press releases.,
Compile your physical press kits.",How to Create a PR Packet for an Event2," It’s common practice to include testimonials from customers in press kits. Since a press kit in this day and age usually means a section of a website, the testimonials are typically general, representing many types of customers. Though it makes sense in that context, if you’re putting together a press kit for a specific event, you’ll be better served by using testimonials from people who are similar to those at the event.If you’re putting together a press kit for an architect’s conference, include testimonials from architects. For example, ""Widgetech's widgets have completely changed the way I draw up plans for houses. I'm ten times as productive as I was before Widgetech rolled out the original widget. Now they're at it again, making my success possible. I wouldn't be where I am today without Widgetech.""

, It’s becoming more and more common for press kits to include DVDs, CDs, slideshows and (of course) photographs. Adding these components works. Members of the media are far more likely to read press kits containing audio and video elements. Customizing your multimedia for the event you’re boosting maximizes the effectiveness of the strategy.Think of your press kit as a long letter to reporters explaining why and how you and your product should be covered. A non-customized press kit is like a form letter. Just as you probably attach little importance to form letters, reporters will attach less importance to a press kit that isn’t tailored to your event.
So if the new drafting software your firm developed is going to revolutionize the profession of architecture, the video you include in your press kit should talk about that specifically.
Remember to include files of your logo (use a flash drive for a physical packet) with your press kit.

, About a week before your event, send a press release to the publications you expect to cover your event (or hope will cover it). That way, you can avoid getting lost in the crowd of competing press releases on the first day of the event and you give enough lead time to benefit from the pre-event publicity.Conventional wisdom states that you should avoid sending out your press release on Mondays, Fridays, and weekends. The plurality of press releases are sent on Monday or Friday morning, so sending yours on a Thursday afternoon will make it stand out.Don’t try and compete with a big news story. An impending hurricane will always be a bigger story than your product launch.

, Before the event, compile your physical press kits. Since your press kit is available on your website, the physical packet is a little redundant. But most people prefer reading paper to screens, and you want to make it as easy as possible on the people covering your event.


You don’t need to send your packet to a graphic designer, but you should do your best to make your press kit look stylish and notable. It might be competing for attention with several others, and you should use any advantage you can get.

Research the time of winter solstice, as well as the occurrences.,
Understand the religious, magical and natural significance of winter solstice.,
Decorate your home.,
Make some solstice-themed traditional crafts, such as a Yule log.,
Prepare a feast.,
Go wassailing.,
Stay up until sunrise.",How to Celebrate the Winter Solstice," Winter solstice happens on December 21 (northern hemisphere) or June 21 (southern hemisphere), when the sun reaches the lowest apex and the night is the longest annually. If you are unable to celebrate on this day, it is generally accepted to celebrate the day directly before or directly after.;
, You don't have to turn this in to a religious holiday if you aren't inclined, but it can be interesting to learn the different myths and legends to go with Yule.


In Pagan beliefs, the winter solstice is the re-arrival and rebirth of the sun, who is personified as a horned, male deity. In Ancient Roman beliefs, it's Saturnalia- the celebration of fertility and the harvest.

, You may find that classic Christmas traditions, such as mistletoe, are actually from the old days. Hang holly, mistletoe, ivy and pine branches around your home, and light a fire to create a warm environment for the longest night. Some Pagan traditions involve lighting candles to welcome the sun deity back to Earth.

, Other ideas include decorating trees like you would at Christmas, using salt dough ornaments in the shape of the sun, moon and stars, and creating spiced potpourri with cinnamon and other seasonal spices.

, You can make any dishes using seasonal ingredients, or look into special Yule recipes. A particular drink is ""Wassail"", which is an alcoholic mix of apple cider, spices, honey and brandy.


You may also want to try buttered rum. For something sweet, try making a chocolate yule log or peppermint fudge. Squash soup and warm roast meat are also good, traditional choices for a main course.

, Wassailing is a form of caroling that originated before Christianity, when farmers would walk around the fields at night and sing songs to ward off spirits that could inhibit crop fertility. You can use any Christmas or holiday carol for this, or use Pagan carols.

, This may be difficult with younger children, but in order to truly observe the winter solstice, stay up for the longest night, and welcome the sun back to begin warming the Earth.

Create a cookbook with one hundred of the centenarian’s famous (or favorite) recipes.",How to Celebrate a 100th Birthday1," Centenarians have experienced a lot of changes, events, and momentous occasions. Capturing their story in a video or slideshow presentation is an excellent way to preserve their memories and honor their life. Produce a video or slideshow presentation that contains photographs, documents, memorabilia, and video clips.


Ask your local historical society to conduct an oral history interview with the guest of honor.
Give your guests copies of the presentation as a party favor.
If you aren’t tech-savvy, create a handmade timeline documenting the centenarian’s life and achievements.;
, Sometimes the best gifts of all are words of appreciation and funny anecdotes. Throughout the party, circulate a guest book. Encourage guests to take a few minutes to write a personal message to the centenarian. At the end of the party, present the book of memories to the centenarian.


Instead of a traditional guest book, create a video guest book. Show the film at the end of the party., On the invitation, ask guests to bring an item that reminds them of the centenarian. At the event, guests can explain the item’s significance to the guest of honor before placing it in a time capsule. Once everyone has put in their item, bury or lock the time capsule.


Let the guest of honor decide when the time capsule may be opened., Work with a local bakery to create a custom cake for the centenarian’s birthday celebration. You may order a show-stopping centerpiece that commemorates different aspects of the centenarian’s life or purchase a simply decorated and delicious sheet cake. When you bring out the cake at the party, sing “Happy Birthday” to the guest of honor.

You could also print a birthday greeting in the guest of honor’s favorite magazine publication.
You could even ask a local news station to wish the guest of honor a happy birthday.

Network.",How to Become an Event Promoter1," Although a bachelor’s degree isn’t necessary to begin a career as an event promoter, the knowledge gained from studying these fields may prove to be beneficial.If you plan on attending college in the future or have already enrolled, consider majoring in these subjects to give your resume some impressive credentials, especially if you aspire to handle large-scale events for prominent clients.If you haven’t the means or desire to pursue a four-year program, sign up for individual courses or seminars at your local university, community college, or online.


Such well known institutions as Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and MIT offer free online resources, including podcasts, lectures, videos, assignments, and more.;
, A bachelor’s degree may look impressive on your resume, but gaining hands-on experience outside of the classroom will better prepare you for the demands and logistics of events and promotion. First, settle on a particular area of entertainment that appeals to your interests. Then apply for a job at any level of appropriate events. Don’t worry about fancy titles just yet. Whether it is entry-level or higher, use your position as an inside-view of the inner workings of events.For instance, if you are interested in promoting Dating Nights, seek out employment with caterers, bartenders, DJs, venues, or any other company that is frequently hired by one or more promoters for such events.

, Once hired, focus on your specific job to the extent of performing it successfully and earning a reputation as a reliable worker. But keep your eyes and ears open to every other aspect of the event, regardless of how far removed it is from your personal duties. Before you branch out and become personally responsible for promoting events, use this opportunity to witness how events succeed, how they fail, and how they overcome snafus.For example, say that a catering company has hired you to wait tables at a Dating Night. On the day of the event, the various people hired (the DJ, the bartenders, the decorators, and your boss, the caterer) realize that the promoter has booked a venue that is too old to adequately provide enough electricity for everyone’s equipment. Even though you are only a waiter at the moment, note what solutions you and others may come up with to resolve this on the spot, as well as what could have been done beforehand to prevent this crisis.

, Whether you started out as an entry-level position for a caterer, music hall, or promotion company, start moving upwards. Seek managerial positions or any others that require leadership and competent handling of multiple responsibilities. Since an event promoter may be responsible for hiring and overseeing multiple people for any one event, gain the experience and confidence required to do just that within your current company. Apply for positions that will help you develop the following skills:Strong communication, both written and verbal, plus negotiation skills.
The ability to effectively organize resources, finances, and time.
Creative problem-solving.

, Seize every opportunity to meet others who work in the same industry in some capacity. Make contacts now to carry with you once you branch out on your own.Ask for phone numbers, emails, or social media info of people who have proven themselves to be reliable so you can reach out to them when you are ready to hire people yourself.


Remember that your own job performance will be remembered by these same people. Whether you are a bottom-rung employee with less than glamorous duties or a team leader juggling multiple responsibilities, be sure to excel at them to cement your reputation as someone who gets things done.

Choose a target market.,
Find a venue.,
Pick a date.,
Secure Entertainment.,
Hire people.,
Advertise the event.,
Collect your cash.",How to Be a Nightclub Promoter," A promoter needs to know their target market. Plan your event around the type of people you want to show up, and keep them in mind throughout the whole process. It might sound obvious but many inexperienced promoters try to appeal to all ages and demographics, the trick is to be as selective as possible. There are many great books available on Amazon or iTunes that explain these concepts even further so you don't make rookie mistakes. Promoting bars and clubs is a much more intricate concept than it first seems, but it is also quite interesting so this should ultimately be your first step. This article can only provide a brief overview, but if you think this is something you will actually pursue, make sure you educate yourself adequately.;
, Call up bars, nightclubs, lounges, or even art galleries to ask if they would be interested in hosting your event. If you're a new promoter, you are really going to have to sell your ability to get people through the doors. However, you would be wise not to choose just any venue, most venues already have an established reputation, you would be wise to conform to these existing perceptions because once the mind is made up, there is no changing it.

, Do some research to make sure there won't be too many competing parties the same night as yours. Picking a bad date for your event can ruin the best laid plans of any promoter. The more time you give yourself and the more notice you provide your guests, the higher your chances of a successful launch.

, This can be nightclub DJs, a band, etc. Make sure to choose entertainment that fits with your target market.

, Some key people you may want to hire for the party include a door person to collect money & email addresses, and a photographer to capture the event.

, This is where the majority of a promoter's work comes in. You'll need to have professional flyers made up, send out emails, call everyone you know, and send out press releases to local media like newspapers, nightlife magazines, forums, and internet blogs.

, Club usually get paid per person they get to the party. This amount is worked out between you and the venue, sometimes it is a percentage of the door cover charge, sometimes it's the whole thing. You can make a large amount of money in a short time as a promoter, if your parties are successful.

Consider the dietary restrictions of your guests and centenarian.,
Plan activities for guests of all ages.",How to Celebrate a 100th Birthday3," A one hundredth birthday is a momentous occasion. While it is tempting to surprise the centenarian with a wonderful party, the guest of honor more than likely has a vision for his or her celebration of life. Ask the guest of honor to describe their ideal celebration and do your best to honor their wishes. During your meeting, consider asking the following questions:


Do they want a party?
Do they want a small gathering or a large party?
Where would they like to hold the event?
Should you only invite family members or extend invitations to friends and acquaintances?
What would they like to do at the party?
Would they prefer cards or donations to a favorite charity over gifts?, Every detail of the party should accommodate the guest of honor’s personal needs and desires, including the event’s time and duration. The event should begin at a time when the centenarian is at his or her best. If this is in the morning, plan a birthday brunch; if this is in the evening, host a dessert soiree. Ideally, the celebration should only last as long as the centenarian can stay at the party—if they have to leave sooner than expected on the day of, don’t panic.


Don’t schedule the party during the guest of honor’s normal rest time.
Plan the event around their schedule, not your schedule., One-hundredth birthday celebrations draw guests of all ages. This means you are responsible for feeding guests as young as 1 and as old as 100. When you plan the menu, account for the ages and dietary limitations of your guest.


Offer your guests a wide variety of food options.

Research the cost of throwing events.,
Hire a lawyer.,
Register your business.",How to Become an Event Promoter2," As a promoter, you may be responsible for financing events yourself,so find out how large of a budget you will need. Form a list of all vendors, venues, and other service providers you will need to hire for each event. Create three hypothetical events differing in size (small, medium, large) and then contact each company on your list to ask for quotes for each size. Determine which events you can afford on your own and which will require additional investors.


For example, with concert promotion, you will at the very least need to pay the talent, book a venue (which may or may not provide its own sound system), and advertise the show. If you are promoting a small “underground” show featuring unknown local acts, you can book a stage at a small club or bar, rent a sound system if needed, and rely on flyers and word-of-mouth for advertising. But for more prominent acts, you may also need to hire security, cover transportation and room accommodations for the talent, book larger, more expensive venues, and much more.To play it safe, always plan on spending more than the quotes given in order to protect your personal profit in case unexpected costs pop up along the way., Although having a lawyer on retainer is not strictly necessary to start a career, consulting one in the beginning will help protect you from future costs due to unseen legal entanglements. At the very least, discuss local, county, state, and federal laws and regulations that bear directly on the sort of events you plan, such as any licenses or business registrations that might be required on your part. Also familiarize yourself with what constitutes a legal contract in order to avoid future liabilities.If you plan on regularly employing a lawyer, be sure to factor this cost into your overhead.

, Local laws may determine exactly what classification your business will belong to.Whether you are the sole owner or partner with someone else may also effect which business entity you choose.Consult with your lawyer or use the internet to conduct research on which business entity is right for you. Classifications include:


Sole proprietorship
Partnership
Corporation
Limited liability company (LLC)

Advertise!,
Know your demographics.,
Network your heart out.,
Build a solid reputation.",How to Become an Event Promoter3," Unlike event planners, who charge clients for expenses plus fees to cover their profit margin, event promoters often rely on attendance and ticket sales to recuperate expenses and earn pay for all of their effort.So make sure people attend your event! Depending on your operating budget, do as much as possible to get the word out. Methods include:The internet, especially through social media
Advertising in print (newspapers, magazines, etc.)
Flyers and posters
Radio and television ads

, Aim your advertising efforts at the appropriate audience. Don’t waste precious time and funds by, say, promoting a country-and-western act on a radio station that primarily plays R&B! At the same time, don’t limit yourself to the obvious. Know which demographics overlap so you can spread the word across the widest possible spectrum of interrelated interests, even through forums that, at first glance, seem to have little in common with the event itself. For example:Say you are promoting a concert featuring all-female punk bands. Use obvious methods to advertise it, like radio ads on stations that play punk music and flyers and posters at bars and venues that host punk shows, as well as record stores. In addition to that, though, think outside the box. Drop off flyers at tattoo parlors and vintage clothing stores. Blanket local colleges and skate parks with the same. Advertise through magazines and websites dedicated to feminism.

, Seize every opportunity to make contacts. Whether you meet someone on a professional basis or in passing, think of them as an extra mouth that could potentially get the word out. Always have business cards handy to pass along, and ask for their contact information in return. Keep your initial meeting light and friendly with a simple hello and introduction to avoid coming on too strongly. Then follow up with a more detailed email of how you hope to foster a working relationship later on.Say you promote sports events, like boxing. Although a bar owner or bartender may have little if anything to do with the world of boxing, they can be a valuable asset in terms of advertising if the bar in question happens to be a sports bar!

, Promoting events is a risky business, and events may fail due to any number of reasons, some of which may have been preventable with better planning, while others, like the weather, are beyond your control. Should you face setbacks and disasters, be professional, regardless of the circumstances. Earn the trust and respect of talent, vendors, and other business contacts so they remain willing and excited to work with you in the future.Your own success depends on them, so present yourself as someone who is not only competent and driven, but responsible enough to accept blame when it is due.


For example, say that, as a concert promoter, you have hired a sound-system technician who turns out to be utterly inept at their job. Even though handling the sound system was not your specific job, hiring a competent technician was. Assure the talent, venue, and anyone else involved with the show that you will certainly never hire the same technician again, but stop short of dumping all the blame on that person. Doing so may create the impression that you are more worried about appearing faultless than actually getting the job done.

Imagine being served a bowl of plain oatmeal or a dish of pasta without any sauce. Even if the oatmeal or pasta has been dressed with flavorful ingredients like butter and spices, it looks like a plain dish of starch. Serve the same bowl of oatmeal with fresh red berries and a swirl of amber maple syrup, or plate the pasta with a healthy drizzle of green pesto and chopped cherry tomatoes, and you've created a wholly different dining experience. No matter what you're serving, think of ways to add more color contrast.When you're planning meals, think ahead about the colors you want to feature on the plate. You might not be able to represent all the colors of the rainbow at every meal, but challenge yourself to have as much color as possible.
If you realize you're about to serve several like-colored foods, like grilled chicken and mashed potatoes, adding a serving or two of fruits and vegetables is a fantastic and easy way to add pops of color. The richest greens, oranges, reds, purples, blues, pinks and yellows on your plate probably take the form of fruits and vegetables.
If you're not sure how to add color, utilize garnishes. Nearly any savory dish is well-served by a sprinkling of fresh chives, parsley, dill, or mint. Lemon and lime wedges are welcome alongside poultry and seafood dishes.;
, The way you cook your vegetables has a lot of bearing on the overall visual effect of a meal. Veggies that are a tad overcooked lose their color and tend to look less appetizing than those that are cooked just to the point of softness. To avoid mushy, pallid vegetables, aim to cook them until they're bright with a bit of crunch. Here are a few ways to bring out the best in your vegetables:


Lightly steam them instead of boiling them. Steaming vegetables makes them look appetizing and flavorful, while boiling creates the opposite effect. Take broccoli, for instance: steaming broccoli turns it a fresh, bright green, and each floret retains its shape and texture. Boiling broccoli results in a mushy texture and a paler color, which isn't as pretty on the plate. The same holds true for asparagus, carrots, green beans, and many other vegetables.
Roast or sauté them with a little oil or butter. Roasted or sauteed vegetables look quite appetizing when they're allowed to caramelize a little in oil or butter. The bright orange or green of the vegetable is offset by brown, crispy spots. It's a delicious way to cook vegetables.

, Many meat dishes look most appetizing when the meat has been seared. The sight of a steak or piece of grilled salmon with a brown, crispy sear will make your dinner guests' mouths start to water. In addition to searing your meat, you should let it rest for several minutes before cutting it. This allows the juices to absorb back into the meat, so that they don't end up running all over the plate.


There are exceptions to the rule of searing your meat. For example, if you're serving braised beef, you'll have to think of creative ways to make the meat look appetizing even though it doesn't have a crispy crust. Serving it with a sauce is a good way to add visual interest.

, Underdone or overcooked fried foods are difficult to present in an appealing way. Fried foods can look beautiful on a plate, but it's important to fry them well and have a plan for dealing with the oil so it doesn't muck up the rest of the dish. Cook fried foods until they're golden brown, then let them drain on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the extra oil. Otherwise, the food will leave streaks of grease on the plates.


Fried foods often continue browning a bit after they've been removed from the hot oil. Carefully monitor foods as you're frying them to make sure they don't get too dark.
Take pains to handle the fried foods gently so they look appetizing when you're ready to plate them. For example, if you need to check whether a piece of fried chicken has reached the correct internal temperature, stick the meat thermometer in a place where the resulting hole won't be visible.

, Texture and color go hand in hand when it comes to how appetizing food looks on the plate. If your food looks too oily, too dry, mushy, tough, or otherwise difficult to chew and swallow, it won't matter how perfectly colorful it looks. Take pains to cook food well so that it comes out to the right texture.


The way you handle the food just after it has been cooked, and before it is plated, can really affect the texture. Pasta, for example, should be kept in water or tossed in a bit of oil just after cooking so that it doesn't start to clump. Fried foods should not be covered with airtight lids, because the heat from the food will end up steaming the breading and causing the food to get soggy.
Once the food is on the plate, a spritz of oil or water can improve its visual appeal if it looks too dry.

, For example, cutting your vegetables into interesting shapes can make the simple become special. An ice cream scoop can be employed to make domes of rice or mashed potatoes. You can cook and serve vegetables, desserts, pot pies and other foods inside unique-shaped dishes to create attractive shapes.

, White plates don't compete visually with the food you're serving. They provide contrast, making colors appear brighter and textures more interesting. For this reason, white dishes are the standard choice for chefs in restaurants all over the world. The shape of the plate doesn't matter as much as its color.That said, there are exceptions. If you have a set of special plates with a pattern or a certain color scheme, it's fine to use them. Just make sure they complement the food you're serving instead of vying for attention.
Don't forget to take the rest of the table into consideration, too. Cutlery, glasses and linens will enhance the overall appearance of the dish upon the table.
When looking for interesting tableware, try going to Asian grocery stores, craft or flea markets, and antique stores. You can find some very interesting tableware from all of these sources.

, Consider how to present the main portion in relation to the side dishes. Be it a slice of pie, meat, a flan or anything else, consider where it will look best on the plate with the other elements of the dish. Consider also how get best impact––the appearance and symmetry are all affected by whether the food is sliced thinly, thickly or left whole. You'll soon get the idea of what works, and there's never any harm borrowing ideas from your favorite restaurants.

, Only fill about two thirds of each plate with food. The rest of the plate should be left empty. The negative space will provide contrast with the food, making it look more appetizing. If the plate is loaded with food, the food itself won't look as visually pleasing. Keep standard serving sizes in mind and aim to serve just the right amount of each part of the dish.


As a general rule, half of the food on the plate should be comprised of vegetables, one fourth should be comprised of meat or another protein, and one fourth should be comprised of a starch.
Start plating food in the center of the dish and work outward from there, so that the food is centered in the middle of the plate.

, Having an odd number of elements on a dish is more visually appealing than having an even number. It creates the impression that piece of food is being framed by the others. Keep this in mind whether you're serving different types of food or more than one piece of the same food. For example, if you're serving scallops, serve either 3 or 5 instead of 4.

, Creating a texture contrast is a good way to draw the eye. Too many soft or crunchy foods on a plate is unappealing, but a combination of both is delicious. For example, an appetizing plate might include shallow pool of silky mushroom risotto topped with a piece of seared salmon and a scatter of crunchy scallions. The three different textures harmonize to create a pleasing dining experience. Leaving one of the elements out would result in a less appealing dish.


To quickly add some crunch to a dish, try topping it with some crushed, roasted walnuts, almonds or pepitas.
A dollop of crème fraiche or some pieces of goat cheese can add a soft, creamy texture to savory dishes. Whipped cream or pastry cream is a good way to add a soft element to sweet dishes.

, It's common to see food layering in restaurants, but home cooks don't usually try it. Adding height to a dish can take it from ordinary to stunning. Don't be afraid to show off your culinary skills by using stacking and layering methods to make your presentation more professional.


An easy way to start layering food is to serve the protein on a bed of starch. For example, serve a kabob on a heaping of rice, or serve grilled swordfish on a pile of mashed potatoes.
You can use sauces to layer as well. Ladle a pool of au jus, marinara or whatever sauce you're using into the center of the dish, and arrange the other elements of the dish on top.
Aim to make foods look bigger, not smaller. Fluff up your salads, for example, instead of smoothing them down. Create a little cross-hatched stack of cooked asparagus instead of presenting it in one flat layer., If you're serving a curry, stew or soupy casserole, you might want to drain the food of its sauce before serving, then pour on just the right amount when you plate the dish. That way you can control the amount of sauce and use it to make the dish look decorative. A soupy dish on a flat plate looks messy unless it is reined in with something such as rice, pasta or potato, or served in a suitable bowl or deep dish.

, Remember that styles change even within the space of a few years or even months, so keep up-to-date by checking out cooking magazines, cooking or foodie websites and cooking shows for current ideas. Complex garnishes have had their time in the spotlight, and towers or stacks of foods were all the vogue at one point, too. However, tricky, hard-to-pull off trends tend to fade eventually, while the classic tenets of plating food so that it looks fresh, appetizing and delicious never go out of style.

, Think beyond the standard garnishes, like the classic dry, rough parsley bit served next to a dish of scrambled eggs. Maybe it adds a hint of green, but does it really enhance the dish? Instead, make a little chive bouquet or add a sprinkling of fresh dill to the dish. No matter what you're serving, make sure the garnish actually makes the dish better instead of just cluttering up the plate.If you serve a dish with lemon or lime wedges, consider creating slender, pretty twists instead of slicing them into thick wedges. This might entice the diner to actually use the garnish instead of scooting it to the side of his or her plate!
Think outside the box and use garnishes you might not normally consider. Sprinkle a dash of cinnamon over a chicken dish, or a handful of pomegranate seeds over an otherwise ordinary salad. Choose garnishes that add a burst of both flavor and color.
In many cuisines, flowers are an acceptable garnish or a large inedible leaf sitting underneath the food. In broader Western culture, it's recommended that nothing inedible be served on the plate. As well, since certain garnishes can affect the flavor, choose carefully.

, Another way to finish food is with a drizzle or swirl of a concentrated sauce or liquid. For savory dishes, this might be a small squeeze of remoulade, pesto, or flavored oil. For sweet dishes, adding chocolate sauce, fruit jam, or crème anglaise might be the most delicious way to add that finishing touch.


Rather than just pouring a sauce over your food, consider putting it in a squeeze bottle so you can create a pretty swirl or pattern. If you don't have a squeeze bottle, put the sauce in a plastic food storage bag, cut a small piece off one of the corners, and squeeze the sauce through the bag.
Don't overdo it. The key is to add a touch of color, flavor and texture without overpowering the main part of the dish.

, After going to the trouble to present your food beautifully, make sure you don't serve it on a dirty plate. Examine the edges of the plate for fingerprints and smudges. A great way to clean up the edges of a plate is to dip a paper towel in a cup of water with a dash of white vinegar. Wipe the rim of the plate so that no food residue or prints are visible. This gives your presentation a professional touch.

, It's one of the trickier dishes to present in an appetizing way. Make sure the pasta stays moist after you cook it, so that it doesn't get clumpy. Use a pair of tongs to lift several strands of pasta from the pot and lay them on a plate in an attractive curl. Do the same with another set of pasta strands, and continue until you have a serving size worth of pasta curls on the plate. Carefully top the pasta with a portion of sauce so that it pools in the center of the pasta - don't drench it.


If you're serving the pasta with a protein, arrange it attractively on the heap of pasta. For example, if the dish includes shrimp, place the shrimp on top instead of burying the pieces inside the pasta heap.
Just before serving, you can mist the pasta with a bit of olive oil to make it glisten attractively.

, Cream of mushroom soup or vegetable stew might taste delicious, but it tends to look boringly neutral in a bowl or on a plate. How do you make something tan or brown in color stand out? Adding a garnish is key. Depending on the flavor profile of the soup or stew, consider adding chopped thyme, fried pieces of sage, minced chives, or another green herb to freshen it up.


Soups and stews tend to splash and run, so it's also important to make sure that the sides of the bowl or plate you're serving them in are wiped clean before serving.
Casseroles might also come out on the brown side. Serving them alongside a bunch of fresh salad greens is a good way to offset the neutral-looking main dish.

, Maybe you made your grandma's famous brownie recipe, and you want to elevate the dish so that it looks less . . . brown. Baked desserts like brownies, cobblers and everyday cakes might need a little boost to look as good as they taste. Try one of these tricks:


Use a cookie cutter to create a neat shape. A star or leaf-shaped brownie will look more interesting than your basic square.
Serve it with mint. Adding a few fresh sprigs is a great way to enhance many desserts, especially fruity ones.
Sprinkle cocoa, cinnamon or powdered sugar on top. Choose the powder that contrasts in color to the dessert you made.
Sprinkle crushed peppermints on top. It'll look like you topped your dish with pink glitter.
Speaking of glitter, add edible glitter to the dish to take it over the top.
When all else fails, plate it with a swirl of whipped cream. You can pipe it through an icing bag fixed with a star-shaped tip to create a visually pleasing shape.

If you can't find any, draw a LEGO brick design using a computer aided drawing program, color in a typical LEGO brick color and print off as many copies as needed.


Unless you're okay about kids coming along too, make no bones about the fact that this is not a party for kids. If you do have the party with kids too, you'll need to organize a separate entertainment corner or room in your house, along with a babysitter to keep a watchful eye on them.
Schedule the party in the evening (after the kids have gone to bed). Make it clear whether guests should leave the kids at home (explain that it's LEGO for ""adults only"").
As part of the invitation wording, suggest that adults bring their sense of wonder and adventure––it’s a night in which adults can play like kids again.
Include a fun (and cheap) package of LEGO bricks or a kit with your invitations. Many dollar stores have small kits, so if you're limiting your invites to 20 to 30 guests (or less), include a cute Lego kit along with the invite as an attention grabber. Or add a mini-figure to the invitation.;
, Here you can let your imagination run wild as there are so many possibilities. However, to help inspire you, here are a few ideas:


Use red, yellow and blue for the main color theme, as these are the principal LEGO brick colors that everyone knows best.
Hang streamers in red, yellow and blue from the ceiling and from tables to give a colorful effect. Also hang balloons up in the same colors.
Raid your kid's Lego supplies and use these to adapt as decorations. Place a display LEGO construction on a sideboard, hang mini-figures from balloons and if you have a moving LEGO item, such as a train or car, set it to go around its track during the party.
Print out LEGO brick pictures for the walls and stick them everywhere.
Stick LEGO stickers on a tablecloth where buffet food is kept.
LEGO posters can be hung up, if you have any.

, No sippy cups here––this party's LEGO drinks need to have a bite and kick to them. Choose a brightly colored drink, similar to the colors used in Lego and add Lego style ice cubes.


Create a LEGO “Jolly Rancher” adult beverage. Definitely not for kids, but inspired by your favorite candy, create a vibrantly colored Jolly Rancher vodka drink. Both Jolly Ranchers and LEGOs have that bright, fun color so make several drinks using a variety of colors and flavors. To make this drink:

A few days before your party combine vodka with actual Jolly Rancher candy. Mix 1.75 liters (0.5 US gal) of vodka with approximately 12 Jolly Rancher candies (choose one flavor per bottle).
Place the 12 unwrapped Jolly Ranchers at the bottom of each bottle and then fill the bottle with vodka––no mixing or shaking. The candy does the work for you.
Make as many 1.75 liter (0.5 US gal) bottles as you want––the entire rainbow could be fun!
Freeze the Jolly Rancher bottles before the party. Mix drinks to order with club soda, triple sec, Chambord or a variety of flavored liquors. Experiment in order to create your own signature LEGO drink.


Other drink ideas include cocktails that end up being blue, red or yellow, like the primary Lego bricks and you might even make jello shots which contain all three colors in layers.

, Purchase a LEGO inspired ice brick tray or make your own “bricks.” The LEGO brick tray can be purchased online or from LEGO® stores, or you can use your child’s LEGO bricks instead but be sure that they're well cleaned. To use them:


Spray large LEGO brick pieces with nonstick spray and fill the inside with water.
Freeze LEGO bricks and then carefully tap the plastic LEGO bricks until the ice is removed.
Make several batches before your party so you have plenty of LEGO ice for drinks.

, Of course, the traditional waffle broken into pieces would make for the perfect Lego food, however move beyond the predictable and give your LEGO party an adult flair with some of these food craft ideas:


Use a serrated knife to cut raw vegetables. Give the carrots, radishes, tomatoes and cucumbers a LEGO look by cutting up strips or blocks using a serrated knife. Partner with a little of your special guacamole or hummus dip and you have a healthy appetizer. For detailed instructions on turning vegetables and fruit into LEGO bricks, see How to make vegetable Lego bricks; this will really wow your guests but be sure to give yourself plenty of time to make them as they're fiddly.
Build-a-sandwich. Apply the Lego concept to your food and let your guests build his or her own sandwich. Lay out all the fixings preferably from clean LEGO containers if possible) and let your guests determine how big (or how small) their sandwich. As an alternative you can do build-a-pizza, build-a-taco or build-a-salad or pasta. If you can't find LEGO containers, display food items in colorful platters and bowls to reinforce the Lego theme.

, Bake some goodies in the shapes of LEGO bricks. For example, try creating a simple LEGO building block cake using a standard cake mix, colorful frosting and marshmallows:


Combine the cake mix ingredients according to the package directions.
Pour the cake batter into a greased and/or floured cupcake or sheet cake pan.
Bake as directed and then allow to cool.
Using a serrated knife, carefully slice along the top to create a flat surface. Whether you're using cupcakes or a full cake, slice cake into rectangular shapes.
Cut two marshmallows in half and apply each half to the cake to create a square.
Use frosting to hold marshmallows in place. Frost liberally using store bought frosting, tinted with bright food coloring.

, Beyond the typical LEGO games your child plays, these LEGO games will be even more fun after a few apps and cocktails.


Who am I? Break your group up into teams and supply each team a pile of Lego items that include pieces to make cars, trucks and people. Have everyone at the party write down a name of a person, place or thing on a small slip of paper (tell them not to show anyone else). Ask each guest to fold his or her slip of paper and place it in a hat. Mix the slips of paper and ask one member from each team to randomly select one slip of paper. Tell the team member not to show the paper to his or her teammate. Set the kitchen timer for 10 minutes and tell the team member who chose the slip of paper to build whatever was on that slip of paper. It’s up to his or her teammate to guess what he or she is building based on his or her teammate’s creation––the first team to correctly guess the right answer wins that round.
Building blind. Just for fun, blindfold your guests and ask them to build a Lego sculpture using a pile of LEGO bricks in front of them. There’s no objective or goal––it's just fun to see which sculpture turns out the best or funniest.
LEGO building contest. If your group is particularly competitive, purchase small, inexpensive LEGO sets and have a LEGO building contest. The object of the game is to build the structure the fastest with all pieces intact. Divide the pieces into separate piles on a table or on the floor and have guests line up next to each other. If you have a larger group and more complex building projects, divide guests into teams and set the timer for some challenging cooperative fun.
Play LEGO toss. Set a range of trash cans or cups (depending on how hard you want to make it) in a row and have teams toss LEGO pieces in. The team that gets the most pieces in wins (you can set a time limit or a piece limit).
Buy one of the many LEGO games available in stores. Divide into teams and play the games for prizes, either following the rules provided or making up the rules for the party.

Use a website like daysoftheyear.com to find unconventional National celebrations that you can join or introduce into your community.;
, Celebrations are generally considered public, although you can celebrate quietly and personally if you desire.

, Decide if your pool of other celebrants is online, in the workplace or amongst friends and family. Decide if it will be personal, citywide, statewide, national or international.

, For example, a religious holiday may not be appropriate in a government office where church and state should be separated. A bachelorette party may not be appropriate in an environment where there are a lot of children.

, If the celebration isn’t on the same date every year, pick any date that is convenient for you and your celebrants. Choose a weekend date if the people you want to invite usually work during the week.

, It can be all-day or during a set time period. Avoid conflicting work schedules by scheduling a large event in the evening if it is held on a weekday.

, The occasion will dictate how early you need to start, but, generally, the more people who are involved, the sooner you should start. For large occasions like weddings, family reunions or big parties, start six months to a year ahead of time.

, Ask the hosts what capacity they can hold and plan accordingly. If you choose to celebrate at home or in the office, set some furniture aside to make way for mingling. A venue may or may not require payment.

, Unless the celebration precludes food in some way, people love to celebrate with food and drink. If you don’t want to provide all the food yourself, consider making it “potluck,” where everyone brings something.


Consider having a food theme. For example, if you want to celebrate French Bastille Day, serve baguettes, Brie and other French food.
Decide if you will serve alcohol. If you are weary of providing an environment where people can drink, make plans to have designated drivers, a shuttle or cabs.
Always include non-alcoholic options and water at a celebration.

, Decide the best colors to convey the occasion and make or buy decorations. Hang signs that announce the celebration.

, They can be as simple as name tags and flags or as elaborate as food and gifts. If you aren’t sure what to make, set up a craft station where guests can make something for themselves, or decorate a sign.

, If possible, ask people to sing, dance or recite poetry.

, If you don’t want to go to the expense of sending it in the mail, send an email, evite or Facebook invitation months in advance.

,, If you send an invitation by mail, include a return card for RSVPs. If you send the invitation by Facebook or email, include a virtual RSVP option.

, People who are passionate about the celebration may want to help and provide food, drink or favors.

, This is especially important with regional or national holidays and charity awareness events. Grassroots, word of mouth campaigning can be very effective.

, If this will be an annual celebration, consider making a website or starting a Facebook page, so that people can be part of a forum about the event.

, If this is a truly public event, you will want to get out amongst the public and invite people to join.

Make sure you have a plan for what to do with the leftovers.,
Broaden your impact.",How to Start a Local Really Really Free Market," Many of the best spaces for holding a market must be rented. While it doesn’t make sense to pay to hold a free event, it probably won’t do to hold your ’Free Market in somebody’s backyard, either. However, if you look around at all the potential options, it might just be possible to find a spot that you can hold the market for free. Talk to your local municipality or council about using public land, emphasizing that your ""event"" won't return any profit and is free for all comers. Perhaps a local farmer is happy to have you use a field or perhaps there is a free yard somewhere that someone is perfectly happy for you to use. It's worth asking before giving up on the ""free"" aspect.


Your ’Free Market should take place on neutral ground – that is, in an area everyone feels an equal claim to or ownership of, so that no one will feel more or less comfortable than anyone else.
For similar reasons, your location should be a central, visible area. If you can use a space where major public events happen or where a wide range of people are already accustomed to gathering, it will dramatically increase your chances of success.
While public space or commons is ideal, you'll still need to check the existing regulations about use of such spaces to avoid breaching any rules or regulations in place about the use of such spaces. A little hassle in the way of form signing and permit gaining may well be worth the effort and conformity to reclaim public space for a good purpose.
An empty car dealership is great for this, and you can pitch showcasing the property to the owner; expect a list of conditions, however, and don't mess them up.;
, It's important to get the word out so that as many people as possible come along and join in. You can advertise successfully by posting fliers, sending out emails to every listserv you can possibly think of, taking handbills around and give them out at bus stops, public events, in neighborhoods and apartment complexes, etc. And don't forget to use Facebook and Twitter as good ways to advertise to people who are likely to be interested. Also see if local radio stations will run Public Service Announcements for you, or if local papers can run a listing or even a story on your event. If you're willing to give an interview, a local journalist might find your market an event worth covering for the local paper.


Solicit participants person by person and preferably in person. As a rule of thumb, one personal invitation is worth a hundred fliers.
Invite an accomplished storyteller, a hairstylist, a popular folk musician, a collective of spoken word artists, a specialist in therapeutic massage, a portrait painter, a bicycle mechanic, an automobile mechanic, and everyone else can you think of or run into. Offer to help provide whatever resources they need. Having such people at the 'Free Market will attract many interested participants.

, The more items that you bring to the ’Free Market yourself, the more excited others will be about the event, and the more they will expect from themselves as participants. Some of the things you could do include:


Go through your own closets, attics, basements and storage places and encourage everyone you know to do the same. Here is an ideal opportunity to declutter all the hoarded items!
While you could dumpster bread and vegetables, see if it is possible that employees might be able to give you stock that would have been thrown out anyway. Just be careful about the safety of food that hasn't been refrigerated or has been inadequately wrapped; don't use anything that could endanger people's health.
Visit colleges at the end of each semester, corporations that are going out of business, and wealthy neighborhoods where they leave perfectly good items sitting out on the curb. Check out businesses, schools and other places that are undergoing renovations as they may be updating their existing furniture and fixtures, and you might be able to get some of the old stuff for free. There is a huge dump of gear in many resort areas, after the season winds down, and the workers start leaving-the common areas get stuffed with it.
Get all your friends together the night before to cook a nutritious meal for one another and to also bake a few hundred delicious cookies, muffins and cakes to give away the next day. Make this into a festive occasion so that everyone has fun as they cook and bake, as well as providing a meal that night.

, A good ’Free Market is about people interacting with each other, not just taking and leaving things. Organise games, musical improvisations, and other participatory activities that can incorporate chance passers-by. Set up displays and dioramas for the shy but inquisitive.


Be sure to have some children's games organised to give parents a chance to involve their children in the event. Have someone supervise the games to allow parents time to wander around the 'Free Market.
Try to make games using some of the free goods you've collected; recycling creativity will entertain everyone!
Making things such as recycled crafts is an activity that can enthuse those attending the 'Free Market. This can be a great way to get people to gather around a table together for chatting as they make items. Allow them to take home whatever they've created but be sure to take photos for a Facebook or similar photo gallery (give each participant the URL to the photos so that they can check out everyone's creations).

Coordinate with other groups to broaden the scope of your ’Free Market. A dance troupe is coming to your town for the weekend; can they put in an appearance? How about a barbershop quartet, a team of champion skateboarders, a holistic health care provider, a symphony orchestra? You’re not just keeping old clothes and stale bagels in circulation, you’re introducing an entirely different economic system that can provide as much diversity as capitalism, if not more! Make sure that this philosophy comes across in what you do and offer at every ’Free Market.







, Even though your 'Free Market is about free items, there will probably be things leftover as there won't always be the right person interested in taking each freely available item. Obviously, don't discard of the objects you're left with; instead, donate them or find some other good use for them. The local thrift shop or volunteer organization may be thrilled to get a big shipment in from you but be sure to check first. If nobody wants your remaining items at the time, you’ll have to either have a place to store it all for the next ’Free Market or consider taking it to a recycling depot.


At the end of the day, be sure to clean up the site of your ’Free Market meticulously; you’ll benefit from having a reputation for being responsible in this regard and you'll be able to hold it again.

, Once your ’Free Markets have taken off, you can move on to other Really Really Free programs: free movie showings and other entertainment events, free education projects, free housing occupations! The sky’s the limit once people have a taste of real freedom and realize that they can make great things happen.

Make sure that there is sufficient and necessary supplies for the visitors such as food, drinks etc.,
Arrange the sofas, armchairs or chairs in comfy positions.,
Clean your house.,
Be prepared for weather changes.,
Decorate your house lightly.",How to Arrange Your House if Visitors Are Coming1," If your visitors might consider using your bathroom or lavatory, some fresh towels and a plentiful supply of toilet tissue would be appreciated.

Do some shopping to get extra groceries, cutlery, napkins etc and if necessary some extra chairs.



 

;
, A position where everyone will be facing each other and at the same time the TV, if any. Many people have visitors come into their home for a specific activity, such as a book meeting, a meal, to discuss family business, etc, if television is not part of the planned active of your visitors, don't make it the focal point if your entertaining space. If you have invited a lot of visitors, get more armchairs, sofas or chairs and arrange them properly so that you need not panic at the sight of too many visitors at the last moment.

, Take your cleaning supplies, use them and clear out unwanted mess.


Dust the furniture. Sweep all the corners, nooks and crannies of the house. Go a step further and use a vacuum cleaner if you have ones and flooring than be cleaned using one. Mop the floors of your house that can be mopped well and ensure you do so hours before the visitors arrive so that dirt does not accumulate before they arrived and it shall still look clean. Wash out carpets, curtains, mats, cushion covers, table clothes etc and dry them well. Be sure to leave enough time for carpets you was to dry. This can take several hours.
Arrange all the books neatly in the bookshelf according to each category like fiction, non-fiction etc so that your visitors can have access to the books whenever they wish if reading is likely to happen. If your visitors have come round to discuss great Aunt Violet's funeral, there's not likely to be much reading going on.

, There may be lot of changes in the plans of arrangement according to the weather

If there's cold weather, get some fire logs and arrange the fireplace neatly. Get warm blankets and spread them on the sofas and armchairs(optional). If there is a heater in the room, switch it on half an hour before so that the cold visitors come to a warm and cozy home. You may like to put your central heating on throughout your home.






If its a hot weather, switch on the ACs and fans to keep the room cool. Remove any blankets or too warm cushions from the sofas. Just add one or too cushions for each sofa. Keep a bowl of mint chocolates for the visitors to suck on if they feel too hot, mint chocolates are considered to be extraordinarily cooling by some. Provide a bowl for your visitors to spot the mint chocolates out into when they're done sucking on them.







, Don't use heavy wall paper, dense fabric wall hangings and imposing pictures. Add a flower vase or two, keep your family photos on the shelves or on the tables neatly, change curtains(optional), drape the armchairs and sofas with a clean and attractively designed cloth so that if a child spills juice on the sofa mistakenly, the cloth will take the damage.(optional)."

Check with the management of your office and determine if any holiday festivities have been scheduled.,
Ask permission to schedule a potluck at the office and coordinate the best time and location to set up and have the meal.,
Pick a date and time.,
Ask the highest ranking manager to send an email to all employees asking them to save the date and time and inviting them to celebrate with co-workers.,
Post signs around the office with the date and time.,
Create a sign up sheet for people to commit to bringing certain items.

,
Tape the sign up sheet to someone's desk in a central location.,
Include another sheet with the details of the event and a separate sheet for a few volunteers to sign up.,
Include a deadline to sign up and remove the sheet at the deadline.,
Consider the following categories and layout to add to your sign up sheet(s).,
Remind everyone to bring the appropriate serving spoons to serve their dish.,
Tell them to drop off their dishes.,
Set up large garbage cans to collect dirty dishes and cups.,
Remind everyone to label their dishes, slow cookers or serving items.,
Make sure you have dish detergent at a sink where people may rinse off items before taking home.,
Encourage people to bring hot items in insulated carriers or to have someone warm the dish at home.,
Coordinate with your potluck volunteers so they arrive about an hour before mealtime and you can begin setting up prior to the designated mealtime.,
Coordinate with the manager a time for him/her to address the group.,
Allow those workers with limited time to eat to go first in line.,
Enjoy this opportunity to share great food and spend time with your co-workers.

,
Give everyone plenty of time to go through and eat.,
Remind everyone to claim their dishes and serving items.,
Wipe down the tables, move drinks and non-perishable items to the break room for people to enjoy later.",How to Plan a Holiday Potluck for Your Workplace," Even if an off-site holiday party is scheduled, an in-house potluck may allow more people to attend.;
,


Depending on when your offices are open, a lunchtime potluck meal may be the best time. More employees are typically in the office during the day.
Ask your manager if the company can cover the cost of the meat items, allowing employees to bring the fixings. If not, ask everyone to contribute a dollar or two in addition to their potluck contribution. Order the meats in advance from a restaurant, grocer, deli, etc.
Because of the cost involved and concerns about proper cooking, you may want to consider ordering hams or turkeys from a local restaurant, grocer or deli. You can pick them up before the meal and serve while it is still warm. The meats usually take the longest time and having them prepared by a professional is usually easiest. Consider ordering pre-cut turkey breasts and ham to offer a variety with easy serving.
Tofurky or other meat substitutes should also be available for any vegetarians or those with food ""issues"" who attend. Don't assume they'll be fine with the side dishes either. Vegetarian dishes are quick to prepare and are good menu items for vegetarian co-workers to sign up to bring. Add a ""meat substitute"" line to your sign up sheet if vegetarians are numerous in your workplace.

, Consider the demands of your industry. Retail businesses may need to schedule this when the location is less busy. Other offices may have many people taking their vacation the week of Christmas. Consider a time earlier in the month of December if your office tends to operate on a skeleton crew the week of Christmas.

, Reminder emails should be sent out weekly leading up to the date.


Send the initial email out as far in advance as possible. Two weeks in advance is adequate for smaller offices.
A message from the most senior manager is usually best and will probably result in a better turn out.
Managers can coordinate a system with their staffers to allow everyone a chance to get food and eat.

, Also instruct people to a specific location to sign up to bring certain dishes. Place the sign up sheet in a central location where people will see it every day.

,, You don't want the sign up mixed up or accidentally thrown away.

, Volunteers will be needed to set up the food, put ice in coolers, etc. For a larger workplace, you may want to have a sign up sheet for ""Set Up Volunteers"" and ""Clean Up Volunteers"".


Consider the size of your office when adding the numbered lines. If you only have 20 people in your office, you may want to only put a few lines under each food category.
By limiting the number of items under each category you can be sure you will have enough of the appropriate food items and not 5,000 paper plates and bags of ice but nothing to eat.

, This will encourage people to sign up the weeks before and not for something at 6pm the night before. One or two business days before is usually sufficient.

, Other items may be considered depending on what may be popular locally. Adjust for the size of your office. Have them write their name and what they are bringing. (Example: John Doe - Candied Yams)

, People bringing desserts should bring pie servers or a sharp knife. Let them know on the sign up sheet and through emails and memos to bring the appropriate serving spoons to go with their dish. People bringing canned foods (cranberry sauce) may need to bring a manual can opener if your office kitchen or break area doesn't have one.

, Include a notation on the sign up sheet asking everyone to bring their dishes to the area/room it will be served at least 30-45 minutes prior to the mealtime. Those with non-perishables can place them in the room as they arrive in the morning. This will get all the food and serving ware into the right room where the volunteers can set it up.


Also include a notation that everyone is responsible for collecting their dirty dishes following the potluck.

, This will prevent food dishes from being tossed into waste paper baskets that may not have liners. You may need to move the garbage cans from other parts of the building or coordinate with the cleaning service to have the large cans and heavy duty liners available.


If your office and staff is working to be more ""green"" you should request specific environmentally friendly plates, cups and cutlery be purchased. Make sure you have a separate recycling container next to the trash.
To stay super green, ask everyone to bring their own plates, cups and utensils from home.

, Keep a roll of masking tape in the drop off area in case someone forgets.

, If a sink is not available, people may want to bring a plastic bag to safely transport the dirty dishes back home for cleaning.

, Having everyone with hot dishes trying to warm food in the microwave could be problematic and delay the start time of your meal.


Electric griddles are an excellent way to keep items warm when you use them on the lowest setting, monitor often and stir as needed.
Some potluck recipes are excellent when served in a slow cooker. They are easy to transport and you can be plugged in when you arrive at the office so the food stays warm.
Have tables set up near plugs to keep slow cookers and other electric serving items can be plugged in.

,


Wipe off any tables that will be used for serving food.
Set the plates, cutlery and napkins at the beginning of the food line, place the meats next followed by the side dishes. Place drinks and desserts and the end of the table or set up another table for those items.
If the dish isn't obvious, the dish bringer should label the dish with the name of the food and note if there are nuts, or meats in it. Just ""Veggie casserole - has nuts"" or ""pasta salad - has become"" will do. The mention of nuts is especially important if someone in your office has a nut allergy. The mention of meat is nice for vegetarians, especially when a meat or broth may be mixed in and not obvious at first glance. Label the dish or tape the note to it. Taping the note to the table may not work since dishes may get moved around as people are serving themselves.

, This is usually best as people are gathering but before everyone has served themselves and is moving to find a seat. If you have someone who can say a few words giving thanks, coordinate with them before. They can be ready to make those remarks as the manager finishes.

, These may be co-workers who have duties that are being temporarily covered by someone else.

,, Encourage people to get seconds or save leftovers on plates for any shift workers that may not be awake to attend. Label these and put in the refrigerator. They'll love the thought.

, Hopefully, most people will come to collect those items and the volunteers won't be delivering bowls and platters to offices.

, Put any tables or chairs back in place. Make an announcement asking for any volunteers to help with clean up. With several people it can be done in a matter of minutes.

Pre-heat the oven to 400ºF (205ºC) or fire up the Grill.,
Carefully cut an X into the flat side of each nut with a sharp, pointy knife, cutting through the shell.,
Spread the nuts on a rimmed baking sheet for the oven or directly on the grill, cut side up.,
Roast for 15 to 20 minutes or until they're tender and the shell comes off easily.,
Wrap the hot chestnuts in a towel and squeeze them to crush the skins.,
Peel while nuts are warm.,
Enjoy!








",How to Roast Chestnuts," If you're going to use a campfire or a fireplace, get the fire established.







;
, This will allow steam to escape, otherwise the chestnuts can explode! Alternatively, you can stab them with a fork, making sure it goes through the shell.









, Sprinkle lightly with water. If roasting over an open flame, including a gas stove, put them in a pan with a long handle and cover.









Some people prefer to lay the chestnuts slit side down so that the shell is cooked, dried and separated from the nut for optimal crispiness.


, Move them around frequently so they don't burn.









, Leave them wrapped in the towel for five minutes afterwards.









, Remove the inner skin along with the shell. Reheat briefly if the nuts become hard to peel.

Know what you are going to prepare and how you are going to present it.,
Get the required spices, vegetables, sauces and other ingredients ready.,
Prepare your dishes two or three hours before the visitors arrive.,
Keep drinks ready.,
Serve desserts after the meal; these can include chocolate brownies and ice cream.",How to Arrange Your House if Visitors Are Coming2," Surf on the web and check different recipes that will please your visitors and satisfy them. Try them out and choose the recipe that you think is more appropriate. Serve snacks, a luncheon, an evening meal or a banquet, the choice is yours.

, Go shopping in a local store and get the best quality ingredients you can. Go to the farmer's market if you want. Go to the supermarket if you like.

Whether you purchase any food or drink you intend to serve has absolutely nothing to do with how you arrange your house if visitors are coming, obviously. If you are occupied with some other work, you can just order your supplies online and they will be at your doorstep in a matter of hours if such services are provided where you live.

, Don't be in a hurry and mix up all the ingredients; go slowly and normally. Prepare mouth-watering dishes like Roast chicken, chicken jalfrezi, if the dinner is non-vegetarian, or vegetarian lasagne, vegetarian pizza. Serve halal food or kosher food if required. Make sure you know about any of your visitor's dietary requirements


, Arrange the drinks according to the weather. Try using hot cocoa and any other hot drink during winter and cold juice or fruit squash during summer. Some visitors enjoy tea and coffee. Wine is commonly served in some households.

, You may serve rhubarb and custard if you wish or simply serve coffee and cake.

"
"
To ensure that your visitors don't feel bored, have a conversation on any topic.,
If there are any kids coming to visit too, arrange some toys or games or any thing that will prevent the child from feeling bored.",How to Arrange Your House if Visitors Are Coming3," Keeping them busy talking about something and joking doesn't permit them to feel bored. Switch on the TV and put some funny channels or any movie or anything worth watching and spending your time with them.

They may not have visited you for any particular reason and therefore be perfectly happy to watch TV. They may have travelled several house to visit you so be careful not to offend by preferring to watch TV than make your guests welcome and have polite, conversation about what is going on in your life












, Get games like Twister, specifically, it's an ideal game for when you are arranging tour house if visitors are coming, or must have something to had that keeps them busy and is fun.

Thank your guests for coming.",How to Be a Good Hostess," If you’re hosting a party for adults, then the #1 rule is that you absolutely can’t run out of drinks. Of course, you can always have a sober guest make a trip to the liquor store, but if you really want to have a successful party, then you should make sure there is more than enough food and drinks for everyone. Make sure to have different types of alcohol and many snacking options so that there is something for each one of your guests.


If you’re planning on serving dinner at your party, make this clear so your guests come with their appetites in tow. If you’re just planning on having snacks, then you should make this clear, too, so your guests know that they should eat in advance.
It’s important to have enough to drink because your guests will be more likely to leave and see that things are winding down if you run out of alcohol. Always get at least 25% drinks than you think you’ll reasonably need; you can always have the rest later or send guests home with a bottle of wine.
Try to have a more food than you think everyone will eat. Have a few extra less perishable items, such as chips, so you can save them if the guests don’t get to them.;
, As you clean your home and prepare for your party, you should make sure the environment is set up so that your guests can comfortably mingle, hang out, and feel relaxed. This means having plenty of seating space, coasters for people to place their drinks down on, and trying to arrange the furniture so the room is as open as possible so people don’t segregate themselves into little clusters.


You should also create enough warm, soft lighting so that the guests can see each other and not feel sleepy, but you don’t need too many glaring bright lights or your guests may not feel so comfortable.
Make sure you set your room to a reasonable temperature and that you ask your guests whether they are hot or cold throughout the night.
If it’s fall, the holiday time, or another festive time, then you can leave little festive touches around your home for your guests.

, If you’d like to play it safe, you can leave a few conversational pieces out around your home so your guests have something to talk about if the conversation gets stale. You can leave out a collection of your musical albums, a photo album, or some souvenirs you got on a recent trip. Just a few eye-catching objects will give your guests something to ask you about or to talk about.


Creating a unique appetizer or making a mixed drink your guests have never had before will also give them something to talk about.

, Though you can’t ensure that everyone will get along, if you want to host a successful party, then you should try to invite guests who have similar temperaments or who share at least some of the same interests. Though it’s great to have completely different people together in the same room and to have them mingle and have fascinating conversations, you should make sure not to have too many “problem” people together in the same room or you may have some trouble on your hands.


Plus, knowing that your guests will generally get along will make you feel less stressed out when the time of the party comes.

, If you want to be a successful hostess, then you should tell your guests when the party is, where the party is, and what they need to or don’t need to bring. You don’t want them showing up empty-handed to a potluck or bringing a ton of beer when you already have two mini-kegs. Let them know all of the particulars of your party at least a week in advance.


If they don’t already have your phone number, make sure you give it to them so they can call you if they have questions or if they get lost.
If you’re throwing a theme party or want the party to be elegant, make sure the guests have at least a week or two to prepare a suitable outfit.

, You should start preparing your drinks and snacks at least an hour earlier than you think it’ll take for you to get everything done. Though you don’t want to leave that guacamole out an extra hour or two, you should prepare as many of the foods and drinks as you can well in advance so your guests don’t arrive when you’ve only started baking that pumpkin pie. Being ready when those first guests arrive can help you feel more in the zone when it comes to hosting a good party.


That said, you can leave some easy tasks until last minute in the kitchen. These can be great for guests who are more shy who want to help you out.
If you’re hosting a big party, don’t be ashamed to ask a friend for help. It can be more fun to get your home party-ready with a buddy.

, You should be as warm and welcoming as possible when your guests arrive. Smile at them, give them big hugs, ask how they are, and make them feel like you’re really excited and happy that they’re there. You should also tell them where to put their shoes, or tell them that it’s okay for them to leave them on, hang up their coats or tell them where the coat room is, and take any foods or drinks they’ve brought off their hands.


Make each guest feel comfortable and welcome as soon as they walk through the door.

, If a lot of the guests at the party haven’t been to your home before, you should quickly let them know where the kitchen, bathroom, outdoor patio, and anything else they may be looking for are. This helps them feel at home and won’t lead them to ask too many questions later. If multiple guests show up at once, just make sure you tell all of them where everything is as soon as you can.

, As soon as you’ve welcomed your guests and oriented them, you should make sure they have some food to eat or a drink in their hands. If you’re having an alcohol-friendly party, then making sure everyone has a drink can help people feel comfortable and can get that party started as quickly as possible. People may be shy about asking for food or a drink so make sure you offer them what they need as soon as you can.


Open beers for people if they want beers, pour them wine if that’s what they want, or tell them about the liquor you have if that’s what they have a hankering for. Of course, if you don’t want things to get too rowdy early on, you can do away with the hard stuff or bring it out later in the evening.
You should also check in advance to make sure your guests don’t have any allergies, and let your guests know which foods are peanut-free, gluten-free, vegetarian, and so on.
Make sure to also have soda, juice, and other non-alcoholic drinks so non-drinkers don’t feel left out.

, Another important duty you have as a hostess is to make sure all of your guests meet each other and that they have something to talk about. If it’s a bigger party and not everyone knows each other, you should introduce your guests to each other and quickly explain their connection to you, while also bringing up something they might have in common.


You can say something like, “Sue, this is Joey, a childhood friend of mine. Joey, this is Sue. She works at the school with me.”
You can also add something about common ground they may share. Say something like, “Isn’t it funny, you’re both from Alaska!” or “You two must be the most loyal Lakers fans I’ve ever met.”
You should also look around for guests who seem lonely or like they’re not really talking much. Introduce them to people you think they might like.

, In order to keep your party environment fun and friendly, you have to make sure to circulate and mingle with all of your guests. You don’t want some of your guests to feel neglected in favor of other guests, and you need to see how all of your guests are and what they’ve been up to so they feel wanted and welcome at your party. Make sure to mingle at least every 10-15 minutes, to bring new people into the conversation, or to leave to get a guest another drink or some more food when he needs it.


You should try to have fun at your own party while also being attentive to the needs of your guests.
If you feel like conversations are growing stale, you should try to bring a different group of people together or open up your conversation to a larger group.

, You should have some entertainment around just in case your guests grow weary or just because you want to spice things up. Just remember that some people just come to parties to hang out and that you don’t want your guests to feel like you’re forcing them to play games or do activities they don’t want to do. Still, it’s good to be prepared with some entertainment, just in case. Here are some things you can try:


Board games, such as Clue or Life
Other games, such as Twister
Video games
A fun outdoor activity to play in your yard, such as cornhole, horseshoe, or bocce

, Though you may need to go to the kitchen to grab more drinks or prepare more food, or you may have something else to tend to, as a rule, you shouldn’t leave your guests for more than a few minutes at a time. Remember that you’re the center of the party and that your guests are depending on you to have a good time and to feel welcome and comfortable. It’s especially important to be there if a lot of your guests don’t know each other and need you to help people socialize.


It’s okay to ask a close friend to help you out with something party-related, such as making more mixed drinks or cleaning up a mess, that will help you minimize time spent away from your guests.

, If you want to be a good hostess, then you should avoid cleaning up while the guests are there at all costs. Though you can clean up spills or a few messes as they occur, if you’re in the kitchen washing glasses and food bowls out in the middle of the party, then your guests will see this as a sign that they are welcome to leave. Though you may hate to see a mess, remember that having a fun party is more important than having everything clean by the time the last guest leaves.


Even if there are only a few guests left, cleaning up sends the message that you want them to leave. If you really are ready for the party to end, it’s better to be honest about it than hoping they get the message.
You can also arrange to have a friend or two stay late to help you clean up in advance. This will keep you from worrying about having a huge mess on your hands at the end of the party.

, If someone spills wine on your carpet, tips over that bowl of nachos, or accidentally knocks over a painting, try not to act too upset or to make your guests feel bad about what happened. After all, you’re the one who decided to throw a party, and big messes come with the territory. If you get visibly upset or stressed out, then your guest will feel terrible and people will think you’re too uptight to throw a fun party.


Just say something like, “Don’t worry about it at all. This kind of thing always happens at parties, and it’s no big deal.”
If you want to avoid damaging anything that really means a lot to you, then you can move out meaningful keepsakes, vases, or souvenirs before the party starts.

, You should be warm and welcoming toward your guests for the duration of the party. If you’ve mentioned an end time and that time has not come yet, then you’ll have to do your best to continue being a good hostess and making other people welcome in your home. You don’t want guests to suddenly feel like they’re being a burden to you or that you just want them to go home already.


Remember that you’re the one who decided to throw a fun party, and that now you have to follow through.

, As your party wraps up, you can give your guests something to leave with, whether it’s a special holiday favor, some cookies you baked in advance, or even leftover food or drinks. This can help them feel like they were a part of the party and that they participated in a truly special occasion. Though it’s not necessary to make a party favor, just giving the guests something small to remember the party by can make them feel like the night was even more of a success.


Having your guests leave with extra food or drinks will also keep your home from being full of too much stuff you won’t use.

, It’s important to let your guests know how much it meant to you that they came to your party as they get ready to leave. Thank them for taking the time to hang out, for bringing anything that they brought, and for just being awesome, fun guests at your party. This will make them feel like you really care and will complete your duties as an excellent hostess.


You can also mention the next time you’ll hang out with your guests, so you will have more parties to look forward to on the horizon—though you won’t have to always be the one hosting!

Select the right peanuts for boiling.,
Wash and pick through your peanuts, removing loose soil and sprouts, stems, weeds, and leaves.,
Set up a cooker if you are boiling a large amount at one time, or get a good heavy pot to place on the stove.

,
Pour your peanuts into the pot, and add enough water to cover them by 2 or more inches.,
Add salt to taste.,
Add other seasonings if you prefer.,
Bring the contents to a boil.,
Stir the peanuts about every 15-20 minutes, making sure the water has not boiled down.,
After an hour or so, remove some of the peanuts with a slotted spoon and test (taste) them.,
Taste for saltiness.,
Turn off the stove/burner when the peanuts are salty and tender enough to suit you.,
Refrigerate or freeze leftover peanuts in zipper type freezer bags for later enjoyment.",How to Boil Peanuts," Jumbo peanuts or Valencia peanuts are preferred by many, but most standard peanuts work well, so long as they are still green. Do not attempt this recipe with roasted peanuts, as they will not become soft, no matter how long you cook them. In the south, farmer's markets and roadside vendors sell green peanuts from early summer through late fall or first frost. Dry/raw peanuts can be enjoyed year round but need to be soaked in water 24 hours before boiling.;
, You can place your peanuts in a large pot or bucket and use a sprayer on a garden hose to rinse your peanuts, and when the water floats the nuts, the loose debris will float to the top when the contents of the pot is agitated or stirred.

,, Some will float to the top, so the amount of water may have a deceptive appearance. Push the peanuts down with your (clean) hands, and you will be able to tell how much water is in the pot.

, This can be tricky, but a rule of thumb is to add 1/4 cup salt for every ten pounds of green peanuts. For older, tougher peanuts, more salt may be needed so the nut will absorb enough salt to season your nuts.

, Here, sliced jalapeno peppers are added to give the finished peanuts a bit of heat. Garlic, either fresh or powder, liquid crab boil seasoning, chili powder, and other strong spices may be used as well.

, On the propane stove, you light the burner and turn the flame up high, on a cooktop, turn the burner to high until the water is rapidly boiling, then reduce the heat/flame so that it maintains a rolling boil without producing excess heat.

, Covering the pot will reduce the amount of water evaporating from the pot, but will increase the risk of your pot boiling over while the peanuts boil.

, Peanuts that have fully absorbed water will sink to the bottom of the pot. When they have become tender, and the nut has become from the shell when it is opened, the peanuts are done. Cooking may take as long as 2-4 hours, depending on the altitude.

, If you desire, before removing the nuts from the boiling water, additional salt can be added and the peanuts can continue to boil for another 30 minutes or so. Keep in mind that with the increased salinity of the water, and the additional boiling time, the already cooked peanuts can become too salty very quickly, so use caution at this stage.

, Drain away the excess water, being very careful not to scald or burn yourself while doing so, and place the boiled peanuts in a bowl to cool and enjoy. They are also great before being cooled.

, Remove frozen peanuts from the bag when you want to eat them, and warm them by heating them for 2 minutes in a microwave.

You can then pat them dry. If they're unshelled, then you should shell them by hand, which is a bit easier when they're dry; they don't have to be perfectly shelled, either.Spanish peanuts are a good choice for peanut butter due to the high oil content.;
, Some people prefer to roast their peanuts before processing them, to give them that additional crispy, crunchy flavor. However, this is completely optional and does make the process take quite a bit longer, so it's up to you to decide whether or not you want to roast them; you can also buy pre-toasted peanuts. If you do decide to roast them, however, then here is what you'll need to do:Place the peanuts in a bowl and lightly toss them with the peanut or vegetable oil.
Preheat your oven to 350°F (176°C).
Spread the peanuts on a single layer on a baking pan. You want to make sure they aren't on top of each other so they are fairly evenly cooked.
Cook them for about 10 minutes, until they're lightly covered in oil and are golden brown.
If you'd like, you can gently shake the pan they're in every 2 minutes or so to take extra precautions against burning.

, This should take just a few pulses. For best results, do this while the peanuts are still warm.

, The mixture should begin to look more creamy and more like that peanut butter you've been craving.

, Continue processing the mixture, processing for 1 minute, scraping it off the sides of the processor, and repeating, until it is of your desired consistency. At least 3 minutes of processing should do the trick.


Just remember that this peanut butter will never look as creamy as the kind you may be used to from Jiffy. That's because it's more natural. Don't expect that it will ever look as creamy as it can from the jar—though it will taste more delicious!

, Use a big spoon to do this.

, Taste your peanut butter and see if it needs a bit more salt and sugar. If it tastes the way you like it, then there's no need to add salt or sugar!

, You can also substitute molasses or honey for sugar, if you like. Some people prefer to place these ingredients in the processor and to blend them together with the peanuts; it depends on whether or not your processor will be able to handle all of the honey or other ingredients.


If you're adding these ingredients by hand, then make sure to stir them until they are thoroughly incorporated.

, Store in the refrigerator for a day or two so it can set in to a lovely peanut butter paste. Of course, the shelf life of homemade peanut butter is shorter than commercial counterparts, but chances are, your homemade peanut butter will have all been gobbled up even before you get the chance to consider its storage life!


You can store this kind of peanut butter in the fridge for up to a few weeks.

, What better use for your tasty peanut butter than a classic PB&J? You can stick to the original recipe or add some extra frills for an added delight.

, You can make these easy, tasty cookies with your peanut butter, some flour, brown sugar, and a few additional ingredients. These cookies are even more delicious when enjoyed with a glass of milk!

, If you're looking for a rich, decadent peanut-butter flavored treat that you can pop in your mouth, then this is the recipe for you. All you'll need is your peanut butter, some powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and just a few ingredients.




, If you want to make your own delicious peanut butter cups with your own peanut butter, all you really need is some chocolate, your peanut butter, and some molds for shaping those cups.

, Who says you have to use your peanut butter for sweets? You can make a yummy peanut butter soup with only milk, cinnamon, and your own tasty peanut butter.

If you're an artist, what better image to have than a picture drawn by you?
If you know someone who is a talented artist, ask him or her to help out by drawing the perfect image.
Dig through your old photos. If you're helping Grandpa celebrate his 80th birthday, a baby picture will be a perfect addition to your invitation.
If your image is not online, you'll have to scan it to get it on your computer.

, The words you choose will the entire birthday card together. You can look online for inspiration, but since you're making your own invitations, a personal touch will work best. Here are some things to do:


Make sure the words match the picture. The words can reference the picture in some way, or just match the tone of the picture. If it's a silly picture, a somber tone won't work.

When and where your party will be held.
The time of the occasion. If it's a surprise party, tell them they absolutely have to be there by a certain time. Hint: tell your guests they have to be absolutely be there by a certain time, but plan the surprise for half an hour later than that. It's impossible to make sure everyone will be there on time and you don't want a straggling guest to ruin your surprise.
What to bring other than gifts. If you're having a pool party, for example, tell them to bring a suit.

Typos. Though you should check for spelling errors on your computer, read your invitation aloud to make sure it's typo-free.
Alignment. Make sure everything is centered properly.
Make sure that your invitation is pleasing to the eye. Check that the colors aren't too flashy and that the invitation doesn't look too busy--it shouldn't be crowded with images and words.
Make sure it's easy to read. Have you used an approachable font? Are the details about your party clear?
Can you fold it properly? Is the image on the front, with the details on the inside?

, Before you print the rest of your invitations, you'll need to have blank invitation paper. Make sure it's thick enough to be sturdy, but thin enough to run through your printer without any problems.


When you buy your blank invitation cards, get a few extra in case of a paper jam, ink smear, or other unforeseen problem.

A glue stick.
Stencils, stamps, and stickers.
Glitter.

Since you're writing by hand, you can have fun and tailor each invitation to the guest who will be receiving it. You don't have to do this for every guest, because it may take too long.
If your friends are helping, make sure that they have good handwriting!

, Your invitation will already look nice, but taking a few extra measures will really make it shine. Here's what you can do:


Cut designs of simple shapes like stars, hearts, or flowers, out of the remaining construction paper, and stick them onto the invitation with a glue stick. Wait for them to dry.
Place a few stickers or stamps on the invitations, or fill in the stencils you have.
Add glitter to the invitation. Just be careful--glitter can get a bit messy, and you don't want to annoy your guests by having them get glitter all over their hands as soon as they open the invitation.
Since you're making these invitations by hand, you can decorate each card differently.

, The envelopes you use will have to be large enough for the card to fit inside.


You can also add stickers or stamps to the envelope for an even more personalized touch.

Search the web for free templates.,
Decide on a graphic design to use.,
Select a message.",How to Make Homemade Baptism Invitations1," Some are pre-written, but you'll want to find blank ones to create your own message. Alternatively, you can create your own template with a word processing or desktop publishing program. Open Office, Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Publisher are all good choices.


Free templates will also give you cute ideas for adornments or additions. You can turn doilies into little baptismal gowns or attach a small cross and ribbon, for starter ideas.;
, Use baptism symbols or a picture of your child for baptizing infants and young children. For adults, choose more serious and serene symbols of faith.


If you are making invitations for an adult baptism, your designs could include a bible, crucifixion symbols, sea shells or other items from the beach, candles or other forms of light, doves or other symbols of peace.
Of course, this is completely up to you. If you're happy with a simple border, by all means! Choose whatever speaks to you; it's your (or your child's) moment!

, Keep it brief and informational; save the person's personal testament for the actual baptism event. If desired, include a Bible verse or two that has meaning to the family or person being baptized.


Make sure the message condones the right level of sincerity; baptism is a very important event for most believers.
Keep the font elegant, but easy to read at a glance. Don't use fancy script (cursive) that is often found on wedding invitations for titles and headers.
Include a brief statement about gift expectation. If you don't want attendees to bring gifts, then may be you should suggest they donate to your faith-based organization instead? Whatever your preferences, make them clear.
Don't forget to include the necessities! Time, place, occasion, and if there will be a gathering afterwards need to be listed on your invite.

Check your printer.,
Print the cards!,
Mail the invitations.",How to Make Homemade Baptism Invitations2," Whether you're buying your own cardstock or ordering pre-made cards, making sure to include some extra. Do so as a precaution in case you accidentally ruin a few. Make sure you also purchase your envelopes at the same time to match sizes.


If you're printing at home, make sure your printer can handle the type of paper and photo qualities you're employing. If your printer can't, you can always go to any office supply store for a small fee.
It is possible to make your own envelopes. If you have time for this, do feel free!

, Verify that all of your margins are accurate, that the card looks neatly organized, and that the colors and graphics selected are suitable.


Are you printing one per page? Two? Three? Make sure you have the settings sorted before you start.

, Make sure that you have enough toner, black, and color ink for the entire printing job. If you're using photos, it will take higher quality, slower, more ink-consuming printing.


If you're worried about the shabbiness of paper printing, a simple solution is just to back your template on color coordinated cardstock. Print out two invitations per printer sheet and use the thicker paper as a border -- it will give it texture and durability.

, Check your printer every few cards to make sure that the margins don't shift or the paper doesn't jam. Using cardstock or other thick paper increases the risk of jamming your printer. Make sure your printer is capable of printing on thicker paper, and if it is, make sure you're feeding the paper from the correct tray for cards.


After the cards are all printed, attach any embellishments you see fit. It's best to use craft glue -- make sure not to use too much! Gloopy invitations are not the way to go.

If attaching things like seashells, ribbon, or doilies, give the invitations 30 minutes or so to dry. Be incredibly careful when stuffing them into their envelopes.



, Address, stamp, and mail your invitations. Don't forget to include a return address, either hand-written or on a label. Invitations should never be sent without a return address.


If your invitations are heavy, make sure you have adequate postage. Maximum letter weight is 3.5 ounces in the US.

Offer bribes.",How to Ask Guests to RSVP on Invitations," stands for Réspondez, s'il vous plait which means please reply in French. Unfortunately, some people might not be familiar with this expression and its meaning. By changing the wording of your invitation, or including the words ""please reply,"" there will be less of a chance that a guest misunderstands your request.


Another option you might consider: ""please send your RSVP response to...""

, You might communicate this to your guests by saying:


To ensure there is enough food and drink for everyone, please send a response to this invitation.
So that we can prepare seating for everyone in advance, please reply as to whether or not you can make our party.

, This may cause her to think you are only informing her of the event, and not requesting an RSVP. To keep your invitation to the point, you might:


Limit your invitation to only necessary information, such as who is holding the event, what the event is for, where the event will be, when it will be, and why it is being held.

, You may also want to use a ""soft"" deadline on your invitation, as it is common for a few stragglers to respond shortly after the deadline has passed. To draw attention to this information you might:


Use an eye catching design to draw attention.
Use all caps, italics, underlining, or special font.

, Check and double check your contact information before you send out your invitations.

, In many cases, a host or hostess might request the RSVP be returned only if a guest is unable to make the event. Be sure the words ""RSVP regrets only"" are prominent and clearly expressed so that no guest misunderstands the purpose of this kind of RSVP.

, You might even consider sending out an email request for your guests to ""save the date."" This will improve the chances of your event making it into your partygoers calendars where they will be reminded of it whenever they check their schedules.

, If you are sending e-vites to personal email accounts, you might wait until a weekday evening, when people are off work and more likely to see a ""new email"" notification.


Sending an e-vite very early in the day or late at night is also a strategy to consider. This way, your invite will have a higher chance at being at the top of your guests inbox, making it more visible.

,


For major events that use physical invitations sent by post, like weddings, anniversaries, and reunions, you may also want to include a return envelope with the RSVP you send.

, Studies have shown that human brains respond to perceived scarcity, and you can use this to your advantage.On your invite, you may want to write:


""Please respond so there isn't a shortage of cupcakes for your children.""
""Seating is limited in our home, so please RSVP so we can prepare to accommodate everyone at our party.""

, By including even a small gift with your invite, you can increase the rate at which your guests RSVP.Your gift doesn't have to be extravagant for you to enjoy this effect. With a simple paper invitation you might include:


A pin from the dollar store.
A balloon.
A sticker.

, The prospect of winning something free can be a powerful motivating factor, and can help your event stick in the minds of your guests. Along with your invitation, you might inform guests that when they RSVP, they'll be entered into a raffle for something like:A bottle of wine.

Send out your invites!",How to Make Wedding Invitations," Wedding invitations are typically broken up into three different parts: the save-the-date, the wedding invitation, and the RSVP card. Decide if you want all of these to be included in your invitation-making process, and how similar or different you would like each part to appear.


The save-the-date typically includes an announcement of engagement and marriage, the names of the couple, and the date and (optional) time of the wedding. You don’t have to include the location or any other details.
The wedding invitation should be sent out at least six weeks before the wedding date. These should include all of the information for the wedding including the names of the couple, the location, date, and time. Feel free to include more than just the basic information on your invitation.
The RSVP card is a smaller card that is sent with the invitation. This is an optional, but helpful, inclusion to your invitation. It comes with an envelope and gives the recipient of the invitation the ability to tell you if they are coming, the number of guests, and their preferred dish for the dinner. The recipient will mail this back to you, so you know how many people your wedding needs to be prepared for.

, Before you can make your invitations, you need to know how many you will have to create. To do this, make a guest list organized by family or household. Include the full name, address, and optionally their email and phone number.


It is easiest to organize all this information into a spreadsheet on your computer. This way, you can quickly pull up the information and make any necessary changes.
As guests RSVP, highlight or mark their names on the guest list. This will help you to keep track of who all is going, and who you have not heard from.
Pay attention to anyone on your guest list who may have special invitation needs. If they live in a rural or remote area, you may need to send them an invitation online as well through the mail. If they speak another language, have a special translated version of your invitation made.

, Once you’ve decided what parts of the invitation you want to make, make a sample (or a few) for each part. Choose the exact wording you want to appear on your invitation, including the order of different sets of information and spacing on the invitation.


Decide if you want to use formal or informal wording. Classic formal introductions include “request your presence at their wedding ceremony on...” or “The family humbly invites you to the wedding of on...”If you want a more informal wedding invitation, try an introduction like “happily invites you to their wedding on...” or simply “You’re invited!” with the included location and date/time.
Although this is just the sample text, make sure that you proofread to avoid any spelling or grammatical errors in the invitations.
Don’t feel limited to making one version of the information that will be on your invitation, but make several versions testing different styles of writing.
Feel free to include directions on the wedding invitation, especially if the location is remote or unknown to most of the guests., Designing your invitations should ideally be done after you have taken steps in planning your actual wedding. For the best looking invitations, choose colors that match the rest of your wedding décor.


Limit your invitation colors to 3 at most. This will keep the invitation from looking overwhelming or busy.
Use at least one neutral or base color. Typically white or cream is used for this, but any light color can be the base. Then, you can use 1-2 additional bright or rich colors to compliment it.
Make sure that you use a contrasting color for the background/text so that it is easy to read everything on your invitation.
Keep the same colors for the invitation, save the date, and RSVP card. You want all the sections of your invitation to flow, not to clash with each other.
Choose what parts of your invitation will be in each color. This includes the background, the text, and any additional design elements you add.

, Before you start adding text and images to your invitation, you must first choose a background. If your invitation text is formal, consider having a classic neutral background. Informal text can match well with quirky, fun background patterns or images.


If you want to have a solid color background, decide on the color scheme. Will you have a single color, or use an ombre effect to fade two or more colors together?
Consider using a pattern or image as the background. Although you have to slightly amend the area where the text will be placed, using a patterned background is an easy way to add interest to your invitation.
Remember that you can use paper that already has a background image printed on it. This way, you are only responsible for creating the text and placement for your invite, and choosing a patterned paper that you want.
You can give the illusion of a background image by using textured (rather than patterned) paper.

, If you want to include pictures or images for your invitation, brainstorm a couple options. If you don’t feel confident with your skills in this area, consider asking an artistic/creative close friend or family member for their help and input.


If you want to have an image, design it yourself or use a free stock photo. Images to consider are a frame or border around the text, small design-related drawings or clipart, or an engagement photo of the couple.
If you use an image, decide if it will be on a solid piece of cardstock with the text printed on vellum that is attached over the top, or if you will include all images and text on the same piece of paper.
Avoid adding too many things to your invitation. If you have a textured background, don’t use too many images or borders. Don’t use more than two images or pictures for an invitation, and make sure the text is the focus of the invite.

, Equally important as the images and colors used on your invitation is the font style of your text. Font is important for attributing a certain mood to your invitation.


For a formal invitation, go with a classic cursive of serif font. This will give the classy, sophisticated look you are going for.
If you use informal text and design, consider using a handwritten font or sans-serif font. You are not limited to these though, and can certainly use a formal style of font for the invite.
Limit your font choices to two at most. It is not unusual to have a wedding invitation with multiple fonts, but using more than two can become overwhelming to the eye.

, Invitations these days can be incredibly detailed and have many additional pieces and stylistic elements outside of the invitation itself. Consider embossing, adding ribbons or bows, using confetti, or adding glitter to your invitations.

, There are hundreds of different envelope styles on the market, many specifically designed for wedding invitations. This part of the process may not be able to be hand-made, except for the most adventurous brides. Find envelopes in the right size, shape, and color online to match your invitations.

, With everything decided on - text, color scheme, background, and possible images - you can now create a mock-up of you invitation. Create a rough draft of your invite with ideal text/image placement.


Make several versions of a single invitation style by moving around text, increasing/decreasing the size of objects, and trying different borders.
Don’t feel like you must stick with a certain style or format. Try many different styles to find which you like best; you may be surprised by what you like and don’t like.
Be sure to think about the size you need to make your invitations in. This may change the formatting slightly.

, Once you have considered all text placement and design styles, put together a final invitation. Make sure that there are no basic text mistakes and that you know the exact sizing for your cards., Although you may have already decided on a type of paper to use if it is adding a patterned background or texture, you should choose on a type of paper for you invitations after designing them.


Visit local craft or print shops to see different styles of available paper. Pay attention to price, and consider the change in cost if you buy in bulk.
Avoid glossy photo paper for your invitations, as this style gets damaged easily. Instead, try using matte photo paper or cardstock.
Make sure that your paper can be cut to size or ordered in the correct size for your invitations.
If you are considering layering pieces of paper for your invitations, make sure to choose the paper for each individual layer. You will likely need equal numbers of each piece.

, You can print your invitations at home or through a print shop. Often, if you design the invitations yourself you will have saved enough money to get a good print job done at a local shop.


If you print at home, make sure your printer is compatible with the paper you intend on using and that you have plenty of ink. Gather a reliable ink or toner, preferably the printer’s original cartridges to give you the best quality possible.
Call multiple print shops in your area to get estimates on prices. For simply printing and cutting your invitations to size, you may have only a very small fee to pay.
Make sure that you print your invitations in the accurate size, so that you don’t waste a lot of time and money re-printing your invites because of a sizing mistake.

, Once you have gotten all of your invites printed and cut to size, put them together! If there are multiple layers to each invited, secure them with glue or brads. Place the RSVP card or additional directions inside the the invitation, and then the entire invitation into the envelope.


Remember that the envelope can be closed with a sticker or wax seal rather than just lick-and-sealed.
Use your best, clear handwriting to address the envelopes or print stickers in a font matching your invitations.

, With all of them completely assembled and addressed, finish the process by inviting your friends and family to celebrate your big day. Be sure to send your invitations at least six weeks before your wedding.

Slip the finished invitation inside the cupcake.",How to Make a Cupcake Invitation," The size of the template should be large enough for the invitation; sizes are suggested below. The shapes you'll need are as follows:


Draw a trapezoid shape for the cupcake base. A suggested measurement is: 10cm/4 inches across the top, 6.5cm/2.8 inches at the base.
Draw a large semi circle for the frosting top. This should be slightly wider each side than the trapezoid base. A suggested measurement is: 11cm/4.3 inches at its widest and up to5cm/2.5"" height. At the base of the circle, draw a wavy line with two inward waves, to form the ""drips"" that frosting develops.
Draw a small circle. This will the cherry for the top of the cake.;
, Put them together to form a cupcake to check that the dimensions and shape are accurate. The trapezoid goes at the base, the smallest side on the bottom, the frosting semi-circle sits over the top of the trapezoid and the cherry sits right in the middle of the top of the frosting piece. When you're happy with how it looks, it's now ready to use for the template.

, Draw another trapezoid. It will need to be slightly wider than the one drawn for the cupcake base because the invitation will slide into this one. Add about 1.2cm or 1/2 inch each side of the trapezoid to make it wide enough. Cut out the shape. Cut it out again and make a mock-up from simple card or scrap card; glue the edges together (or use double-sided tape). Test that the cupcake base slides inside it with ease; if not, make adjustments before proceeding.

, The color theme is entirely up to you, although it's a good idea to focus on colors that the party girl or boy loves. For example, a pink cupcake invitation could consist of a hot pink frosting layer, a pastel pink cupcake base and a metallic pink cupcake case. Use strong but lightweight card for all parts of the cupcake; for the cupcake case use craft corrugated card instead, to have the look of a cupcake case.


If you cannot match the colors exactly, you can paint colored dots, stripes or other designs on plain card, so that it carries the color theme through.
The cherry is best in red.

, For each invitation needed, cut out card as follows:


1 cupcake base
1 cupcake frosting
1 cupcake cherry
2 cupcake case pieces.

, Either works but just be a little more careful with the glue, that it doesn't glob anywhere; wipe off any excess that oozes out. The remaining steps in this section assume you've chosen one or other attaching methods.

, The frosting line should sit quite high up, so that you can see a lot of the cupcake base, and so that it doesn't interfere with slipping the invitation into the cupcake case.

,, Be sure to only use a small amount of glue or double-sided tape right at the edges, to allow for slipping the invitation inside the cupcake case. Do not glue or tape closed the top part of the cupcake case; this is needed to allow the invitation to slip in.


The tape may need to be cut in half to prevent it covering too much area if you're using tape.

, This is not essential but if you want to add extra features, then feel free to do so.


You could paint a design onto the cupcake cases.
You could run a line of lace or ribbon across the top of the cupcake case (simply glue or tape in place)
You could add costume gems to the case, etc.

, Again, this is an optional embellishment and may look overdone in some cases, so perhaps do a test run on one invitation first to see if it's worth it. If you like the look, add glitter as needed.

, This is the cherry side of the cupcake.

, On the back of the invitation, write the date, time, place and occasion. Write ""to and from"" as well.

, It can now be slipped inside a large square envelope or simply given to the intended guests as it is.

Fill out the RSVP card that was sent with your wedding invitation.,
Write an RSVP letter to a formal or semi-formal invitation.,
E-mail an RSVP to an Evite.,
Call to RSVP by telephone.,
Regardless of how you respond, always thank the host for the invitation.,
Reply sooner rather than later.,
Specify how many guests you will bring.,
Know how to change or cancel an RSVP.",How to RSVP," Most wedding invitations include an RSVP card with a structured template.


For example, an RSVP card might begin with: ""A favor of reply is requested by July 20, 2014."" This is the cut-off date for responses. Always RSVP by this date, if not sooner. It is considered rude to leave RSVPs to the last minute.
Underneath the deadline there will be an item looking like this: ""M__________."" Here, you will simply need to fill out your title according to your gender. For example: Mr. Arthur Mitchell or Mrs. Rita Morgan.

There will be the option of accepting or declining. Sometimes it is simply an empty space next to ""Will attend,"" where you may place a check mark. Other times, it may look like this: ""__Accepts with pleasure __Declines with regrets."" In this instance, simply check the appropriate box. You may also leave a brief explanation or a note of congratulations.
Once the card is properly filled out, mail it back to the sender. A separate envelope is often included with the RSVP card.
If you receive a blank RSVP card, simply mimic the template used in standard RSVP cards. State your name in the third person, whether you will attend, and include the date of the wedding. Remember to use formal wording.

, Invitations to significant events, such as graduations and baby showers, may not specify how to RSVP. In this situation, writing a letter is the proper etiquette.If you are writing an RSVP letter to a formal invitation, such as a graduation or Bar Mitzvah, keep it simple yet elegant. Write, ""Mr. and Mrs. Dexter Morgan accept with pleasure the kind invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Miguel Prado on Saturday, the first of April.""If you are declining an invitation, simply substitute ""accept with pleasure"" with ""regret that we are unable to accept.""
For semi-formal invitations, such as birthdays and baby showers, follow the basic structure of normal letter writing. This letter will be longer than a formal letter but should still be short (only a few sentences).
For example: ""Dear Mr. Prado, I regret that I am unable to attend the baby shower you will be hosting for Oscar Prado on December 12, 2014. Unfortunately, I have a work conference scheduled for the same day and it is mandatory that I attend. Though I cannot be present, I have already bought Oscar a gift and will have it delivered to the party.""

, Invitations sent via e-mail are typically reserved for casual events, such as children's birthdays or dinner parties.Sometimes they are used as simpler alternatives to formal paper invitations.


Simply open the e-mail containing the electronic invitation. Click ""View Invitation."" This will direct you to an electronic card where you will be able to RSVP.Select ""Yes,"" ""Maybe,"" or ""No."" You may also include additional comments. Take the opportunity to ask valid questions such as, ""Who's coming?"" or ""What should I wear?"" to help better inform your decision.
Sometimes formal events, such as weddings, will opt for electronic invitations.This is typically done to avoid large costs, lessen the stress, or limit paper usage. In any case, you should respond in a formal manner if including additional comments.

, Responding by telephone usually involves very casual and small celebrations. However, sometimes formal and semi-formal invitations will request that you RSVP by phone.If you are responding to a formal invitation, remember to maintain respectful etiquette. Though the RSVP may carry over into conversational territory, always use proper English.Do not use slang or foul language.
For example, begin by saying ""Hello, is this Mr. Batista?"" Once he responds, you can reply with, ""Hello Mr. Batista. This is Vince, I'm calling to RSVP to your 50th wedding anniversary party. I can't believe how long you've been married. I look forward to celebrating this momentous occasion with you.""
Be concise. Although the RSVP may include small talk and pleasantries, try not to carry on the conversation longer than it needs to be. Your host has other potential guests to hear from!
For casual invitations, especially from friends, using relaxed language will most likely be acceptable. Conversation length will also vary depending on your relationship with that particular person.

, Remember that you are being given the privilege of celebrating key events with people who are fond of you.


Though it is not mandatory, try to provide a reasonable explanation for declining an invitation. This an empathetic way of informing your host that you, too, have significant matters to attend to.
Make an effort to supply a gift for your host. Not only is this customary for big occasions, it is the ultimate sign of thankfulness. You do not have to splurge on an expensive item; as long as the sentiment is there, your host will appreciate your gift.

, Be sensitive to the time constraints your host faces. Late RSVPs will require time and effort that could be focused on other planning aspects.


Knowing the amount of guests ahead of time, especially for highly organized events like weddings, will ease much of the pressure and work to be done by your host.
Punctuality not only saves your host trouble, it reflects your level of respect and thoughtfulness as a person.

, If your host offers you the option of bringing guests, be clear and precise about the number.


Formal invitations sometimes offer the option of bringing a ""plus-1."" Only bring a date or companion if you have already confirmed that you will do so in the RSVP.
Informal invitations may allow some room for multiple guests. Regardless, you should always respond in a timely manner. Avoid bringing unexpected guests or too many guests.
Avoid ambiguous estimations, such as ""a few"" or ""a couple.""

, Foregoing a commitment to appear is unfortunate, but sometimes there are extenuating circumstances for canceling an RSVP.


If you have recently suffered an injury or illness, have had a death in the family, or have an unavoidable business conflict, canceling an RSVP is acceptable.Call your host immediately if there are last minute complications. The telephone is the quickest way to reach someone and will save your host unwanted surprises.

Never miss an event to which you have already made a commitment without first notifying your host. This conveys both disrespect and indifference towards your host's efforts.
Do not cancel because you have something better to do. This is extremely rude and inconsiderate.

Is it for some adventure, relaxation or to experience new things? Once you understand the reason for your travel, you will get your direction or the next step, namely, choosing where you want to go.;
, When you’ve decided where you want to go, the next most important thing is to check your budget.  Do you think you’ve got enough bills in your pocket that you can travel to your chosen place? If not, it’s time to start saving now with a positive attitude. This can also help you decide when you want to start your trip – because you will only be able to make arrangements once you’ve saved enough.

Night life? Mountains? Depending on your interests, you can choose a destination. Choosing a destination, whether within the country or international, can help you move forward towards the next phase of easy travel.

Start with a script.,
Do your best when recording your invitation.,
Practice good video etiquette.,
Keep it quiet except for you in the video.,
Maintain eye contact with the camera.,
Don't overanalyze your actions.,
Editing could be a complicated process so try to use simple tools (unless you are a pro), and you'll probably have a lot of fun.,
Embed the video on video sharing websites such as Youtube or attach it as an attachment (if you've exported it into a .wmv format).",How to Create a Green Video Invitation," Make it as short as possible and not too complicated. If you have a script you won't have to worry about remembering what to say and you should be able to focus on the performance. You should try to follow the script but also leave room for spontaneous moments. Work in feeling and a sense of importance or excitement into your article to catch the watcher right from the start and keep them interested throughout.;
, The better your script and filming, the less time you spend on editing. Focus on delivering the speech straight to the camera and never second guessing yourself. If you want, practice without the camera on a couple of times to be sure that you efficiently deliver the speech.

, Try to avoid leaning over, fixing your hair, stuttering or fixing your clothes. Distracting movements will only inhibit you from doing your best. If you need any props, keep them on a small table to the side of you so that it is not visible to the camera. Try not to say things like ""um"" or ""and"" over and over. If you want you can put a full length mirror behind the camera so that you can see yourself and watch the way you move, but be sure not to use this as an excuse to fix your clothes or hair and be careful to look at the camera instead of the mirror the majority of the time.

, If you're doing this outside, at home or anywhere else where there might be people or noises try your best to cut down on extra noise during the filming. Let people know that you're going to be filming and you need it to be as quiet as possible. If you have animals try to keep them out of the frame and preferably in a different room.

, This is the most important step. Make sure that you are not distracted or tempted to look away from the camera at all. Videos in which people don't maintain eye contact are never as effective or nice to watch as videos where the person does. You'll probably feel a little silly talking to a camera, so take a deep breath and treat it just like you're having a normal conversation with someone. If it helps to envision someone you like to talk to as the camera than do that, whatever works you should do.

, You are your worst enemy, so try not to worry too much about everything you do. Have fun and let go. If you make a mistake don't let it show and no one will ever notice, so go on as if nothing happened and have fun with it.

, If you need help don't be afraid to ask! You can also find good instructions for video editing if you do a google search or a wikiHow search. It doesn't have to be perfect and if this is your first time creating a video don't worry too much about the editing.

, Send it in an e-mail to your friends and family or keep a copy on a CD or thumb drive to show to people if you want to.

Take local customs in stride.",How to Keep Your Sense of Humor While Traveling," When you are away from the comfort of your home, there is no telling what the world has in store for you. So while the best laid plans are perfect to make, don't be surprised, alarmed or disappointed if there is a detour in your path.;
, For as much as you would love to have your way 100 percent of the time, life doesn't work like that. On a vacation, you may be forced to accept your second or third choice as opposed to always getting your first choice when it comes to room selection, hotel you stay in, or time you have to schedule something. That's OK, though, just be grateful that you are away from the stresses of home and work, and enjoy the company you are with and new friends that you make along the way.

, If the maid forgets to bring clean towels, take the two minutes to call down to the front desk and politely ask them to send them up. It's not worth grumbling about something that should not have any impact on the overall enjoyment of your trip just for the sake of hearing yourself complain.

, It takes fewer muscles in your face to smile than it does to frown, so put those muscles to good use by brightening not only your day but that of those around you.

, If your gate attendant is slow and not moving as fast as you would like him to, or the server at the fancy restaurant you are at forgot something on your order, use a little humility and treat that person how you would want to be treated. You never know if someone is having a terrible day, and your simple act of kindness, patience or forgiveness can make the situation better or at least less volatile than it could be.

, If someone frustrates you, make light of the situation to save face for all parties involved and gracefully exit without incidence.

, While they may not be what you are used to, using humor and enjoying yourself while you acclimate yourself to these activities and the culture will help you ease into acceptance and enjoyment.

Stay calm.,

Never give up.",How to Live on a Deserted Island," The most important thing for you to do at first is to remain calm and try to think clearly. If you start to panic, you can lose control and end up forfeiting your chances of survival. You won't do that well if you've driven yourself crazy. William Golding's novel 'Pincher Martin' is a great example that illustrates how you can't do anything unless you 'take control', because the main character in the story lets panic get the better of him. Try making a ""buddy"" out of an object or animal near you, and talk to them to calm down. You should make 'safety, water, shelter and food' your main priorities, in that order.;
, Start by asking yourself if the area around you is safe. Look around again and check if there are there any wild animals lurking in close proximity? Does it appear like there could be a flooding risk? The first important step is establishing whether the place where you are is physically safe.

, Almost all people who are lost out at sea are found in a matter of hours or days. Science tells us that the human body can survive up to 2 weeks without food, but just 3-4 days without water. So if there is no natural source of fresh water, start looking for a way to collect rainwater.


Any source of water is great! As long as you have found a source of water, you can try to purify or desalinate it later.

, This will purify it.

If you have a desalination device, that's even better! If not, don't fret, there are actually several methods by which you can desalinate water.
One such method is distillation. To distillate water, construct a solar still, or one that works over a fire.
A solar still can be built by filling a large, flat container with salt water or even urine which can be re-used, if the need arises. Place a smaller container in the center with a rock inside it to hold it in place. Cover it with a thin sheet of plastic or whatever similar material you have and place a rock in the center above the cup. If placed in direct sunlight, the water will evaporate and it will condense on the plastic sheet, which will then run down the sheet and drip into the smaller container.
For a method that works over a fire, create steam and condense the steam by using a large piece of metal or glass placed inside the steam. This will allow the condensed water to run into another container.

, You will need a shelter as protection from the elements and from natural predators as well. The best options are usually a natural shelter such as a cave, or one that you build.


The next step to follow after having found a natural shelter, is to build a more enduring shelter. A shelter acts as a home base, a warm and shady place for you to sleep in, a place for storing your resources, and a hiding place from beasts of prey as well. Ensure that the shelter above the ground so that bugs don't crawl all over you.

, The ocean is filled with life. Try building a low V-shaped wall made of stones at low tide, with the pointed part of the V pointing out towards the sea. At high tide, fish will swim into it, and get trapped as the tide flows out.


There are a lot of edible roots and berries that you can actually consider eating, but do remember to watch out! Some of these roots and berries are poisonous and eating them would probably be fatal. Only eat them if you are sure they are safe to eat.
The most reliable source of food on a deserted island are bugs. Yes, bugs! They can be found everywhere and they are an excellent source of protein, too. If you decide to fish with the bugs instead of eating them, a hook can be fashioned by carving out a stick into a hook shape and putting a barb on it. Tie string to it and you're in business.

, Have you found a source of fresh water? Do you have a long range radio, satellite phone, or any other means of communication? Try to find other people who might be inhabiting the island. Remember that people can be your greatest resource.

, This may seem a bit trivial, but on a deserted island, fire has a number of uses. At the very least, it boosts morale. Fire can also be used to distill water, to cook, and to provide light for you and for your rescuers who can find you if they spot the fire! If you can't start a fire, don't worry, just move on to the next step and keep on trying.

, If you know somehow that there are dangerous animals in the vicinity, use a fire at night time to help keep them at bay. If you have a fire extinguisher, you could use that to ward them off in an emergency. Traps and warning signals (such as snapping twigs) can be used to prevent animals from entering your shelter zone or alert you to their presence., Everyone must work together and ensure that all needs are met, and ensure that all your resources are put to good use.

, If anyone in the group dies, bury them and hold a funeral. This brings some closure, and gives the due respect required while removing a potential source of disease as well., In William Golding's novel 'Pincher Martin', the stranded man actually built a figure out of rocks, which could be seen by passing ships. Recognized mountain distress signals are based on groups of three (six in the UK). A distress signal consists of three fires or piles of rocks placed in a triangle, or three blasts of a whistle, or three flashes of a light, each lit in succession, followed by a one minute pause and repeated until a response is received. Three blasts or flashes is the appropriate response. If you are in clear view of boats, attempt to make a large red X somehow.

, Build big and unnatural looking shapes, with bright colors and something shiny. Use a radio, if available, to contact possible rescuers. Use signal mirrors, fires, flashlights, and whatever else available on hand to draw attention to yourself. This can be done while you wait.

, A desperate act can be lethal. Willpower is what you need to survive without food for weeks. Believe it or not, without the will to live, you won't. Try to envision the great life that you will enjoy one day; if you give up now, that will be the end.

Research the area you will be traveling to ahead of time.,
Carefully plan out your travel schedule and make note of any gaps in your itinerary that can be filled with an exercise routine.,
Pack equipment and information that will help you construct an exercise routine while on vacation.,

Be creative and think about different ways to exercise at your hotel.,
Choose sightseeing and tourist activities which require aerobic activity.",How to Maintain an Exercise Routine While Traveling," Determine whether or not there are any exercise facilities available for out-of-town visitors.


Contact professional gyms and aerobic centers and inquire about weekend passes that may be available for visitors and tourists to purchase. With a pass like this, you can have full access to a workout facility during your vacation.;
,


The best time to schedule an aerobic activity is in the morning. Because many travelers are busy either with business or pleasure during the day, the nighttime can be a difficult time to find the motivation to workout.
Waking up just thirty minutes earlier and incorporating a quick aerobic exercise routine into your day can dramatically transform the rejuvenating effects of your vacation.

,


While you may not be able to feasibly pack heavy weights, a pair of lightweight dumbbells can be very beneficial in a travel workout regimen.
Pack any of the following if it will also help you complete your workouts: a pair of running shoes, lightweight clothing for working out, a pedometer, a heart rate monitor, a small floor mat and an mp3 device or other portable music player if you prefer to workout with music.

, Working out in pairs or groups is a far more effective way to ensure that you don't put off your intended exercise routine. Keeping each other accountable will ensure that you follow through with your exercise goals while on vacation.

, While it is tempting to throw caution and care to the wind and eat whatever you feel like, your exercise routine will be far more effective if you maintain a healthy diet while on vacation.


Bring healthy, non-perishable foods along with you. You can have them as snacks between meals - especially if you're traveling and can't get to restaurants.
If your hotel has restaurant(s), check them out. If you have food allergies, explore gluten free restaurant options in the place(s) you’ll be visiting. You can also ask about room service if you need to rest before exercising.

,


Book rooms at a hotel that has a workout facilities and/or a swimming pool. When the exercise facility and pool are easily accessible, you will be much more likely to utilize these facilities to complete your exercise routine.
Use the hallways and staircases of your hotel as a walking track if you prefer not spending time outdoors. Perform several circuits by crossing the hallways and walking up flights of stairs and then back down. Keep your heart rate up for 20 to 30 minutes for an effective hotel exercise routine.

,


Opt for a walking or cycling tour rather than a tour bus to burn calories and incorporate aerobic activity into your vacation.
Plan a day on your vacation completely devoted to an outdoor task such as hiking, cycling, mountain climbing or even all-day shopping.
Climb stairs instead of taking escalators and elevators.

, Try to stay away from those areas.

, Bring your own toothbrushes and hair products and soap! If you forget this step or usually don't do it, it won't matter because most hotels provide things like that (But not toothbrushes or toothpastes).

, Don't go around dark alleyways at night alone. If you need to go through one at night to do shopping or something take a friend and something like a big rock to throw at in case someone attacks you.

This will make it an easy target for thieves, who may take advantage of your distraction.It's a good idea to keep all luggage within arm's reach at all times, especially when you are checking in.
Be wary about passing your luggage off to a porter or bellhop. At large hotels, some thieves may attempt to imitate staff.;
, Ground level windows are common points of entry for burglars. By requesting a room on the second floor or higher, you'll severely limit the potential of someone breaking into your room from the outside.Ideally, you may want to ask for a room on floors three through five. These will deter break-ins, but can still be reached by emergency personnel, like firemen., Your hotel should not announce your name and room number aloud. Doing so may alert eavesdropping thieves as to where to find your room. If the hotel desk worker says this information out loud, ask for another room.You may feel self-conscious while doing this, but the simple fact is your room number should be private for your own personal security., Especially when traveling with family or in a group, you might be tempted to lay your credit card on the front desk so you can direct your attention elsewhere. This makes your card a prime target for a quick cell phone picture of your credit card information.


Hold your credit card in your hand or keep it in your wallet or purse until the desk worker is ready to process your hotel fee.
Inspect your card after it's returned to you. In some cases, you may be given back the wrong card or a fake., You never know when an emergency will occur. Having your hotel's business card will enable you to provide an address for where you're staying or a number to contact your hotel if the need arises. This is also a useful technique to prevent getting lost in unfamiliar cities.


Keep one business card somewhere visible in your room, like by the phone or on the nightstand, and the other in your wallet or purse., Many hotels offer valet or porter service to assist getting your baggage to your room and to point its features. When accompanied to your room by staff, be sure to leave the door open to minimize any potential accusations of improper behavior.


Do a brief check of the room while the valet, porter, or bellhop is there to verify the room is empty. Check closets, the shower, and behind doors., In some cases, hotel staff may have missed compromised safety features, like broken locks and deadbolts. If you notice that any of the safety features of your room are broken, request a new room.


Lock each door and turn the handle to confirm the lock actually works. This includes deadbolts and safety locks., Most hotel rooms are equipped with an additional safety lock above or below the handle lock and deadbolt on your room's door. Frequently, these locks can be fastened by sliding a piece of metal on a chain into a fixture bolted to the door or door frame.


Some safety locks are installed improperly or on doors/frames that are insufficient. Try pulling the door against the safety lock. If it or the wood strains, moves, or deforms, your safety lock will only provide minimal safety., This is especially important when staying in areas where natural disasters, like earthquakes, are common. Natural disasters can interrupt power and leave you scrambling in the dark. Keep a small flashlight by your bed or on your nightstand so you have light in the event of an emergency.


Many cell phones also come equipped with a flashlight feature. However, many people charge their phone during the night. If a disaster happens, your phone may have little charge. For this reason, having a battery powered travel flashlight is recommended., Hotels usually provide a safe in your room to protect your valuables. Combination safes that you can set yourself are much safer than key-lock safes.Electronics, like laptops, music players, and tablets, are often targeted by thieves, making these prime candidates for room safe storage.
Jewelry and other small valuables are easy to hide in pockets and smuggle out of your room. Keep these in your room safe as well.
If your room safe appears to be poorly made or easy to break into, you may want to forego storing anything in it and use the front desk safe instead.

, Room safes tend to be small, so you may need to split valuables between your room safe and the one at the front desk. Also, larger items simply might not fit into your room safe and may need to be stored in the front desk safe.


When keeping items in the hotel safe, always ask for a written receipt that lists the items you're keeping in the safe.
Most hotels will not insure or replace items stolen from your room safe, but will for items kept in the front desk safe., A glimpse of a designer dress or a fancy suit may tempt hotel workers. Keeping all your luggage zipped closed, especially when you're out for the day, will decrease the risk of a hotel worker taking something.


You might also want to move your luggage to a less visible location, like in a closet or under the bed, to further remove temptation., The small locks used to secure luggage or technology won't deter a serious thief, but they will help prevent casual theft. Thieves often look for the easiest victim, and your locks will send a signal that you're a cautious traveler.These kinds of locks can be found at most hardware stores, technology stores, luggage stores, or through online retailers.

, Open windows or balconies will be easier for a thief to break into. Every time you leave your room, check to make sure each window, balcony, and door leading into/out of your room is closed and secure.Even on higher floors, burglars may be able to easily hop from the balcony of a neighboring room to your own."

Call as far ahead of time as possible.,
Schedule an early or late dinner if availability is limited.,
Be as courteous as possible when booking a reservation.,
Visit the restaurant in person.,
Call ahead or cancel if you are running late.,
Book a reservation online if possible.",How to Make a Reservation2," In many cases, you will be able to make a dinner reservation early in the same day. However, if you are planning the dinner ahead of time, call earlier. This is especially important if you have a large group or have special requirements such as dietary needs. Most restaurants will accept reservations a few days in advance, and exclusive fine dining venues will often accept (or even require) reservations weeks or months in advance.


If you make your reservations more than a few days in advance, it is best to call the day of the dinner to quickly confirm your reservation.

, A helpful way to get a reservation at a heavily booked restaurant is to avoid the dinner ""prime time"" - usually around 7:30 pm. Remain open to booking a reservation at 5:00 pm or even 10:00 pm (depending on the restaurant's hours). This will increase your chances of getting a table the same day or earlier in the week than you expected.

, If you are attempting to book a tough reservation, remember that your attitude on the phone will go a long way. Be confident but polite; avoid giving the impression that you feel entitled to a reservation. Remember, however, that even Michelin-stared restaurants are not in the business of turning away customers. If the host replies that the restaurant has no availability, explain your situation and ask politely if there is any way you can be accommodated in the future.

, A further strategy for booking a tough reservation is asking for availability in person rather than over the phone. This shows that you are willing to put a bit of effort into securing a table. A host is also much less likely to be dismissive or unhelpful when dealing with you face-to-face.

, Once you've secured your reservation, call ahead and apologize if it looks like you'll be up to 20 minutes late. If you are running much later than that, consider canceling and rescheduling your dinner. Remember that reservations are made for a reason - to make sure as many guests as possible are served on each night. If you are late it affects other guests' reservations.

, Some restaurants allow you to book online using websites like OpenTable, Reservation Genie, or through their own proprietary system. Not only do these websites offer the convenience of seeing which time slots are still available for dining, but many of them offer coupons or membership rewards programs through which you can accumulate perks by using the service.


A similar way to accumulate perks like discounts or reservations at exclusive restaurants is through your credit card company. Credit card companies often include restaurant discounts in their rewards programs as a means to attract customers, and some high-profile cards even offer exclusive access to heavily booked restaurants.
If you book your reservation online, you may still want to call ahead and confirm before arriving.

Determine your travel dates.,
Check fares early.,
Check reliable travel websites.,
Contact an airline directly as an alternative option.,
Have some form of credit card.,
Ask for confirmation of the booking.",How to Make a Reservation3," Often, advance booking will ensure that you will get to choose from a variety of routes and the most affordable fares.

, Even if you only have a general idea of when the air travel will take place it is a good idea to start shopping around. If you plan on flying during a major break period such as Christmas or New Year, the proximity of your travel date to the hectic, heavy traffic days can affect your chances of being bumped, missing a flight or just having an unpleasant travel experience. Book early!

, Most travel sites operate in a similar manner. They will prompt you to enter a destination and a specific date of travel. A list will be generated showing results across a number of different airlines. The results can usually be organized by price. Price may be affected by a number of variables including the number of stops made, the destination or departure airport and the proximity to the date of travel.

, If you have an airline that you prefer you can book tickets online in much the same manner as on any of these travel websites. The disadvantage of this method is that you won't be able to compare prices or routes across different airlines.

, The booking itself will require a valid credit card and you will be prompted to enter the credit card number and expiration date in the payment section. You will also be asked for pertinent personal information such as a full name, address and possibly, a passport number for international travel. Make sure you remember to bring the credit card used to pay for your reservation to the airport with you! You may be asked to produce the credit card if the reservation is irretrievable or to prove identity.

, You will most likely be asked if you'd like an e-mail confirmation to be sent to you. Choose to generate this e-mail confirmation because it will come in handy should you need to reference the details of your reservation. In addition, an e-mail confirmation can be printed and used at airport self-service kiosks for check-in. This step will save you the time and irritation of standing in long queues.

Find a hayride near you.,
Choose the type of hayride that you prefer.,
Check for allergies.,
Wear the appropriate clothing.,
Reassure anxious urban folk.,
Expect good old-fashioned jokes or storytelling.",How to Enjoy a Hayride," Many farms offer hayride experiences near to towns and cities. Look in notices in the paper, online, or ask around for recommendations by word-of-mouth. An online search should return many hayride options accompanied by your locale.;
, A hayride can be traditional or modern. The traditional version will use a horse and cart filled with hay. The modern version might use a tractor pulling along a cart, although you might find some farms use vintage tractors to enhance the fun. Alternately, it might use a vintage truck filled at the back with hay.

, Not everyone has fun around hay; for those with allergies to dried plant material, this could set in train respiratory, nasal, and eye reactions that mar the experience. If you know this is the case, children or adults who might be affected are probably best to while away the time on a different activity. Alternately, seek advice from a health professional about anti-allergy medications.

, Hay is fun but messy. Wear old clothes that you don't mind getting dirty and filled with burrs, sticks, etc.

, If your kids or fellow adults are a bit concerned about mussing about in the hay, tell them it's fine. Let the kids roll in it, jump on it before the vehicle starts moving, so that they can familiarize themselves with it.

, Hayrides hearken back to times when the harvest was a whole-of-family or even community affair and it was a good occasion to bolster the spirits of the hard-workers collecting the hay for storage by cracking jokes or telling stories. A good hayride will encourage this tradition still.

Include your kids in holiday planning.,
Help your kids shop for gifts.,
Coordinate gifts with your co-parent.,
Create new holiday traditions.,
Maintain some stability.,
Concentrate on positivity around your kids.",How to Enjoy the Holidays as a Single Parent1," Ask your kids what their hopes and expectations are for the holidays. If they want to try something new and it’s feasible for you, give it a shot! Don’t give them too much to do, however--it might be stressful, especially if they feel torn between both parents. And don't feel bad if your budget no longer allows for the kind of holidays you've had in the past. Chances are, your kids are just happy to spend the holiday with you., Don’t make your kids feel guilty for wanting to get their other parent or their extended family gifts. Take an active role by taking them shopping, offering suggestions, or, for younger kids, giving them money to spend on gifts. Be honest with your kids if your budget has changed since becoming single--you don't want them to think that you're refusing to help them buy gifts., You don’t want your kids to end up with two bicycles, so get in touch with your ex and coordinate gift-buying. Don’t try to compete with your ex over gifts--focus on what’s best for your kids and don’t involve the children in gift discussions. If you don’t have a cooperative relationship with your children’s other parent, it might be a good idea to get your kids a gift card and go shopping for a gift after the holiday.Don't try to compete with your ex. If you can't spend as much on a gift as they can, spend quality time with your children instead.

, This isn’t the same holiday as the ones you had before your split, so don’t try to copy it exactly. This is a great opportunity to add in new family traditions with just you and your kids--visiting extended family, making new foods, or taking a trip., Adding new traditions is a good idea, but don’t replace everything. Your kids need to know that even if the way you celebrate changes a little, the holidays will always be a time for family. Keep your family’s favorite traditions, like reading Christmas stories, eating ham on Thanksgiving, or celebrating Kwanzaa between Christmas and New Year’s., The first holiday after a split is difficult for everybody, but make an ongoing effort to be as positive as possible around your children. Keep them smiling by reminding them of their favorite holiday stories, serving their favorite foods, and showing them new ways to enjoy the holiday."

Inform your host.,

Eat well in the days beforehand.,
Eat before you go.",How to Enjoy Holiday Parties on a Pre‐Pregnancy Diet1," You don’t want your host to think you are being rude when you do not eat or drink certain things. When you RSVP for a party, let them know that you are on a special diet. Ask them what the menu is to make sure that you have something to eat at the party.


If you don’t mind your host knowing that you are planning to conceive, you can say, “I am on a pre-pregnancy diet right now, and I was wondering what the menu would be like.”
If you do not want your host to know, you can say, “I’m on a restricted diet this year, and I was hoping I could look over the menu to see if I need to bring something for myself.”;
, If it is a potluck or if your host allows you, you might bring a dish to the party that aligns with your diet. There should be enough for everyone at the party, but you can choose a dish that fits into your special diet.You can ask the host, “Do you want me to bring anything? Since I’m on a diet anyways, I can bring a healthy option to the party.”
Some good pre-pregnancy dishes you might consider bringing include a spinach salad with nuts, a pan of roasted vegetables, a fruit plate, or whole-grain bread rolls.

, You should not skip meals on a pre-pregnancy diet, as your body should be adjusting to the regular three-meal diet that you should maintain while you are pregnant.Skipping meals can also cause you to eat more at parties, and it might tempt you to eat foods that you shouldn’t., If you stick to your pre-pregnancy diet before you go to the party, it will not matter as much if you slip a little bit. While you should be cutting down on bad fats and processed sugar, an occasional treat will not harm a future pregnancy.


You can designate, if choose, your party as your cheat meal. These meals can help you lose weight on your diet by reducing cravings and boosting your metabolism.If there is a chance you are already pregnant, you should avoid alcohol, soft cheeses, undercooked meat, cured meats, and raw dairy., A great way to avoid temptation at a party is to have a meal before you go. Leave a little room for treats during the party, but eat something healthy and light so that you are not starving. This can help prevent you from eating the wrong types of food at the party."

You do not have to explain why unless you want to. Simply state, “No, thank you,” and move on.If your host insists that you try something, you might take a small portion to try a taste. Tell them that it was delicious. You can say, “You’re right. That’s amazing. But I’m so full right now off of all the other food that I can’t possibly eat another bite.”

, There can be heavy pressure at holiday parties to drink alcohol, but you should be avoiding alcohol during your pre-pregnancy diet. Avoid this pressure by gently insisting that you cannot drink at that party. Let them know that you have specific health reasons for abstaining.


You might say, “We’re trying to get pregnant, so I have to avoid alcohol this year.”
If you do not want people to know about your attempts to conceive, you might come up with an excuse. For example, you can say, “I can’t drink right now. I’m on medication that doesn't allow it,” or “I’m the designated driver tonight, so no alcohol.”

, If you don’t mind explaining your pre-pregnancy diet, you might tell people that you are on it. This might help reduce the pressure you receive from other people. Let them know what a pre-pregnancy diet does and why it is important that you watch what you eat this holiday season.


You might say, “What a mother eats before pregnancy can impact the health of the baby. I am on a diet to prepare my body for pregnancy.”If you do not want people to know that you are trying to conceive, you might say, “I’m on a diet right now. It’s important for my health right now that I avoid certain foods.”

, It is important that you do not get sick, as it can delay pregnancy or cause problems early in the pregnancy. In addition to washing your hands often, you should make sure that you do not mix up your plate, cup, or utensils with anybody else's.If you lose your cup, ask for another one.

Bring a mint or stick of gum.",How to Enjoy Holiday Parties on a Pre‐Pregnancy Diet4," If you want to sample the wide variety of foods available at the party, you can take just a small amount—enough for one or two bites.This will help you enjoy the holiday fare while reducing the amount of calories, fat, and sugar that you eat. A small amount will not ruin your pre-pregnancy diet, and it can prevent you from binging later.

, Folic acid is extremely important both before and during pregnancy. It can prevent the baby from neural tube defects like spinal bifida.Folic acid can be found in leafy greens (like spinach and kale), citrus (like oranges and limes), eggs, nuts, broccoli, beans, fish, and brown rice. Some common holiday items that are full of folic acid include:Roasted Chestnuts
Spinach salad
Lentil loaf
Chili with kidney beans
Chocolate covered strawberries
Cranberry-orange relish
Green bean casserole
Deviled eggs
Roasted Brussels sprouts

, Iron is an important mineral in pregnancy. Increasing your iron intake will prepare your body for a growing baby. When looking for iron at your party, find meats such as beef and poultry, fish, beans, legumes, cabbage, and whole-grain breads.Some holiday friendly options you might look out for include:


Collard greens
Dark-meat turkey
A rack of lamb
Whole-grain bread rolls

, If you do not have enough calcium, you may have bone problems during pregnancy, as a baby will pull calcium from your bones.Start stocking up on calcium early. Look for low-fat dairy products, broccoli, figs, tofu, and almonds.Some holiday options might include:


Tofurkey
Low-fat store-bought eggnog
Raw broccoli and ranch
While you can eat cheeses, you should start avoiding soft cheeses such as brie or camembert to reduce your chance of contracting listeriosis before pregnancy., When in doubt, you should look out for vegetable options at the party. These are generally healthy and high in other vitamins. Try to avoid options that are high in fat or salt. Some vegetable dishes you might find include:


Roasted squash
Mashed sweet potatoes
Glazed carrots
Corn on the cob

, You do not have to skip dessert entirely, but you should reduce the amount of processed sugar that you eat.Limit yourself to one cookie, slice of cake, piece of pie, or candy per party.


You can aim to eat fruits instead of processed sugars. Some fruit desserts still contain processed sugar, but the amount may be lower than in other desserts. You might pick foods like a fruit tart, dark chocolate-covered strawberries, or baked apples.
Scope out the dessert table at the beginning of the party, so that you can choose whichever dessert will fulfill your craving the most.

, Alcohol is discouraged if you are actively trying to become pregnant, as any exposure to alcohol early in the pregnancy can cause Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.Instead, drink water or choose a festive non-alcoholic version.

Also, avoid believing that you are cursed and every holiday will be like this one. Maintain hope that future ones can be enjoyable.

, Poor mood and alcohol related fatalities are more common near Christmas.Many people feel loneliness over the holidays for various reasons. Often the holidays are a reminder of our family and relationships with others. Know that it's okay and common to feel down from time to time, particularly during the holidays.Find others who you can talk to openly about what you're feeling. You may find more people who feel what you feel than you think.
Remember that the holidays are what you make of it. They are not predetermined. Particularly as an adult, you can make choices about how, where, and with who you want to spend your time.

Start a holiday tradition.,
Gather materials for a holiday-themed activity.,
Make a point to connect with a few particular people.,
Try to let go of fixed expectations.,
Take the opportunity to practice open-mindedness.",How to Enjoy a Holiday at Home2," Traditions can be an enjoyable part of getting together with the same folks for certain holidays every year. Specific tradition vary, of course. Go with something traditional, like reading the same short holiday book together, or something inspired by the spirit of the holiday.For instance, during the winter holidays, you and your family member could all spend an afternoon volunteering together. Have a different family member choose the organization to volunteer with every year.

, Whether you’re hosting or visiting home for the holidays, a planned holiday activity is something everyone can enjoy. For instance, have everyone bring over a pumpkin or other gourd to carve at a fall holiday party. Similarly, you can gather pine bows and pine cones so everyone can make a wreath for the winter holidays., You’re never going to please everyone. More to the point, you likely won’t even be able to spend quality time with everyone when you’re home for the holidays. Decide beforehand who you want to catch up with this time around and initiate conversations or activities with them during your time together., This is much easier said than done, but it’s an important part of maintaining familial relationships. The fact of the matter is: if you have specific expectations about other people’s behaviors, it’s unlikely they’re going to fit these expectations perfectly. In turn, this may frustrate or otherwise upset you.Instead of having fixed expectations about peoples behavior or specific things you'd like to have happen, try to approach the holiday together with a mindset that emphasizes getting along.
When you feel yourself become frustrated with a family member’s behavior, remind yourself that holiday gatherings are for nurturing connections, and that issues that need to be addressed are best addressed in other contexts. Avoid starting arguments. Let go of your expectations about the holiday, and be open to whatever happens at the gathering.

, It’s extremely common for disagreements or differences in perspective to arise when all of the family is home together. If a serious issue needs to be addressed, do so, but it may otherwise be best to let small differences in opinion pass when everyone is home together for the holidays."
"
Let friends know you’re around.,
Plan an activity and invite others.,
Reach out to far-away loved ones.",How to Enjoy a Holiday at Home3," If you’re staying home for the holidays, it certainly doesn’t mean you have to spend them alone. In fact, friends who are staying in your area will probably be glad to see you over the holidays. Give them a phone call or reach out through another method of correspondence beforehand.Say something like, “Hey! I just wanted to mention that I’m not traveling for the upcoming holiday, so I’ll be around. If anything fun is going on or you’d like to get together, let me know.”

, Be proactive and plan a social activity. You can model it around whichever holiday people may be celebrating, or simply take advantage of the free time to do something you and your friends enjoy. The specifics are up to you - go on a hike, hit an art museum, or invite friends to play basketball.Be sure to invite folks ahead of time so they can plan to attend.
If you just moved to an area or if you don't know many people near you, you might use the internet to organize a meeting.

, Even though you may not be able to see loved ones if you’re home for a holiday, you can still share the holiday spirit with them by getting in touch. Especially if you know a family gathering is happening elsewhere, give them a call during the festivities and have everyone pass the phone around.If letters are more your speed, sitting down to write loved ones is another great way to share the holiday spirit.

Start that creative endeavor you’ve been curious about.,
Try meditation.,
Get that task done finally.",How to Enjoy a Holiday at Home4," Almost everyone has the urge to create, but many people struggle to find the time to pursue creative projects. Holidays at home provide the perfect opportunity to finally try that creative hobby you’ve been interested in.Whether sketching, playing music, or taking photos, set aside the holiday to spend time expressing yourself creatively. If necessary, make sure to get the materials ahead of time.

, You’ve likely heard about the benefits of meditation, and have maybe even tried it a couple times before. It can admittedly be hard to get the hang of, but free time over the holidays gives you extra time to practice. Make a point of sitting down everyday to meditate, even if only for ten minutes.Once you make a habit of meditating, you’ll experience more of the benefits and be more likely to work meditation into your daily life.

, You know that home improvement or cleaning project you've been putting off? A holiday at home provides the perfect opportunity to check it off the list. Plus, you'll likely find it easier to wind down in the evening if you get something productive done during your holiday at home."

Rekindle connections with family and friends.,
Try meeting new people and connecting with acquaintances.,
Volunteer.,
Join an activity group.,
Find connections through a support group.,
Take a trip.",How to Cope with Loneliness During the Holidays2," Sometimes when we're feeling down or lonely, we feel even greater desire to isolate ourselves from others. Resist this urge to avoid or ignore others. While there may be certain people you want to avoid, try connecting with those in your past that love and support you.Reach out to an old friend who you haven't spoken with in a while. Talk by phone, text, or in person.
Spend time one-on-one with friends and family or in small groups of three or four people to have a more personal connection with them around the holidays. Sometimes large parties or gatherings can feel isolating if you're not feeling connected to the people there. Being in a smaller group may make it easier for you to relax and connect with people.
Try putting grudges aside and opening up to others who care about you. Give yourself ample time to recover after these gatherings if they are difficult for you, but don't avoid them.

, Sometimes we ignore, or are too busy to connect with, our acquaintances or neighbors. Instead, make a point to talk or spend time with them. Reach out and talk with new people, rather than distancing yourself.Offer some holiday treats or goodies as an icebreaker to open up the conversation.
If you're feeling shy, try making the conversation more about them. Act as a good listener and often people will feel more at ease.
Avoid putting your emotional baggage on new people. Try getting to know them in a general way first through common interests.

, Helping others in your community can help you connect with something bigger than yourself. It can be a reminder that there is much to be thankful for in life. It can also feel rewarding on a personal level and make you feel better.Find a cause that you believe in, and talk with the organization about how you can contribute your time and skills.
Consider charities such as Toys for Tots or the Salvation Army which often have volunteer needs during the holidays.
If you have a talent for crafts or playing music, use those talents to make gifts or host a small concert for those in retirement and nursing homes, for example.

, Finding groups with common interests or similar challenges as yourself can help you feel grounded and hopeful during the holiday season. Consider joining activity groups that keep you focused on the positive.Consider activity groups online such as Meetup.com, where you can find a variety of people with different interests. You may have an opportunity to meet new people and share common interests.
Connect with your church, place of worship, or a community center. There may be holiday activities that foster connection and community. This can help to alleviate loneliness.

, If you're struggling with a recent life transition such as divorce, a recent death, or family crisis, consider reaching out to support groups in your community. Support groups provide a sense of camaraderie through shared challenges or life experiences.


Connect with a counselor in your area about possible support groups through them or elsewhere that fit your needs.
Search online or via local counseling centers for listings of support groups in your area or region.
See a support group as a safe space where you can express yourself without judgment.

, Visiting a new place with a friend or significant other may help to combat loneliness during the holidays. By getting out of your usual environment and exploring somewhere new, you can have some great new experiences. You may also meet some new people and make new friends along the way."

Focus on activities that bring you joy.,
Practice self-care in mind and body.,
Avoid social media.,
Consider therapy to improve coping with these feelings.,
Get help for self-destructive behaviors.",How to Cope with Loneliness During the Holidays3," Doing what you love can distract you from thoughts of loneliness and make you feel more at ease. Whether you love to play video games or watch classic movies, take time for yourself. Just be sure to balance this with socialization so that you don't isolate yourself. Consider trying new things along the way, such as the following:Doing art projects such as painting, drawing, or crafts.
Building things or completing home projects.
Getting outdoors to run, hike, bike, ski, swim, or play.
Exercising or going to the gym.
Listening to or playing music.
Reading books you love or writing stories.

, Your thoughts and feelings are connected to your overall physical health. The more you take care of your body, the more you will feel happy and empowered to take care of yourself. If you feel more rested and relaxed, you'll likely feel less lonely.Get plenty of rest.
Eat healthy and drink plenty of water.
Relax with a hot bath or shower.
Practice deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.

, Modern technology has this wonderful ability to connect us, as well as remind us of what we don't have. If you are an avid social media junkie, you may find yourself seeing happy faces and cute photos of friends and family during the holidays. This may lead to loneliness or envy. Step away from social media and focus on you.Limit your time on social media. Avoid using it throughout the day. If you feel the need to check it, consider doing it once or twice in the middle of the day. Try to make a few positive, encouraging statements on others' posts to help keep your attitude in check. Don't look at social media sites such as Facebook or Instagram right before bed. You may be more vulnerable to feeling lonely late at night.
If you need to feel connected, consider calling a friend or family member, or messaging someone directly. Passively checking social media could make you feel more isolated even if you are scrolling through other people's personal lives and thoughts.

, Therapy can help to provide you with skills and self-awareness. If you have persistent feelings of loneliness that seem to linger for weeks or months, it may be better to seek help from a counselor. They can help you navigate your feelings.Therapy can help you to focus on you. Use it as a way to discuss your feelings of loneliness in a safe space.
Discuss about what expectations you have for the holidays and for yourself. A therapist is trained to tease out what may be really bothering you. If you already have a therapist, consider scheduling ahead in anticipation of the holiday season to ensure that you are on the books.

, Avoid using substances such as alcohol or drugs to cope with loneliness. Alcohol is a depressant, and can make you feel more down. If you are having thoughts of self-harm or suicide, see immediate help. You're not alone.

Ask the person what their half-birthday is.,
Ask the person to describe their favorite birthday.,
Have a general conversation about birthdays.,
Look for their birthstone.,
Ask a mutual friend or relative.,
Check the person's info on Facebook.,
Do a little Facebook digging.,
Use other social networking sites.,
Use an online database.,
Peek at a friend's calendar.,
Check your phone for old “happy birthday” messages.,
Look through your credit history.,
Have a background check performed.",How to Find out Someone's Birthday," Sneaky trick: have a discussion about half-birthdays. Tell your friend that your half-birthday is coming up, and ask when their half-birthday is, then do your calculations later to find the real date. You can usually get someone to spill the beans indirectly, without having to make a fuss. Easy as pie.;
, Casually ask the person about his or her favourite birthday. Ask him or her what it was like, and see if you can pick up what time of year it was from the context, based on whether or not the person mentions a season, an upcoming holiday, or even whether it was hot or snowing. This might jog your memory.

, Casually mention your birthday and see if the person reveals anything about his or her birthday. You can say, “Man, I hate being born in the summer. Nobody’s ever around to go to my birthday party!” Or, “I love having a March birthday. It gives me something to look forward to during bad weather.”


You can also say something like, “Only one month until my birthday” or even “Just another few weeks until my half birthday.” To see if the person chimes in, mentioning when his or her birthday is, too.
Try asking the person about their astrological sign. Say something like, “I’m an Aries, which means I’m pretty moody. What’s your sign again?”

, Some girls like to wear jewelry with their birthstones on it; for example, Opal is the birthstone of October. If the girl is wearing some jewelry with a stone on it, you can say, “Is that your birthstone? What is that?” If it is the girl’s birthstone, she’ll tell you what it is, and then you’ll know the month when she was born. If it’s not, then she might give you a hint by saying, “No, this isn’t. My birthstone is emerald.”

, If you and the person in question have any mutual friends, consider asking the friend to tell you the appropriate birthdate. If they don't know, ask the friend to find out for you. You don’t have to be coy about it. Just say that you genuinely forgot the person’s birthday and that you feel bad about it. You don’t need to be super sneaky to get an answer.

, The easiest way is to check to see if the person has listed their birthday on Facebook. If you have an account, you can log in, then type the name of the person you're looking for. When you get to their timeline, click on the info box below their profile picture.


If it's listed, the person's birthday should be under ""basic info."" Note that you may have to add the person as a friend for this to work.
Many people only list the date that they were born, though, instead of the year. If you're looking for the years as well, then this method may be less helpful.

, Try scrolling down the person's timeline to see when there is an explosion of people saying ""happy birthday!"". If you find this somewhere on the person’s timeline, then chances are, this is the person's real birthday.


Look through the person's Facebook photos. See if you can find a photo of the person celebrating her birthday. Though this may not give you the exact date since not all photos are posted the day they were taken, it can give you a good ballpark idea.

, If Facebook was a no go, then you may also like to look at other social networking sites or sites where the person keeps his or her information obvious, such as blogs or portfolios. Other social networking sites may list birthdays, and even if the person's birthday does not appear on the site, you may be able to figure it out by seeing other posts, Tweets, or photos. Check out the following to see if you have any luck:


Twitter
Instagram
The person's website or blog
Tumblr

, There are a number of databases out there that you can try for little to no fee. For these to work, you'll generally have to know the full name of the person you're searching and their approximate age. You may get a number of people with the same name and different addresses, so it can help to know where the person lives, especially if the person’s name is more common.


To begin, try Birth Databaseor Zabasearch. As long as you know the first and last name and the approximate age of the person, the site will usually be able to return a birthdate. However, they vary in their reliability.

, Most people won't put their birthday on their own calendar, but it's more likely a friend might have it marked. Keep an eye on their calendar for things like ""John's Birthday"" or ""Birthday party!""

, If you knew the person during his or her last birthday, then there’s a pretty good chance that you sent the person a “happy birthday!” text message. Scroll through all of your messages with this person to see if you can find this exchange. If it’s there, then you’ll know the exact date of the person’s birth. Good job, you old sleuth!


Check their phone, too. If you want to look without offending the person, you can say, “Hey, can I see the calendar on your phone for a sec? I need to check up on something.”

, If you gave the person a birthday present the previous year, or took the person out to dinner, or paid for a gift with your credit card, then you can check your old bank statements to find the date that you did this. Though you’ll have to remember what you got the person or where you went to dinner, this can help you find the date.


Remember that you might not have bought the gift right on the person’s birthday and you might not have taken the person out exactly on his or her birthday, either. Still, this could get you close to that magic date.

, If you don't have all of the proper info after your own digging, you may elect to try a fee-based service and have a background check performed on the person. This could be something like publicbackgroundchecks, where you pay a small sum for a little bit of information.


Just make sure that the service is legitimate before you fork over any money. Consider whether or not this is a better option than just asking the person yourself.

Give homemade presents.,
Save money on wrapping and cards.,
Buy group gifts.,
Shop the sales.",How to Deal with Unexpected Holiday Expenses1," If you are stuck giving gifts that you didn't plan for (e.g. to co-workers who surprised you with a gift), or if you're simply overwhelmed by your expenses during the holidays, there are many homemade gifts that you can make for a minimal cost. Try to customize gifts based on the recipient's preferences, which will make the gesture more meaningful and personal. Some good homemade present ideas are:


Folded star holiday ornaments
Scented candles
Holiday cookie bouquets
Scented bath bombs;
, The cost of holiday wrapping paper, accessories (such as bows, ribbon, and scotch tape), and cards can add up if you don’t make a conscious effort to spend wisely. Opt to shop at dollar stores for these items, or buy in bulk and use things for several years. Try shopping after-holiday sales for discounted holiday wrapping paper and gift bags. Save gift bags and bows that are still in good condition to re-use next season., When possible, make the cost-effective choice to buy group gifts rather than individual gifts. Rather than purchasing individual gifts for co-workers, for instance, buy a gift to be shared by everyone at the office (e.g. leave chocolates or cookies in the break room to be shared by the work team.) Buy one gift for a couple that both people can enjoy together (such as a bottle of wine) or one gift for a family to share (a board game to be played together, for example.)A gift certificate for a movie theater or restaurant is another great group gift that can be given to a family or couple to enjoy together.
Items for the home (e.g. a kitchen appliance like a food processor) can be a good gift for a cohabiting couple to share.

, You can save a significant amount of money by shopping for the holidays in advance and taking advantage of big sale events like Black Friday. To save travel time and hassle, do your homework by comparing store ads to determine the best deals before going shopping. Set a budget before shopping to avoid overspending.For example, you can shop for a blue tooth speaker set on Black Friday by comparing the advertised sales for leading electronics stores and department stores.

Try new things.,
Be spontaneous.,
Make something together.,
Collaborate with each other.,
Surprise each other.,
Have realistic expectations.",How to Create Holiday Traditions As a Newly Married Couple1," Part of creating your own traditions involves doing things for the holidays that you've never done before. This is especially important if you've decided not to spend time with either of your families during the holidays. Have a few ideas of things that sound fun to do. You'll soon find what things you'd like to keep as traditions and which ones to leave behind. Some ideas include:Ice skating
Decorating your home
Baking food together
Seeing a festive movie;
, You might feel like you need to plan and organize your traditions, but you should also allow some flexibility. Saying yes to an impromptu concert or show might be a great way to find a new favorite tradition. Remember that all traditions have to start somewhere!


If you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious about the holiday traditions, take a break and just do something fun with your spouse.

, If you'll be celebrating the holidays just the two of you, spend some time creating things. You could bake cookies or make a fancy dessert, write cards to send to family, or create your own gifts to send to friends and family. You'll be making memories as a couple.


Keep in mind what your spouse enjoys doing. If your spouse would rather shop for friends and family, consider doing a shopping trip date. Make it special and go out for a nice dinner beforehand.

, Traditions are best when they're made together. If you feel like you're the one making all the decisions, get your spouse involved. Take turns with planning new ideas for traditions. For example, you could plan one event or activity for one day and your spouse could be responsible for the next day's activities.


Taking turns with traditions should also relieve some of the pressure to make the traditions. Creating holiday traditions should be fun.

, Make the holiday special for your spouse by doing something you know they'd really appreciate. This is especially important if you know your spouse is disappointed at not being able to celebrate some of their favorite holiday traditions.


For example, if you and your spouse can't be with your spouse's extended family when they watch their favorite holiday movie, surprise your spouse. See if any local theatres are playing the show on the big screen or just plan a special night in to watch the movie together.

, Avoid setting yourself for disappointment by expecting the perfect holiday while trying out your new holiday traditions. Realize that you might try things that don't work out as you planned. Just go into the holiday with the goal of having fun together as a newly married couple.


Be honest with your spouse about how the holiday traditions are going. It's better to tell your spouse exactly how you feel so you don't feel the need to do the tradition again next year.

If need to be, double the amount of cheese to lessen any spice taste or whip in cream cheese to equalize the flavors.

Get a part-time holiday job.,
Offer babysitting services.,
Sell unwanted belongings.",How to Deal with Unexpected Holiday Expenses2," The holiday season offers many opportunities to make extra money, as many businesses require extra help during this time. Look at online job boards or company websites to see what part-time positions might be available, and have your CV ready to apply to as many as possible. You’re likely to find work at:


Major retail stores (e.g. Toys “R” Us, Best Buy)
Shipping companies (FedEx or UPS)
Restaurants and bars

, Babysitting services are in high demand during the holiday season, particularly for parents wishing to attend holiday parties or shop for their kids. Advertise locally in churches, community centers, and on bulletin boards of local businesses. You can also advertise on a website that connects babysitters and parents (such as Sittercity).Rates for babysitting can range from $7-10 per hour in smaller towns up to $20 in larger cities like New York.

, If you want quick cash to cover your unexpected holiday expenses, try selling some of your unwanted belongings. Post ads on Craigslist, Ebay, or social media sites (e.g. on Facebook ""buy and trade"" groups) and be sure to include clear pictures that convey that the items are in good condition. If online resources don't work, you can also opt to sell things at a flea market or yard sale. Renting a table or getting a permit will both cost a fee, but the odds of selling your items are good.For instance, you can try to sell a lamp that no longer fits your decor by posting an ad on Craigslist (with a good picture of the lamp included.)
If you wish to sell a collection of books or DVDs, a yard sale or table at a flea market is an easier option than posting ads for all the individual items in the set.

Open a sub-savings account.,
Make travel plans early.,
Buy emergency gifts.",How to Deal with Unexpected Holiday Expenses3," Save money specifically for your holiday expenses - in general, people tend to save more money when they are saving for a particular goal. Speak to an agent at your financial institution about opening a new savings account where you would save $10 or $20 a month during the year. When the holiday season arrives, cash it out for an extra boost to your shopping budget., As a general rule, air travelers who book a month and a half in advance get the best rates possible, while people who book less than two weeks in advance pay over $100 more, on average, for their fares. Prices for air, rail, and bus travel all go up around the holidays when tickets are in high demand. Book your trip at least a month in advance if possible, and take the time to look for online deals or promotions.Keep checking fares for your trip after you've booked; some airlines will reimburse you for drops in their itinerary prices.

, The best way to prepare for unexpected gift-giving (e.g. a host gift for a last minute party) is to purchase gifts ahead of time to keep on hand. Purchasing “emergency” gifts when things are on sale (right after the holidays, for example) will save you money and keep you prepared for the next holiday season. Some gift ideas to consider might be:A serving platter
Scented candles
Wine glass markers
Cheese knives
Stationery
A flower vase

Discuss the traditions you each followed with your families.,
Keep the traditions you both enjoy.,
Divide your time among your families.,
Expect time conflicts.,
Drop traditions you don't enjoy.,
Set aside time just for the two of you.",How to Create Holiday Traditions As a Newly Married Couple2," Take some time to talk with your spouse about all of the traditions they celebrated with their family. If your spouse isn't being very detailed, ask specific questions. Then explain the traditions that you grew up with.For example, if you spouse says that their family would always eat a nice meal for the holiday, ask for details about what they ate. You might find that your spouse has specific memories of the holiday meal that are important to them.

, Once you've talked about the traditions you both grew up with, choose which traditions you want to continue celebrating as a couple and which ones you don't want to celebrate. Be aware that since the two of you will be celebrating instead of your whole families, the tradition may feel different or strange. It may just take some time getting used to.For example, if your family traditionally did a big holiday dinner buffet and you'd like to keep that tradition, you may just want to scale it back for the two of you.

, As a newlywed, you might feel like you have to split your time evenly among both of your families. Talk with your spouse about how both of you would like to spend the holiday time. You might find that your spouse only wants to spend a limited amount of time with their family.Keep in mind that you can rotate holidays, if you're worried that families won't want to split your time.

, Holidays as part of a couple can be overwhelming when everyone expects you to drop in for a little. At some point, you'll probably miss part of a friend's party or a family meal. To be prepared for this, talk with your spouse about what events or celebrations are a priority. Make it clear to your friends and family if you will be able to make it to their event or not.


For example, if you want to attend your friend's holiday gathering, but your spouse needs to be at their family's big holiday celebration, you'll probably have to go to the family celebration. Ask your friend if you can meet up at some point during the holidays.

, Consider how many traditions both of you are used to celebrating. If there are a lot of traditions or ones you don't enjoy celebrating, you might want to choose some to drop. Not feeling tied to the traditions can make you enjoy the traditions that you do choose to celebrate. If a conflict comes up, be honest with your spouse to reach a compromise.


For example, you might say, ""I'm not going to do holiday baking this year because I really don't enjoy it."" If your spouse is upset that there won't be any holiday treats, ask your spouse if they're willing to do the baking. Or offer to buy holiday baked goods.

, It's easy to get caught up in festivities and activities, but remember that creating new holiday traditions with your spouse is important. Take a break from friends and family so you can do something fun and unique with your spouse. You don't have to do something traditional, just enjoy each other's company.If you're feeling overstretched, realize that it's okay to cut back on family time. For example, if you usually attend three holiday celebrations on the holiday, only go to one and spend the remaining time together.

Instead of decorating the whole room, make a fort and say its the 'den' and fill the blanket draped chairs with items suggested, to make it even more forest like, you could use camouflage blankets and cover them with stick and leaves, if strong enough.
Take out spider webs from Halloween and decorate a few corners with the spider webs.
Cover door ways with green silk or fabric, and cut some of the fabric into slivers making a vine themed door entrance way.

,


For the kits' room, you could have tons of pillows and small stuffed animals and spider webs scrunched into soft play balls. Place leaves on the pillows and spread dyed or glow in the dark spiderwebs around the room to look like moss.
For the 'warriors' den make small nests of green spider web or three pillows to make a sleeping area.
For the leader's den you could choose the largest, least occupied room. The couch can be your bed, covered with the spider webs or pillows. Cover the floors in colored blankets, or brown to give it that dirt or sand effect.
You will also need an apprentice den, this can be made just like the warriors den, but larger and less comfortable.
Make the Medicine cat's den. Outside, in the kitchen, or by a window would be the best place because there are plants you can use to heal. For the comfort of the person who volunteers to be the medicine cat, place down multiple blankets on top of one another to get that carpet effect just like inside. Use a brown or blue tarp to make a ceiling and add cozy green spider web beds and the best pillows you got. Offer spoons, forks, sticks, and brown like bowls to be able to make the treatments. To insure your medicine cat is comfy and NOT lonely, ask a friend to be the apprentice of the medicine cat.

, Use multiple pillows stacked or use a chair or couch. Let the other cats sit below you on pillows or just on spread out blankets.

, In the middle of 'camp', place a cardboard piece that is cut out like a stump and is decorated as such. For when it comes to hunting the cats can put there 'fresh kill' or stuffed animals on the stump.

, Your outside or 'forest' can be a room decorated with cardboard cut outs of trees, spider webs, and badger holes. Under furniture you can place a skunk or burrowing stuffed animal', green moss, a fake river (use a cardboard cut out colored or painted blue), and stuffed animals scattered about.

, Maybe with a dip of your head or a whisper of. Welcome to the home of the Clans.

, Once everyone has arrived, why not pretend to be warrior cats? Everyone could be one RP character (roleplay) and one real warrior. If you have the time, you could make name badges.

, People can hide stuffed animals while others try to find a stuffed animal with the number they were assigned to written on a card around their neck.

, Have everyone pair up, and give each pair a spoon. Fill white water balloons up with dyed water.

, In this game, each den will be removed of its items and hidden among the 'forest'. Teams assigned to each den must collect the items and amount wanted. Give them a check list to cross of items safely brought back to their 'den'. The first to bring back and arrange the interior like before everything was pulled will get prized with an extra piece of fresh kill and a new piece of bedding from left over pieces not collected. The losing teams will pick up the resources and must hand one piece of bedding to the other team, the team gets to choose which item they get to posses.

, Once you've eaten, maybe you could play some warrior cat games with your friends on the internet.


In the evening, have a mini battle (doesn't have to last long) and then a Gathering if your party is on a full moon, lucky you, otherwise, make an exception just for the party.

, Not all birthday parties need to be sleepovers, but they can be lots of fun! In the morning, depending on what time you wake up, you could play some party games or read books, and have breakfast.

, When it's time for dinner, call it 'fresh kill' instead, and ask everyone what they would like. Obviously, don't really serve mice at the table. Think of something everyone could enjoy, maybe something fresh, like a pizza, you can have delivered to your house.

, Food is 'fresh kill' in warriors so you must get something close to meats, think think think! Have meat skewers, steak, meatballs, pepperoni, salami, and hamburgers, anything with juicy meat will do. If you have a vegetarian then offer veggie patties, cheese, anything that sticks to the theme.

, The best birthday cake can have something printed on it, such as the cover of your favorite book from the warriors series or the map of the territory.

Keep it lighthearted.",How to Play the Best Pranks on April 11," That is, pick a place that is a part of the person's normal routine. If you try to get them to come to the prank rather than having the prank come to them, they're more likely to be suspicious, especially on April 1.For instance, set up the prank in their home or work, as they are most comfortable there.
If you ask them to meet you somewhere or come outside, for example, they may become suspicious.;
, By mid-morning, everyone has had a chance to realize it is April 1, so they are are on their guard. However, if you start early, you're more likely to catch people unawares, especially before they've had their morning coffee., Fooling someone is one thing, but they should be able to laugh at the joke when it's revealed. Silly and fun works much better than serious and threatening. You don't want an April Fool's joke to cost you a relationship, a job, or even worse, land you in jail.For instance, filling a room with balloons is silly. Making someone trip when they walk in the room could be more serious, especially if it leads to injury.

You shouldn't try to scare a stranger because you don't know what they're capable of. You could get hurt if you mess with the wrong person.;
, Find a closet, preferably one that lots of people open, and jump out of it. Hold something like a can of soup or dress up in huge coats.

, This only works for inward-opening doors. Hide behind someones door, and when they close it, jump out and scream something.

Without a budget, you run the risk of overspending and not enjoying the party, both of which you certainly want to avoid.


To help create your budget, use free spending tools that can be found at Manilla.com, apps such as Party Budget Tracker, or go to evite.com/app/party/calculator for help.
With teen parties, be prepared and budget for friends of friends to attend.;
, Choose a location that the guest of honor would most enjoy or feel most comfortable being at. This might be at your home, another’s home or a place in the community, such as a restaurant, country club, bar, park, gymnasium, etc. If you’re thinking about hosting it at your home, ask yourself if you’re prepared for the responsibility that entails, particularly if it’s a children’s birthday party. An entire first-grade class running around your two-bedroom bungalow is a lot to handle!After you’ve chosen the location, decide on a date and time after confirming that it will work with (a) the location, if it’s not at your home; and (b) any special invitees.
If it’s a children’s party, keep it short. Two or three hours is plenty of time, especially for younger children, and plan toddler parties in the morning when they’ll be in better spirits.

, Children’s parties typically have themes, and the invitations you send will relate to this theme. You’ll need to decide on the theme first, and involve your child in picking a theme for his or her birthday party.


If it’s an adult birthday party, a theme is also appropriate and even desirable. Attending a party as an adult often requires getting a babysitter, buying a new outfit, booking a car and so forth. Incorporating a fun theme is a great way to entice people to come to the party, and it's a conversation starter once people arrive., The guest list will be determined in large part by how many people your location and budget can accommodate. Make sure to determine these things before writing down names. After you’ve written the guest list, check with the guest of honor to make sure you haven’t left off anyone he or she particularly wants there. The next step is to send out the invitations, whether paper or digital, at least three to four weeks in advance.Here are a few more tips on both guest lists and invitations.


If it’s a children’s party, don’t exclude just one person from a whole group (boy scout troop, class, soccer team, etc.) just because he or she isn’t your child’s friend. If you’re inviting just part of his or her class, don’t hand out invitations at school.
If it's a teen's party, specify an ending time an hour earlier than you actually expect everyone to leave to account for dawdling, and ensure you get parents' contact information with the RSVP.Include all necessary information in the invitation, including things such as style of dress and the level of formality. Include a GPS-friendly address as well.
Use websites such as Evite.com or Punchbowl.com to send customized electronic invitations. Add photos and be creative with your wording to build excitement for the party.
Follow up with phone calls to those who haven’t RSVP’d a few days before the party.

, Ask friends, your spouse, relatives, other parents, older children and so forth for help with such things as supervision, photography and games. If you don’t feel comfortable with this, and it’s within your budget, hire a professional, a high-school student or your babysitter to help with the pre- or post-party cleaning, or to help during the party by serving food, supervising children and teens, or whatever you might need to assist you.

, Your list of supplies will depend largely on the location and type of party, but one is necessary all the same. Outside of food and drinks, possible supplies include things such as balloons, party hats, signs, games, crafts, music, coolers, serving dishes, tablecloths, plates, cups, ice, extra toilet paper and utensils.

, The entertainment will depend largely on the type of party, its theme and the location, but it's very important to keep those at the party engaged so put extra thought and effort into planning it.


With children’s parties, it’s best to create a schedule of activities and intersperse higher- and lower-energy activities.If you’re hiring entertainment for any type of party, make sure you book early and ask about set-up requirements.
If you plan to have the party at your home and to play music, create your mood-appropriate playlists in advance. Make sure you include the guest of honor’s favorites, too.

, Depending on where you’re hosting the party, you may or may not make the food yourself. In fact, if your budget allows it, you could have the food catered at any location. What’s most important is that the food is appropriate for the people who are in attendance, while also keeping the theme in mind. Even if it’s a children’s party, don’t forget the parents who may stay and make sure you have something for them to snack on and drink, too.Here are a few more tips.


For children’s parties, finger foods, pizza and things most children actually like to eat are best. Keep it simple.
For teen parties, keep it simple as well, but make sure you have a lot. Pizza, chips, pretzels and soda are all good and don't require utensils (more trash).Always have a few extra goody bags in case an unexpected guest attends or one is lost.
If you’re having it at your home and cooking yourself, pre-cook and pre-assemble the day before, if possible, so you don’t feel so rushed the day of and have more time with guests.
Assign seats at large dinner parties, splitting up couples and seating more quiet people by more lively people to generate a more festive party.
Don’t forget the birthday cake, even if it’s a party for an adult, and make sure you order it in plenty of time!
If you arrange for the food to be catered, you’ll also want to ensure that it's ordered about three weeks in advance., With children’s and teens' parties, make sure you have more than you think you may need because they'll likely go through a lot. Avoid pumping younger children full of caffeinated beverages, which their parents will thank you for later. For adult parties, make sure you include non-alcoholic beverages, and label big-batch cocktails or punches to indicate that they contain alcohol.


Always have more cups than you think you will need. You don't want to run to the store in the middle of the party.

, A week or two before the party, go shopping and get everything you’ll need for the party. Some things, like fresh foods, will need to wait. But it’s best to have everything else well in advance so if you need to have something ordered, you’ll have time to make the order. Balloons, streamers, and party activities can wait as well.

, If you’re having the party at your house, you’ll want to clean thoroughly inside and do any major yard work or planting if the party is outside. Removing knickknacks and clutter and rearranging furniture will help free up space for guests to move about more easily. It also creates a more welcoming environment.After the cleaning or if you’re having the party at another location, you’ll want to decorate based on the party’s theme. Don’t spend a lot of money, time or energy on decorations that most won’t even notice, though.

, Get the cameras ready. Stash extra toilet paper in the bathrooms. Light candles. Turn on the music. Set up the food. Strategically place trash cans.

, The last thing you want is to be in a chic outfit that’s completely unsuited to chasing after children for two or three hours. Nor do you want to wear stilettos that may make your legs look fabulous but your feet ache an hour into your hosting duties. Choose your attire wisely so that you look nice and well put together, but also with a mind to being comfortable so that you’re not a cranky host or hostess., Try to have everything in place at least 30 minutes before the party starts. That includes yourself. This will allow you to catch a breath and be more relaxed when you welcome guests and be more prepared in case guests arrive early. Doing this will set the tone for the rest of the party, and it will be a good tone.


If you’re running behind and a guest arrives early, greet the person nicely and explain you’re behind schedule. Asking the guest to help with something can help alleviate the awkwardness.
If it’s a dinner party at your home, have appetizers and drinks out and ready for guests when they arrive.

, You should greet each guest as he or she arrives, hopefully by name. As the host or hostess of the party, it’s your responsibility to make them feel welcome, to make them feel you’re happy they are there.Offer to take their coats; show them around if you’re able to; either receive the gift or explain where to put it; say thank you for the gift; and explain the plans for the party, if applicable.


Have a craft or non-competitive game or activity at children’s parties for newcomers until everyone arrives., As the host or hostess of the party, it’s your job to make everyone feel comfortable during the party. Talk with your guests; genuinely listen to what they’re saying; respond authentically; ask them questions; introduce guests to those they don’t know; and so forth.


Don’t wait for others to generate the party’s energy. You get it going, help it sustain itself from that point forward, and enjoy yourself while doing so!
The more you put others at ease, the better the party will be.

, Drinks will be spilled. Plates will start to pile up. The music might suddenly stop. Focus on guests, not cleanup or problems. Problems can be resolved, often much more easily than we may initially think. When accidents happen, as they will, accept apologies with a smile and take care of them.Have stain remover on hand and create discreet places to put garbage and dirty dishes. You can deal with those things after the party, or hire help to assist during it.
At children’s parties, have plenty of paper towels on hand and keep your sense of humor about you!

, Always offer guests refreshments throughout the party. If you see someone with an empty cup, offer to refill it. If you see someone standing alone, go speak with that person or introduce him/her to someone you think they might enjoy getting to know.At children’s parties, don’t rush activities that are going well to stay on schedule. Just go with the flow for a little while until it’s really time to move on.


Monitor teens as best you can throughout the party. If you see suspicious activity, talk with the teen in private and, if necessary, call the teen's parent., If it’s an adult party, you shouldn’t drink too much as the host or hostess of the party. Getting drunk or even a bit too tipsy can make your guests feel uncomfortable and doesn’t lend itself well to fulfilling your hosting duties.

, Although it’s a seemingly regular occurrence for people to be glued to their phones, even at parties, it’s best to keep your phone put away while hosting a party. If a situation exists in which you need to keep your phone on vibrate and then must take a call, excuse yourself politely to take the call, keep it brief and return to your guests promptly to explain why you had to answer the call.


Being upfront and only using the phone when absolutely necessary is reasonable, and your guests will be understanding.

, Typically, gifts are opened at children’s birthday parties because most children love to see what the guest of honor received. The child who gave the gift also likes to see the guest of honor open that gift. This is usually one of the last things done at the party, and the host will want to write down what present each child gave so that information can be noted in the thank you card.Gifts can be opened at adult and teen birthday parties as well, though this is not generally the standard.

, At the end of the party, the host or hostess should personally thank each guest for attending and tell the guests goodbye. The host or hostess should also thank the guests again for bringing a gift, if they did. If it’s a child’s birthday party, use this as a time to teach good manners and encourage your child to personally thank friends for attending and for their gifts.At teen parties, call the parent if someone isn't picked up on time or says he or she is taking an alternate means home.Goody bags are typically given at this time. Although these are generally reserved for children’s and teens' parties, they can also be given at adult parties. Here are some ideas for adult party favors:
Make a small potted plant with moss, cacti or a houseplant and wrap a ribbon around it.
Create your own wine labels and adhere them to wine bottles using double-sided tape.
Mix up your own BBQ herb rub, put it in a glass jar and attach the recipe to it.
Buy small notebooks from a dollar store, write down the recipes from the foods you served and tie a ribbon around each.
Have photos printed during the party and insert them in frames to give before guests leave., About a week after the party, send a thank you card to each guest who attended, expressing your appreciation.


Personalizing each note is a nice touch and goes a long way. Make sure to mention the particular gift that was given.
If you have a photo from the party that includes the person and guest of honor or one of the whole group, include that photo as well.

Send out train ticket invitations.,
Place a train depot sign outside.,
Create fake train tracks with duct tape.,
Set up a cardboard train for a photo prop.,
Hang train themed signs around the party.,
Stuff and hang a train piñata.",How to Plan a Train Themed Birthday Party1," Invitations are important and are a great way to introduce your guests to the theme of the party. Look for train ticket invites at the party store, or order them specially printed online. If you want to save some money, draw them up by hand on cardstock.


Be sure to include what the event is, where it will take place, and when it's happening.
Use phrases like ""Come aboard for a party,"" ""Next stop fun,"" or ""Here's your boarding pass for a good time!"";
, Grab a wooden dowel rod and either a piece of cardboard or a piece of plywood. Paint on the sign something like “Marshall’s Depot” or “Last Stop for Fun.” Attach the sign to the rod. Set the sign up at the end of your driveway or at the entrance to the party to let people know they are in the right spot.If you use cardboard, attach the sign with hot glue or other craft glue. For a wooden sign, you could drill two holes in the sign and use zip ties or string to tie it to the pole.
Stick the rod into the ground, sit it in a traffic cone, or wedge it between two rocks or cinder blocks. If it’s especially windy, you may want to have the sign inside.

, Buy a roll or two of black duct tape. Either out on your sidewalk or in your house, use the duct tape to make train tracks. Stretch out two long pieces for the rails and then lay short pieces across for the wooden planks.If you do it outside, have it lead right up to your door. If you do it inside, have it lead to the food or to the bathroom.
If your child is old enough, let them help you put the tape down so they feel like they’re part of planning the party.

, Use cardboard boxes that are large enough for kids to sit down in. Draw or paint on the boxes so they look like various train cars. Cut the flaps off of the box so the kids can climb into them. Set the boxes up in a row and have kids sit or stand in them for a photo opportunity., Hang a ""Boarding Platform"" sign on the front door. Draw a ""Dining Car"" sign and hang it over the food table. If you have a place for coats, shoes, and bags, hang a ""Baggage Claim"" sign by that area. A sign that points to the rest room is also a good idea.This is a great way to get creative based on how your party space is set up. You have many options for signs.

, Piñatas are great because they function as a decoration first and an activity second. Go to your local big-box store or party store and request a train engine piñata. Fill it with candy, small prizes, or other snacks and toys. Hang it from the ceiling near the area where the kids will play.


Be sure to use caution when the kids are breaking it open. Keep any kids who are not hitting it away from the child who is hitting it.

Find an alternate way to say happy birthday.,
Tailor the birthday message if it's a milestone birthday.,
Wish happy birthday in a different language.,
Send the person a message.,
Be funny or professional in a birthday wish to a coworker.,
Choose an appropriate closing for a letter or card.",How to Say Happy Birthday1," Instead of reciting the tired and boring ""Happy Birthday,"" come up with a different phrase to tell the birthday girl or boy. The point of a birthday message is to wish her happiness, luck, and warm wishes on her special day. Think of a way you can pass this along in a unique, different way. If you can't think of any, try some of the following:


Many happy returns! or Many happy returns of the day!
Warm wishes on your birthday!
Wishing you a year that's blessed.Hope you have a day/year to remember.
Happy day-you-entered-this-world.
Wishing you all the best/that your dreams come true/you happiness and luck.Eat, drink, and be merry!;
, Milestone birthdays occur when a person hits a significant age. This may vary from culture to culture, but common milestone birthdays are: 13, 16, 18, 21, 30, 40, 50. After 60, every 5 years is a milestone.For a milestone birthday wish, make sure to emphasize the age. Tailor the wish around why the milestone is so important. At 13 a child is finally a teenager, at 16 the child can finally drive, and 50 is considered over the hill.
Milestone birthdays are a great time for humor, especially as people grow older. Before you make a joke about someone's age, determine if it is appropriate to joke about it. Some people are extremely sensitive about their age. You don't want to hurt her on her birthday.
For a generic joke about getting older, try: That's a lot of candles. Try not to burn down the house!; At this age, everything either hurts or doesn't work; or a joke about being over the hill.For something more positive about getting older, try: 40/50 and fabulous!; 50 is nifty; Like a fine wine, you just get better with age; Don't think of it as getting older, think of it as getting better; Count the age, not the wrinkles; You look too good to be this old; You have to grow older, but you don't have to grow up.For someone turning 16, make a message about driving: I hope the world can handle you on the road!; I can't believe I used to help you cross the street, and now you're going to be driving down it.As children hit milestones, focus on her transitioning from a kid to an adult: Welcome to the world of adults!; I'm proud you've become such a responsible young man/woman., Instead of wishing someone happy birthday in English, try sending her wishes in another language. Choose the language of a place the person loves or has always wanted to go to. Find audio clips of the phrase online so you can practice. Try learning happy birthday in the following languages:


Mandarin: qu ni sheng er kuai le
Japanese: Otanjou-bi Omedetou Gozaimasu!
Punjabi: Janam din mubarak!
Spanish: Feliz Cumplea–os!
Afrikaans: Gelukkige Verjaarsdag!
Arabic: Eid milad sa'aid! or Kul sana wa inta/i tayeb/a! (masculine/feminine)
French: Joyeux Anniversaire!
German: Alles Gute zum Geburtstag!
Hawaiian: Hau`oli la hanau!
Yoruba: Eku Ojobi!, Instead of finding an alternate way to say the words ""happy birthday,"" send a longer message with ""happy birthday"" at the end. If you don't know the person very well, you can send her a message wishing her happiness and prosperity. If you are close to the person, you can let her know how much she means to you. Try some of the following messages:


Blowing out another candle means you've lived another year. Make every day and every candle count. Happy birthday!
Be happy because today was the day you were brought into this world. You make the world a better place by being in it. You deserve all the happiness in the world.
Instead of a message, try famous quotes: Life is a journey. Enjoy every mile; It's the journey that counts, not the destination., Wishing a coworker happy birthday can be a bit tricky. Maybe you work alongside each other, but don't know each other. You don't want to be impersonal with a simple ""happy birthday,"" but you also don't want to be too personal and overstep boundaries. Decide if you should be professional or funny with the co-worker. That will determine the message you leave for her. Try some of the following:


All the best in the year to come!
It's a pleasure to work with you. Warm wishes on your special day.
You work hard all year round, so don't work too hard on your birthday. Have a great day!
You make work feel a lot less like work. Thanks for all you do around here! Happy birthday.
I didn't bring the cake, but I'll absolutely eat a slice in your honor. Here's to you!, Instead of a message, write the person a letter. Let her know how much you appreciate her, share memories with her, and make her feel appreciated and loved. When you close, try some of the following birthday phrases:


Celebrating you
Cheers
Let us eat cake
Party on

Pull ""the deal"".",How to Pull a Prank for April Fool's Day1," You're with a friend or sibling. And you make a little deal like 'Teach me how to cook, I'll teach you how to draw.'


Lets say you said 'I'll teach you how to draw'. So you do a little homework. They tell you to try something simple; make cookies and show them tomorrow. You say something like' I want you to paint a perfect picture of Mona Lisa.' If they're surprised or something, then say ""APRIL FOOLS!"";

Try bedtime pranks.,
Create alarm clock fun.,
Fake destroying important documents.,
Cover a car in sticky notes.",How to Play the Best Pranks on April 12," One good, easy prank is to put something under a person's pillow. Messy substances work best for this prank, such as marshmallow cream or shaving cream. When the person gets ready to go to sleep, they'll stick their hands under the pillow and find a silly surprise., Alarm clocks are often used to prank people because you can set them to go off at a later time. One way to use alarm clocks is to gather a bunch of them and hide them around someone's room. Set them to go off at different times during the night.Another option that takes more commitment is to make someone early for something.

, Secretly make a copy of documents important to a friend or coworker. Hide the original away. In front of the person, ""accidentally"" spill coffee on it.This prank works especially well if it's something that's not easily reproduced, such as a birth certificate, car title, or something that was notarized.
It also works well to play it on a friend who doesn't have easy access to a printer and who has printed off a paper for class already.

, This prank takes some time and commitment, but the shock value is worth it. Simply buy a bunch of sticky notes, and cover the entire car with them.

Wrap a phone in rubber bands.,
Grow a garden in a keyboard.,
Make mayo donuts.,
""Freeze"" their computers.",How to Play the Best Pranks on April 13," This prank is a good one for the office. Simply use rubber bands large enough to wrap around the person's office phone, then completely wrap the phone in rubber bands. When they go to use the phone, they'll have to unwrap it first.Remember that you're taking a chance anytime you pull a prank at the office. You're cutting down on productivity, and your boss may not be okay with that. Make sure you are willing to accept the consequences before you pull an office prank.

, One way to prank coworkers is to grow gardens in keyboards and switch them out for the working keyboards. When your coworkers come in, you'll definitely get a laugh.Start with an old, broken keyboard. Add water, soil, and chia or grass seeds. Enclose it in a clear plastic bag (loosely) to create a greenhouse, and set it in a sunny spot.
Check on the soil every day to make sure it stays moist. Let it grow for about a week.
Set the garden keyboard on the desk, and hide the person's regular keyboard.
It is NOT a good idea to do this prank on a working office keyboard. That is destruction of company property, and you could easily be fired for that. Even if you're not using company property, consider your office atmosphere and the temperament of your boss before pulling this prank.

, Buy a box of glazed donuts. On top of them, spread or pipe mayonnaise to look like frosting. Your unsuspecting coworkers will get a mouthful of mayonnaise when they're expecting sweet frosting.This prank could backfire if someone has a food allergy or is vegan or vegetarian. Just be sure you take that into consideration before attempting it.

, One way to prank coworkers is to take a screenshot of their computer screens. Then, you replace their background with that screenshot. Once you hide the icons, it will look like their regular screen, but they won't be able to click on anything.Start by hitting ""Print Screen"" on their keyboard. Paste it into a program like Paint. Save it as an image.
Next, replace the background image with your image. You can usually do this step by right-clicking on the screen and hitting ""personalize"" or ""preferences"" on the menu.
Hide the icons. The easiest way to hide the icons is to right-click on the desktop, then move to ""View."" Next, uncheck the box for ""Show Desktop Icons."" Check this box again when you want them to reappear.Once again, this prank will cut down on productivity, so make sure you're okay with the consequences if your boss isn't happy.

Don't use a prank to isolate and humiliate someone.,
Skip the scare tactics.,
Avoid ""good news"" pranks.,
Don't do anything dangerous.,
Skip anything illegal.",How to Play the Best Pranks on April 14," In some settings, such as the office, pranks are often played on either the top performer or the under performer. In other words, the prank is often played on someone that others would like to see humbled a bit. In that case, the prank can go pretty wrong, considering that the person you're pranking could end up feeling victimized, leading to poor office morale or even consequences for you.Also, it's never a good idea to prank the boss, unless she or he has created an atmosphere where everyone gets pranked now and then.
Stick to people who can take the joke or even unilaterally play it on everyone.
Another option is just sticking to friends and loved ones, who know you care about them.

, Simply jumping out at someone may not be so bad, but pulling elaborate pranks that fake someone's death are much less appropriate. For instance, if your girlfriend faked her death, how would that make you feel? Most people are left feeling hurt and vulnerable even after the prank has been revealed, so it's a good idea to skip these types of pranks., That is, don't tell someone they've won a car, for example. It gets their hopes up, and then you just have to dash them later. This type of prank can turn cruel very quickly.This step is even more true when it's more personal. For instance, telling someone their song is going to be played on the radio can raise false hopes that will leave the person feeling very disappointed.

, Hitting someone in the face with a cream pie isn't dangerous. Digging a hole for someone to fall in is dangerous. You don't want to cause harm to another person, especially since you could be liable for any hospital bills or even face criminal charges., It can be easy to tip into illegal activities when pulling a prank. Moving someone's car, permanently damaging property, or even tripping someone could all be construed as illegal if things go wrong. Think about the possible consequences of your prank before you pull it off."

Prepare a doll.,
Hide the props.,
Use their phone against them.",How to Scare Somebody Easily2," Fake spiders are a great accessory for scaring your siblings or friends. They can be found at most toy stores for a pretty inexpensive price. Try to find one that is large and realistic looking.


Set up the spider. Use a strip of floss to attach the spider to a door jamb. Tie a firm knot around the rear of the spider.
Then find a way to hang the other end of the floss above the door jamb. This in effect will cause the spider to appear to be facing whoever is underneath it.

, Dolls are a classic device for spooking. They run on the thin line of cute and creepy.

Right before the person goes to bed, set the doll up in a location they can see from their bed. Place the spider up in a doorway where you know someone will walk through frequently.


Another way to spook them out is to first wait for them to fall asleep. Then, set the doll or spider next to their pillow. If they wake up in the middle of the night, you might hear a scream.

, If you have access to someone's cell-phone, you could really freak them out. Pick an immediate person in their life like their close friend or family member. Change their contact information to your phone number.


Text them from the fake contact. This part is open for your touch of creativity. It won't be freaky if you simply text ""brains."" You'll need to say something weirder like:

""There's a killer loose in your neighborhood. Please lock your doors and your windows""
""Did you know that if feel a shiver when get underneath your sheets at night, a ghost is passing through you?""This is a little bit of a more intricate scare. It has a lot of opportunity to backfire, or may not even work the way you want.

Send a card in the mail.,
Send a card through e-mail.,
Tell the person happy birthday on social media.,
Send the person flowers, cupcakes, or other gifts.,
Bake a cake.,
Surprise the person.",How to Say Happy Birthday2," Instead of saying ""happy birthday,"" why not show it? People love getting things in the mail, so it will be an extra special surprise for her when she opens her mailbox. You can buy a funny card or a sincere card. You can also make your own card for a bit of a DIY personalized touch.


Sending a card shows you care because it shows that you took the time to purchase or make a card, and also that you thought about the person ahead of time.
Send a card that plays music to give the person an extra special surprise. Or buy a card where you can record your own voice so you can personally say happy birthday without physically being there.

, If you didn't think about it ahead of time, or you don't know the person's address, send an e-card. Many websites offer free cards that you can send as long as you know the person's e-mail address. Type up your own message or give her a short greeting, and send away.


You can choose from thousands of different designs - funny, serious, animated, or with pictures of animals.
Some of the cards have short animated movies, play music, or are interactive. You can go as simple or elaborate as you want.

, No matter if you are just acquaintances or best friends, wishing someone happy birthday on social media makes the person smile. To not be like all the other boring ""happy birthday"" wishes, personalize the message. Add birthday photos, or a photo of the person's favorite celebrity. You can even find animated pictures to accompany your message.


Instead of a generic birthday photo, find a funny birthday picture on the internet and post it instead.
Make your own picture in Photoshop or Paint and post it for the person.

, Cards are not the only way to tell someone happy birthday. Instead of sending a card, contact a local florist and send a flower arrangement. If she is not into flowers, send cupcakes or cookies from a local bakery.


Other ideas for surprise gifts include balloons, singing telegrams, fruit arrangements, chocolate covered strawberries, or truffles. Investigate what local businesses are in the person's area that can deliver a birthday package.
If you don't find anything local, go online. Many businesses do birthday packages and arrangements that you can order and have shipped to her home or workplace.

, Everyone loves cake on their birthday. A great way to say happy birthday is to write it on top of her favorite homemade cake! If you don't want to bake a cake yourself, order a cake and have the bakery write a message on top of the cake with icing.


You can also do the same thing with cupcakes. Write a letter or a word on each cupcake to spell out a special birthday message.

, Think about ways you can surprise someone on her birthday. Maybe throw the person a surprise party. Show up at work to take her to lunch, or after work to take her to dinner. Bring her an extra-special gift she wasn't expecting.


Make sure if you want to surprise the person and take her somewhere that you make sure she is available. You don't want to have a party or special dinner planned when the person already has plans.

, ""Thanks a lot for the birthday money"", ""Your generosity is greatly appreciated"", or ""I just wanted to thank you very much for the money that you left/gave me"" should do the trick.

Something like ""I have been saving up for a new car, and this helps out a lot"", ""John and I have been having trouble making rent lately, this is going to help us out a lot"", or ""Now I have something to start my savings account with"".

, No matter how many times you may have mentioned this before, it does not hurt to say it again. Just a nice ""Thank You!"", ""Thanks Again!"", ""Thank you so much!"", or just wrap up the whole note with ""Thanks, (your name)"".

, If you haven't talked to the person in a long time, you might want to give a brief update on what you are up to.

Determine if your honoree will react well to a surprise.,
Grab a friend to help.,
Pick the day and time.,
Choose the location.,
Invite guests.,
Time it well.,
Keep decorations hidden.,
Hide cars.,
Avoid telling people that can’t keep a secret.,
Make as much noise as possible.,
Consider a quiet surprise.,
Use silly string or water guns.,
Make sure your party is in progress when it’s time to surprise your guest of honor.",How to Throw a Surprise Birthday Party," Not all people react well to something unexpected so before planning a surprise party consider how your guest of honor will react. If you are unsure, talk to their close friends or family members to feel out the idea before proceeding. Also consider whether they enjoy parties or like being the center of attention. Lastly, avoid planning a surprise party for someone who likes to be in charge of hosting their own event.Rule out finicky or meticulous people who prefer to know details about an event before attending.
Avoid throwing surprise parties for people who get really excited about birthdays. In your attempt to surprise them, they may think you have forgotten to plan anything and become upset.Consider whether the guest has health issues that may result in a negative physical reaction to the shock.;
, A trusted confidant is one who will assist you in planning the party and ensuring the element of surprise. They can help to make sure the honoree arrives at the right place at the right time. Additionally, if you live with the guest of honor your co-conspirator can help with RSVPs and their house can be used for planning purposes so you don’t get caught with evidence.Choose someone close to the guest of honor and someone that you can trust to keep a secret.

, The most important thing to consider when picking a day and time is the guest of honor’s availability. You will secretly have to find out if they are available on the day and time that you have chosen. You can also choose a date before or after the honoree’s actual birthday to avoid arousing suspicion.Make sure your honoree is kept busy for a few hours to ensure the element of surprise. A short errand might not give you enough time and will cause you to have to speed up or rush the process.To ensure a seamless surprise, make sure to organize the party around the honoree's routine. You will be able to retain the element of surprise by organizing the party around the guest’s usual schedule., When planning where to hold the surprise party, consider your honoree’s favorite places. Is their favorite restaurant available, would they prefer an indoor or outdoor event, or will you be hosting the party in a private home? It’s easier to coordinate details in a private home setting, but public venues are also great options.Choosing a public venue usually means you have less time to easily attend to details because space is often rented.
When choosing a location, make sure it is easily accessible to your guests.

, Consider the number of people you would like to invite and then consider with whom the guest of honor would really enjoy celebrating their special day. When contacting guests, phone calls or private Facebook invites work best. This way, information can’t be forwarded to friends who haven’t been invited, and it can’t be accidentally read by the guest of honor., It’s important that guests arrive much earlier than the guest of honor, so if someone is 20 minutes late it won’t ruin the surprise. Plan for guests to arrive at least 30 minute before the surprisee’s scheduled time of arrival. If someone is running late, advise them to remain in their car until the guest of honor has arrived to avoid spoiling the surprise., This goes for both before the party, and the day of the party. Store pre-purchased decorative items in a place where the honoree won’t accidentally come across them. If you live together, try storing them at a friend’s house. On the day of the party, avoid highly visible decorations like lights or flashing signs that can easily be seen. Also, avoid decorating the outside of the location with balloons or signs., Whether the venue is public or private, tell guests to park cars out of sight to avoid being recognized by the honoree. This is especially important if people have unique or easily recognizable cars or license plates. Encourage carpooling to cut down on the number of cars present., For those who have a difficult time keeping secrets, encourage them to not be in too much contact with the honoree. Avoid telling children until the day of the event to ensure they don’t accidentally spill the beans.


Talk about their birthday as easily and calmly as possible. This will keep them from becoming suspicious or thinking that everyone has forgotten about their birthday.

, When your honoree arrives, you can jump out and yell surprise but you can also add to the surprise by making a lot of noise. Give your guests instruments like whistles or shakers, or instruct them to sing or clap when the honoree arrives., Instead of the traditional surprise approach, have guests walk in on the guest of honor, instead of the guest of honor walking into the surprise. Choose a day that appears ""typical"" to the guest of honor, and instruct your guests to casually file in one by one. Watch your honoree glow with shock as they see the number of their loved ones growing. , If you are planning an outdoor event, surprise the honoree by showering them with items like silly string, or water from water guns or water balloons. If you are choosing the water option, make sure the party is water-themed so that the guest will either have on a swimsuit or have a change of clothes handy.Consider your honoree's reaction before taking this route. Some people won't be happy about getting their clothes wet or having their hair covered with silly string.

, Begin serving food and drinks ahead of time. This will help detract from some of the spotlight and ease the honoree into the party more easily.

Make sure the upcoming birthday is free of any obligations, work related, or family oriented, and if so, then just pick another day that the two of you can enjoy hassle free together.,
Start doing some investigating, especially if this is a fairly new relationship!,
Plan your perfect birthday outing.,
Think about what he wants rather than what he needs.,
Tease your partner, not in a mean way, but you want to make him anticipate what you've got up your sleeve.,
Choose what to wear.,
Celebrate!,
Give him the ultimate gift, and that's you!",How to Plan a Romantic Birthday Outing,";
, Find out what his favorite type of food is, what kinds of movies he likes, what does he like to do for fun? What outfit does he like seeing you in, does he prefer your hair up or down, where are his favorite restaurants/bars? If possible, ask his friends, family, co-workers, or even him!

, You'll need to decide what activities you'll do for entertainment, what place you'll make the reservations to eat dinner, and if you'll be doing anything else publicly after dinner. Some examples might be: Going to a comedy club while enjoying dinner along with the show, following it up by heading to the park and enjoying the stars on a blanket. Or, heading to the local cinema to catch a movie that you both have been wanting to see, then going to his favorite restaurant where you take turns feeding each other your entrée, followed up with a night booked at a hotel with a jacuzzi suite. At this point, you'll also want to think about whether or not you'll be giving him a gift aside from the night out.

, This will have a more personal effect and show him that you really pay attention to his desires and his interests. If there's a new book he mentioned wanting to read, that might be a good choice. If you want it to be a more thoughtful, or romantic gift, you could also choose jewelry.. a new watch, a tie pin/clip, bracelet, or even a necklace. Remember, it's all in what his interests and likes are! Try to think of something that he would buy for himself. If jewelry is not in the budget, you could always go the route of a new cologne, those new motorcycle boots he's been eyeing up, or a new cowboy hat! Depending on his taste and what you think will brighten his eyes, and his day! You'll probably also want to choose a birthday card for him, or make your own. When picking out a card, spend some time looking at what each one says, and means. Don't just pick up the first one you see, unless of course, it conveys the feelings, emotions, and says exactly what you want it to say! Cards are a wonderful way of saying things that sometimes we can't find the words for ourselves. Simple, yet they can have a big impact!

, Give him little hints about what's going to happen, without telling him all the details. For example, 'Oh honey, I'm glad we're going out for your birthday on Saturday night, because you'll need all day Sunday to rest!' Or you could say something like, 'Baby, I can't wait for you to see what all I have planned for you!' Things like that will spark his curiosity and have him asking more questions trying to figure it all out, but don't give in and tell him! The less he knows, the better, use the element of surprise to your advantage, he'll thank you for it later.

, This step is also very important, because you'll want to look good for your man, but you'll also want to dress appropriately for the evening. You'll not want to be wearing high heels while playing miniature golf, just as you'd not want wear jeans and a t-shirt while going to the opera or seeing a play! Also, choose something that gets his attention, or something that he's commented on before and said looks good on you. This is HIS night, so all this preparation is for his enjoyment and pleasure! Once you've decided on what you'll wear, then you'll decide how to style your hair, and what accessories to compliment it with. If he likes seeing your neck exposed, then wear something with a plunging neckline, and add a nice necklace to draw more attention to that area... And if he loves it when your hair is down, then let it down to heighten his senses.. See what I mean? I would also suggest, only if you feel comfortable doing so, to wear some sexy lingerie underneath. When he gets to his 'dessert' and sees that you've been hiding that temptress underneath the whole time, it'll really make his mind reel! This also gives you the advantage of not having to change into it later on, and lets you be able to go with your passions without being interrupted. Another thing to think of when dressing for the occasion, is what scents he likes on you. It could be a perfume he really likes, one that he bought for you, or a new one altogether just for this evening. I would be careful doing a new scent though, because he may not like it, you wouldn't want anything out of place in all your planning. A few scents to try that are appealing to men are lavender/lilac, vanilla, and jasmine. These will have an arousal effect on him without him even realizing it! The trick is to be subtle, and to make it seem like you're not trying too hard to look sexy for him, but to look innocently ravishing!

, You've made all the arrangements, have your agenda all planned out, dressed for him, and you're ready to give him a night out he'll never forget. Here are some things you can do to make the night extra special.. Make sure you tell him how good he looks, too, and how you can't wait to get your hands on him later on. On this note, flirting, light touches, and gestures all add excitement for what's to come later on in the evening, and will remind him that he's still very desirable, attractive, wanted, and sexy to you. You can even send him some dirty texts during dinner! Remind him of why you fell in love with him, the things he does that you appreciate, and that you wanted this night out to be a very intimate and sensual evening for his birthday because he's worth it and you wanted to show him how much you love and care for him. Throughout the evening, hold his hand, touch his arm, make lots of eye contact especially when he's talking directly to you. Laugh and smile at him. Make him feel like he's the only person in the room. Turn off your cell phone, other than texting him.

, Take your time giving him pleasure. Do his favorite things, ask him if there's anything special that he wants. Let him know that you want to give him pleasure like it's the first time.. Listen to his cues, let him guide you. Try talking dirty to him, if you feel comfortable with that. Use your hands to explore his body and appreciate every part of him. Make him feel like he's the hottest, most attractive man you've ever seen and don't hold back! Take control if that's what he likes, dominate him for a little while. If you're both at ease with it, use a scarf to tie his hands.. Use your imagination! Give him your full, undivided attention and make this birthday one that he'll never forget!

Write a personalized letter letting the person know how much they mean to you.;
, Waking up to breakfast in bed, or walking into the kitchen to find there favorite breakfast will make the birthday girl/boy feel extra special. Think about what there favorite breakfast foods are. Does she/he like pancakes, muffins, or eggs? You want to surprise then with there favorite foods.


Get up early, make the breakfast, and put it where they usually sits for breakfast. Or you can take it into there bedroom and wake them up with a tray of there favorite foods.
Put a small note wishing them a happy birthday on the saucer.
This is a great idea for spouses and significant others, parents, children, siblings, and roommates.

, Blow up balloons, and then fill a cupboard, the person's closet, or the car with the balloons. When they open the door, they will be showered in balloons. Or use crepe paper to gently secure balloons to their bedroom door so that when he/she opens it, balloons cascade in front of them.If you have the time, write messages on the balloons. You can write, ""I love you more than ____"" or ""Reason #___ that I love you is _______."" If this is a surprise for a friend, sibling, child, or parent, write reasons you appreciate him/her on the balloons.
Another idea is to write memories, funny stories, inside jokes, song lyrics, and meaningful words on the balloons to show them how special they are to you., Repurpose a tin can to make a special surprise for someone. Fill the can with streamers, candy, and small gifts that the person will like and that will make her smile. All you need is a can with a pop top, some tape, a can opener, and a hot glue gun.


Use the can opener to open the bottom of the can. Remove the label, remove the food, and clean the can well. Cover the sharp edges on the can and the top with masking tape, clear tape, or washi tape.
Make a few paper chains and hot glue them to the inside of the pop top. This will make the paper chain come out as soon as the person pops the top of the can. Then fill the can with small gifts, candy, and treats.
Replace the bottom of the can and secure it with clear tape. Fit the outside of the can with paper that you can decorate. Add ribbon, glitter, sequins, or any other accents to the paper. Hot glue the paper to the can., One simple way to surprise someone is to take the time to bake her/his favorite cake. This is meaningful because you took the time to make it (even if it's from a box instead of scratch) instead of a buying a cake from a store. Plus, homemade cakes usually taste better.


Make cupcakes or pie if your loved one prefers either of those desserts to cake.

, One way to surprise your special someone is to collect letters or notes from his/her loved ones and friends. These notes can be general well wishes, memories, song lyrics, inside jokes, lists - whatever the person wants to share with the birthday person.Put the notes in envelopes to open, or place them in a scrapbook or notebook for them to look through.
Put the notes on post-its. Stick the post-its on a wall, on the door, in his/her car, or around his/her work space. Choose different colors for a pretty array of messages., To surprise your loved one, decide what she/he likes. Then leave little surprises for her/him during the day at her/his regular spots. Leave a surprise by the bed when she/he wakes, along her/his regular jogging path, at her/his desk at the office, or in her/his car.


If she/he likes music, start the day off by leaving a piece of paper with song lyrics where she/he can find it. This can be taped to her/his alarm clock, the bathroom mirror, rolled up in her/his coffee mug, or texted to her/his phone. The song lyrics should be either from her/his favorite song or have a significant meaning to the two of you.
Make them a mix CD and leave it in the car for them to listen to on their commute and at work. String musical notes along the path where she/he normally jogs. Text her/him a video of their favorite song or a song that means a lot to both of you.
This can work with movies, sports, animals, or anything else your loved on likes.

, This is a fun way to surprise your friends when in middle and high school. If you go to the same school, decorate the outside of their locker. Make sure your school allows it before doing it so you don't get in trouble. Think about using the following things when decorating:


Ribbon and streamers
Balloons
A huge card
Wrapping paper
A locker mirror. Write in lipstick, ""You look great!""
Candy. Tape the stick of lollipops to the locker. You can also tape Tootsie rolls, candy bars, and other treats to it.
A group photo
A Christmas stocking filled with fun stuff
Glitter
Cute magnets
Magnetic whiteboard. Write something nice on it. You might even get friends to leave messages on it.
If you can't decorate the person's locker, leave post-it notes on it with messages.

Decide the context of the event.,
Figure out the strengths and weaknesses of your voice.,
Practice singing the song alone.,
Practice with others.,

Sing the song for the birthday person.,
Clap for the birthday person at the end of the song.",How to Sing Happy Birthday," The tune of the “Happy Birthday” is very simple and has six notes. The easiest way to learn it, especially if you can’t read music, is to listen to a recording of the song online. Hum along as you listen to the song. You don’t even need to know the words yet.


If you use a search engine like Google, you can find many examples of the song that will give you an idea of the tune. The version at http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3kao0_happy-birthday-song_news is an excellent example of how the tune goes and shows the most common version of the song.;
, Try snapping along to the beat as you learn the tune of the song. This will help you figure out when you’re supposed to sing what word.

, Just like the tune, the words to the “Happy Birthday” song are very simple. There are two common versions people use, one that is personalized for the birthday person and another that is just general, for example if there is more than one birthday person. Depending on which version you choose, it is composed of either four or six total words sung over four lines.


The first version’s lyrics are: Happy Birthday to you (slight pause), Happy Birthday to you (slight pause), Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday - Happy Birthday to you.”
The second and more personalized version is: Happy Birthday to you (slight pause), Happy Birthday to you (slight pause), Happy Birthday dear (name of the birthday person) - Happy Birthday to you.”

, Are you singing to your ten-year-old daughter at a birthday party with a few other friends? You'll probably want to keep it simple. Are you singing alone to your husband or wife? Maybe you should sing more softly and romantically. Are you singing with a huge group to your father at his 80th birthday party? Maybe you guys should all practice, or at least decide when you are going to sing. It’s important to understand the context of your event so you can figure out what’s appropriate.

, If you’ve got a deep voice, don’t try singing Happy Birthday in the traditional singsong way. Use your deep voice! Stay within your range and don’t try to hit the high notes. No one is expecting you to be an expert.

, Practicing often to yourself, for example at home, will allow you to work out any kinks that may be in your voice and also help you to remember the song. It will also allow you to add special flourishes to the song, like a “cha cha cha” after every line.

, If you’re performing with a group of other people it’s always a good idea to rehearse. Designate one person to act as the conductor and start on their cue. You don’t want to start at different times or end at different times. Otherwise, everyone should easily fall into line.


If you’re singing with a group and you aren’t going to have time to practice before hand, don’t try doing anything special. It’s assumed that everyone knows the song.

, Pick one of the two traditional versions of the song that you want to sing for the person. If you are only singing to one or two people you should use the personalized version. If you’re singing at a school party to a whole group of people who had birthdays over the summer, use the less personalized version.


If the person comes from a different country or is interested in languages, you could also use a version of “Happy Birthday” that’s been adapted into another language. For example, Germans sing the same song, but with German lyrics. They are: “Zum Geburtstag viel Glück! Zum Geburtstag viel Glück! Zum Geburtstag liebe ...(add the name of birthday person) Zum Geburtstag viel Glück!”, Generally you want to start singing happy birthday right before they cut the cake or whatever celebratory dish you are having. It could be before opening presents too. Try to figure out when you’re going to sing happy birthday ahead of time so that everyone is on the same page.

, If you’ve put some effort into learning the song for a special birthday or an event, consider giving a small introductory speech before you sing the song. Keep your comments short and light to draw in your listeners.

, You could start off by playing one note on a piano or another instrument. Cue your listeners in that you’re about to start the song by playing one note on a piano. If you don’t have a piano where you’re singing, you can use another instrument.


For example, recorders or harmonicas are great, simple, and easy instruments you can use to start off your song.

, Sing to the birthday person to the best of your ability and make sure to have fun with it so that others do, too. Make sure everyone can hear you.

, When you’re done singing “Happy Birthday,” it’s always a good idea to clap for the birthday person. This lets your audience know that your performance is done and that the song was a fun gesture.

Open your gift.,
Act surprised/excited once the gift has been opened.,
Offer compliments.,
Say thank you.,
Let everyone see the gift.,
Say thanks again.,
Make sure to write thank you cards a week or so after your party.",How to Say Thank You to Gifts at Your Birthday Party," Open the gift with care and consideration–-this means avoiding ripping it gleefully. Make a show of being excited about receiving the gift.;
, For example, you could say: ""Wow! This is amazing!"".


If you are perplexed by the gift, feel free to ask what it does but do so politely. For example: ""This looks incredibly interesting. I've heard about these but I'm not sure what to do with it. Would you mind explaining?""
If you already own the gift, consider carefully what to say. If it will be obvious to the giver that you already have it, you won't have any choice but to explain that and to ask whether they'd mind if you exchanged it for something you don't have, preferably something related to the gift. If they wouldn't realize, it might be best to stay quiet and show thanks for their kindness, then later pass it on to someone who hasn't got the same item. This will all depend on who is giving the gift to you and what is right in the given context; some people would much rather help you to exchange it than to not know.

, Compliment both the person who gave you the gift: For example, ""You have such great taste!""; ""You know me so well!"", and so forth. Compliment the gift itself too; For example: ""Wow, it's so pretty!""; ""This is awesome""!


If you actually don't like the gift, just tell yourself that you do until the party is over. Use less exciting adjectives, such as: ""Wow, this is interesting!""; ""This is unique!"" Do not mention using it or putting it on display.

, Regardless of whether or not you like the gift, be thankful. Look the giver in the eye, smile genuinely and say ""Thank you!"" or ""Thank you so much!"" Some people say ""Thanks"" without smiling or looking the person in the eye. This doesn't make the gift givers too happy.


Pretend that this person just gave you the best thing you could ever imagine for if you don't much like the gift. Remind yourself that it is the action of giving that counts the most––this person has made an effort, has spent time and money on it and has gone to the trouble of giving the item to you.

, Slightly show it off but not too much! Just enough so that the gift giver will know you really like it (unless of course you don't. If you don't like the gift, tone down this step.)

, When everyone leaves, say thank you again. This time, say it to everyone! But to make it more personal, say ""Again, thank you so much for the _____!""

, Preferably do this as soon as possible so that you remember correctly and it's over and done with.

Surprise them with a picnic.,
Take them somewhere they've always wanted to go.,
Host a surprise dinner.,
Hire a limo.",How to Surprise Someone on Their Birthday2," The classic way to surprise your loved one on his or her birthday is to throw a surprise party. You can even share the responsibility. Have one friend bake a nice cake, one friend, or all your friends, make a card, and one friend make decorations.


Make sure to consider what your loved one likes. Decorate the party in a theme that reflects his interests. Make sure the cake is his favorite flavor. If he has a favorite drink and snack, make sure the party has that.

, Make a day of fun for your loved one. Think about what he loves to do, where he loves to eat, and where he loves to go. Make a schedule and give it to him so he sees what you have planned. Or keep each new stop a surprise and make them wait in anticipation as you move from one place to the next.Take him to his favorite diner for breakfast pancakes, pack a picnic lunch to eat at his favorite park, and take him to eat at his favorite sushi place for dinner.
Spend the morning taking a hike, the afternoon playing miniature golf or paintball, and the night watching a double feature at the drive in. Let your imagination run wild as you fill the day with things he will love.
If his actual birthday is a bad day to do this, make it the weekend before or after. You can also make it a week or weekend of fun instead of just a day!
Make it a 12 days of birthday celebration. For the 12 days leading up to the birthday, give him a note, a card, a letter, his favorite candy bar, or even an activity. Spread out the fun instead of putting it in one day., Surprise your loved one with a themed box filled with everything for a perfect night. Or if you are away from someone, use it as a themed birthday care package filled with things you'd give them in person, along with inside jokes. This can be tailored to anyone. Try a romantic themed one for your significant other, a game themed one for your best friend, or a princess themed one for your daughter.


Try a movie night box filled with popcorn, movie theater size candy, a soft drink, a blanket, and your favorite movie.
For a romantic box, try massage oil, bath robes, scented candles, bubble bath, body scrub, massage oil, body lotion, love notes, and chocolates.For a birthday themed box, place birthday cake Oreos, cotton candy, and cupcakes. Decorate the flaps on the box with birthday messages and stickers.

, Set up a picnic at a park, at the end of a hike, or in a field. Decorate the area with balloons or Chinese lanterns, but since you're outside, you can keep the decorations minimal. Spread a blanket, and pack a basket full of all her favorite foods.


To surprise your friend, suggest going on a hike, for a walk, or just for a ride. Take her to the same place you have the picnic set up, and keep it a surprise until you just happen upon the blanket, basket, and balloons., Maybe your loved one has always wanted to go to Disneyland, on a movie tour, or to the beach. Arrange it so he can miss work or it falls on a weekend. Pick him up early in the morning and surprise him with where you end up.


If you both have the time, make a weekend out of it. You can plan a weekend trip with the person but keep the destination secret. You might also pretend you are going one place but then surprise him with the real destination., Instead of a surprise party, take your special someone out to dinner and have friends and family be waiting on her. Or have the friends and family show up for dinner at your house. This is a simple, yet nice surprise for the birthday girl.


You can have the guests bring gifts, treats, or birthday wishes with them.You also can host the dinner as a potluck, with each guest bringing a dish they prepared for the birthday girl.

, Surprise the person you love with a limo to chauffeur him around all day. Have it pick him up for work, then from work. Make him feel special by letting him ride around in style all day long.


When the limo picks him up from work, have it filled with friends and family, ready to go to dinner or a fun activity."

Prepare invitations.,
Decorate.,
Get some themed food.,
Don't forget the cake.,
Welcome the guests.,
Play games.",How to Throw a Les Miserables Birthday Party," You can't have a party without them. For your Les Mis party, your invitations should look old fashioned (maybe written on aged parchment paper in a fancy font) and should quote some of the songs. Here's and example:


Do you hear the people sing the birthday song? The time is near! Eponine Thenardier is turning twelve! Come meet at the ABC Cafe (Eponine's house, 1234 Thenardier Lane) on October 2nd, 1815 to celebrate! Bring your best singing voices, Les Miserables (French Revolution era) costumes, and plenty of ammunition!;
, Obviously, you've got to build a barricade. You could go all the way out and build a ginormous one in your back yard with old junk (you could even ask your guests to bring old junk that they have, and then you guys could assemble it to ""The Building of the Barricade"" at the party) or pile up bits of furniture in the corners at home. Or, you could make each room of your a house a different Les Mis setting. Have your kitchen be the ABC cafe, and your living room be Thenardier's inn, and your garden be the streets of Paris.


Try to avoid balloons, streamers, or any typical party stuff, but if you absolutely need a birthday banner, then try having it be a neutral color with the Les Mis font on it.

, This is a fun one. Get some miniature sausages or hotdogs and stick toothpicks into them Put papers on the toothpicks labeling them ""Kidney of a horse"" and ""Liver of a cat"" Other food ideas: sparkling cider or apple juice in fancy bottles (""Grantaire put the bottle down!""), Loaves of freshly baked bread (Valjean stole a loaf of bread), and various French foods.

, There are many ways you could go with a Les Mis cake. You could A.) Have it look like cakes did in that era B.) Frost some kind of Les Mis design on it (barricade, etc) or C.) Use some kind of other French dessert instead of a cake. Whichever you choose, it should be easy to do at home or get as a special order in a cake shop.

, Okay, you're all ready for your party, decked up in your best Eponine costume, and the guests begin to arrive. Make sure that your guests know that they must come dressed up to the party and that there will be no talking, only singing (and some yelling when the battles come). If they break this rule, send them to Javert!


Have your Dad or brother or someone dress up as Javert and tie them to a tree for five minutes or so (nineteen if they try to run). Play your Les Mis soundtrack throughout the party, but don't watch the movie- some guests may not consider it appropriate (even if you fast forward through Lovely Ladies) and some may not be mature and awesome enough to appreciate the true brilliance of the movie.

, One idea for games is to tweak the names and rules of actual party games so that they're Les Mis themed. ""Pin the tail on the donkey"" could be ""Pin the bread on Valjean"" ""Tag"" could be ""Running from Javert"" You can come up with more on your own.


And, of course, the epic barricade battle! Have your guests help you build a barricade and then have a giant nerf-gun battle! If you get shot in the head, stomach, chest, or other fatal spots, you die and have to sing an epic death song. When the battle is over, rank each guest on how well they did with a character name. First to fall is Eponine, the one that stays alive the longest is Marius. Then, they have to sing one of that character's songs in front of everyone, or they get sent to the guillotine! If you have a karaoke machine and your guests don't know the songs, then you could pop in your CD and use that.

Confirm your Jewish heritage or convert to Judaism.,
Study the different branches of Judaism.,
Apply for rabbinical school.,
Complete your rabbinical training.,
Talk to the rabbi at your local synagogue.,
Apply for positions through a referral service.,
Join a Jewish rabbi organization.,
Be a dedicated rabbi to your congregation.,
Consider a career outside of the pulpit.",How to Become a Rabbi," One of the most essential steps to becoming a rabbi is to confirm that you were born Jewish through proof from your biological parents. You may already be involved in the synagogue and your Jewish faith when you consider becoming a rabbi.Individuals who become rabbis must already have lived a predominately Jewish lifestyle for at least three years, where you are involved in your Jewish community and have been close to your Jewish faith. This is especially important for Jews who have been secular or away from their faith for some time.
If you are not Jewish by birth, you will need to convert to Judaism to become a Rabbi. Converting to Judaism is a major life step and should be done after much thought, as it is a serious and humbling experience. You will need to have lived a predominately Jewish lifestyle for at least one year, taken formal conversion training at a synagogue, and complete the process of Mikvah or conversion. Males must also undergo circumcision, if they are not already circumcised.;
, As a rabbi, you will need to select a branch of Judaism that you would like to train in and practice as a confirmed member of the congregation. There are five main branches of Judaism, each with their own approaches to traditional Jewish practice. They include:Orthodox Judaism: Orthodox Judaism focuses on the traditional teaching of Jewish law and accepts the doctrine of revelation. This means that they believe the Written Law in the Hebrew Bible and the Oral Law in the Talmud was given to Moses by God on Mount Sinai, and therefore, it is the everlasting and only true guide for Judaism. Orthodox Jews demonstrate unswerving loyalty to Jewish traditions and Jewish law.
Conservative Judaism: Like Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Jews believe Jewish laws are sacred. But Conservative Jews believe these laws can be changed and adopted, if necessary, to suit the modern conditions of Jewish life. The Conservative movement tries to “conserve” and protect the Jewish faith but maintains that Jews are not only a religious group but also a people with a distinct culture, history, and language.
Reform Judaism: Reform Judaism focuses on the importance of adapting religious life to the modern age. They view the Torah as divine inspiration but do not view it as a literal revelation that must be strictly followed. For Reform Jews, every generation has the right to accept laws and practices that are essential and adapt certain practices to fit their way of life. They believe that Jewish people are destined to teach the belief in God as well as justice, peace, and fellowship.
Reconstructionist Judaism: This branch was founded by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan in the 20th century and views Judaism as evolving and part of a continuous history. Reconstructionists emphasize understanding, observing, and celebrating Jewish culture, tradition, and heritage.
Secular-Humanist Judaism: This branch is based in Detroit and views Judaism as a living culture and a way of life. It offers an alternative to traditional or conventional Judaism and modern ways to practice Jewish commitment.

, Once you have selected your branch of Judaism, you should look into applying for rabbinical schools within that branch. For example, if you are an Orthodox Jew, you may go to an Orthodox rabbinical school. There has been a drop in enrollment in rabbinical schools in the U.S. so you will likely get into your chosen school or be able to work with the school to get your Hebrew and Jewish literacy up to par.You may need to be willing to relocate for your training as the only accredited rabbinical schools in the United States are located in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, and Cincinnati.
You can also do an online training program with Aleph, the Alliance for Jewish Renewal, in their five year distance program. However, doing an online program may make you less appealing to congregations once you graduate and look for a position as a rabbi.

, Each branch of Judaism has a different set of requirements. Your training may consist of an academic program plus internships and life experience - including spending one year in Israel.Many programs require a four to five year commitment, and you may need to spend $20,000-$30,000 a year for your training, depending on your chosen branch of Judaism. You may need to take out financial aid or loans to pay for your rabbinical training, a common practice among aspiring rabbis. If you are an Orthodox Jew, you may not to take out financial aid to pay for your schooling as many Orthodox rabbinical training programs are given free tuition.
The typical rabbi curriculum includes study of the Torah, Talmud, Mishnah, Jewish history, and Hebrew language. You will also need to take psychology courses, community outreach courses, public speaking courses, and teaching courses. At the end of your studies, you will become ordained as a rabbi.

, Once you have been ordained as a rabbi, you should reach out to the rabbi at your local synagogue. You may be able to gain some connections through touching base with your local rabbi and get more information on open positions. You may also be able to get advice from a more seasoned rabbi about how to take your training and put it into action in a community., There are referral services for rabbis that are run by family services, called the Jewish Clergy Officiation Referral Service. You can apply to be included in this referral service and take on positions through this service.You may be vetted by the service to confirm you are an accredited rabbi with the proper training and you may need to show proof of your accreditation.

, You can join a rabbi association based on your selected branch of Judaism. For example, you may join the Rabbinical Assembly if you are a Conservative rabbi, the Central Conference of American Rabbis if you are a Reform rabbi or the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association if you are a Reconstructionist rabbi. Joining the association will require you to follow certain rules as a member and you may need to be approved by the association’s Board of Rabbis., If you do land a position as a rabbi for a congregation, called “pulpit work”, you will need to fulfill the responsibilities of your position and satisfy the expectations of the congregation, or shul. As a rabbi, you will need to act as a community organizer and as a spiritual guide for the congregation, a long term position that can be challenging and rewarding.Keep in mind your salary as a rabbi is paid for by the congregation but some shuls may only be able to pay you part time. You may need to support yourself with other community work or teaching work to supplement your income.Many congregations are interested in younger rabbis who have energy and passion for the position, and as a way to appeal to younger Jews. This does not mean that older rabbis may not be hired by a shul, just that preference may be shown for younger rabbis.

, Some individuals who become rabbis do not actually practice their training full time and may seek jobs outside of the pulpit, or outside of a congregation position.You may end up working in a Jewish organization, a Jewish community center, in a hospital or in a chaplain. Be open to positions outside of the congregation, as the demand for these roles may be higher and you may have a greater chance of landing a position in these areas.

Understand that, like any religious conversion, converting to Judaism is a big step.,
Research Jewish laws, history and customs, and talk to Jews about their religion.,
Speak with your family about your intention to convert.,
If you are converting because of marriage, speak with your future husband/wife to determine the best course of action, including what denomination you will join.,
Once you feel that you have sufficient reason to convert, make an appointment with a rabbi to discuss the process.,
Unlike in many religions, converting to Judaism is not fast or easy.,
At the end of your studies, you will take a test to determine how much you've learned.,
If you have passed all these steps, a conversion ceremony will be scheduled.,
Children born prior to the end of conversion do not become Jews if their parent converts.",How to Convert to Judaism," Do you believe in and worship your god in some way, shape, or form? If so, you're part way there! If not, take the first step. It's okay, friend, take all the time you need — this article will be waiting for you when you get back.;
, Figure out what you are getting into, and determine why you want to do it. Be aware that Judaism is a major commitment which will affect every part of your life, will last as long as you live, and will even transfer to your children. Judaism is based on the commandments (of which there are 613 in total, though many are not applicable today) and Maimonides' Thirteen Principles of Faith. They should be your first step and the foundation of your Jewish faith.

, This can often be a touchy subject among families, so be sure to explain your reasoning and desire to become Jewish. Make sure that you are comfortable with your decision to leave your former religion, if you had one. in order for your family to allow you to convert, you can start to drop subtle hints, bring up conversations about the Jewish religion, etc, to at least see their views on the Jewish religion and people.


Your family, friends, and people that you know could turn you down or have a negative attitude towards you if you convert. While this of course is no reason not to convert, you should be prepared for this outcome.

, Not many rabbis will convert people just because of marriage; the potential convert must be sincere and want to convert because of spiritual feelings and not just because of marriage. There are three main branches, all with differing levels of observance and ritual. Generally speaking, from most to least traditional, these are: (a) Orthodox, (b) Conservative (called 'Reform' or 'Masorti' in Europe), and (c) Reform (called 'Progressive' or 'Liberal' in Europe).

, Be prepared for the rabbi to try to dissuade you, or turn you away, 3 times or more. Many rabbis consider this part of their job. The goal is not to prevent honest seekers from converting, but to test the individual's commitment, and to make sure that becoming a Jew is truly what he or she wants. If you are persistent, show that you know what you're getting into, and are still committed to doing it, the rabbi may eventually decide to start you on the path to conversion., You will need to spend at least a year (sometimes two or more) studying (many organizations offer night classes) and living a Jewish life before your conversion is finalized. Your studies will cover the basics of Jewish law, history and culture, and you will also receive some instruction in the Hebrew language. If you are a teen or child who would like to convert to Judaism, realize that very few rabbis will let you convert, and you also have the obstacle of family not allowing you to practice your faith. If you are in this position, it is recommended that you get Jewish books, study Judaism as much as you can, and maybe even try living Jewish traditions, such as not eating leavened bread during Passover and keeping the Sabbath. When you are age 16-18, go to a rabbi and start talking to him or her about conversion. Remember that you don't need to officially convert to join a Jewish community, you can go to services anyway. However, certain aspects, such as reading from the Torah scroll or wearing a prayer shall and Tefillin, may only be done by a Jewish person.

, You will also be questioned before a Jewish court (called a Beit Din, consisting of three authorities) about adherence to the Halacha (Jewish Law), as part of the conversion proceedings.

, It will involve three things: acceptance of all The Commandments of the Torah and Rabbinic Enactments (at least for an Orthodox conversion), a ritual bath (full-body immersion in a Mikva), and if you're an uncircumcised male, you will also need to be circumcised. In the cases where the man has already been circumcised, creating a small drop of blood is sufficient.

, Some authorities (often Orthodox and those of higher levels of observance) have stricter rules, considering a child conceived before her conversion as not being Halachically Jewish. If they want to be Jewish, they will have to go through conversion themselves after they reach the age of 13. Children born to a Jewish woman after her conversion are Jewish automatically, since Jewish lineage is passed through the mother.

Start building at the right time.,
Choose a spot outdoors.Building your sukkah near your home is ideal for convenience.,
Plan your sukkah.,
Gather materials.,
Build the walls.,
Build the roof covering.,
Embellish your sukkah.,
Rebuild your sukkah each year.,
Use the sukkah.",How to Build a Sukkah," Most experts suggest that you should start building your sukkah right at the end of Yom Kippur.If you cannot start building at the end of the day, then start early the next morning. Ideally, the structure should be finished on the day after Yom Kippur, but don’t finish until the structure is built safely.;
, One important condition, however, is that nothing must be blocking the top of your sukkah from the open sky. This means that no tree limbs, roofs, etc. should hang over it.The sukkah must be exposed to open sky because it must be able to provide functional shade to represent the protection similar huts gave Jews in the wilderness.Functional shade means that the sukkah's roof will block most sunlight, but let some shine through to make a person aware of the shade.
If you do not have a yard, you can build a sukkah on a balcony (as long as it is not covered by another balcony)., A sukkah should have a minimum of at least two walls plus part of a third wall (at least 3.2 inches wide).However, it is preferable for the sukkah to have four full walls.There does not need to be an actual door, but there must at least be a doorway so that you can enter the structure. Your sukkah must also have a roof. The structure should be at least 32 inches high, but not taller than 30 feet (about 10 meters or 20 amount).These size specifications are determined by traditional Jewish law to ensure that the sukkah is large enough to serve the basic functions of a dwelling: eating and sleeping.You can make a sukkah that is larger than the minimum if you want to have room for more people in it, or space for other activities.

, You can use any materials to build the walls of the sukkah, but you must use special raw plant-based material (sechach) to build the roof. It helps to gather all of your materials before beginning to build your sukkah. However, you must build it in the right order. The roof material should not be laid until you have completed the walls., Keep in mind that the walls of your sukkah should be at least 32 inches high, and larger than 22.4 inches in length and breadth. A floor space of at least 27 by 27 inches (70cm x 70cm or seven tefachim by seven tefachim) is recommended, to provide enough room for a person to sit down.There can be gaps in the material making up the sukkah’s walls. However, these gaps should not be wider than 9.6 inches. You can make the walls of your sukkah out of any material that is suitable enough not to be blown around in the wind.For instance, you could:


Stretch canvas, sheets, or plastic around metal poles.Build simple walls of planks of wood
Stack cinder blocks
Use an existing wall of your home as a portion of the sukkah and build other walls out of materials to complete it., To be kosher, the roof of a sukkah must be made out of sechach, or raw plant material not used for any other purpose, as the Book of Deuteronomy (16:14) specifies.You can lay long strips of material over the walls of your sukkah, then build up layers of sechach until the roof is thick enough to block out most sunlight, but let some shine through.Do not tie down or support the roof with any non-sechach materials, especially metal. Possible materials for building the roof can include:


Bamboo
Evergreen branches
Reeds
Corn stalks
Straw
Special schechach mats (these must be designed and intended specifically for serving as the roof of a sukkah), You can add lighting (such as a portable lamp and an extension cord), chairs and/or a table, posters, or fresh fruit to decorate your sukkah.This makes the dwelling more festive and personal. However, Chabad custom encourages the act of building and using the sukkah in remembrance to be thought of as the real beauty.

, You can reuse the base of your sukkah each year. However, you must replace the sechach materials of the roof.Store the structure safely to protect it from wind and water.

, Once your sukkah is built, you should use it for seven days, according to Leviticus 23:42.This period serves as a remembrance of the time that Jews spent in the wilderness. The basic function of a sukkah is to provide shade, and room for sleeping and eating.


According to tradition, you should eat at least your meals (if not all snacks) in the sukkah during Sukkot.You can sleep in the sukkah if you want, but you do not have to if it is uncomfortable (too hot, too cold, wet, etc.) or inconvenient.The sukkah is a symbolic dwelling, so you can also use it for other activities you would normally do in your home, such as working, talking with friends and family, reading a book, etc."

Inspect the 'Talit', look at all the fringes to make sure there are four of them in each of the four corners and that they are well separated.,
Hold the 'Talit' in front of you and say the following blessing:

Remove non-Kosher parts from the hind quarters of the animal.,
Remove all fat surrounding the vital organs.",How to Properly Slaughter a Cow Under the Kosher Method Shechitah," The length of the blade is twice the width of the animal's neck.;
, If the animal is ill or injured, it is no longer considered Kosher. This has two purposes. First, it ensures the quality of the meat because an ill or injured animal should not be eaten anyway. Second, it provides a disincentive for Kosher farms to partake in the methods of other farms, because if the cow is hurt in any way, it cannot be slaughtered.

, If the animal is injured during the restraining, it is no longer considered kosher.

, Make sure that there are absolutely no nicks or unevenness. Any blemish on the blade at all, even one big enough for a human hair to fall into, renders the knife unacceptable for kosher slaughter. The knife must be sharpened to such a sharp point that if the Shochet were to slice of his/her finger, he/she would feel no pain. , The incision must not at all pull or tear, and must be performed in one motion free of any pause. If done correctly, the animal will die within 2 seconds.

, Eating blood is not Kosher, because the blood contains the soul of the animal.

, For mammals (cows, sheep, goats, etc.), make sure there are no defects. The lungs must be inflated to check for unwanted holes, and for signs of lung disease. If there are holes or signs of active lung disease, the cow is not considered kosher.

, These include the blood vessels and the sciatic nerve (unless you are Ashkenazi and have no tradition of its removal). As with the lungs, this only applies to mammals., Internal fat, known in Hebrew as ""cheilev,"" is not considered Kosher.

Where to Sit Shiva: “Sitting shiva,"" is an emotionally and spiritually healing time where the mourners may dwell together and have friends and loved ones come to support them with short visits when they ""make a shiva call."",
After the Funeral:The word ""Shiva"" in English, translates as ""Seven"".,
Provide Food for Mourners: After returning home from the funeral, the mourners eat a traditional ""meal of condolence"" - traditionally round foods symbolic of the need for life to go on.,
Jewish Customs to follow at a Shiva House: In a traditional Jewish house of mourning; mirrors are covered, leather shoes are not worn, the immediate family does not cut their hair, shave, engage in marital relations, listen to music or watch television or partake in anything that can be construed as joyous.,
Daily Prayer Services at the Shiva House: Jewish Prayers services may be held daily at the home.,
How to End Sitting Shiva: The last day of shiva is observed for just a few hours and the following may be recited:


No more will your sun set, nor your moon be darkened, for God will be an eternal light for you, and your days of mourning shall end.",How to Sit Shiva," The home of a direct mourner is said to be filled with the spirit of the loved one who is now gone. Memories will come easily there, and part of the comfort of shiva is remembering the deceased by sharing stories of his or her life with friends and family. It is considered a great mitzvah (act of kindness) to visit someone ""sitting shiva. "";
, The Shiva period is traditionally 7 days, beginning the day of the funeral and running through the morning of the seventh day. Many Jewish families, however, opt to sit shiva for a lesser number of days.

, ""Shiva Food"" is provided by relatives, friends and neighbors. It is a mitzvah for visitors to send prepared food to mourners, to assure there is plenty to eat as observant mourners may not cook or prepare food using heat. If the family observes traditional Jewish dietary laws only kosher foods should be sent.

, Immediate family members sit on low, uncomfortable stools. Grief is traditionally expressed by tearing one's clothing. Alternatively, mourners may choose to wear a small black ribbon that is cut by the Rabbi for a period of 30 days. A Jewish memorial candle may be lit and remain burning publicly 24 hours a day for the entire week. The candle, reminds us that our loved one's soul is eternal.

, This is a good time to ""make a shiva call"" and non-Jews are welcomed to participate.

, (Isaiah 60:20)
When shiva is over, mourners may take a short walk around the block, to symbolize their return to society.

If you can read Hebrew but do not understand all of the words, consider purchasing a Siddur with English translations.
If you cannot read Hebrew, you may be able to find a transliterated Siddur.

, On an ordinary weekday, Jews must pray three times over the course of the day. Shacharit is the prayer recited earlier in the morning, Minchah is prayed in the afternoon before sunset, and Maariv (or Aravit) is prayed in the evening.

, Say them out loud, but only loud enough so that you can hear yourself (remember, this is a personal experience). Do not just recite the prayers--concentrate on their meanings.

, This is the most important part of the Jewish prayers. It is more often known as Shemoneh Esrei, as it was originally comprised of 18 blessings (""Shemoneh Esrei"" means 18, though there are currently 19 blessings). This is the most complex part of the prayer in terms of rules, so be sure to familiarize yourself with them before beginning.

, Instead of rushing to finish, reflect on you experience. Can you improve?

There are 2 Talmuds: The Babylonian Talmud and The Jerusalem Talmud.,
Learn to read Hebrew.,
If you're not already an Orthodox Jew, study Orthodox Judaism.,
Study as much of the Tanakh (Jewish Bible) as much as possible, with particular attention to the Torah, also called The Five Books of Moses.

,
Study the Mishnah.,
Study a traditional Jewish work written in Hebrew without vowels and symbols.,
Acquire a basic knowledge of Aramaic grammar.,
Begin studying the Talmud.,
Find a Yeshiva.,
Continue your studying after leaving the Yeshiva.",How to Learn to Read the Talmud," Ask your rabbi which Talmud to study and why.;
, The Hebrew language has symbols and vowels below the letters to make the Talmud easier to read.

, It's not necessary to be Orthodox to study the Talmud.

,, Formally, the Talmud is organized as a commentary on the Mishnah, although its frequent digressions give it a much wider scope. For breadth of knowledge, studying the Mishnah in English may be useful at the outset, but it is important to become skilled at reading it in Hebrew. Many beginning students of Mishnah have found the edition with the commentary of Rabbi Pinchas Kehati particularly valuable.

, The Talmud and its commentaries do not include them, which many beginning students find intimidating. Mastering the skill of reading Hebrew without vowels and symbols before starting to study Talmud makes this transition easier. A particularly good text to use for this purpose is the restatement of Jewish Law by Moses Maimonides, known to traditional Jews as ""The Rambam""; his book is known in Hebrew as ""Mishnah Torah"". It is written in a Hebrew style similar to that of the Mishnah, and includes information that will be useful when beginning Talmud study. Beginners may wish to start with the Koren Talmud Bavli edition, which has a clear English translation of the Talmud text and the traditional ""Daf Vilna"" page with vowels and symbols. It also has helpful commentary and notes in the margins by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, which clarifies the Talmudic text.

, Many beginning students of Talmud skip this step, and later encounter serious difficulties because they did so. Aramaic has several dialects, so try to find a resource that focuses on the dialect of the Babylonian Talmud. 'Aiding Talmud Study' by Rabbi Aryeh Carmell and ""The Reference Guide to the Talmud,"" also by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz are popular choices for this purpose.

, For this you will need, at a minimum, two other people:


1. A rabbi or Hebrew teacher, whose knowledge and skill in Talmud study should be far above your own.
2. A study partner, whose knowledge and skill in Talmud study should be as near as possible to yours. The preferred method of study is that you and your study partner go over a section of Talmudic text together, challenging each other until each is certain that both fully understand every word, phrase, statement, and argument in the passage and the structure of the passage as a whole. The pair - or pairs - who make up the Hebrew teacher's Talmud class then meet with the Hebrew teacher, who uses a kind of Socratic method to uncover and remedy any misunderstandings, and to reveal deeper levels of meaning in the text than the students would be able to see on their own.

, If you are female, may be called a Midrasha, which is a traditional Talmudic school in which to study more intensively. True mastery of the art of Talmud study is very difficult to achieve without at least a year of full-time study. Moreover, the Talmud was itself composed in the yeshivas of Babylonia. There is no way to fully appreciate its internal dynamic without first-hand experience of the yeshiva setting and atmosphere.

, The Talmud requires regular study so you don't fall behind.

, Certain prayer objects are a necessity for the morning prayers. These objects can be purchased at your local Judaica store. These include the tefillin and tallit that you will need to wear for the prayer, as well as the siddur, or prayer book, that contains the prayers you will need to recite.

, The Shacharis is the morning prayer and can only be undertaken in the morning. Traditionally, you may begin the Shacharis when there is enough light for you to recognize a friend six feet away - so, shortly after dawn. The prayer must be completed before midday, after which point the afternoon prayer is more appropriate., Most prayers take place in a Beis Haknesses (House of Gathering). In general, the minimum amount of men that you should pray together with is a quorum (10 men). However, there are situations where you can pray by yourself. These include travel, sickness, and time availability. Note that the prayer ritual changes slightly when you pray alone.

Open the case and take out the tefillin. Lengthen the strap by the knot so that you can fit the tefillin around your arm. If you're right-handed, it will go on your left arm; if you're left-handed, it will go on your right. After rolling up your sleeve, slide the tefillin up your arm.

Then wrap the strap into the inside of your hand, and around one more time to for a Hebrew letter ‘Shin.'


Once you are wearing your Tefillin, talking outside of praying is strictly prohibited unless necessary, or if you are going to speak words of learning.

, Now that you are wearing your Tallis and Tefillin, it is time to start praying to God. There are 4 parts of the morning prayers. All the prayers are written in Lashon Hakodesh (The Language of Holiness), or Biblical Hebrew. If you do not know how to read Biblical Hebrew, it is suggested that you buy a Siddur with a translation to a language with which you are familiar. The four parts are:


Birchas Hashachar or Morning Blessings, which include praise for the Torah as well as Biblical and Rabbinic readings.
Pesukei D'Zimra, or the Passages of Praise, which consist of various blessings, psalms, and verses.Amidah, or Shemoneh Esrei, which is the central prayer of the Jewish liturgy and consists of a series of 19 blessings.Ashrei (Psalm 145) and Uva Letzion, or the concluding prayers, before which you should not leave the synagogue.

A Bar/Bat Mitzvah is a time to reflect on your spiritual self and find God.
A Bar/Bat Mitzvah is an acceptance of more responsibility.
A Bar/Bat Mitzvah is the time you become responsible for your own actions.
A Bar/Bat Mitzvah is an agreement to continue your Jewish education.
A Bar/Bat Mitzvah isn't the end or goal of your Jewish education.

A Bar/Bat Mitzvah isn't just about the party.
A Bar/Bat Mitzvah isn't a money-making opportunity.;
, Don't start learning Hebrew the year before your Bar/Bat Mitzvah, it should be a long process, usually starting when you are very young, in kindergarten or first grade. If its too late for that, you have some catching up to do. Learning Hebrew should be your goal, not just knowing enough for your Torah portion. You should be able to read your portion, not recite it from memory.

, If one is available, go to religious school and attend it as if it were a regular school. In order to fully appreciate your Bar/Bat Mitzvah, you need to understand the culture you are a part of. Next time you go to a Passover Seder, really listen to what is being said and ask questions. Join in the discussion, and add your insights to what the Haggadah is talking about. When you shake the Lulav and Etrog, ask your rabbi why you are shaking it in each direction.

, One of the things that makes Judaism unique is that you are encouraged to ask questions. Take advantage of this. Don't just accept what your rabbi tells you, ask him/her why. Asking questions is the key to spiritual maturity. It shows you won't just believe something because a rabbi says it.

, The Torah contains all of the teachings and rituals of Jewish culture. You don't have to memorize it or even be able to quote it, you just have to read it and understand what it's saying.

, Mitzvot translates as ""commandment"" and it usually refers to a Jew's obligation to G-d to help others. A mitzvah can be something as small as holding the door open for someone at the library or as large as starting your own organization to feed the hungry. Doing mitzvot shows G-d that you are responsible and are ready to take on the responsibilities of becoming a Bar/Bat Mitzvah.

, Make sure you set the date at least a year in advance. You will need at least that much time to fully prepare for the ceremony and out-of-town guests will need to know the date early in order to make plans to attend. Usually the date is around the time of the Bar/Bat Mitzvah's birthday (13 for a boy and 12 or 13 for a girl depending on your synagogue), but it doesn't have to be. Choose a date when you are least busy, that might be after school is out or during a break, but be warned that these dates are often the first to be grabbed and some guests may be on vacation. You will be very busy about 2 weeks before the ceremony solidifying your plans, so make sure you will have time.

, The weekly portion is often very long, and often you will only be required to learn some of it. Choose a section that is interesting to you.

, While you should do mitzvahs every day, this one is special. It should be about something you feel truly passionate about. You should consider your Bar/Bat Mitzvah project a part of tikkun olam, repairing the world. Try to do something big that will make a major impact on your community.

, Your rabbi will have many interesting insights to add and will probably spark your own ideas. Don't be afraid to share them, rabbis love it when young people take an interest in Torah and will be happy to discuss it with you.

, Going to services is a good idea anyway, but when you're preparing for a Bar/Bat Mitzvah, it's even more imperative. You need to be familiar with the prayers and the ""stage directions"" because you will be doing them yourself during your Bar/Bat Mitzvah. Shabbat services will also give you an opportunity to connect with G-d.

, When you study, it's best to start with a sheet including vowels, unless you speak Hebrew fluently. If you read or chant it enough, it will become second nature and you'll be able to read the real thing without vowels. Once you are comfortable with the portion, however, make sure you practice with a facsimile of the Torah you are reading so you can get used to the unique handwriting of the scribe who created the Torah. Reading from a sheet that looks similar will also help to calm your nerves about the portion.

, In your eagerness to learn your portion, it's sometimes necessary to slow down and take a look at what you're actually reading. Try to get to the point where you can translate as you read and actually know what the words mean. It's an amazing experience when you can read and understand your portion as if it were in your native language.

, After you're on the right track with your portion, it's time to think about the fun part: the reception. Your reception can be anything you want, from a formal party with a DJ and dancing, to a less informal basketball game. Whatever it is, try to pick something that you can invite all of your guests to. That means choosing something that isn't too expensive. If you leave some guests out, you might end up in more drama than you can even imagine.

, As soon as you know how many people you can accommodate, send out your Bar Mitzvah Invitations () so your guests will save the date. Spend some time on the invitations and make them look nice.

, It is customary for the Bar/Bat Mitzvah candidate to give a speech to the congregation. It can be about pretty much whatever you want, so long as it relates back to your Torah portion. You might want to include an informal promo for your Mitzvah project, but you don't have to.

, By about three months before the date, you should know your Torah portion. You'll have to be able to do the whole service on the real day, so you need to be very familiar with it. If there are any prayers you are stuck on, ask for help from your rabbi or religious school teacher.

, The Haftorah portion is usually read at some point after the Torah portion and is from the Books of Prophets. The tropes are very different from the ones in your Torah portion, so you will need to devote time to study them. Make sure you practice your Torah portion as well or you might accidentally start singing your Torah portion with Haftorah tropes!

, Having an Aliyah is a great honor so you should choose your Olehs (people who have an Aliyah) well. Usually, you will do the last Aliyah, and there will be six other Aliyahs to give out. The only rule is that the Olehs must be Jewish and must be of age (had their Bar/Bat Mitzvah). Remember this includes people who didn't have the actual ceremony, assuming they are over thirteen for men and twelve for women.

, A few months before your ceremony, you need to have started your Mitzvah project. Earlier is better, but a few months is plenty of time. It doesn't have to finish until after your Bar/Bat Mitzvah, but you need to put some work into it now.

, About a month before your ceremony, make sure you have reservations wherever you plan on celebrating. You should also pick out decorations and hire any personnel you might need such as a DJ. Ideally, you should make your reservations long in advance so you aren't closed out.

, It will be easier for you to sleep the night before if you have a rehearsal a few days before. If possible, have everyone who has a part there, even if it's just a reading. You'll get all of the rough edges smoothed now and your nerves will be calmed during the real thing knowing you've done it before.

, The Friday before, do something fun before going to Shul. Studying at this point is futile, you should already know the service backwards and forwards. Studying the night before is the equivalent of cramming for a standardized test the night before; it's so broad and complex that you will probably lose more information than you retain.

, The entire ceremony should be fun. Don't let nerves stress you out too much, or you'll regret it later. You'll be fine, you've been preparing for about a year now, and with all of that preparation, there's no way anything will go wrong!

, This will allow you to see Judaism at a more personal level and will allow you to get to know the rabbi more. Attending a Passover Seder is recommended. If March or April is far from now, then attending a Shabbat dinner is recommended.

, Reform Judaism is a movement that is never the same in each community or even in each city. One synagogue may view Reform Judaism in one way and another synagogue may view it another way. It's recommended to see how a Reform synagogue runs. Reform synagogues observes Reform Judaism the same way it was since its starting in the 1800s.

,,, It has the full power of the healthful enzymes to nourish and keep your body and mind healthy.

,, Namely:


We believe that Ein Sof (the Eternal One) is the Creator and ruler of all created things. He is the Creator and Sustainer. He is Immanent and Transcendent.
We believe that the Creator is echad (one), yet emanates, three manifestations; Abba Yahweh,the Father, Yeshua HaMoshiach, the Son, and Imma Ruach HaKodesh, the Holy Spirit.
Though Elohim is beyond gender, Elohim has manifested certain characteristics that are masculine and feminine. Thus, Yahweh represents the Divine Masculine aspect of Ein Sof, and Ruach HaKodesh expresses the Divine Feminine, the Mother.
We believe in Messiah Yeshua, the only begotten Son, beloved of His Father in heaven, whom Yahweh sent into this world to be our Master and Redeemer, as He promised by his holy prophets, and who descended from heaven for our salvation.
He was conceived of the Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit), born of the virgin Miriam (Mary is the translation.), the seed of David and anointed of Yahweh with the Ruach and power.
He was tempted in all ways as we are but without sin. He glorified his Father in heaven in all of His words, thoughts and deeds. He bore the reproach of sinners and was put to death on the tree for our transgressions.
He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him and by His stripes we are healed (Isa. LIII)
We believe that Messiah Yeshua is the Alef and the Tav, the beginning and the end.
We believe that we pray only to the Father, in Yeshua’s name. Yeshua is the Way, the Truth and the Life. No one comes to Abba except through Him.
We believe that the prophets prophesied of Messiah Yeshua through Yahweh’s foreordained wisdom and knowledge.
We believe that the Torah, given through Moshe (Translated as Moses) is eternal and binding for the Essene Netzari community. The Torah contains the transcendental precepts by which we are to live our spiritual lives.
We believe that the whole Torah, which we now possess, is the same as that given to Moshe. We reject any notion of an oral Torah.
We believe that Sacred Scripture as written by the original writers in the original language is the Word Of Yahweh. We accept and affirm the Tanak, the Brit Chadasha, the Apocrypha, and the Book of Enoch as Sacred Scripture.
We believe that Elohim knows the hearts and minds of all human beings. No one is lost to His love, mercy or tender gaze.
We believe that Yahweh will reward those made righteous through the atonement purchased for us by Messiah Yeshua on the tree. Those who reject His mercy and love will reap the results of their hard-heartedness.
We believe that Yeshua will return to set up His Eternal earthly kingdom and rule the world on David’s throne from the New Jerusalem.
We believe that the dead will be raised and the righteous shall be changed.
We believe that Daven (prayer) and meditation are our primary methods of communication with Yahweh and seek to lead lives filled with their attentiveness.
We believe in observing the Principle of Kashrut in our diet. Further, we strongly encourage the organic Edenic Diet (vegetarianism) as most befitting our future life in the Eternal Kingdom. We do not judge those who choose not to maintain the Edenic Diet, but expect that they will keep Kashrut.
We believe that to enter the waters of mikveh is an outer sign of an inner transformation. We hold it as a necessary component of spiritual realization in Yeshua.
We believe that non-violence is a mandatory precept for talmidim (disciples) of Yeshua Messiah.
We believe that stewardship of the earth is a sacred obligation. To this end we encourage organic farming, sustainable living, and eco-theological understanding.

",How to Celebrate Rosh Hashanah," Rosh Hashanah is Hebrew for ""Head of the Year."" It is considered to be the birthday of the world, and hence is the Jewish New Year. Rosh Hashanah is a time to learn from your mistakes of the past year, and to think about how you can improve yourself in the future. It is also a time to make personal resolutions both large and small.;
, This will help cleanse you spiritually for the upcoming holiday.

, People often dress up for this very important High Holiday, so think formal to business casual attire.

, This is the only commandment directly referenced in the Torah regarding the observation of the holiday. The shofar is a ram's horn. It is blown during the service by the ""Ba'al Tekiah"", or shofar blower. It is a symbol of spiritual awakening and reflection. As we do not know exactly how the shofar was blown in the ancient Temple, four different blasts are given to ensure that the shofar is heard properly for each new year:


Tekiah: One blast, a few seconds long, that ends abruptly.
Shevarim: Three one-to-two-second short blasts that rapidly scoop from low to high in pitch.
Teruah: Nine short, rapid blasts.
Tekiah Gedolah: This is one long, continuous blast, traditionally held for nine counts, but in progressive communities it is often held as long as possible.

, Most people throw stale breadcrumbs. This is observed on the first afternoon of Rosh Hashanah.

, The challah is round on Rosh Hashanah to symbolize the cycle of the year..

, Apples dipped in honey is a traditional food as well. This tradition signifies the hope for ""A Sweet New Year"" due to the sweetness of the honey. Another common Rosh Hashanah food is the pomegranate. According to Jewish tradition, a pomegranate contains 613 seeds representing the 613 Commandments. This signifies the hope for a fruitful new year ahead.

Extinguish the Havdalah candle to begin the new week.",How to Perform Havdalah1," Start by lighting the Havdalah candle, which is typically braided and has several wicks. A wine glass is filled, and a spice box is filled (typically with cloves or cinnamon).The ceremony begins by making fire, which represents civilization, hope, and a way to overcome the darkness (both literal and figurative). Lighting the candle harkens back to Adam and Eve, who were afraid of the darkness until G-d showed them how to make fire.
Even when the candle is put out, the memory of its warmth and light will remain.;
, Wine represents hope and joy for a happy week ahead. Pray the following: ברוך אתה יי אלוהינו מלך העולם בורא פרי הגפן


The transliteration is: Baruch ata Adonai eloheynu melech ha’olam borei p’ri hagafen.
Translate this as: Blessed are You Adonai our God, Ruler of the universe, Creator of the fruit of the vine.,
The English translation is: Blessed are You Adonai our God, Ruler of the universe, Creator of all the spices.
The spice box can then be passed around. It symbolizes a revival of the senses, to remind you that the next Shabbat is only six days away., You can extend your hands towards the flame to feel its heat and appreciate its beauty while praying: ברוך אתה יי אלהינו מלך העולם בורא מאורי האש


You can speak this transliteration: Baruch ata Adonai eloheynu melech ha’olam Borei m’orei ha-eish.
The prayer translates as: Blessed are You Adonai our God, Ruler of the universe, Creator of the light of fire., This blessing both closes the ceremony and points toward the new week that has just begun: ברוך אתה יי אלהינו מלך העולם המבדיל בין קדש לחול


In transliteration, it is: Baruch ata Adonai eloheynu melech ha’olam Hamavdil bein kodesh l’chol.
In translation, the prayer is: Blessed are You Adonai our God, Ruler of the universe, Who separates the sacred from the profane., The candle is put out in the wine and leaves you in (relative) darkness. Shabbat has ended, and it is time to look forward to the new week and what it holds in store. This last sound (the sizzle of the snuffed flame) is what separates the holy (Shabbat) from the mundane (the rest of the week)."

Start Havdalah after sunset on Saturday.,
Overpour the wine, and bless yourself with it.,
Pick up and pass around the key items.,
Decide how to phrase the prayers.,
Use the blessed wine to extinguish the blessed candle.",How to Perform Havdalah2," The service should not begin before sundown, and the traditional timing is to wait until three medium sized stars can be viewed in a single glance at the sky.There are, however, other means of determining when to start:


Some people start Havdalah one hour and ten minutes later than they began Shabbat. So, if Shabbat began at 6:00 PM on Friday, Havdalah would begin at 7:10 PM on Saturday.
Others base the start time on sunset in their location, and add approximately forty-five minutes. So, if that day’s recognized sunset time is 7:13 PM, Havdalah would begin just before 8:00 PM.
There are online and printed guides available to help you time out when to begin Havdalah. You can also ask around regarding the traditional start time determination where you live.

, Many celebrants choose to pour just a bit more wine than the cup or glass can hold, allowing some to spill over onto a plate positioned underneath. This is meant to represent the hope for an overflow of blessings in the week ahead.At the conclusion of the Havdalah service, some people dip their pinky fingers into the spilled wine on the plate and rub their eyebrows and/or ears with it. This indicates a hope to see and hear good things in the coming week.

, While it is traditional to hold up the wine, spices, and candle at various times during the Havdalah service, the fine details tend to vary. Here is one version to consider following (it assumes a right-handed person; reverse the hand directions if you are a lefty):Pick up the wine in your right hand; pray; move the wine to your left hand and continue to hold it.
Pick up the spices in your right hand; pray; smell the spices and pass them around for others to do the same.
Bless the candle while another holds it or, if alone, while it rests in a holder. During the blessing, all present can extend their hands toward the candle so that their fingernails reflect its light.
Move the wine back to your right hand for the final blessing.

, As with most elements of Havdalah, variations exist in the specific phrasing of the blessings given. You may wish to consult your local community regarding common phrasing and content. Here, for example, is a more detailed version of the final blessing:Barukh atah Adonai, Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam

Blessed are you, Lord, our God, sovereign of the universe


hamav'dil bein kodesh l'chol

Who separates between sacred and secular


bein or l'choshekh bein Yis'ra'eil la'amim

between light and darkness, between Israel and the nations


bein yom hash'vi'i l'sheishet y'mei hama'aseh

between the seventh day and the six days of labor


Barukh atah Adonai

Blessed are You, Lord


hamav'dil bein kodesh l'chol (Amein).

who separates between sacred and secular. (Amen)



, After the Havdalah candle has been blessed and the service completed, the candle is extinguished. Many people choose to use the blessed wine to do this. For instance:After the final prayer, the leader of the service drinks some of the wine.
The rest of the wine is poured into a dish or bowl.
The lit candle is dipped into the poured out wine.
Alternatively, the candle flame can be held over the empty dish, and the wine poured onto it.

Buy a shofar from a Jewish store.,
Practice making the correct mouth form.,
Try to close that hole.,
Get the shofar and make this form with your mouth.,
Hopefully, you will get some sort of shriek, which means you have succeeded!,
Know the shofar commands.",How to Blow a Shofar," They can be found easily but can vary in price. Some are longer and better looking than others so they will be more expensive. If you would really like to blow your shofar in front of a crowd, Maybe getting a shiny, long, twisty one will make you look good, but keep in mind that a longer one is much harder to blow. Practice on a medium one - the kind that have a quarter twist. Avoid the very small ones. They are very difficult to sound. Try several shofars in the store and pick one that seems easier.;
, If you play any type of horn, play the Shofar like you would play the horn. You might need to tighten your lips to fit the hole. If you don't have experience with any horns, try tightening the sides of your lips. This should make your mouth look much smaller and you should only be able to suck in air from the hole made by tightening your lips, air should not come in from the sides.

, Blow out air as hard as you can; this should make your lips vibrate, making almost like an elephant noise. This is how you are going to play your shofar.

, Put the shofar at the spot were your lips vibrate the most. Usually this is right in the center but for some people, like me, it can be played from almost anywhere on your lips depending where you put the pressure. However, the Jewish tradition requires that one use the right side of the lips for blowing shofar.

, It might not sound like much, but with practice, your lips will work muscles that will make you better and soon you will be blowing the extremely long blast at the end of the Jewish holidays!

, Tekiah is a short sound, Shevarim is three blasts, Teruah is 9 short blasts in rapid succession. These can be combined, such as Shevarim Teruah which is three blasts and than 9 very fast blasts in rapid succession. Tekiah-Gedolah is usually the last command called, and it means the very long blast usually to signify the end of the holiday of Yom Kippur. Some Shofar blowers can sustain a Tekiah-Gedolah for as long as a minute! If you'd like to be the ""talk of the temple"", make sure your Tekiah-Gedolah is impressive.

In fact, Sukkot is so closely associated with happy emotions that traditional sources often call it Z'man Simchateinu (Hebrew:""the Season of our Rejoicing""). For the seven days of Sukkot, Jews are encouraged to celebrate God's role in their lives and rejoice in the good fortune of the past year. Sukkot should a happy time spent with your friends and family, so be ready to let go of any negative thoughts or feelings in preparation for the holiday. Aim to be upbeat, positive, and thankful to God for the entire week.;
, As noted above, one of the most memorable, remarkable traditions of Sukkot is the building of a Sukkah.. This lightly-constructed booth can be made from many different types of materials as long as it is able to stand up to the wind.The roof of the Sukkah is traditionally made from leaves, branches, and other plant matter. Sukkah are usually decorated on the inside with drawings and religious symbols. For more information on building a Sukkah, see the appropriate section below.


In the book of Leviticus, Jews are instructed to dwell in the Sukkah for all seven days of the Sukkot holiday. In a modern context, most take this to mean centering family gatherings around the sukkah and eating meals inside it, though some devout Jews will even sleep in it.

, Though the Sukkot holiday lasts for about 7 to 8 days, the first two days of the holiday are especially blessed. On these days, much like on Shabbat, most forms of work are to be avoided as a show of reverence to God. Specifically, all activities normally forbidden on Shabbat are also forbidden on the first two days of Sukkot with the exception of cooking, baking, transferring fire, and carrying things around.During this time, people observing the holiday are encouraged to spend time praying and celebrating with their families.


The following five days are Chol Hamoed (Hebrew: ""intermediate days""), during which work is permitted.Note, however, that if Shabbat falls during the intermediate days, it must be observed as normal.
Many common activities, like writing, sewing, cooking, braiding hair, and even watering plants are traditionally forbidden on Shabbat.Complete lists of banned activities are available from Jewish resources online.

, During Sukkot, the ordinary morning, evening and afternoon prayers are supplemented with additional ones to mark the holiday. The exact prayers you'll need to say will vary depending on what day it is — the first two special days and the following five intermediate days have their own prayers. However, traditionally, on every day of Sukkot after the morning prayer, the complete Hallel (Hebrew: ""praise"") prayer. This prayer is the verbatim text of Psalms 113-118.On the first two days of Sukkot, the ordinary Amidah (Hebrew: ""the standing prayer"") is replaced with a special variation used just for holidays.On the following five intermediate days, the Amidah prayers are said as normal, except that a special ""ya'aleh v'yavo"" passage is inserted into each., Besides building and dwelling in a Sukkah, this is the most important holiday tradition for Sukkot. On the first day of Sukkot, the observers of the holiday ritually wave a collection of branches, including the lulav and the etrog in all directions. A lulav is a bouquet made from a single palm leaf, two willow branches and three myrtle branches, held together by woven leaves. An etrog is a citron, a lemon-like fruit grown in Israel. The etrog must have the stigma stem to make it kosher. To perform the ritual, hold the lulav in your right hand and the etrog in your left, say a Bracha blessing over them, then shake them in the six directions: north, south, east, west, up, and down, symbolizing God's presence everywhere.Note that different religious commentators give different instructions for the order of directions the lulav and etrog should be shaken in.To most, the precise order isn't important.

, Building the Sukkah and performing the branch-waving ritual are undoubtedly the two most important, well-known Sukkot traditions, but they're far from the only ones. Sukkot is a holiday with many traditions - too many to list here. These often vary from family to family and locale to locale, so feel free to research the Sukkot traditions of the world as you're planning your holiday. Below are just a few ideas you might want to consider for your Sukkot celebration:


Spend time eating meals and camping out in the Sukkah.
Tell stories from scripture, especially those from the 40 years the Israelites spent in the desert.
Participate in Sukkah song and dance - many religious songs are made just for Sukkot.Invite your family to join your Sukkot celebration.

, The sukkah, which is the definitive Sukkot tradition, is quite simple to build. The four-sided booth must have at least three walls, while the fourth wall can be used as a door. One of the walls can be low or removable to allow passage into and out of the Sukkah. The material used to build the sukkah can vary, but because the Sukkah will only remain standing for seven days, a light material probably makes most sense. The only traditional requirements for the walls are that they be able to stand up in the wind. With this definition, even canvas stretched across a hard frame is suitable.


In terms of size, you'll want your walls at least far enough apart that you'll have room to eat in the Sukkah. Depending on the size of your family, this can cause the size of your sukkah to vary greatly.

, Traditionally, the roofs of sukkah are made from plant matter, like branches, leaves, twigs, and so on. These materials can be purchased or taken from nature.According to tradition, the roof of a sukkah should be thick enough to provide shade and shelter during the day, but you should still be able to see stars through it at night.Making a roof from plant material is a way of giving remembrance to the Israelites who wandered in the desert for 40 years after leaving Egypt. During their travels, they had to live in temporary dwellings similar to the sukkah, using whatever materials were available to them for shelter.

, Decorating the sukkah is seen as a commendable show of Sukkot observance. Traditional decorations include harvest vegetables: Corn, pumpkins, and squash hung from the ceiling and beams or placed in corners. Other decorations include but are not limited to: paper chains, pipecleaner constructions, religious pictures or drawings, wax paper stained glass, or anything else that you or your children feel like creating.


Children usually love to help decorate the sukkah. Giving your children a chance to draw on the walls of the sukkah and gather vegetables for display is a great way to get them involved in the holiday from an early age.

, If you're in a rush or you don't have the materials necessary to buy your sukkah, don't worry! These kits allow you to set up your own sukkah without having to prepare any of the materials yourself, saving you lots of time. As an added bonus, these kits can usually be easily disassembled for use next year.


Sukkah kits usually aren't terribly expensive. Depending on the size of the finished sukkah and the materials it's made out of, a kit will usually cost anywhere from about $50.00-$120.00., The sukkah traditionally stays up throughout the Sukkot holiday, serving as a place to gather, eat, and pray for all seven days. Immediately after Sukkot 2 holy days, Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah. Though they're not part of the Sukkot holiday, they are closely associated with it, so the sukkah isn't traditionally disassembled until after Simchat Torah.


It's perfectly acceptable to save your disassembled Sukkah materials so that you can use them to build another sukkah next year.

, Though Sukkot has its origins as an ancient agricultural harvest festival, the modern religious version of the festival is derived from the Hebrew scriptures. According to the Torah, God spoke to Moses while he was leading the Israelites through the desert and instructed him on the proper traditions of the Sukkot holiday. Reading this original account of the source of Sukkot traditions can help imbue the holiday with divine meaning, especially for someone who's a new practitioner.


Most of the scriptural description of Sukkot comes in the book of Leviticus. Specifically, Leviticus 23:33-43 offer an account of the meeting between God and Moses during which the Sukkot holiday is discussed., Sukkot is most famously associated with traditions like the construction of a sukkah that take place with one's family. However, entire Jewish communities are also encouraged to come together in celebration of Sukkot at synagogue services. At traditional morning Sukkot services, the congregation joins in Amidah prayer, followed by Hallel as would normally occur for Sukkot. After this, the congregation recites special Hoshana Rabbah psalms asking for God's forgiveness.Scriptural readings during Sukkot traditionally come from the book of Ecclesiastes.

, If you have questions about Sukkot or any of the traditions associated with it, try talking to your rabbi. He or she will be more than happy to discuss the religious and cultural sources of Sukkot tradition and instruct you in proper observance of the holiday.


Keep in mind that Sukkot traditions can vary from community to community. For instance, among non-observant Jews, it's not uncommon for someone to not even know yow to celebrate Sukkot, while, for traditional or highly Orthodox Jews, the holiday can be a major yearly event.

, Not everything that's ever been written about Sukkot comes from ancient scripture or religious texts. Much has been written about Sukkot over the years by rabbis, religious scholars, and even laypeople. Many essays and opinion pieces centered on Sukkot have even been produced in the modern era. Most modern Sukkot commentary will be relatively easy-to-read and approachable compared to older writings, so feel free to look up Sukkot Essays at www.chabad.org.


The subjects of modern Sukkot writings are highly diverse. Some offer new perspectives on the meanings of old traditions, others relate the meaningful personal experiences of the authors, and still others give firsthand instructions for making the best of the holiday."

Attend a Jewish service.,
Study the Torah.,
Sing Jewish songs.",How to Celebrate Shabbat2," You can go to synagogue during Shabbat and experience a slightly varied form of Jewish worship where the focus is on personal and group prayer.

You can read the Torah by yourself or discuss it with a friend or family member.


The Torah is most prominently made up of historical stories, which reveal God’s influence and work, as well as the details of Halahka, the Jewish laws.Most importantly, The Torah teaches of commandments and the welfare of the body and soul.Get into the habit of reading and/or discussing a new section of the Torah with a friend or family member each Shabbat. Select a small group of Jewish laws to study, or pick a particular story to read and discuss with a friend over coffee.

, There are many different Jewish songs, often in Hebrew, that have messages of praise and worship. During Shabbat, you can sing these songs at synagogue or a Shabbat meal with others. Some worship songs you can sing include:


”Ki Tavo'u El Ha'aretz,” including text from the book of Leviticus

Volunteering
Going for a nature walk

There is much debate over the acceptability of partaking in certain activities, such as watching television, driving a car, cooking, cleaning, and spending money. Some of the original thirty-nine prohibited tasks include:


Plowing
Baking
Shearing wool
Weaving

Food and drink are off the table as. Don’t approach someone with invitations to activities that revolve around eating or drinking until after nightfall. Afterwards, many practitioners will choose to eat traditional Jewish food and recuperate at home.
, Yom Kippur is a solemn day so wishing someone a happy holiday isn’t the best idea. Instead, wish them an easy fast or “Tzom Kal” in Hebrew. This is a great way to show understanding and support towards the challenge of fasting.This greeting is best used near the beginning of Yom Kippur. It won’t make much sense to say it near dusk. The fast lasts from one evening to the next evening.

, The most direct greeting for Yom Kippur is “g’mar hatimah tovah.” It means “May you be inscribed (or sealed) for a good year (in the Book of Life).” It refers to God sealing the person’s fate in either the Book of Life or Death on Yom Kippur. The Book of Life indicates that the person will live through the year.This phrase is sometimes simplified to “g’mar tov.”

, On the Jewish calendar, the ten days from Rosh Hashana to Yom Kippur mark the start of the new year. Wish them a good new year or “L’Shana Tovah.” This phrase is similar to “g’mar hatimah tovah.”

L’Shana Tovah is often used incorrectly to mean “happy new year.” Use good instead of happy when expressing this in your language.

, Gut Yontiff (or good yom tov) is Yiddish and means good holiday. It’s an acceptable greeting for any holiday, including Yom Kippur. Remember, wishing someone a good holiday is more appropriate than wishing them a happy holiday.Chag sameach is Hebrew for “joyous festival.” It is also used for many holidays. Yom Kippur isn’t a joyous holiday or a festival, so use a different greeting.

, Shalom means peace and is used to say hello or goodbye. This word may be the one you remember best. When you can’t think of a better option, you can use this greeting.Say shabbat shalom on a Saturday. It basically means peace on the Sabbath or good Sabbath.

, This phrase means good Sabbath. It is an all-purpose greeting on Saturdays. It may be used during Yom Kippur if the holiday falls on a Saturday., The word “tov” can be adapted for greetings during any time of day. Boker tov means good morning. Tzohora’im Tovim means good afternoon. Erev tov means good evening. Finally, Lilah Tov means good night. These are always acceptable and can be repeated back when your Jewish friends say them first., Mazel tov, or “good luck,” does not have the same meaning in Yiddish and Hebrew as it has in English. It is used to express pleasure after a happy event has occurred. When wishing someone good luck for the holiday, bid them an easy fast instead."

Eat foods with a kosher for Passover seal.",How to Keep Kosher," Most kosher laws are centered around meat, and are usually concerned with the type of animal that is permitted to be eaten and the way in which it was killed. In the case of mammals, kosher laws specifically state that the only mammals to be eaten are those who both chew their cud and have cloven hoofs. All cattle, sheep, bison, goats and deer are kosher. Pigs, hares and horses are not kosher because they do not fulfill both requirements.This law about mammals derives from a passage in Deuteronomy, Chapter 14: 8-10: “And the pig, because it has a split hoof, but does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. You shall neither eat of their flesh nor touch their carcass.”
Some speculate that this kosher law came about because in the days of early Judaism, animals such as pigs were more likely to carry diseases, and that Jewish kosher laws were established as an early kind of health code.;
, In the case of fish, there are several species that are not considered kosher and cannot be eaten. These include all shellfish including crab, lobster, shrimp and oysters, in addition to fish without scales such as swordfish.This kosher law comes from a passage in Deuteronomy, Chapter 14:8-10: “These you may eat of all that are in the waters; all that have fins and scales, you may eat. But whatever does not have fins and scales, you shall not eat; it is unclean for you.”
Some have speculated that the reason why shellfish are considered unclean is because many of them are “bottom dwellers” who live on the ocean floor as opposed to swimming in the cleaner waters.

, Reptiles, amphibians, most insects, and birds of prey are not permitted to be eaten by the laws of kashrut. These animals include turtles, frogs, whales, dolphins, salamanders, snakes, and birds like vultures or crows.Some communities of Jews permit the eating of certain insects, but the varieties that are permitted are specific to those individual communities.

, Not only can you not consume the meat of an un-kosher animal under the laws of kashrut, you also cannot consume their milk, eggs, fat or organs.This may seem easy to avoid, but in some cases it can be tricky. For example, many cheeses are hardened with an enzyme called rennet, which is often obtained from non-kosher animals. It’s important therefore to examine the ingredients in every product that you buy, or only purchase items that have been marked with a kosher seal.

, Even if you stick to eating the meat of animals you know are kosher, you can still break the laws of kashrut if the animal is not slaughtered in a way that adheres to Jewish law. You should be able to tell that the meat is kosher by the a label saying “Sh’Chita"" or ""Sh'Chita K’shera Beit Yosef"", or by finding the meat in a specially labelled section of the aisle. It may be hard to find a kosher meat if you aren't living in Israel, New York City, or a neighborhood with a high concentration of Jews.An important aspect of the ritual slaughter, known as shechita, is the quick and humane slaughtering of animals.
The draining of the blood is another vital aspect of the ritual slaughter. It is against kosher laws for Jews to consume blood, as blood signifies the life or soul of the animal. The shochet, or person in charge of the slaughter, also remove certain nerves from the animal, as well as the fat surrounding the vital organs and liver. Consuming these pieces of the animal is against kosher law.

, One of the most important and most difficult to follow rules of kashrut is the prohibition of eating meat and dairy in the same meal. This law comes from the Exodus 23:19 passage, which states that it is forbidden to “boil a kid in its mother’s milk.” This law applies to all meat and dairy except for fish, which is acceptable to eat with dairy.Different Jews who keep kosher have different perspectives of how long one must wait in between eating dairy and meat. Some Jews avoid having it in the same meal, while others wait at least 3 hours in between the two food groups.

, The laws of kashrut command those who keep kosher to not consume grape products or wine made by non-Jews. Kosher wine usually comes with a Kosher seal, so it is easy to distinguish.The reasoning behind this law is grounded in the history of ancient Judaism, when the Jews existed among pagan communities. These polytheistic communities produced wine that they sanctified to be used in sacrifices to the pagan gods.
Ancient Jews did not want to imbibe wine that was associated with these pagan sacrifices, so they created a law that the only wine to be drunk was wine made by other fellow Jews.

, Eggs are kosher under the laws of kashrut as long as they are taken from chickens or other kosher animals. However, because the consumption of blood of any kind is not kosher, it’s important to check your eggs for blood before cooking them. Crack individual eggs into separate bowls and look for blood traces before combining them with the rest of the food you are cooking. If you crack an egg with blood into a pot of food, you will contaminate the entire dish.Finding blood traces in eggs is relatively rare, but it’s a good idea to always check each egg to be completely sure.

, Before purchasing or consuming fruits or vegetables, make sure to inspect them for bugs or insects. All fruits and vegetables are kosher, but since bugs and insects are not in most communities, it’s important to inspect produce before eating it.Be sure to carefully inspect vegetables like corn and lettuce, where bugs can easily hide.

, As long as you know that a food is kosher, and if it’s meat that it has been slaughtered in a way that adheres to the laws of kashrut, you don’t need to buy food that has a kosher seal. However, buying food that has a certified kosher seal on it can make life a lot easier for you. If you live in a large city that has ample food options, or in a community that has a lot of Jews, you should have access to meat and foods that are marked as kosher.There are several types of kosher seals. Some kosher seals use the letter “K” for kosher or a “U” that stands for the Orthodox Union. The seal is usually under the product name or near the ingredients list on packaged foods.
A lot of packaged food have kosher seals, but it may be harder to find kosher seals on meat unless you live in a heavily Jewish community.
There may also be “parve” or “pareve” seal in addition to a “K” or “U” seal. Parve means “neutral” in Hebrew, and signifies that the food doesn’t contain dairy or meat. When you see this seal, you know that you don’t have to worry about pairing this food with dairy or meat.

, Very observant Jews take keeping kosher a step further by keeping their kitchen kosher. Having a kosher kitchen means that you keep two separate sets of dishes, silverware, napkins, and even refrigerators to serve or hold dairy and meat separately. Separate dishes and silverware for meat and dairy is the easiest step in keeping a kitchen kosher. Buy two separate sets of dish ware to avoid confusion, can consider designating separate drawers and cupboards to meat and dairy dishes and cutlery. Don’t use the oven for meat and dairy at the same time. You can use the stovetop to cook dishes involving meat and dairy on separate burners, but watch out for and clean up spills. Try not to microwave meat and dairy at the same time, since fumes from each dish can escape and infiltrate the other dish.
Consider getting two dishwashers. Orthodox and very observant Jews often have two separate dishwashers which they use to separately wash any dishes or utensils that may have touched dairy or meat.
Keeping your kitchen kosher ensures that you never run into a situation in which you may be eating dairy off a plate that held meat. Taking the measures to keep a kosher kitchen is complex and can be expensive, which is why the majority of Jews do not keep their kitchen kosher in this sense.

, Keeping kosher for Passover refers to a separate set of kosher laws that are followed for the week long holiday of Passover, which falls in March or April. The fundamental kosher law during Passover is to not eat leavened bread, or bread that has risen for more than 18 minutes. Instead, Jews eat unleavened bread called matzoh. The reason why Jews eat unleavened bread during Passover comes from one of the most significant stories of the Jewish people, found in the book of Exodus.Jews who keep kosher all year round also follow the kosher laws of Passover during the holiday in addition to the year round kashrut laws. Some Jews don’t follow the year round kashrut laws, but adhere to the Passover kosher laws during the holiday.
The Torah explains that the Jewish people were once enslaved under very harsh conditions in the land of Egypt. Moses led the movement to free the Jews from slavery, with resistance from the Egyptian pharaoh. The Jews fled Egypt before the pharaoh had time to change his mind about freeing them, and they didn’t have time to wait for their bread to rise before they left.
Eating unleavened bread during the holiday of Passover is a reminder of the hardship that the Jewish ancestors had to endure, and a reminder of how God led them to freedom.

, Kitiniyot is a group of food that many Jews also avoid on Passover. Kitiniyot includes rice, corn, millet, dried beans, lentils, peas, green beans, soybeans, peanuts, sesame seeds, poppy seeds and mustard. The reason for not eating kitiniyot is still debated, though it is theorized that these foods should be avoided because they expand when soaked or cooked in water, which is similar to the process of leavening.The prohibition on kitniyot is an Ashkenazi tradition. Ashkenazi Jews are Jews with roots in Eastern Europe. Most Jews in the United States are Ashkenazi Jews and therefore avoid kitiniyot when keeping kosher for Passover.
Sephardic Jews, or Jews with roots in the Middle East and North Africa, do not follow all the same traditions of Ashkenazi Jews, and therefore do eat kitiniyot on Passover.

, The seal that signifies a food is kosher for Passover is different from the regular kosher seals. Unless the seal states that the food is kosher for Passover, you can’t be sure that the kosher seal pertains to Passover or not. If are purchasing a food that you think may not be kosher for Passover and doesn't have a kosher for Passover seal, check the ingredients on the back of the product to be sure it doesn't contain un-kosher ingredients.Kosher for Passover seals usually say “Kosher for Passover” in English or Hebrew. They can also have a “P” next to the regular seal.

Ready your measuring equipment.,
Get hanging material.,
Place the scroll in the case.,
Determine where you’ll hang the mezuzah.,
Measure your door post.,
Recite the blessing.,
Put in the nail.,
Affix the mezuzah properly.",How to Hang a Mezuzah," Kosher mezuzah scrolls are written by scribes. The scribes use a particular type of quill and ink on a particular parchment. Good scrolls follow these traditions and should be bought from a trusted religious authority.According to religious doctrine, you are supposed to have a mezuzah for every proper room. This includes hallways and large walk-in closets but excludes unclean areas and areas of improper dress such as bathrooms and indoor pools.Ask your rabbi for locations where you can get properly made scrolls.;
, The scroll rests inside the case you’ll hang beside your door. The scroll needs to fit inside comfortably, never pressing against the sides of the case. Most cases come in heights of 10 or 12 centimeters and may open from the sides or back. These can be found online or at Jewish religious shops.


Cases come in a variety of styles, such as simple wood, metal, or glass. They can also be decorated, such as sculpted or painted with religious imagery.

, You will need measuring tape in order to determine how high you must place the mezuzah. Once you’ve measured the proper distance with tape, use an implement such as a pencil to mark where the bottom of the mezuzah will hang.

, A hammer and nail or a screw and drill are common ways to hang a mezuzah. Choose a nail or screw that corresponds to your mezuzah. These will go into the door frame and must be big enough to allow the mezuzah to hang securely. Strong glue or double-sided tape are also options.Glue or tape should only be used with cases that open from the top or bottom. They do not support the part where the scroll rests in cases that open from the back.

, The mezuzah should have been rolled from left to right. Now set it in the case, making sure it does not get damaged. The word Shaddai (אֵל שָׁדַּי) should be facing outwards and the letter Shin (ש) should be on top and facing the doorway., The mezuzah will always be on the right side of the door’s entrance. When entering your home from the street, it will be on the right post. For doors inside your home, it will be on the right when you enter into the room the same way the door opens.For an entryway without a door, consider the hierarchy of a room in daily life. The dining room is a gathering spot and is used more than a kitchen, so the mezuzah should hang on the right side when entering the dining room from the kitchen.

, Use your measuring tape to get the total height of your door. Divide the height by three. Measure that resulting amount from the top of the doorpost and mark it with your writing utensil. This is where the bottom of the mezuzah will hang, about shoulder height on an average doorway.If your door is taller than average, hang the mezuzah at shoulder height.

, Before you hang the mezuzah, it needs to be given a blessing. Hebrew is the proper language to do this in, but if you do not know Hebrew, do it in a language you understand. In Hebrew, the blessing is ""Baruch atah, Adonai Eloheinu, Melech haolam, asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu likboah m'zuzah.""In English, the blessing translates to “Praise to You, Adonai our God, Sovereign of the universe, who hallows us with mitzvot, commanding us to affix the mezuzah.”
When affixing multiple mezuzahs, only one blessing is needed, but try not to talk until all of them are in place.
A mezuzah that is removed from its spot for over 24 hours should be blessed again.

, Where you marked the door frame is the place where the bottom of the mezuzah should hang. Bring the mezuzah up to the wall or measure upwards if you know how tall the case is. Hammer in the nail or secure one half of the mezuzah with whatever alternative hanging material you’re using.

, Now the bottom of the mezuzah should be on the mark around your shoulder. Slant the top of the mezuzah towards the inside of the room and the bottom to the outside of the residence. Add a second nail or screw to hold it in place or secure it to the wall with tape."

, Some Orthodox synagogues may only have prayer books written in Hebrew, but most have at least a few sets of prayer books supplemented with English, too. If you don't understand the Hebrew words, feel free to say them in English or simply hum along in tune with the congregation.

, Many Orthodox synagogues have signs that are manually updated by someone with the current page numbers, or there will be someone designated to call them out at the beginning of each new section.

, You don't need to look too dressy, but business or business-casual attire is the norm on Shabbat and High Holidays. If visiting on a weekday, you can generally get by with casual clothes as long as they are appropriate.

, If you don't own or bring one there will likely be some available at the synagogue to borrow.

Lead your life in the way of this teaching of Rabbi Hillel, a great rabbi of the Mishnah.",How to Be Jewish," While there is no official list, Judaism has five main denominations:


Hasidic - Very strict and conservative, taking the religion upon themselves in every aspect of life. Incorporate Jewish mysticism into their teachings.
Orthodox - Most Orthodox Jews tend to fall into one or two sub-denominations; the most common being Modern Orthodox. In general, Orthodox Jews stringently adhere to all laws and customs of the religion, while Modern Orthodox Jews typically try to balance a secular lifestyle with that as well.
Conservative - More lenient in observance than Orthodox Judaism, but adherent to the basic values and tradition of the religion.
Reform - Very lenient in observance, though aware of the basic values and traditions of Judaism.
Reconstructionist - Very lenient in observance; pressing a mostly secular lifestyle.;
, In Orthodox synagogues, men and women sit separately to avoid ""inappropriate"" behaviors and distractions, and the service is mostly in Hebrew. Other synagogues may have mixed seating and services are in both English and Hebrew.

, It is not as difficult to comprehend as it may seem, and knowing even a few special words or certain phrases will help expand your understanding and appreciation of the prayer of the religion.

, These can be found at Judaic shops, Jewish bookstores, and online.

, This means that only foods that have been prepared according to the laws of the Torah may be eaten. You can call your local Orthodox rabbi and ask him to help you ""kosher"" your kitchen.

,
Fish with fins and scales
Fruits, vegetables, and some breads are ""Parve"" which means fit for both meat and dairy.
Not all breads are parve. Some contain milk, whey or dairy margarine which makes them dairy. Some contain ingredients that are not Kosher making them ""tref"" (not Kosher). It's best to buy breads that have Kosher certification (without a D for Dairy if you want parve bread). Or, if there's a Kosher bakery available you can ask the clerk for what you want.

,, The Sabbath starts at sundown every Friday and ends when there are three stars in the sky on Saturday night. Observe the Havdalah, the ceremony after the Sabbath. The Sabbath doesn't allow work, travel, carrying money, discussing business, using electricity, lighting a fire, and making and receiving phone calls, but is cherished for its relaxing, spiritual separation from the busy workweek.

, The stricter in observance you are, the more holidays you will take on to celebrate or commemorate. Some of the major Jewish holidays include Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year), Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), Sukkot, Simchat Torah, Hanukkah, Tu B'Shevat, Purim, [[Celebrate Passover, Lag b'Omer, Shavuot, Tisha B'Av, and Rosh Chodesh.

, Orthodox Jewish men wear ""tzitzit"" (a religious garment with fringes, worn underneath the shirt) and wear ""tefillin"" (phylacteries) during morning prayers, except on Shabbat and holidays. Observant women dress modestly and married women wear headscarves or wigs.

, He said that if the Torah could be summed up while balancing on one foot one would say, ""Treat your neighbor as you want to be treated.""

",How to Kosher Your Kitchen,";
, Use disposable utensils until you make your kitchen kosher.

,, Immerse them in the mikvah, a ritual cleansing pool of rainwater. Vessels made of material other than glass or metal need not be immersed. If you don't live near a mikvah, make sure you have kosher soap.


Use steel wool or acetone to remove marks or labels from vessels before immersion.

, Clean parts and surfaces with chemical cleansers to remove food and grease, then reassemble the oven. Self-cleaning ovens are automatically kosher if you follow the manufacturer's directions.


Don't assume self-cleaning ovens are kosher. Set the oven at 450 Degrees Fahrenheit (232 Degrees Celsius) and leave it on for several hours. Clean spots that aren't removed by the continuous-clean process, but don't use caustic cleansers because they may destroy the oven's automatic-cleaning mechanism.

, If you don't have a blowtorch, purchase a new broiler pan.

, Electric range tops may not disassemble as easily, but turning the burners on high for a few minutes will kosher them. Thereafter take care not to set pots or utensils on surfaces you haven't koshered.

,, Wait 24 hours, then boil the cutlery and utensils in water. If an item is too large for your pot, boil one end, then the other. Remove utensils with tongs and immerse the utensils in cold water.

, If necessary, submerge large pots in stages.

, It isn't possible to kosher a frying pan if oil was not used in the frying. The pan must be discarded.

, It isn't possible to kosher a porcelain sink because it's too porous.

, Keep separate scouring pads, sponges, tablecloths and napkins. To keep track of which is meat and which is dairy, use a different color for each.

,, If you use one stove, dedicate certain burners to meat and certain to dairy and don't deviate.

, Otherwise, never cook meat and dairy simultaneously. Cover vessels tightly when baking. Wait 24 hours before cooking meat after baking something that will be served with dairy or vice versa.

Familiarize yourself with the 5 main branches of Judaism.,
Understand that in Chasidic and Orthodox Judaism, Jews generally wear modest attire that is not overly revealing.,
Be aware that Chasidic and Orthodox Jewish men and women sit separately in their synagogues.,
Be aware that in other synagogues, everyone sits together, and the prayer books have both Hebrew and English, so you can read the English while listening to the Hebrew.,
Know that Jews stand during certain parts of the service, such as when the Ark of the Covenant is open and for specific prayers.,
Dress appropriately.,
Don't make noise during the services.",How to Be Respectful in a Jewish Environment," They are, from most stringent to least observant: Chasidic (Hasidic), Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist. Keep in mind that each of these main branches have several sub-branches with varying degrees of differences. Ask your Jewish friends which branch(es) they practice and how to behave.;
, This is especially pertinent to women who (at least publicly) will not wear clothing showing cleavage. On Shabbat and Jewish holidays, they wear their best formal clothes. Married women wear wigs or headscarves, while men wear yarmulkes or kippot (skullcaps) on their heads at all times. Only the men wear tallit (prayer shawls) during services.

, They also have only male rabbis and cantors, and they often (though not always) have prayer books (siddurim) in Hebrew only. Hebrew is read from right to left, the opposite direction to English, and the pages in the prayer books open at what would be the back of an English language book. Some of the men wear their prayer shawls over their heads and move in different directions while praying.

, Sometimes, there are female clergy, and some of the women wear skullcaps and prayer shawls just like the men - and the men don't always wear skullcaps on their heads!

, This is done as a sign of respect to God, so stand up when everyone else does.

, If you're a man, wear a dress suit with a tie and dress shoes. If you're a woman, wear your best hairstyle, dressy dress, simple shoes, simple makeup, and simple jewelry.

, If you have to go to the bathroom, step out and come back quietly. Also, make sure you turn off your cellphone before entering the synagogue.

Set a budget.,
Get the invitations.,
Decorate.,
Pick different activities.,
Purchase or buy snacks.,
Provide some loot bags.,
Congratulations, and enjoy the party!

",How to Plan a Home Party for a Nine Year Old," Give yourself a reasonable budget that includes:


Decorations
Food
Presents/Loot bags
Any rentals
Invitation cards
And any other costs. It is important you stick to your budget.;
, Give out handmade or store-bought invitation cards for the party at least 1 week in advance, so the guests can confirm if they can come or not. If you give cards out last-minute, they may have other plans! Invitation cards should include:


Name (of birthday person)
Date
Location (where the party is)
Time (when the party starts and ends)
Contact information (Phone number and email)

Make sure you receive their confirmation. For example, you may kindly ask them on the card to call and confirm their arrival.



, Put up your decorations before the day of the party to make sure everything gets done. Get your child to help you come up with a theme for the party. Themes include but are not limited to:


Colour themes (e.g. all pink, shades of pink, or neon, etc.)
Disney Princess themes
Star Wars theme
Action figures theme
Race car theme

After you chose a theme, you must buy the actual decorations, which can include:


Balloons (round, helium, worm-shape, or water)
String decorations
A birthday sign
A piñata (candy-filled or other wrapped-treats)
Chain decorations*
Pom-pom decorations
Sticker decorations
Poster decorations
Origami decorations (hanging from thread)
Cut-out decorations (e.g. you can cut out large paper images and glue them)

Chain decorations are made of paper by cutting out rectangular strips of paper and taping them loop by loop. They are a great space-filler, and they are also fun to make. They are home-made and you can choose your own colours, according to your theme.
Most of these decorations can be purchased at dollar-stores, and are usually at a favourable price. Try to include home-made decorations, they aren’t any less special!
Remember to buy enough decorations for the amount of space you are using. Then, put them up. If you are using multiple rooms for the party, set them up equally, but put up more decorations in the main-room.



, Sit down with your child and discuss what they would like to do during the party. Ask them about:


Movies-(make sure they choose age-appropriate movies. Movies also usually run for more than an hour, so choose a movie that fits your time schedule).
Games – this can include board games like Bingo (or other games you own/can purchase), or if the weather is suitable, outdoor games like basketball, octopus, tag, dodge-ball etc.
Crafts- e.g.: painting nails, face-painting, frame-making (you can use popsicles, or buy cheap craft frames to decorate), cookie-decorating. Try to stay away from “drawing competitions”, because not everyone enjoys drawing and it can make others feel excluded. Do not introduce too many competitions (e.g. singing competitions).
In between games/crafts, they can also have snack intervals to just talk, eat and relax. Offer them drinks and small snacks to keep them fuelled up.
Before making any final decisions about games/movies/crafts consult with your child. Ask them if they are comfortable with these choices, and if they think their friends will enjoy it.

, Depending on how long the party will last, there should be at least one full meal for the guests + snacks + drinks. It is your choice whether you want to get cake at the party, or some other dessert. Snacks can include:


Crackers
Chips and Dip
Cupcakes
Rice Krispies
Pretzels
Jello
Pudding
Take into account any allergies the guests may have. To be safe, get peanut-free snacks.

, Loot bags are a way of saying “thank you” for coming to the party. They are fun to receive, but must be fair and creative. First, start by gathering what to put in the loot bags. Most dollar stores have very cute and creative party sections where you can find objects to put in the loot bags. They may include:


Key chains (e.g. flip-flop key-chains)
Stickers
Fun rings
Cute magnets
Decorative pencils/erasers
Bright note-books
Small race-cars
Decorative beads
Party hats
Mini puzzle games
A small plushie

(GIRLS) You can also choose to get them other gifts such as :

Creams (e.g. Bath and Body works)
bracelets/necklaces
Leg Warmers
Mini-purses
Other accessories (e.g. Ardene and Claire’s)
Hair clips


(BOYS) Some ideas for boy loot-bags:

Small air-craft toys
Small toy race-cars
Small robot toys




You could also choose to put a variety of candy in their loot-bags like:
Candy canes
Chocolate coins
Kinder surprise eggs
Marshmallow Candy
Make sure every guest gets an equal amount of gifts in their loot-bag so nobody feels excluded. Then, put the gifts in individual bags.

Set up some construction stations.,
Create a house building activity.,
Make a game of ""pin the tire on the cement mixer."",
Prepare a skyscraper challenge.",How to Plan a Construction‐Themed Birthday Party2," Create a building station with plenty of building bricks like Duplo or Legos. Make or buy cardboard bricks and a “wrecking” ball -- this can be any large, soft ball painted black -- for a destruction station. Put small toy trucks in disposable baking trays filled with dirt or sand for a digging station -- be sure to add plastic shovels. Invest in plastic hammers, pieces of foam, and golf tees for a nailing station.For older children, you can use pieces of wood, real nails, and real hammers.

, Get lots of cardboard or recycle old boxes. Cut the cardboard into squares with one foot (30.48 cm) sides and rectangles that are 6 inches (15.24 cm) by one foot (30.48 cm). Make sure you have at least 6 pieces of cardboard per guest so they can make the sides and roof of the house.

Get ready for the surprise.",How to Plan a Birthday Party for a Friend," Start planning at least 3 weeks in advance and talk to your friend to get an idea of what she wants.At this point, it is important to decide what kind of party she wants and how many people to invite. Ideas for small birthday parties include:


Simple and casual gathering at home.
A cozy dinner party or pot-luck.A barbecue or pool party.A retro or vintage themed birthday party.;
, Once you decide on an awesome theme, you need to answer the following questions: When is your friend’s birthday? Will you celebrate on her birthday or a few days later? What time of day will the party be? How many guests can we invite?


Think of your guests when planning a party. If your friend’s birthday is on a weekday, guests may not be able to attend due to work or school obligations. Friday evenings are usually the best time to hold a small get together.For barbecues or outdoor parties, Saturday or Sunday afternoons are best.

, Work with your friend to create a guest list. Next, organize the list into family and friends. Review the list and add-in significant others, children, siblings, etc. if needed.For a small party, keep the guest list to 25 people or less., Guests should be notified 2 to 3 weeks in advance. You can send invitations electronically via email, through regular mail, or call or text everyone on the guest list. When inviting guests, make sure to give them the following information: your friend’s name, date and time of the party, location including address and any driving/parking instructions, date which guests should RSVP, and your contact information (email address and/or phone number) with instructions for RSVP-ing.


If possible, set-up a private Facebook event page and add your guests. This is an easy way to keep everything coordinated, provide information such as directions or party updates, and communicate with guests.
If sending invitations in the mail, look online for creative invitation ideas or print out unique templates.Be creative and make your own invitations at home. You can personalize them to fit with your party’s theme., Make a list of everything you need (decorations, grocery list, etc.) and keep it with you at all times. Have everything ready several days before the party.If you are preparing the food yourself, select recipes in advance and bring them with you to the grocery store. Also, place an order for a cake or other desserts to a local bakery or delicatessen at least one week before the party, and buy birthday candles.


Take an inventory of chairs, plates, utensils, napkins, cups, and bowls. Purchase additional items if necessary – you do not want to leave your party to go the store because you ran out of napkins!
Notify neighbors you will be having a party at least one week in advance. Let them know what time the party is scheduled to begin, and when you expect most guests will leave. This is especially important if you live in an apartment or share a house., When making a playlist, you want it to be long enough so you don’t repeat songs, and can “set it and forget it”.Ask your friend for a list of her favorite songs, or create a playlist that fits the theme of the party. For example, for a fancy dinner party consider classical music, or play big-band and jazz hits if you are throwing a 1920s bash. You can also use a playlist online using websites such as Pandora, Slacker, or Grooveshark., Rearrange any furniture to make space for the food and guests. Keep food and drink areas separate so guests are not running into one another. Next, place table clothes over surfaces where food will be served, and hang any decorations. Set-up and organize the buffet table by napkins utensils, and plates first, followed by the salad and sides, and finally hot dishes and the main entrée.All set-up and decoration should be completed 2 hours before the party begins.


Set-up an ice bucket at the beverage station and make sure you have extra bags of ice stored in a cooler or the freezer. Keep alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, and liquor) separate from non-alcoholic ones, and have non-alcoholic options for underage guests or designated drivers.Make sure hot foods are covered with tinfoil to keep them warm. Wrap other foods or dishes with foil or plastic wrap to keep them fresh. If possible, prepare fruit and vegetable platters in advance and keep them in the refrigerator until just before the party begins.Place bowls of finger-foods in several locations for your guests to nibble on when they arrive. Select items that can be left out for several hours, such as nuts, chex mix, chips and salsa, or trail mix.
Do a once over several hours before the party begins. Make sure the space or house is clean, there is enough soap and toilet paper in the bathroom, and you have enough seating for all your guests.

, While the focus of the party is on your friend, you are the host and it is your job to make sure everything goes smoothly and everyone has a good time. Don’t be afraid to delegate tasks to other guests, such as refilling snack bowls or checking on ice and drinks. Also, don’t hesitate to ask an intoxicated or uninvited guest to leave. Simply pull them aside and, if necessary, arrange someone to give them a ride home.

, Larger parties with 25 or more guests often require more planning to be successful. Reduce stress and be prepared by starting far enough in advance. Start by creating a party checklist and timeline for when things need to be finished. Important things to consider include:booking the venue, arranging entertainment if necessary (DJ, photo booth, games, trivia, etc.), sending out invitations, collecting RSVPs, decor, food and/or catering, and drinks and/or a bartender.Recruit help. Do not try to do everything on your own. Get a group of friends and family together and delegate tasks. Set-up a ‘central command station”, such as an email chain or private Facebook group, to keep one another updated. Check-in regularly with your helpers to see how things are coming along.
Create a budget and stick to it. What will be spending money on, asking other friends or family to contribute. Use your checklist as a guideline for costs. Call around and ask for quotes on party supplies, venue prices, and entertainment. Write these estimates next to each item, use them to barter for a better deal, and keep track of your spending as you go along.

, Decide how many people you and your friend want to invite. Organize the list into family and friends.


Do not invite more than 20% of people that can comfortably fit in your party space – typically 70 to 80% of all invitees will actually attend.Consider people’s significant others and if they are likely to attend when deciding who (and how many people) to invite.

, This is important if the party will be somewhere other than your house. Depending on availability, you may need to make reservations weeks to months in advance. If you don't want the hassle of hosting a party at your house or apartment, you can often reserve community centers or church halls for a small fee. These places have the added benefit of providing tables, chairs, and access to a kitchen.Things to consider when selecting a venue include: availability of parking, if they serve food, who is responsible for set-up and cleaning, size and how many people can fit comfortably.

, For larger gatherings and when you have guests traveling from out of town, you want to send out invitations at least 60 days in advance.Invitations should be printed, addressed, and mailed at least 60 days (2 months) in advance. Make sure to include instructions on how to RSVP (e.g. calling, email, etc.). Your invitations should include: the party hosts (you), purpose of the party (your friend’s birthday), date, time (starting and ending), location, attire (casual, themed, formal), and RSVP.Customize your invitations so they reflect the theme of the event, or include your favorite pictures of your friend. Search the internet for sites that allow you to customize invitations, such as Zazzle.com or Shutterfly.com.
Keep the guests updated by creating a private facebook group.

, For larger events, having professional music will make it go smoother. DJs also help move the party along. Make sure you hire a reputable DJ. They should be upfront with costs and send you a contract stipulating the terms of their service. Do not send any payments until you see a contract.

, Plan the menu based on the type of party and number of guests. For example, ask your friend if she wants pizza and ice-cream or something more formal. What kind of food you serve also depends on your budget. You can save money by making everything yourself, or save time and hassle by hiring a caterer. Most catering companies charge per person, and include additional fees for serving. While caterers can be expensive, they reduce the stress and hassle of organizing a party – and will also set-up before and clean-up after the party.When organizing food and/or hiring a caterer, it is important to keep in mind:.


Different types of food, such as: appetizers and snacks, salads, main course, and desserts.
If any of your guests are vegan or vegetarian, or have food allergies.
Offering a variety of drinks (alcoholic, non-alcoholic, coffee, tea, water, and ice).

, Make a list of decorations and start buying things several weeks in advance. Search the internet or go to a party supply store for basic birthday decorations or themed items. If necessary, order specialty themed items a month or more in advance so they arrive in time for the party.Basic birthday decorations include: birthday candles, a ""Happy Birthday"" banner, streamers, balloons, fun birthday hats, and table cloths.
If this is a milestone birthday (e.g. 21st, 30th, 40th, 50th, etc.), buy plates, hats, napkins, balloons, etc. with your friend's age. Also, consider making a photo album with pictures of family and friends.

, Create a checklist for everything you need and have everything ready 2 hours before guests arrive:Furniture: tables and chairs for guests, tables for food and cake, and a space for cards and presents.
Drinks: soft drinks, water pitcher with ice (can also include lemon or orange slices), coffee urn and hot water for tea, coffee extras (creamer, milk, sugar, stir sticks), wine (red and white), beer, pre-made mixed drinks or cocktails, and cold storage or extra ice.
Eating and drinking: plastic cups or glassware, wine glasses, cutlery (knives, forks, spoons), small plates for appetizers, large plates for main meal, bowls for salad, salt and pepper shakers, butter and butter dishes, butter knives, and water jugs.
Food tools and miscellaneous: serving spoons and forks, carving knives, extra bowls, pot holders and trivets, garbage cans, and garbage bags.

, Delegate tasks such as food, drinks, clean-up, gift organizer, kitchen help, and set-up (if you hire a caterer, they will perform most of these functions).Most importantly, make sure your friend is having fun, stress-free birthday!


Mingle, and make light small talk. try to approach each guest and thank them for attending.If serving alcohol, make sure guests get home safely. Ask several friends to act as designated drivers, or call a taxi. Also, if a guest becomes intoxicated and aggressive, simply pull them aside and ask a sober friend to take them home., Plan things as you would for a small or large party depending on the number of guests (more than 20 to 25 is a large party). For a smaller gathering, begin planning about 3 to 4 weeks in advance. A larger bash requires starting at least 60 to 80 days in advance. Create a party checklist to keep you on track and organized:Pick a date and venue.
Make an invitation list, decide on a theme, and hire caterers and a DJ.
Send invitations, plan the menu, and plan additional activities (e.g. games).
Purchase decorations, collect RSVPs, and plan a fun activity to keep your friend occupied the day of the party.
Clean the space and set-up food and decorations.

, Collaborate with your guests so they know this is a surprise party. Get in touch with someone who lives with or is close to the birthday boy or girl. Have them casually ask if they have any plans for their birthday.Without ruining the surprise, make sure they are not busy that day by telling them you will take them out for a small birthday lunch or dinner.


Alternatively, plan on throwing the party a few days before or after their birthday. Tell them you are taking them to movie or concert, but in reality you are throwing them a party.

, In order to maintain the element of surprise, make sure your friend is distracted and out of the house the day of their party.Tell them you are busy, and will celebrate with them later. Arrange several friends to take the birthday boy or girl out for a nice lunch, to a movie, a sporting event, or for a spa day. Make sure they are nowhere near the party venue while you are setting-up and guests are arriving!

, Tell all guests to arrive 30 minutes or more before the birthday boy or girl. If possible, have them park their cars on another block, so your friend does not see them walking in.Set the stage for the surprise by giving your guests noisemakers or confetti to throw as the birthday boy or girl walks in.
You can also ask your guests to hide behind tables, chairs, couches, etc., and jump-out as your friend arrives.
Have someone with a camera ready to capture the moment of surprise.

Pick a theme and place for the party.,
Make the guest list.,
Make and send invitations.,
Make gift bags.,
Buy food.,
Choose any other activities.",How to Plan a Child's Birthday Party," Think about your child's likes and interests. You may even want to ask them what theme they want. Some ideas are pirates, princesses, and Hawaiian. You might want the theme to relate to their favorite TV show or movie, like Spongebob. Other than at your house, the party could be held at these places:


House or Community pool
Build-a-Bear--great for little girls
Bowling--fun for all ages
Roller skating or ice skating
Bounce U;
, You can invite cousins, your close friend's children, and friends of your child. A good amount of guests is five to fifteen. Too little guests will be boring, but too many can get crazy. Ask your child who he/she wants to invite as well.

, The invitations should include who the party is for, what date and time it will be held, and where it is. Also provide your phone number and an RSVP date. That way, you'll know who can and can't come. Don't forget to mention the theme! Say, if needed, what guests should bring. e.g. a towel and swimsuit for a pool party. Make sure you have all of the guests addresses so you can mail them. Then, mail the invitations.

, Depending on the theme of the party and ages of the children, certain items should go in gift bags. For girls, don't put in makeup for 7-8 year olds. Some ideas are stickers, candy, pencils, rings, and temporary tattoos. The theme matters a lot. For, say, a Hawaiian party, put in leis, swirly straws, and flower hair clips. For pirates, try an eyepatch, pirate tattoos, etc. Gift bags don't have to be expensive. You can get colorful gift bags really anywhere, and the items inside at a department store. Decorate the outside of the gift bags, sticking to the theme.

, For dinner, you can have pizza, but be sure to have at least two different kinds. Always have regular cheese pizza, and, say, pepperoni. Instead of pizza, you can make your child's favorite dinner, such as chicken fingers or hot dogs. For dessert, you can always have cake, or have ice cream or cupcakes. For cake, you can buy it or make it yourself. Know what kind of cake your child wants, and try to stick to the theme. Also get healthy snacks, like popcorn, pretzels, fruit, and veggies with dip.

, You could buy a pinata, play limbo, purchase movies, or pick a craft to make, such as bracelets or a photo frame with a group picture. Buy fun party games, like Twister or hot potato. This step, however, only applies to house parties, because a party anywhere else would be considered the main activity (like bowling).

Know how to apologize.,
Design and mail a personalized jigsaw puzzle.,
Create “I’m Sorry” coupons.,
Apologize on social media.,
Go on air to apologize.,
Wait for National I Forgot Day.",How to Make Up for Forgetting Someone's Birthday1," When you hurt someone, like forgetting a person’s birthday, express that you recognize what you’ve done and are concerned about their feelings. When deciding how you will apologize, think about the person to whom you’re apologizing. Who are they to you? What is the person like? What would that person find most meaningful? Let the answers to these questions guide you in creating your apology., One way to apologize and demonstrate you truly mean it is to spread your apology out over the course of several days or more. Here’s one way to do this. There are websites online that allow you to upload photos, which they then use to create a jigsaw puzzle for you of varying sizes. Choose a photo of the two of you based upon your relationship and the message you want to convey in your apology. Upload the photo and when you get the puzzle, write on the back of each piece expressing that you’re sorry and, if you choose, what the person means to you.


It doesn’t have to be sappy or sentimental; something funny might be best for the person whose birthday you forgot.
When you’re done, mail one piece (or more) of the puzzle every day to the other person., Another way to spread out your apology is to create apology or “I’m Sorry” coupons or vouchers for services or activities that the other person can redeem at times of his or her choosing. Again, think about who the person is and what would be most meaningful when deciding what you’ll be giving. You can either make the coupons yourself using art supplies or your computer and printer or you can go to websites like givecoupons.com or spottedsparrow.com and have them printed for you. On the back, write what each coupon is “worth.”, Making a public apology not only shows that you have humility (or simply don’t get embarrassed easily) but also that you’re willing to accept responsibility for and go the extra mile to make up for your lapse. If you don’t think the other person would be embarrassed by this approach, post an apology on his or her Facebook page and tweet an apology on his or her Twitter feed. Tailor it to your relationship and the person’s personality.


Add a photo, quote or song that is particularly poignant (or funny) to you both.
It’s highly unlikely he or she will be the only person to respond., Another way to publicly apologize is to say you’re sorry on air. If you know what radio station the person listens to every day on the way to work – or at another time – contact the program’s DJ and explain the situation. Ask if you can get 30 seconds of scheduled on-air time to make your apology. Also see if they’ll play a particular song right after it, a song that is special to you and the other person. Be persistent if you don’t get a response right away. If they agree, write out what you plan to say and rehearse it. You’ll only have one chance, and you want to nail it.


To ensure the other person turns on the radio that day and at that time, you may need to enlist the help of someone you can trust to keep it a secret.
If that’s not an option, call the other person shortly before you go on air and say he or she should turn on the radio because they’re playing some really good music or something to that effect.

, July 2nd is National I Forgot Day. Believe it or not, there does, indeed, exist such a day. If the other person’s birthday wasn’t too much before July 2nd, you could use this day to your advantage. Go to nationalcalendar.com and order a National Day Wall Calendar. When you get it, circle July 2nd and write a personalized apology for missing his or her birthday. Ask the person over for dinner at your place on July 2. If he or she can’t do dinner, try lunch. Make a home-cooked meal with all of their favorites and set the table with only the calendar as the other person’s place mat so it will be sure to stand out.


When you sit down to eat, point to the calendar and make your apology – one that likely won’t be forgotten!

Bestow a night of babysitting.,
Clean up their computer.,
Take on the yard work.,
Atone with a night of romance.",How to Make Up for Forgetting Someone's Birthday2," Obviously, this would be for someone who has a child or children, but as apologies go this is golden for the stretched-too-thin parents of today. Get creative about how you might present it and your apology. If the other person has an infant, for example, show up one day unannounced with a baby doll in a stroller. Tucked into the doll’s hand or side, have a card expressing your apologies for missing their birthday, along with a certificate you made for a day or evening of free babysitting.You’ll probably need to stipulate that you’ll need some advance notice, but do it in the fine print.

, We all know someone who isn’t particularly tech-savvy and has so many files on his or her desktop that it’s amazing anything can be found, let alone opened. Generally, it’s become quite the nightmare for the person, too. One way to apologize to someone like this, and make quite an impact, would be to give his or her computer a little sprucing up, assuming you know how to do such things. Email the person a personalized, belated birthday card, letting him or her know you feel badly about forgetting and that you’d like to redeem yourself by breathing new life into the contraption they’re staring at now., While there are a few people in the world who genuinely enjoy mowing the lawn, trimming edges and pulling weeds, it’s safe to say the vast majority would rather spend Sunday afternoons doing other things, like watching football or going shopping – in the air conditioning. Thus for many, taking this off their hands in the way of an apology could mean an awful lot. Consider who the person is when thinking about how you’ll deliver your apology and this gift of your time.For example, if it’s your father, perhaps you could sneak into his closet and get his work clothes and boots, dress up in them and deliver your apology written on a watering can or a bag of leaves you’ve already raked and sacked.

, One of the birthdays you most don’t want to forget – and typically suffer the most consequences from – is that of your romantic partner or husband or wife. Not a good thing. Nor easy to remedy. However, a surprise candlelit dinner for two with roses and a thoughtfully written card, followed by a hot bubble bath, a long massage and whatever comes after, well, that probably has some mileage in helping to make up for forgetting your loved one’s birthday. And it likely won’t be a much of a burden for you to bear either!"

Create a happiness jar.,
Bake a cake from far away.,
Download their favorite tunes.,
Post Post-It notes.",How to Make Up for Forgetting Someone's Birthday3," When you feel badly enough about forgetting a person’s birthday that you want to make it up to them somehow, it signals that you have a special relationship of some kind. It indicates you truly care. Making that person a happiness jar can show this. All it takes is a Mason jar with a lid, paper and a pen. Of course you can get more creative, but what matters most is what you write. On each piece of paper that you put in the jar, write down a memory you have of the person – something you experienced together, something you remember the other person saying or doing one day, the way he or she looked on a special occasion, how you feel about the person now and at different times since you’ve known one another.


Include one larger piece of paper or a small card saying you’re sorry for missing his or her birthday.
If there’s room left, throw in their favorite candies, tokens to the arcade if you do that together, small items the person might collect and so forth.
Decorate the jar if you’d like. Tie a ribbon around it, paint on it, hodge podge a photo of the two of you on one side., Sometimes the person doesn’t live nearby, and while you can call, email, send a card or a traditional present, maybe you’re also looking for something with a bit more punch behind your apology. Here’s one idea. Videotape yourself as you make the person his or her favorite kind of birthday cake. You could make it humorous or you could pretend as if you’re the star of a cooking show, which the other person might also find quite funny. You could even light the candles, sing him or her “Happy Birthday” and then express your apologies.


Burn your video to a disc, write out the cake recipe and wrap it like a birthday present before you send it in the mail.
If you think the cake will survey the journey, send it, too, or perhaps just a slice.

, If you’ve never looked online before, USB flash drives now come in all shapes, sizes, colors and materials. There are even action hero USB flash drives. You can also have them customized from a variety of online sites, which is exactly what you want to do. Since they’re small and you won’t have much space to convey your message, keep it simple, or consider using a symbol or photo. Then fill it with the other person’s favorite music (music that you own, of course).Add photos of you together. Create a special playlist.
Before you give it to the other person, go online and print a piece of blank sheet music. Write your apology and birthday wishes on it when you present the USB drive.

, If you have access to the person’s home, buy a package of multi-colored Post-It notes and write a variety of messages on them, tailored to the person and your relationship – memories, quotes, feelings, jokes. Tape small photos or other mementos, such as a ticket from a concert you went to together, to some of them. While he or she is not home, stick them in both obvious and more hidden places throughout the house so they’re found not only when the person comes home and sees them everywhere, but also over time.


Then tape several together to create a card expressing your apology that you can either leave after you’ve gone Post-It note crazy or that you can be waiting to hand deliver."

Plan a day of awesomeness.,
Enjoy a picnic.,
Pack up and hit the road.,
Design a scavenger hunt.",How to Make Up for Forgetting Someone's Birthday4," Very few things show you care more than wanting to spend time with another person. Knowing them well enough to plan a day of awesomeness only amplifies that. Here’s how it works. Think about all the things they love to do in your city or area – favorite places to eat, favorite activities, favorite places to go – and then plan a day touching on all those things. It could even be a surprise day of awesomeness.Arrange it so you pick the person up in the morning. When you arrive, present the day’s itinerary – taped to the menu from the restaurant where the day begins with the person’s favorite eggs Benedict.

, Food and sunshine, maybe a lake, river or ocean. Perhaps even a grill. Who doesn’t love a nice picnic? You can go with just the other person or invite others along. All it requires is picking a time, a location and packing food, drinks, a blanket and whatever you might want to play with or ride while you’re there. You don’t even need a car. When you invite the person to the picnic, pack a sack lunch in a brown paper bag and write your apology in Sharpie on the bag. Place the bag on a Frisbee, tie a ribbon around both and pass it to your loved one with a smile.

, This might require a little more planning, and more money depending upon where you go, but taking a trip – getting away and spending time one-on-one – may be just the apology needed in some cases. Or, it could just be an immensely fun time with someone you care for and whom you want to make sure knows it. It might be a one-night stay in a quirky town two hours away, a weekend in NYC or a week long trip to Australia. Budgets and schedules vary, but one thing is constant – the importance of making time for and spending time with people who matter most.


What better way, then, to invite them on the trip than to give them a bell alarm clock with your apologies written on the back?
If you’re splurging, buy a watch and have it engraved!

, Decide upon where you want the scavenger hunt to end, which will be at a place where the two of you will do something together that the other person really enjoys. It might be at a bowling alley, movie theater, restaurant or even a river where you can canoe. Then start creating clues that are relevant or significant to the other person or to you and the other person. For example, they might be inside jokes, memories, things you’ve discussed doing, etc. Write or print them on whatever type of paper or material will be appropriate for their locations. The first, for example, might be on a piece of scratch paper taped to the bathroom mirror while the third might need to be laminated (or even put in a jar) because it’s buried by the tree you used to climb as kids.


Don’t tell the other person the scavenger hunt is your apology!
Go to your ending point before the scavenger hunt begins and drop off a bunch of balloons that say “I’m sorry.” Include a gift, if you want, and express your apologies before spending the day having fun together.
If this isn’t possible, get just one balloon, stuff it in your pocket, blow it up when you arrive and give it to the other person, along with your apology."

Be prepared for mishaps, because they will happen.",How to Plan a Birthday Party," The sooner you choose a date, the sooner you can get started with planning other elements of the party.


Consult with the person whose birthday it is to determine a good day for the party. Check his/her schedule and take note of any holidays around that time. Keep in mind that many people travel for different holidays.
It is advisable to host the party on a weekend. More people will be willing and able to come if it is on a weekend, because many people do not have to work on the weekends.;
, Appropriate times will vary based on who the party is for and the age of that person.


If you are throwing a birthday party for a child, host it in the late morning or early afternoon. This is most convenient for families.
If you are throwing a party for an adult, then an evening party is appropriate.

, Parties can easily consume a great deal of money, so it is important to come up with a budget and stick to it.Come up with an overall budget, meaning a total amount that you want to spend on the birthday party. Most people believe that a budget up to $300-400 is reasonable, and many feel keeping party costs under $150 is completely doable.Break down each element of the party (e.g. invitations, food, drink, decorations, venue) and decide how much should be spent in each area.

, There are a few reasons for doing this.


A guest list will help you ensure that no one is forgotten when sending out invitations.
It will aid you in deciding where to hold the party. A guest list of 12 people means you could host the party in someone's home, if you wanted to do so, but a guest list of 50 people will likely need to be held somewhere else.
This will eliminate the risk of people the birthday person does not want attending showing up to the party.
Having a number of guests in mind enables you to determine how much food and drink will need to be provided, if you are doing that yourself or having it catered.

, This involves knowing the individual for whom the party is being thrown.


Take into consideration what the birthday person wants. If he/she wants a more elaborate party, then work to plan the party in a venue that enables that. If he/she is into small gatherings with close friends, then aim for that instead.
You will need to decide if you want to have the party in your home or someone else's home in order to keep the venue cost-free.
Think about making a reservation at a restaurant if your party is of a reasonable size. Most restaurants can accommodate up to about 25 people without too much issue.
Another idea is to host the party at a party or banquet hall. This will be a more expensive option, but it can easily accommodate more people.
Think about the guest list and keep in mind if any guests need accommodations. Be sure that wherever you choose caters to people who need certain accommodations, like wheelchairs.

, Themed birthday parties can be a lot of fun, but they can also end up being more costly when you consider buying everything to match the theme.Weigh the pros and cons of having a themed party based on the person whose birthday it is. Would they like a themed birthday party?
Consider whether it is a kid's party or an adult's party. Choose a theme that is age-appropriate, if you decide to go this route. For example, appropriate themes for children would be based on kid-friendly television shows or movies, circus, movie theater, a children's book, or carnival. On the other hand, appropriate themes for adults might be a black-and-white affair, casino, a decade theme, or an adult movie or television show.

, Once the earlier details are decided upon, then it is time to send out invitations to the guest list.


It is best to send out the invitations about 3-4 weeks in advance of the party in order to give people enough time to plan for it. Be sure to include RSVP information on the invitation.
Sending out the invitations after you have decided on the earlier details ensures that you have the guest list secured and that you have decided on whether to have a themed party, making you more organized.
Be sure to reach out to some of the invited guests for help. They can help set up, clean up, provide food, decorate, and more. It is not necessary to do it all by yourself!, Based on what you have decided for the party, you have different options for these aspects.


Decide what type of food will be best for the party. If you chose a theme, then make sure the food flows with that theme.
Know whether any of your guests have food allergies. If so, be sure to provide options that are safe for them to eat or let them know that they are welcome to bring their own food.
Be realistic about how much food and drink to provide based on the length of the party. A party that is planned to be an hour or two might only require refreshments and birthday desserts, while a party that is meant to last for several hours will need more of a meal.Make sure that you plan for enough food and drink to cater to all of the guests. Err on the side of too much food rather than too little.

, You may or may not be responsible for providing these things, based on your decision about where to host the party.


If you are throwing the party in your home or someone else's, decide if you will make all of the food yourself. If not, then reach out to others and ask for their assistance in providing the food and drinks. A potluck is a great idea!
If the party is going to be held at a restaurant, then no real planning needs to be done in this area, as the restaurant will take care of that for you!
If the party is going to be at a party or banquet hall, then you need to check with their staff about catering options. Find out if you can bring the food, if they will cater the food, or if they have particular vendors they use to cater food for parties.
Decide whether alcohol should be provided, if it is an adult birthday party. For example, if the birthday person does not drink and has many friends and family who do not drink, then alcohol would be unnecessary., This is one of the most enjoyable parts of the planning!


If you decided on a theme for the party, then this will be easy, as you will simply buy decorations to match the theme.
If you did not decide on a theme, then think about what the birthday person would want. Does he/she like a lot of decorations, like balloons, streamers, and confetti? Or is he/she more of a laid-back person who is not interested in decorations? Purchase decorations accordingly.
Decorations are not as important for an adult's birthday party, but they are quite important for a child's birthday party. Kids are imaginative, so even household items can contribute to the decorations if you want to save money in this area., This could involve several different types of entertainment.


For a child's birthday party, there are many options. Games are great, but they often require supplies, so keep that in mind. You could have a story time, if it goes with the theme. Another idea is to have music playing. You could also hire an entertainer, such as a clown, a magician, or a scientist, if it is in your budget.An adult's party can just as easily include games. It would also be helpful to have music playing in the background, either via a disc jockey or via a homemade setup with a computer or smartphone and speakers. If the party is going to be out on the town, then the entertainment could come in the form of a live band or an activity, such as a comedy show.

, For many birthday parties, this is the most important part!


Most of the time, the birthday person will want a cake, especially if it is a child. Decide whether you are going to make the cake yourself or purchase one from a bakery.
Know what kind of cake the birthday person likes, and take into consideration any food allergies of the guests. Have an alternative dessert ready if they cannot have the cake.
If the birthday person does not want a cake, then provide what they do want! Cupcakes, brownies, pies, cookies, and ice cream are all perfectly acceptable substitutions for birthday cake.

, Have an alternative location prepared and a system for notifying the guests if the need arises.

, This is why you asked them to help, so make sure they are there to help you!


Set up the decorations and food, if necessary.
If you are providing the food to the party venue, then be sure to get it to the venue on time.
Give yourself enough time to set everything up. Rushing will result in mistakes.
Have everything you need in one place, or have dedicated helpers be in charge of what supplies they are helping to provide. Know where everything is to streamline the process.

,


If the food is being catered or provided by the restaurant, then that will be taken care of by that business.
If you are providing the food in your home or someone else's, then be wary of putting the food out too early. Food can spoil if it is not kept hot or cold.

, If you had an outdoor party planned and the weather is poor, then your guests need to know where to go instead.

, Take them in stride as best you can.


Have a dedicated cool-down area if a child gets upset during the party. It is best if it is away from the rest of the guests.
Have a first aid kit and anything else that you think might be necessary in case someone gets injured during the party.
If you have pets, keep them secured away from the guests for the duration of the party. Unless your pets are very well behaved and trained, an issue could arise there, from someone being afraid of them to the pets getting loose.

Come up with a message.,
Come up with a layout.,
Decide on a theme.,
Play with font.,
Choose a color scheme.,
Don't be afraid to use prints and patterns.,
Use blank spaces to add designs.",How to Make a Birthday Banner1," Your message can be as simple or complex as you want it to be. Here are some ideas to get you started:


HAPPY BIRTHDAY
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BOB
HAPPY 30th BOB (the ""th"" will be on one sheet)
HAPPY SWEET 16
HAPPY 16th BITHDAY JANE (the ""th"" will be on one sheet)
HAPPY SWEET 16 JANE

, Most banners will have the entire message on the same line, but you don't have to do this. You can make your banner look more interesting by giving it a different layout. Here are some ideas to get you started:


All the words can be on the same line
Each word can be on a different line
HAPPY BIRTHDAY can be on one line, and the person's name can be one a different line.

, This can make choosing your colors, patterns, and fonts a lot easier. You can match the theme to the party, the person's interests, or come up with your own theme. Here are some ideas to get you started:


If you want to use a train theme, consider making a pennant banner with square pennants. Each pennant will make a train cart. Make a train engine shape to use at the front of your banner.
For an under water theme, use lots of blues and greens. Use some fish and bubble stickers around the letters.
For a princess theme, consider what sort of princess this is. Typical princess colors are pink and silver, but if your princess is from a specific movie, you might want to use the colors from her dress instead.
Consider what the person likes. Does he or she have a favorite food, animal, color, book, or movie? Choose one of those, and design your banner around that.

, You can use a standard block letter font, or a fancy italic or cursive font. Larger, thicker fonts might be more appealing to children. If your banner has a party or theme, consider matching the font to that. For example, if you are doing a princess themed banner, consider using a cursive or italic font.

, This will help your banner look more unified and interesting. Choosing random colors might result in something that looks less than appealing. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Use three different colors, such as red, yellow, and blue.
Use different shades of the same color. For example: light blue, medium blue, and dark blue.
Use all cool colors, such as green, blue, and purple. You can also use all warm colors, such as red/pink, orange, and yellow.
Use metallic colors, such as gold or silver.
Alternate contrasting colors, such as white and black.

, You can make your banner look really interesting and unique with some patterned scrapbooking paper. Here are some things to consider:


Combine solid colors and patterns. For example: solid blue and white with blue dots.
Combine patterns, such as vertical strips, horizontal strips, and dots.
Try to use similar colors in your patterns. This will tie the design together and prevent the patterns and colors from clashing.

, When creating a banner, you will likely end up with some blank spaces between and around the words. You can leave them blank, or you can fill them in with images that matches the theme. Here are some ideas to get you started:


If you are making a pennant banner for a snow themed party, and you have blank pennants between the words, consider gluing a snowflake onto the blank pennant.
If you are painting a banner for a super hero themed party, consider adding a border using comic book strips. You can also buy comic book themed scrapbooking paper instead if you don't want to sacrifice any old comic books.
If you are making a banner for someone who likes the ocean, consider filling in any blank spaces with images of fish, shells, and sea bubbles.

Decide on a theme for your party.,
Buy a character stuffed toy for your child.,
Choose the best 12 to 15 photographs from your collection.,
Print them on white cardstock.,
Use a circle puncher to punch out circles from the photographs.,
Punch out circles from two different card-stocks.,
Paste variety 2 circles on variety 1 circles right at the center.,Cut out lots of small circles from different card-stock.,
Lay a ribbon flat on a table and use clamps to secure it tightly.,
Paste 5 small circles on the ribbons in a way that they overlap each other.,
Paste the circle bunch and repeat this until all the circle bunches are over.",How to Make a Photo Banner for Your Child's Birthday Party," Your photo banner must follow this theme.

Determine the theme of your party way in advance so that you get sufficient time to capture your child’s pictures for making a kids' birthday party.;
, Make your child sit beside the stuffed toy and photograph him. Since you would need at least 10 to 12 images, try capturing only 2 in a single day so that the photographs you use for the banner will have your child in different dresses and in different moods., Use them for your photo banner., To give a classy look to the banner, you can convert all the images into black and white before printing., Make sure the circles clearly accommodate the birthday child as well as the stuffed character toy., Each photo circle will need one circle from each card-stock variety. The photo circle should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) smaller than the card-stock variety 1 circle and the card-stock variety 1 circle should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) smaller than the card-stock variety 2 circles., Let the glue dry completely, then paste the photo circle on them.,, The ribbon should be long enough to make the entire banner., You can randomly choose a circle or create your own pattern., Do not remove the banner from its position until the glue is completely dry."

Choose a tasteful bag.,
Think outside the bag.You could use a basket, a decorative box, or any other receptacle that is clean and the right size for the goodies.,
Decide on a theme.,
Consider where you will be presenting the bag.,
Decorate the bag.,
Don’t forget filler.,
Set a budget.,
Focus on quality over quantity.Instead of handing over a giant bag filled with mostly useless and throwaway items, aim for fewer items that are stylish, sophisticated and useful.,
Make sure the goodies reflect the recipient.,
Select useful items.,
Keep it simple.,
Include a birthday card.,
Close the bag securely.,
Test the bag’s stability.,
Add finishing touches.",How to Make a Birthday Goodie Bag for Adults," Avoid using a plain brown lunch sack for an adult goodie bag. Those are fine for kids, but for an adult you should use a higher quality bag that looks classy. Most craft stores have an enormous selection of gift bags in a broad range of sizes, colors and materials.


Select a sturdy bag made of quality materials and make sure the handles are secure.
Choose a simple bag that is all one color so that you can easily customize it with creative embellishments.
Have a good idea of what you want to put in your bag before making a purchase or doing any decorating. Consider the weight and size of the items so that your bag will be able to accommodate the goodies.;
, You could get really creative and choose a vessel that ties in thematically with the goodies themselves or a vessel is actually part of the gift itself.


For example, if you want to fill the bag with cooking-related items for a chef, use a nice steel mixing bowl to hold the items instead of a bag. Doing this keeps the design elements consistent and the chef can actually use the steel mixing bowl later.
Go green.Consider choosing a bag that is made with recycled materials or one that can be repurposed later, like a canvas bag.

, An easy way to maintain the perceived sophistication of the adult goodie bag is to keep all of the design elements consistent.This can be as simple as choosing a color theme for the gift and keeping that color consistent with the packaging, decorations and items inside the bag.


For example, get a nice yellow bag and fill it with goodies that are yellow or packaged in yellow. Something as simple as that will make the gift appear visually cohesive and the overall effect will look sophisticated and high quality.

, Are you bringing it to a birthday party or giving it to the recipient one-on-one? Is it a gift for a co-worker that you are presenting at an office party? You can then tailor the bag to fit the event.


If you were attending a woman’s birthday beach party, you could choose a yellow/blue color theme that reflects the colors of the ocean and the sand. Using a canvas beach bag as the vessel would tie the gift into the party.
You could fill the bag with yellow/blue items that can be used at the beach, like a nice pair of designer sunglasses, a big fluffy beach towel, quality sunscreen, water-resistant wireless mini speakers, lip balm with SPF and a cute pair of flop flops.

, You are already using quality materials for the bag itself, and customizing it with a few additional design elements will add a personal flair to compliment the overall presentation. Since you are going for a classy looking bag, keep these additional elements to a minimum.


Try adding some curly ribbon that matches the color theme, tying them around the bag handles.
Get some nice postcard-sized cardstock with an interesting pattern and glue it on the bag, along with a paper cut out of the first letter of the recipient’s first name (you can find those at any craft store) to give the bag a posh, monogrammed look.
Affix tasteful cut out paper shapes that contribute to the theme or color scheme. Stickers are also an option, but opt for upscale designer stickers, like those used for scrapbooking (you can find these in any craft store).

, In most cases you will want to get some filler for the bag, such as tissue paper, shredded crinkle paper or cellophane paper. All of those come in every color of the rainbow, so choose something that enhances the design elements you have in place.


Filler, along with looking nice, will also protect the items inside the bag and keep them hidden until the recipient opens the gift.

, Tailor your budget to fit the relationship you have with the recipient. In other words, you’ll probably want to spend more on a close friend than a co-worker. Regardless of who the person is to you, give yourself a budget. Adult goodies can get pricy very quickly, so it’s good to have some limitations in place.

,


To keep yourself on track when selecting items to put in the bag, continually ask yourself, “Is this something I would appreciate receiving myself?”

, For a friend, choose upscale items that are tailored to what you know about them. For people that you don’t know well, choose items that are a little more neutral that anyone could enjoy.


For an artist friend you could put all art-related items in the bag, like paint brushes, a small paint set, a book about their favorite artist, a beautifully bound sketch book and/or two tickets to an art film showing in your city.
For a co-worker you could use a dark brown coffee-themed bag and cream colored tissue paper. Inside you could put a nice mug, a few bags of high-end coffee, a small bag of bakery-made biscotti and a gift card for Starbucks.

, Everyone appreciates receiving things that are useful and functional. Gift cards fall into this category and since these days you can get a gift card to almost anything, tailor your choice to the person. Restaurants, department stores, craft stores, wine shops, book stores – the possibilities are endless.


Other ideas would be movie tickets, sports tickets or tickets for a night at the symphony.
Smaller useful items are great too – travel sized hand sanitizers that are high end or decorated could be included, or a well-designed pen.

, Don’t go overboard with your choices – pick 3 to 6 quality items that are well-made and nice to look at and leave it at that. When paired with the sophisticated, well-designed packaging you’ve created, even the smallest of gift bags come off as swanky and thoughtful.

, No birthday goodie bag is complete without a card for the recipient. Whether custom-made or store bought, include a card that ties in with the rest of the gift in color and/or theme. Sign it and place it into the bag last, so that it is on the top when the recipient opens it.

, For bags, add 2 or 3 small pieces of double sided tape near the top and press both sides of the top together to secure the bag closed. If you are using something other than a bag, do whatever you can to secure everything in place.


Putting cellophane wrap around baskets and other similar vessels is a common solution.

, Your bag is nearly complete, so go ahead and give it a little test to make sure the bag is stable, the items don’t move around and that it remains closed. Pick it up by the handles and walk around the room. If it’s sturdy but a little heavy, carry and present the bag with your hand on the bottom of the bag to support it.

, Now that you are looking at the bag in its finalized state, you may get a last-minute idea for an embellishment or addition. Resist the temptation to add a bunch of new elements to the bag – just tweak it a little.


Add a little more curly ribbon or glue a few more shapes or patterned paper onto the bag. Purchase and tie on a helium-filled balloon in a complimentary color, if you like.
Craft stores sell trim that comes in sticker form to be used on paper and in scrapbooks, so try adding a little trim to one or all of the bag’s sides.
Tuck a single fresh flower into the top of the bag so that the stem is secure in the bag and the flower itself peeks out of the top.

, You can use scissors or a sharp craft knife. Be sure to cut just inside the lines you made when tracing the letter. If you see any pencil marks, be sure to erase them.

, The string needs to be long enough to fit all of the letters, plus an additional 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) at each end. This will allow you to hang the banner.

, They can be as close together or as far apart as you like. They will hang better, however, if you include some space between each letter.

Consider taping the string to the back of your banner.Flip the shape over, and lay the string across the back.,
Wait for any glue and paint to dry before hanging the banner.",How to Make a Birthday Banner3," You can use any type of paper you want to make your pennants. The best paper to use is scrapbooking paper, because it is very colorful. Cardstock is also a good option, because it is sturdy. The paper can be all one color, or multiple colors.

, You will need one sheet of paper for each letter in your message. You will also need an extra sheet for the spaces between each word.

, You can use almost any shape you want, but the most popular shapes are circles, triangles, and rectangles. Make the template a few inches larger than the letters you are planning on using. It needs to be large enough so that you can easily read it across the room.


If you are using a rectangle, consider cutting a ^ shape into the bottom., Use a pencil if you can. Once you have cut the shapes out, erase any pencil marks that are still visible. These will be your pennants. You will be sticking the letters onto these.


If you could not find a pencil, cut the shapes out just inside the lines you have made.

, Use a contrasting color. This will create a sort of frame around the letter. To do this, take your template and cut it smaller all around by ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters). Trace the template onto contrasting sheets of paper, cut the shapes out, and attach them to the center of each pennant. You can use glue or clear, double-sided tape.

, The letters need to be several inches high, but smaller than the pennants. You will need one letter for pennant. Consider using a contrasting color to make them more visible. Here are some ideas on what you can use for the letters:


Use some large, letter stickers.
Paint the letters on using stencils and acrylic paint.
Cut the letters out of paper and glue them on. You can even use glitter scrapbooking paper for some extra sparkle.

, Choose a thin string, such as baker's twine, yarn, or balloon ribbon. Plan on leaving about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) of string at the front and end of your banner so that you can hang it.

, Use a hole punch to poke a hole in each top corner. Then, weave the ribbon through the holes like so:


Push the string down through the left hole.
Bring the string across the back of the pennant.
Pull the string up through the right hole.
Push the string down through the left hole of next pennant.
Bring it across the back of the pennant, and pull it back up through the right hole.
Keep doing this until you have no more pennants.

, Position it about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) below the top edge. Secure it in place with a long piece of clear tape. The tape should go from one side of the shape to the other.


If you are using a rectangle shape, tape the string 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) down from the top edge. Fold the top edge back by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) on top of the string. Secure it with glue or clear, double-sided tape.

, Depending on what you used, this can take anywhere between a few hours to a whole day.

Buy enough butcher paper to fit your message.,
Draw some guidelines on the paper using a pencil and ruler.,
Lightly sketch out your message using a pencil.,
Place your stencil where you want it.,
Paint over the stencil using acrylic paint.,
Move the stencil over to the next letter.,
Let the paint dry before you hang the banner.",How to Make a Birthday Banner4," You can find colorful butcher paper online, in teacher supply stores, and in certain university/college art stores. Regular arts and crafts stores may not sell butcher paper.


You can also use fabric instead, but you may want to hem the edges so that they do not fray.
White butcher paper may seem plain, but it will give you a nice canvas to work on.

, Draw lightly with the pencil so that you can erase the marks easier later on. This will help ensure that your words are straight and not crooked.

, You don't have to get the font right at this point—just try to get the rough shape and size. This will help you position the stencils later on. Again, remember to draw lightly so that the pencil does not show through the paint.

, Some stencils will have a sticky back and will stay put while you paint. If your stencil moves around too much, tape the edges down using painter's tape.

, You can use a foam brush or a stencil brush to apply the paint. Apply the paint using a light, tapping motion. Try not to apply too much paint at once; you can always apply another coat or two. If you apply too much paint at once, the paint may leak under the stencil and create puddles.


If you are painting on fabric, use fabric paint instead.

, You may want to start out by painting every other letter first, then going back and painting the missing letters. This will give the paint time to dry, and you won't have to worry about accidentally touching and smearing wet paint.

, Depending on what type of paint you used, this can take anywhere between 20 minutes to 2 hours. Hang your banner up by either taping or tacking it to the wall.

Put healthy treats in a chip bag.,
Create fake lollipops with broccoli.,
Serve a family member fake sunny side up eggs made with yogurt and canned peaches.,
Switch out condiments.,
Fill Oreos with toothpaste.",How to Play an April Fool's Day Prank on Your Family1," Caramel apples are a delicious treat many love. A fun way to mess with your family is to make caramel apples, but replace the apples with onions. Your family members will bite into an apple expecting a delicious treat only to be met with the taste of onion. Use a basic caramel apple recipe for this prank.Buy a 14 ounce package of individually wrapped caramels, some milk, onions, and popsicle sticks. Place a stick in each onion you're using. Make sure to buy onions in the size and shape of regular apples. You should also remove the papery skins off of the onions. Use a knife to carve the bottom of the onion into a rounded, apple-like shape.Remove the caramels from their wrappers and place them in a bowl. Add two tablespoons of milk, and microwave for 2 minutes, stopping halfway to stir. Allow the mixture to cool for a few minutes, and then coat each onion in caramel.
Set the apples aside where you family will find the treat or serve them after dinner as dessert.;
, By poking small holes in a plastic bottle, you can create a booby trap for an unsuspecting family member. You can leave this trap in the fridge for someone to find later.Take a plastic bottle of water. Hold it over the sink and poke holes in it with a needle. Some excess water will spill out. You can wipe this away with a towel.
Set the water bottle in the fridge. When someone picks up the bottle, the pressure from their hands will cause water to squirt everywhere.
You can also pull this prank with a bottle of soda, juice, or any liquid.

, A lot of great pranks come from messing with expectations. Someone expects one thing, but gets another. You can pull a prank by replacing the contents of a bag of chips.


Get up in the morning before anyone is awake. Take a bag of chips from the cupboard. Gently open the bag along the seam, going slowly as to not rip the bag.
Dump out the chips into the garbage. Replace the bag with a healthy snack. Something like dried fruit or kale chips would work well here.
Once the bag is full, place a small amount of glue along the seam. Reseal the bag and set aside until it dries. Then, place it back in the cupboard.

, Fake lollipops created with broccoli can be a fun prank to play if you have young children. Your kids will think you're giving them a sugary treat, when you're really providing them with health food. Keep in mind, very young children may react poorly to this, so it's a good idea to have some real lollipops on hand after you pull the prank.Buy some lollipop sticks and some 6-by-6 inch pieces of wax paper at a craft store. You should also buy colored tissue paper.
Take a small piece of raw broccoli, about the size of a large marble, and put it on the end of a lollipop stick. Wrap the broccoli in the wax paper. Then, wrap the wax paper in a piece of colored tissue paper.
Leave the treats out for your kids to find or give them to your kids as a snack or after dinner or lunch.

, If you're in charge of making breakfast for your family, fake sunny side up eggs can be a great prank. You can make what looks like an egg out of yogurt and peaches, leaving your family baffled when they bite into their breakfast.Put a dollop of plain white yogurt on a plate. Then, place a canned peach in the center of the dollop. This will look like an egg.
Serve this breakfast to a family member, or multiple family members. Keep in mind, if you don't usually make breakfast for your family, family members may get suspicious if you suddenly decide to do so on April Fool's Day.

, Switch the types of condiments in the bottles in the kitchen. This will give people a shock when they expect one thing and get another. You can do this in the morning, before anyone is up, or get up in the middle of the night to make the switch.It's a good idea to switch condiments that look similar, so whoever ends up using the bottle does not notice until he or she begins eating. You could, for example, place mayonnaise in the whipped cream container. You could also put spicy Sriracha sauce in the ketchup container.

, A classic April Fool's Day prank can be done with Oreos and a bottle of toothpaste. Make sure the toothpaste you use is white, so it looks like the filling of an Oreo. As with many food pranks, it's best to do this early in the morning or at night so no one catches you.Open each Oreo and then scrape off the cream. Be gentle, as not to break the cookie, and use a fork or spoon to help.
Squeeze a bit of toothpaste onto the center of one side of the cookie. Spread evenly on the cookie's surface, then place the other side of the cookie on top.
Place the Oreos back in the container. Leave them out in the cupboard for a family member to discover.
If you can't find Oreos, any other type of sandwich cookie will work.

Make up some party games.,
Then we played a game of freeze dance to Frozen music.,
Lastly, we went to go see the movie Frozen because it was still in theaters.,
After the movie, we came home and the princesses all left Arendelle and returned to their own kingdoms.

",How to Have a Frozen Disney Birthday Party," You can use the pre-made invitations sold in stores, or make your own. I suggest creating your own in power point. I made the invitations to the birthday party as if it was Elsa's coronation banquet, and addressed them to each child as if they were a citizen of Arendelle.;
, You can really decorate however you and your daughter wishes. We transformed our living room into a wintry wonderland by hanging many paper snowflakes that we had made from the ceiling at different lengths (using clear string and tape). Also, we took some Christmas lights out and strung them around the border of the room. We also had the traditional party balloons and streamers.

, For our banquet we served pizza with melted snow (water). After pizza, we served of course chocolate cake with chocolate ice-cream because Elsa and Anna both love chocolate. All throughout dinner the adults pretended to be cooks from the castle of Arendelle serving the royal princesses. The girls really got into it and made up their own princess names and what kingdoms they had come from.

, One Elsa and Anna team. We gave each girl a necklace with either Anna or Elsa's picture on it as a party favor.

, He then proceeded to usher the girls into our decorated living room ""outside"". One of the adults had already cued up our apple T.V. to show the scene of Frozen where Elsa is outside shrinking away from everyone when her powers are exposed.

, For a game, we had the girls on the Elsa team separately hide somewhere upstairs. Then the girls on the Anna team had to go find one girl on the Elsa team and bring her back to the living room. Luckily we had an even number. Once they came back downstairs, they had to pick up a white balloon off the ground (snowball) and pop it between them. We put the balloons on the ground while the Anna's were still looking to avoid popping them early.

, Whenever a girl was caught moving when the music stopped, she fell down from a ""frozen heart"". The last girl left was the only one that could unfreeze her friends (which she did by tapping them on the head with her hand)

, When it is on dvd you could watch it that way if you want.

Start with a relaxing bath.,
As for the dress, you need something that makes you the centre of attention.,
Put on something comfortable.,
Start with your hair, because a lot of styles involve treating or styling hair when it's damp or wet.,
Make sure your face is moisturized, because make up on dry skin hurts and gets all flaky.,
Dress up carefully, away from all the makeup supplies and beetroot (Stains are ugly, ask Victoria Beckham!).,
Spray on some perfume, toss a few mints in your mouth and walk confidently outside.

,
Be careful while you're eating or celebrating, make sure you don't spill anything on yourself.,
Enjoy yourself.,
Wear a smile.",How to Look Nice on Your Birthday," Brush your teeth again and use mouthwash. Wash your hair clean with shampoo and conditioner. (You can also oil your hair an hour before you wash it for added shine!) You want to make sure you're clean, because that falls under the basics of looking good!;
, Like we said before, it's your day. Don't camouflage yourself in the room. Stand out. The moment people enter the room, their eyes should fall on you. Make it obvious whose party it is. Of course, you also need to intelligently choose your outfit. For example, if its freezing, you can't wear a little black dress just because it will stand out. You want to stand out in a good way! Choose something chic and comfortable all at the same time. (You can read more on choosing the perfect stuff on the Internet).

, Sweatpants and a loose t-shirt are a good bet, because that will ensure you're comfortable while you get ready and you won't stain your clothes with anything.

, Study a few styles beforehand and try them out. You don't want a catwalk catastrophe at the last moment, do you? For example, if you're going for a pretty fishtail braid or something, practice a few times. If you're leaving it loose, style it well! Determine what suits you and go for it.

, Start with concealing your little zits and black heads. Go for your desired look, but don't overdo it. A face packed with make up can be uncomfortable, too. If you can't do it right, get someones help.

, Make sure you're comfortable.

,, Who wants the pain of dressing up from scratch for a second time?

, Remember, its your day. Make the most of it. However, don't go blabbing that sentence to all your guests- you don't want to come off as a snob!

, As they say, a smile is the best accessory!

Create a guest list.,
Pick a venue, time and theme.,
Deliver invitations.,
Pick out decorations and foodstuffs.,
Come up with a few games.,
Take care of the adults.",How to Have a Nice Birthday Party1," A good rule of thumb is the child's age plus 1. Depending on how many adults can stick around, you'll be grateful that this number isn't too high. Have you child pick their closest friends and start planning.


As you create the guest list, consider schedules. Are there any conflicts you can foresee? Holidays? Church? School activities?;
, Though you don't necessarily have to have it at your house, that may be the easiest option. Otherwise consider taking your bundles of joy to a kid-friendly restaurant or to a play area or park.


If you're doing it at your house, think about having a theme. It'll be much easier to pick out decorations, food, and plan games if you narrow down your options.

Let your child narrow it down to a few themes and then go see which one is easiest to accommodate at your local party supply stores. You may want to take to your child to the stores with you to encourage them to select what's available.


Find a time that you believe will work for both the parents and the kids. The parents' availability is almost as important (the kids will need rides and/or you'll need back up!) as the kids'. A few hours is more than sufficient -- do not feel obligated to take the children all afternoon.

, This is a touchy topic at times and must be done appropriately. You can either call the parents to inform them of the goings-on or carefully deliver them at school.


Consider asking the teacher to put them in the kids' folders. This is a super discreet way of making sure the children who aren't invited don't find out and get upset.

, Now that you know how many people are coming and what theme you're working with, you can pick out the appropriate amount of food, drinks, and decorations. Make sure to do this in advance! You don't want to be running around chaotically on the day of.


In addition to decorations, think about something the children can take home with them. This can be a decoration itself, or it can be some game the children played. Avoid wasting your money on little trinkets they'll just throw away in a month when it's not being used.
Remember the cake! And stock up on juices, water, and some alternate age-appropriate foods. You may have some children that can't or won't eat cake and you don't want to hand over a starving child to their parent.

And equally important: cups, plates, napkins, forks, and spoons.



, Though the children may be able to make their fun (especially depending on their age), be sure to have a few pre-planned activities to keep things manageable and speed the time away.


If you have a theme, try to stick with it. The kids could pan for gold in a western style theme, make bracelets for a princess theme, or build cardboard rockets for a space theme. Ask other parents for ideas, too.

These games are good way to cover your party favor. The kids can take home whatever they've done, found, or made that day.



, Hopefully, one or two will volunteer to stick around. That being the case, be sure to provide for them too. Have adult friendly food and drinks included on your grocery list when you make your venture to the store.


If you're super on top of party etiquette, you may want to send them a thank you for helping out at the party. Though this is by no means necessary, it is a nice, thoughtful touch.

Take the day off.,
Sleep well the night before.,
Treat yourself to your favorite food.,
Take a fancy bath or shower.,
Open your cards and gifts.,
Have some birthday cake.,
Write down your thoughts in a journal.",How to Have a Great Birthday1," Plan ahead and give your job notice that you’ll be taking your birthday off. You’ll likely have to take a vacation day, but some work places that allow free leave will understand and encourage a celebration of your birth!


Account for the work time lost from your birthday by working ahead prior to the big day. You don’t want to follow up your birthday with a day full of errands and catch up work.
Don’t schedule any meetings or errands on your birthday unless they are absolutely necessary. You want to worry about nothing at all for your birthday.;
, Going to bed early ensures you wake up bright and early to take advantage of your clean slate. The average number of hours to aim for when getting sleep is between 7 and 9 hours for the average adult, but adding an hour in either direction may also be appropriate depending on your needs.Don’t drink too much before going to bed. If you drink too much in the evening, you’ll find your sleep interrupted by the need to go to the bathroom all night.Consider tossing the alarm clock for the evening. Just let your body handle everything, and get up only when you feel refreshed. Don’t be afraid to sleep in. It's your day after all. A few extra hours of sleep feel great and might be what you need to get in the right mindset for the day.

, Go out to a fancy restaurant and get your favorite meal, or order in and let the food come to your front door. Your birthday is a good day to order that new meal or dish you’ve always wanted to try.


Many restaurants offer free meals or sides when it's your birthday. Take a look online and see if you can score a few free bites! This applies to retail stores as well. Have some breakfast in bed. If you live with someone, ask if they’ll bring breakfast right to your bed. Bring a food tray and napkins so that you don’t get crumbs or runny egg on your bed.

, Use a scented gel and some favorite soap, even if it's usually saved for going-out occasions.


Light candles, dim the lights and play some music to optimize your relaxation.
Bath bombs and other bath accessories are perfect to moisturize and feel great, whether you are starting or ending the day with your bath.

, You’ve probably received a few cards or packages in the mail for your birthday by the time the big day rolls around. Don’t open them as soon as you get them. Save them for your birthday to accentuate the moment. People are thinking about you!


Spend the day deciding how to best display those cards. Cards make a great decoration for window sills or on the kitchen table.
If you received gift cards or money for your birthday, think about what you are going to do with those gifts. The day is open, but make sure you don’t let the money burn a hole in your pocket.

, Buy yourself a cake, or make one yourself. If you make one yourself, consider making it the night before. After all, you don't want to work too hard on your birthday.


If you make your own cake, go for the guilty pleasure and eat the leftover frosting with a spoon. You deserve it!

, Your birthday is good time to reflect on your life. Think about where you’ve been, where you are, and where you are going. Write down how you are feeling in your journal, along with any other things on your mind.


Think back over your day.. Pick out three extra fun and enjoyable moments.Write these moments down as a memento. You can look back on this entry when your next birthday approaches to get ready to have an even better time.
Write down your goals. Writing down the goals you’ve achieved and the goals that are still in front of you give you a good metric to measure your progress each year.
Other things you can reflect on are your recent successes, your dreams, and any feelings you may have that you haven’t been able to express otherwise. "

Choose a site in nature.,
Throwing a party at a restaurant is another common way that we choose to celebrate our birthdays.,
Decide on the place at least 20 days before your birthday event, so that you get enough time for other preparations.

,
Avoid party halls.,
Many restaurants have such arrangements where you can enjoy the nature too, along with your celebration.

,
Although you will go at a perfect natural destination, celebrating at a party hall won't give you the different experience that you want to have.,
Decide on the right time.,
Decide whom to invite.,
Inviting someone just for the sake of formality doesn't work.,
Create a card.,
Set up a daytime party.,
Set up a nighttime party.,
Choose a different dish.,
Make sure that you have something sweet and delicious to serve.,
If you have decided to have some games for fun, then don't plan a heavy dish.,
Add a cake and candles.,
Do a good deed.,
If you have an environment-friendly nature, then plant trees and help save the environment.

,
Remember that happiness increases when you make others happy!

",How to Have a Memorable Birthday," For making your birthday a memorable one, you need to do something different. Start with a perfect place where you can celebrate! Try choosing a beautiful hill station, or a station by the side of the waterfalls, which will completely change and cheer up your mood, and a place where you can enjoy the eternal beauty of nature. By celebrating your birthday there, you will get the completely awesome experience that you want to have!;
, Thus, we get the same experience. By having a change in the way of celebration, you get a different experience and perhaps a memorable one!

,, Maybe you have decided on the place (say a hill station) and you are celebrating there at a restaurant. Don't celebrate there in the party hall! Choose a place from where you can see the picturesque scenes of nature. Remember that fun and enjoyment, in your unique celebration, is linked with nature, so make sure you aren't celebrating away from it.

,, Keep this in mind when deciding on a destination.

, If you like to celebrate at night, you may go with that. Usually, people like to celebrate their birthday at night, but if you want to have something different, go with a party in the daytime.

, Usually, we prefer to invite our friends and family. In order to have a good and quality time with everybody, choose to invite only the people who can make you happy and comfortable.

, The only person who is concerned about your birthday is you, so invite only those whom you really want to have with you on your birthday. Inviting people unwillingly will just spoil your mood and you won't be able to enjoy anything.

, By using a card rather than inviting people via the phone or email, you can have beautifully illustrated cards that will entice people to join you in your celebration.

, Since you are celebrating at a natural destination, you don't need much decoration. Your background should already be full of beauties of nature! If you want to give off a birthday feeling, you can use balloons of your favorite colors, but don't just stick them anywhere. You can just fly them in the sky (use balloons that fly high in the sky). You will really enjoy it, and your party guests will also love the scenes and will ultimately enjoy it.

, You can use beautiful night lamps, lanterns, or balloons that light up. Again, don't stick them in the sky; let them fly in the sky and enjoy the lovely scene!

, Choose a dish that is new, and something that everybody will love to have. You can have a wide variety of dishes and delicacies!

, For example, you can have the yummy and delicious Italian Gelato that will add sweetness to everything!

, If you do, nobody will want to play the games after having food. In that case, you can have light snacks.

, A birthday is incomplete without cake and candles! Have a printed cake that would attract everybody's attention to the cake. Have a flavor that everybody will certainly enjoy. Have different candles that will probably catch everybody's attention.

, Try distributing your old toys and clothes among the children of an orphanage, or any other random act of kindness. By doing this, you will really get that satisfaction and peace that one gets after doing an act like this.

Change cell phone settings.,
Install a Blue Screen of Death screensaver on a Windows computer.,
Tape a piece of paper over the bottom of an optical mouse.,
Set the clocks back an hour.,
Wrap household remotes in duct tape.",How to Play an April Fool's Day Prank on Your Family2," Changing the settings on someone's cellphone can be an excellent prank. You'll have to wait until someone leaves their phone out, and take the opportunity to alter the settings. If you know where a family keeps his or her phone at night, you may be able to pull this prank then. You can also quickly grab a cell phone that's been left out on the table. You'll have to work fast in order to make the changes before your family member notices.Change the phone's language settings. You can change the default language to French or Spanish, so the cellphone user won't know how to read his or her phone.
Find a contact that the user hears from frequently, like a girlfriend or friend. Change that contact's name to ""Low Battery.""

, The Blue Screen of Death is the colloquial term for an error message that appears on Windows devices indicating the computer is seriously malfunctioning. Online, you can find websites that allow you to download a screensaver that shows up as the blue screen error message.Wait until no one is near the computer. You may have to get up early, or stay up late, to do so. Once the computer is unoccupied, download the screensaver. Follow the instructions to download on the website.
It's a good idea to fix it so that the blue screen screensaver is the first thing a parent or family member sees in the morning. Therefore, you may want to get up early and turn the computer on. Then, leave it alone until the screensaver appears. Walk away, and wait for the first unsuspecting computer user to panic.

, If your family computer has an optical mouse, there will be a small red light on the bottom. This is a light source that detects movement, allowing you to move the cursor. Taping a piece of paper over this light will prevent the mouse from working, frustrating a family member.Wait until the computer is unoccupied to pull this prank. It does not take a lot of time, but you want to work fast to avoid getting caught. You can also get up before anyone is awake to pull this prank.
Any kind of paper works, whether it's from a notebook or a post-it note. You only need to rip off a piece big enough to cover the red light on the bottom of the mouse.
Tape this piece of paper to the bottom of the mouse. You may want to write something like, ""April fools!"" on the paper, so when your trick is discovered the family member will know they've been pranked.

, You can try messing with the clocks in your house. If you set them back an hour, your family members will be scrambling to get to work or school only to realize they're an hour early. You'll have to get up in the middle of the night and move from clock to clock. This prank is best to play on older relatives, as younger people may primarily rely on their cellphones to tell time. The time on a cellphone is generally connected to a cellphone tower, and cannot be set manually.Set an alarm to get you up in the middle of the night. When it goes off, get up and get to work.
Move from room to room, setting the clocks back an hour. Target clocks on the wall, digital clocks, and clocks on ovens and microwaves.
You may have to reach a clock in your parents' room. Be very careful here. You'll have to open the door slowly, as not to be overheard, and tiptoe through the room to the clock. It may be a good idea to do a test run earlier in the week. While your parents are out, sneak into their room and examine the clock and figure out how to change its settings. You'll need to work fast when you're actually playing the prank, as stumbling with the clock too much can wake your parents.

, While this prank is not subtle, it is annoying. You can place a heavy amount of duct tape over the remotes in your home, rendering them temporarily useless. When a family member wants to watch TV in the morning, they'll have to take the time to remove all the duct tape.


As with many pranks, it's best to do this early in the morning or late at night. Find a time to work when no one is awake.
Take a large roll of duct tape. Wrap the tape around TV remotes, DVD remotes, remotes to stereos, and basically any remote you can find. Wrap the remotes in several layers, so the duct tape will be hard to remove.
Leave the remotes where they usually are. When your family members wake up, they'll be irritated to discover they can't use the remotes.
Keep in mind you may get in trouble for this. If your family doesn't have a great sense of humor, you may end up having to remove the duct tape yourself. Only use this prank if you think your family would laugh it off rather than respond with anger.

Put Vaseline on the toilet seat.,
Cover the toilet bowl in plastic wrap.,
Paint soap with clear nail polish.,
Fill the toothpaste container with mustard.",How to Play an April Fool's Day Prank on Your Family3," Vaseline is a clear substance and a very sticky one. If you lather the toilet seat in Vaseline, it will be hard to see. If you can't find Vaseline, petroleum jelly will also work here. An unsuspecting family member will sit down to use the bathroom and get an unpleasant surprise.


Check to see if there's Vaseline in your family's bathroom. If not, you can purchase some at a drug store before April Fool's Day.
It's a good idea to pull this prank at night so a family member will fall for it early in the morning. If someone is half-asleep and using the bathroom, they're less likely to notice the vaseline. Set your alarm to go off late at night, when no one will be awake, and then set up the prank.
Use gloves while handling vaseline, as it's very sticky, and you also probably do not want to touch the toilet seat with bare hands. Spread some vaseline over the toilet seat. Go for a thin layer of vaseline, as this will be less noticeable, and try to even out any bumps or lumps.
When you're finished, dispose of any evidence. Place the vaseline back where you found it. If you bought it for the prank, hide it. Throw out the gloves you used. Then, leave the bathroom as you found it.
Vaseline can be very slippery. Do not pull this prank on young children or the elderly, as it may cause them to slip and fall.
Be careful not to sit on this yourself!

, Another fun prank involves covering the toilet seat in plastic wrap. If you have a lot of male family members, this can be particularly fun. Male family members will try to pee in the morning, only to have urine squirt back upward off the plastic wrap.


Get up before anyone else is awake. Take some plastic wrap from the kitchen. You also probably want to use gloves to avoid touching the toilet bowl with your bare hands.
Lift up the lid of the toilet seat. Place the plastic wrap over the toilet bowl. Try to make sure the plastic wrap does not crinkle, as this will make its presence more noticeable.
When you're done, put the lid down. Put the plastic wrap away, and dispose of your gloves. Leave the bathroom as it was before.

, A bar of soap that produces no suds is a great prank to play on a family member. You'll need a bottle of clear nail polish, which you can purchase at most grocery stores and drug stores, as well as a bar of soap. Go for the type of soap your family uses.The day before April Fool's Day, take a bar of soap from the bathroom. Go to your room, or a private place in the house, and prepare the prank.
Paint the soap in a thin layer of clear nail polish. Paint slowly and use smooth strokes. Uneven layers may make the soap look suspicious. When you're done painting, set the soap aside to dry.
Once the soap is completely dry, put it back in the bathroom. In the morning, a family member will go to use the soap only to find it does not produce suds.

, Empty out a container of toothpaste in your family's bathroom. Then, refill the container with mustard. Your family member will be annoyed when they try to brush their teeth in the morning only to find their toothbrush coated in mustard.You should do this prank early in the morning or late at night, to make sure no one catches you. You should also be sure to dispose of the evidence. You should empty the toothpaste into a plastic bag and then throw that bag away when you're done.
Keep in mind, if your family is on a tight budget, this may be more annoying than funny. You may end up having to pay for a new bottle of toothpaste. You should only play this prank if you believe your family members will take it well.
It can also be fun to choose a liquid similar in color to toothpaste, like mayonnaise. This way, your family member may not notice anything until they try to brush their teeth with mayo.

Decide on the basics.,
Pick your attendees.,
Come up with a few things to do.,
Stock up on food and drink.",How to Have a Nice Birthday Party2," You'll need a place, time, number of guests and duration for starters. Consult your parents on what they're willing to put up with and think is a manageable idea. Start with a venue and work from there.


Home isn't your only option (though it may be your best). If you have a gathering at a restaurant, all the work is done for you -- just make sure everyone can eat there!

, Your parents may give you a ballpark figure as to how many is acceptable. Too many and you won't be able to pay attention to everyone -- too few and it may not feel like a party.


Once you've narrowed down your list, let everybody know -- but do it politely. Don't go around school inviting some and ignoring others -- that's just rude. Make phone calls to contact everyone if you can.







, Though the party may take its own course that you cannot foresee (which can be a good thing), you'll want to have some basic things planned.


Have cards or games ready. Limit it to games that everyone can play. 2 player games or games that require an immense amount of skill are not ideal.
Prepare a few movies that are recent and popular. If nothing else, you can have it on in the background while everyone is chatting.

, Party is code for ""come hungry,"" so be sure to cover all your food and drink bases. Examples are cake, soda, and finger foods.


You might want a healthy alternative, too -- and that includes drinks. Get some grapes or other poppable fruit and have water ready, too.






Don't forget the cutlery and dishware! Your parents may not be thrilled if you have to bust out the fine china to find another clean plate.







"
"
Make plans in advance.,
Pick your destination.,
Get adequate supplies of food and drink.,
Cover your bases.",How to Have a Nice Birthday Party3," Everyone these days has a busy schedule and work is generally less than accommodating. Take a look at your own schedule and ask around what time works best for most people. If a few people can't make it, that may be inevitable.


Once you make your plans, try to notify everyone as soon as possible. That way, they'll have more notice and either be able to rearrange things or ink you down on their calendars for that time.

, Now that you're not relying on a ride or the supervisory ""okay,"" the world is your oyster. Take your party to a restaurant or bar or any entertainment establishment to take the impending mess off your shoulders.


If you do decide to not do it at home, consider your guests. Your place of choice has be within everyone's budget and belief system. Some people may not be keen on gambling at the casino or spending a day at the spa. Be considerate of everyone, even though it is your day.

, That is, if you've opted for the home route. Some people can be human garbage disposals, so it's better to be safe than sorry. Grab food and drinks that will sate any appetite to ensure party success.


Have different kinds of alcohol -- not everyone likes to drink beer or shoot tequila. But if people are driving (which they probably are), try to keep this to a minimum or designate a driver. Keep the teas, juices, and sodas cold, too.
Have foods for different dietary constraints. Nowadays, someone in every group is either allergic to gluten, dairy, or vegetarian. If you're not sure of your friends' dietary constraints, inquire.
There is nothing shameful about ordering pizza.

, Adults are pretty good at coming up with things to do, but you may want to have a few back ups. Have a party playlist set up on your iPod. Grab a few movies to play in the background. The party will go where the guests take it, but it's a good idea to get it started.


You may want an activity prepared while guests slowly trickle in. Hook up your Wii, grab a deck of cards, or have do-it-yourself drinks as an appetizer. Margarita slushie, anyone?

Visit your family.,
Go on a date.",How to Have a Great Birthday2," Get out of the house and take a trip somewhere to have some fun. You don’t have to have a particular destination in mind. Rambling helps clear your mind and get your thoughts in order.


Hit the road. Take a drive to the far corners of your town or beyond. Travel along the back roads to observe buildings, structures and landmarks you never would have seen otherwise. Jot down any places you might want to revisit in the future. Road trips also offer a chance to visit locations related to your family history. Go to the beach. Beaches offer everything you could want out of a great day – sun, surf and the warm beach sand. Even if the weather is on the colder side, a walk along the beach gives you a great place to think.
Find a trail to hike. Much like the beach, hiking offers a great place to collect your thoughts. Nature and other green space is also healthy for the mind and body. , Get your friends together for a fun activity that doesn’t necessarily result in drunken revelry. A fun night out bowling or playing skee-ball is something that anyone can enjoy, while still providing the option for drinks if desired. You can also hit up a specialty restaurant that you’ve always wanted to try.


There are a variety of leagues dedicated to casual games such as skee-ball or kickball that can provide a perfect new opportunity for your birthday. You might even decide to make a habit of playing! , Gather up some friends and hit up the bars for a classic birthday celebration. If you’re looking for a quieter experience, head to some smaller dive bars, or take the night on solo.


Let people know it’s your birthday! It’s a great way of scoring some free drinks.
Make sure you have safe transportation to get home. Take a taxi service or public transportation such as the bus or metro if you have been drinking a little too much.
Some taxi services offer special rates for birthdays or other events. Make sure to call ahead of time.

, Travel to a local vineyard with some friends to sit back, sip some wine, and celebrate your birthday with an air of sophistication.


Research common wine tasting techniques prior to visiting to get the most out of your wine experience. There are techniques dedicated to maximizing the taste, aroma and even atmosphere of your wine. Areas particularly well known for wine offer wine tours, a guided educational (and delicious) tour through all of the area’s vineyards. Such tours can accommodate groups as well – a great opportunity if your friends are wine lovers. , Birthdays are a perfect excuse to take part in these thrill-seeking activities. Even better, many sky diving or bungee jumping groups offer a discount if you come in on your birthday.


Make sure someone takes pictures of the occasion. Who knows when you’ll next jump out of a plane that’s 12,500 feet in the air?
Plan to spend the whole day skydiving. There are several safety measures to take into account, including weather concerns and a pre-jump class, before you get into the air. , Take a spontaneous trip to see some of your family members and see if they want to go out for a bite to eat. We usually settle for a phone call or a birthday card from our family members, but a visit can show them how much you care.


If your family lives far away, arrange for a gathering of the whole family. Plan ahead to make sure everyone can take the time they need to travel.

, Arrange to spend your big day with that special someone in your life. You can try out a few of the other activities featured on this list, but limit it to your partner for a more intimate experience.


There are plenty of ideas for toeing the fine line between birthday bash and romantic date. For example, go on a picnic and follow it up with a brewery tour. "

Throw that party.",How to Have a Great Birthday3," Start planning about 2 to 3 weeks before your birthday. Send out invitations early and through multiple media channels, such as Facebook, text and phone messages.


Create a Facebook page or website about the party. Add those you’ve invited to the page in order to create a hub of information that can keep everyone up to date on the latest information on the party. , Figure out where the party is taking place and how many people can comfortably fit into the venue. Prioritize your family and close friends to make sure your party is full of people you enjoy being around.Create a cutoff date. When inviting a large amount of people, place a cutoff date for accepting the invitation, or on the number of attendees allowed to the party, to make sure you don’t end up with far more guests than you can handle. If the cutoff date is well before the actual date of the party, you can open the invitations to additional guests to account for those who failed to RSVP.
Account for those who can’t make it. If you are planning a large party, allow for guests to invite one friend, or invite more people than you think you can actually handle. This is helpful if your party is less formal and you aren’t sending RSVPs.
If you are concerned about guests bringing friends that you aren’t comfortable with, place a caveat on the invitation regarding plus ones. For example, you might require guests to ask if they would like to bring a plus one, allowing you to screen your guests carefully.

, Your family and friends are bound to be leaving you messages about your impending birthday, with some suggesting they hold a party for you. Let them know early that you will be holding your own, so that a surprise birthday party doesn’t go to waste!

, Choose a time and place that is as convenient for the largest number of people as possible. Take into consideration whether your friends have obligations, such as kids or projects, and whether there will be plenty of alcohol.


Celebrate on a more convenient day than the actual day of your birthday if it happens to fall on a holiday or work day.
If you don’t plan on going to a restaurant or bar for your birthday, and you don’t think you have the space to hold it at your house, ask a friend if they can help with hosting duties.

, Food, drinks and decorations will need to be taken care of prior to the big day. Assign some work to friends or family to help pull everything together.Create some space. Move tables, chairs, and other furniture in order to create enough space for the expected number of guests. Avoid blocking off exits or creating dangerous obstacles when arranging the party space.
Have guests bring food and drink. You can make planning much easier if guests are required to bring food and drink to the party. Set up the music. Create a party playlist according to the ambience of the evening. Preset playlists are available on many music streaming programs, including Spotify and Apple Music. Some popular music stations also list their playlists for you to mix and match. , Have a great time! Remember to stay safe and minimize the risks for you and your guests.


Serve water and other snacks if you plan on serving alcoholic drinks. Drinking on an empty stomach increases the rate at which alcohol is absorbed into the blood stream.
If someone is getting too rowdy or a tensions get heated, take them to the side and let them know they need to either calm down or leave.
Keep your valuables secure and in other rooms, away from the party.Be mindful of your neighbors. You wouldn’t want your party to end early because you’re making too large a ruckus.

First of all, you must get permission!,
Before you do any other planning, decide on the details that need sorting first.,
Decide who you want to invite.,
Think of what to do at your party!,
Tea!,
Opening your presents when your friends are there and can see how pleased you are with them shows how much you appreciate the effort they made.",How to Have a Fantastic Birthday Party," Ask your parent(s) if you can have a party to celebrate your birthday. Ask politely instead of demanding to get one organized! If it's a yes, then get planning!;
, Where will you have the party? Date? Time? Some ideas on where to have your party are your house, local Pizza Hut/McDonalds, etc or you could have a day shopping. If you are having the party after school, have it at something like 6.00pm to 9.00pm. That's 3 whole hours, plus you have time to get ready as soon as you get home. If you are having it at the weekend, that's good too. A date must be confirmed before sending out the invitations.

, Only invite people that are nice and friendly to you, and who won't make you feel miserable on the night. Friends can be temperamental, so invite your best ones. Hand-make the invitations for a look that shows you've made a real effort, or design them on the computer. Include the date, time, where it is and a phone number, just in case, plus any other information that is necessary. Hand them out at school rather then an email as you have a better source of info if you have details written down in front of you.

, Consider the ages of you and your party guests while doing it, too. How about some fun games? Strictly come worst dancing is a fun game in which the pair who do the worst or funniest dance wins. Or musical statues? Pass the parcel? You can also dance and just chat to even it out a bit.

, Make sure you supply a totally yummy tea for your guests. Sandwiches, Sausage rolls, Pizza, Chips, Hot dogs, Dips, Fairy cakes, Drinks and anything else you like is good. Either sit around your dining room table or make a buffet in the living room for people to go to and choose their foods. Make sure there are enough chairs.

, Remember to say thank you for everything (even if you don't like it much!), including the cards!

Become withdrawn, quiet and defensive.,
Show a lack of interest in all of your hobbies.,
Develop sudden and violent verbal outbursts.,
Keep a blank, exhausted look on your face.,
Leave incriminating books and images lying around.,
Do unnerving things in public.",How to Act Like You're Possessed1," One of the most tell-tale signs of demonic possession is a sudden change in personality.

A usually happy and social person might become quiet and withdrawn, followed by negativity and hostility. Be very quiet and only speak when you are spoken to.

Reply in a monotone, emotionless voice and act defensively when you are asked any questions about your behavior.
You can also mimic people in a sarcastic voice when they talk to you, repeating whatever they say in an eerie tone before abruptly walking away.;
, Appear listless at all times and don't visibly enjoy anything. When asked your opinion or when friends and family try to otherwise draw you into a conversation, respond with a sullen “I don't care” and stare off into the distance.

,

Make angry, unexpected comments in the midst of a casual conversation or a quiet dinner. Have explosive, violent reactions to benign, random things. Make it seem like these comments and reactions are happening without your control.

Look disoriented and confused after a sudden outburst.It should be over almost as quickly as it began, leaving everyone around you feeling jolted and confused.
Project your voice loudly, give it a sharp edge, and speak more quickly than you normally would during these verbal outbursts.
Twitch a bit, like you’re experiencing muscle spasms.

, Walk around in a sort of fugue state, almost like you’re sleepwalking. Look exhausted and completely without energy, as though you haven’t been sleeping well or eating enough.]

When someone does stop you or tries to get your attention, narrow your eyes a bit and stare at them wordlessly before returning to your blank, empty facial expression.
Don’t overdo it. You want to look exhausted and even a little bored. If you’re too dramatic, it won’t be believable.

, Place books about the occult and drawings of strange symbols in places where people will see them.Be seen tracing over a symbol on a piece of paper over and over again, as though you’re in a trance, until your pen tears through the paper. Look perplexed by this.


Keep these incidents to a minimum – maybe one or two instances. If your room is suddenly littered with crystals, tarot cards, and other occult tools, it won’t be quite as believable.
Such incidents will plant the idea in the minds of your friends and family that something very sinister is going on with you, but it won’t be so over the top that it reveals your ruse.

, Sit in a chair facing the wall and laugh hysterically to yourself. Be seen having furtive conversations with no one in dark corners. Rock back and forth catatonically while repeating a phrase under your breath. Hiss at people suddenly as you walk by them.


This is another area in which you don’t want to overdo it to be believable. Start with an isolated incident and have them grow more frequent and weirder as time goes by.
You also want to avoid being too dramatic with these incidents because it might get you into trouble at school or work. This takes all the fun out of your prank.

Apply a pale concealer to your face, neck, and lips.Choose a concealer that is at least a few shades lighter than your natural skin tone.,
Apply matte brown, gray or purple eyeshadow under your eyes.Use an eyeshadow brush to apply matte brown and purple eye shadow beneath your eyes to make them look hollow and sunken in.,
Contour your cheekbones.Dust a brown or gray matte eyeshadow beneath your cheekbones in a straight line.,
Color your eyes, cheeks and nose with red makeup.,
Define and deepen your facial lines.Using a small angle brush, apply matte brown (or gray) eyeshadow to the lines and creases in your face.,
Draw veins on your cheeks and forehead.,
Dust your face lightly with a sheer or white powder.,
Make your lips look dry and cracked.,
Make your hair look greasy and stringy.,
Darken your fingernails and fingertips to look dirty.Pat black eyeshadow under your fingernails and around your nail beds.",How to Act Like You're Possessed2," Make sure to apply the makeup evenly to create the right pallor. You can also add a white face cream or powder — the kind sold at Halloween — over the concealer to lighten it up even more.


To make your skin tone look more even and convincingly pale, apply the concealer/white makeup to your chest, hands and any other skin that’s showing.
Lightly dust all of the areas where you’ve applied the white makeup with a translucent powder. This will “set” the makeup and make it last longer.

, Add a little bit of gray eyeshadow beneath your eyes to give the look dimension.


For a slightly more extreme look, apply the eyeshadow to the inner corners of your eyes, your eyelids and creases of your eyes.
Apply a very small amount of black eyeshadow to the inner corners of your eyes, in addition to the purples, browns and grays, for an extremely dramatic look., This will give your face a gaunt, malnourished look. Blend the makeup well.


The goal is to look very unhealthy, but not to look like you’re wearing any makeup to achieve that look.
The contour line you create should begin at your hairline at the top of your cheeks and follow the cheekbone down, stopping about 1 inch from your mouth on each side.

, Apply a pink, maroon or red lip stain or eyeshadow to your eyelids, the inner corners of your eyes, and beneath your eyes. Add a little of the red color to the tip of your nose. Use a red lipliner pencil to redden your lower waterline (the inner edge of your lower eyelid, above your lashes), which will make you look sickly and exhausted.


Blend the red makeup on your face well so that it looks a little more natural. You don’t want it to look too obvious that you’ve applied makeup.
Once you’ve applied the red lipliner to your waterline, use the end of a Q-tip to smudge it slightly. This will blend it a bit and give it a more natural appearance.

, Focus particularly on the lines that run from the sides of your nose to the sides of your mouth and the lines that run down from the ends of your mouth when you frown.


Don’t forget to darken the lines that appear between your eyebrows when you push them together, as well as the lines that appear on your forehead when you raise your eyebrows as high as you can.
Defining and deepening your facial lines with dark makeup will make you look haggard, exhausted and angry.Apply it so that the makeup doesn’t look too dark or obvious.

, Use small angle brush and blue or green eyeshadow to lightly draw veins on your cheeks and forehead. For a creepy flair, let your hand wobble a bit as you draw the veins in.


If you want the color to really pop, wet the angle brush slightly before dipping it in the eyeshadow.
Blue or green gel eyeliner or cream eyeshadow are also great options to draw the veins.

, This will make your newly drawn “veins” look like they’re sitting beneath your skin. The powder will also help set the rest of your makeup and remove any shine from your face.Use a large, fluffy powder puff or blush brush to apply the powder to ensure you get a very light, even dusting.

, Pucker your lips and fill in the lines with a dark eyeshadow or eyeliner pencil. Apply some pink/red/maroon eyeshadow to the inner edge of your lips. This will enhance the dehydrated look of your lips, and it will also make the inside of your mouth look a bit bloody and mottled.

, Spritz your hair with water/hairspray and/or gel, and work it into sections with your fingers so that your hair looks messy and hangs down in your face. Wear your hair as long and messy as possible.


If you can go a few days without washing it, this will definitely help further the illusion.

, Drag the eyeshadow down your fingers so that the “dirt” is heaviest at the fingernail and gets lighter as it moves down your finger.


Paint a small amount of reddish brown liquid lipstick around a few of your cuticles for a slightly bloody look.

Wake up screaming.Frequent nightmares are another common sign of demonic possession, so pretend to have them fairly consistently.,
Practice yoga, strength and flexibility training.,
Act catatonic and go long periods without blinking.,
Practice rolling your eyes so that only the whites show.,
Rehearse extreme facial contortions and pained expressions.,
Learn a new language or a few Latin phrases.,
Develop a creepy voice.",How to Act Like You're Possessed3," Scream unintelligibly and thrash around so that you’ll look unkempt and sweaty when someone inevitably comes to check on you. Open your eyes as wide as you can and make sure your facial expression shows that you are terrified.


When asked about the nature of your nightmares, get upset and shake your head hysterically, as though you can’t even fathom verbalizing what you’ve seen.
The most effective time to do this is between midnight and around 2am. Others in the house won’t be deeply asleep yet, so they will be easier to wake and more on edge when they do.

, Possessed people are often depicted in popular cinema as being able to contort their bodies.It is also common for them to display superhuman strength. You can increase your strength and flexibility through yoga, light stretching and weight training.


Arrange yourself in contorted looking positions after your “nightmares."" Maintain a completely straight face.
To prevent injury, stretch your muscles out in private before attempting a contortion incident.
Keep your contortions simple. It won’t take much on your part to unnerve the person that witnesses this.

,

When others attempt to talk to you or move you, remain silent, keep your body rigid and your eyes unfocused. Make it difficult for anyone to physically move you while you’re “catatonic.” Pretend to black out.

Once you snap out of it, act as though nothing happened. Argue defensively with anyone who wants to talk about it.
Show signs of memory loss around others, and hint that you’ve been losing stretches of time.

, Keep your head facing forward, then look up as far as you can using only your eyes — don’t move your head. Move your eyes upward until you can’t move them any further, then lower your eyelids slightly to hide whatever is left of your iris.


Make sure you aren’t completely closing your eyes when you do this. Practice getting it right with the camera on your phone. Take video and stills.
Some people find it helpful to close their eyes first. Close your eyes, look up at the ceiling (with your eyes still closed), then open your eyes while still looking upward.

, Exorcists say that possessed people often contort their faces in extreme, frightening ways. Their facial expressions also communicate that they are in pain. Sit in front of a mirror and practice contorted and pained facial expressions.Once you get a few choice facial expressions down, use them after your “nightmares” and other weird incidents that you’ve staged.
If possible, use props to enhance your contortions and expressions.
The classic vomiting scene in The Exorcist movie is widely recognized, so it would be pretty hilarious to incorporate some thick pea soup into one of your incidents.

, In horror movies, possessed people often speak in Latin, but any foreign language will probably disturb your friends and family if you suddenly start speaking it. If you don't have time to learn a new language, simply learn a few Latin phrases.


A common phrase the possessed use in horror movies is “Legio mihi nomen est, quia multi sumus” which means “I am Legion, for we are many.”Even saying this in English will probably be extremely scary to others.
Be cautious about foreign languages if your loved ones study them. You don't want your sister announcing that your Latin has a very poor accent, with bad grammar.
Another option is simply incoherent babbling. If you go this route, try to make it sound like you are speaking another language but inserting pauses and using inflection on some of your “words”.

, In film, when a demon speaks through the possessed person, its voice is often very low, sinister and a bit raspy. Play around with your voice to see what sorts of strange and frightening sounds you can make. Check out a few online instructional videos to increase your vocal range — particularly moving into deeper registers.


Record yourself speaking in your creepy voice with your phone. Use an app to make your voice sound deeper and scarier, then play the recording late at night or when you’re around other people.
Incorporate other vocalizations like wheezing, hissing, growling, and screaming. Use these sounds in between sentences or words.

Check your employee handbook for rules on pranks.,
Keep your pranks reasonable.,
Select the right targets.,
Choose the right time, place, and situation.,
Render a coworker's mouse temporarily inoperable.,

Have a fake newspaper printed up and leave it in the office.,
Leave a doughnut box full of vegetables in the break room.,
Mess with the office printer and/or copy machine.",How to Play Office April Fool's Day Pranks," Before you pull any pranks, it's a good idea to make sure that your office doesn't strictly prohibit or restrict pranks in the workplace. Then double check the rules to make sure that your prank wouldn't constitute any kind of dismissible or reprimandable offense.Make sure your pranks would not be considered harassment (including sexual harassment).
If you're unclear on the rules or unsure about whether a prank would be allowed in the workplace, it's best to talk to your supervisor to get permission first. Describe the types of pranks you're planning and see what he or she says.;
, When you devise a prank to play on a coworker, it's important to choose pranks that you wouldn't mind receiving. Think of it as treating others the way you want to be treated, since your coworkers will most likely retaliate.If you're going to dish out pranks, you'll need to anticipate pranks in return.
A good gauge is to ask yourself, ""Would I be upset at all if someone did this to me?"" (And someone almost certainly will.)
Think about any possible repercussions that might arise from your prank.Avoid any pranks involving race, religion, or sex. You should also generally avoid any pranks that might make someone uncomfortable.

, It's always important to make sure you pull pranks on the right people - someone you know well, someone whose sense of humor you know well, or a regular office prankster. In really serious cases, a prank could even get you in trouble, so it's important to be aware of whom you play pranks on and how intense they get.Do not play a prank on anyone you've had tension or feuds with in the past, as a prank may set that individual off.
Avoid pranking your boss unless you know him or her extraordinarily well and can pull off a prank that won't challenge his/her authority. Without some type of close, personal relationship with your boss, your pranks could land you in hot water.Don't prank anyone who is considered vulnerable or easily upset. This could create a very negative situation at your office and may result in you being reprimanded.

, Most people will find pranks to be in good fun. If you pull a prank at the wrong place/time or in the wrong situation, though, you could end up getting into serious trouble (and possibly even losing your job).If your pranks disrupt work productivity in any way, or if they unfold in front of an important person (like the CEO or a prospective business partner), your prank may get you fired.
Remember that your pranks are not being played on your friends at home. Your office friends may have a different sense of humor and different boundaries, so be respectful of where and when you pull off a prank., This simple prank is easy to pull off and will leave your coworker scratching his or her head. You may want to write ""April Fools"" on the paper you attach to the bottom so your coworker recognizes it was a prank once he or she notices the paper.Put a Post-It note on the underside of a coworker's computer mouse.
Trim the sides so that the paper isn't sticking out. The goal is for your coworker to not realize that the mouse's laser track is just covered up.
Watch as your coworker tries and fails to get his or her mouse to work.

, This prank works best with a coworker you know fairly well. It will also have to be someone who doesn't use a password to lock his/her computer, but make sure you don't mess with any computers that contain office-sensitive material. It's best to stay clear of going onto someone's computer in HR or accounting, for example.You can make the desktop background a photo of the wall behind that computer.
You can also use a photo of your face, or of something that will get a laugh (like your coworker's face edited into a ridiculous photo).Make sure the photograph(s) you use won't upset anyone. Don't use anything sexually suggestive or racially/ethnically offensive.

, Prank calls are a classic way to mess with someone. Just make sure that any prank calls you make or arrange for someone else to make are work-appropriate. Don't be offensive or threatening in the prank call, just say weird things that don't make any sense and try to (playfully) frustrate your coworker.You can make your prank calls even more convincing by using an unrecognizable voice and phone number.
Have a friend (whose voice won't be recognized) make the call for you from a blocked phone number.
You can also try using a service like Prank Me or similar services. Prank Me charges 99 cents (USD) for a blocked phone number and your choice of pre-recorded responses.Have the person prank calling your coworker complain about something work related.
You might even have the person tell your coworker that your supervisor wants to see him/her. However, make sure your supervisor is in on the fun; otherwise you might end up getting in trouble for wasting everyone's time.

, Sabotaging someone's office is a great prank. As long as the sabotage doesn't require a lengthy or difficult clean up, it will probably be a big hit around the office.


You can fill an office with packing peanuts, since many offices have these on hand.You can also fill an office with balloons. Just make sure you bring an air pump so you don't have to blow them all up by mouth.Try wrapping a coworker's office (both furniture and equipment) in tin foil or newspaper, or covering the office in Post-It notes. They're easy to remove but will still get a laugh., The point of this prank is to make someone unable to speak into his or her office phone without realizing the reason why. This is a harmless prank, though some coworkers may find it mildly annoying. Be sure that the person you choose to play this prank on knows you well and gets your sense of humor.Take a picture of the phone's receiver so you know the exact color to look for.
Go to an office supply store and find a roll of tape that matches the phone's color perfectly.
When your coworker is out of the office (either in the morning or during a lunch break), carefully apply pieces of the tape to the part of the receiver where your coworker speaks into the phone.
Make sure the tape doesn't extend past that part of the receiver. If your coworker grabs the phone and feels tape extending all the way around, he or she will realize what happened.
You may want to try to replicate the pattern of holes in that part of the receiver so that your coworker won't notice the tape. Use a black marker and try to recreate the pattern as closely as possible.

, Whoopee cushions have been a staple of pranks for many years, and their use in offices is nothing new.When properly executed, a whoopee cushion prank will leave your coworker who sits on it feeling shocked and embarrassed as the rest of the office looks up in horror.


Inflate the whoopee cushion. You'll need to blow it up by mouth, but make sure it's not so full that the cushion is bulging and noticeable.
It will be fairly obvious that there is a whoopee cushion there if it's left sitting plainly on the chair. Look for a coworker who uses a seat cushion or leaves his/her sweater hanging off the back of the chair.
Place the whoopee cushion either under the seat cushion or against the back of the chair. If using the back of the chair, drape your coworker's sweater over it so that the whoopee cushion will remain hidden.
Make sure the coworker you choose has a good sense of humor. Many people would be embarrassed or even mildly angry to be the victim of this prank, so choose carefully.

, Fake newspapers are a classic way to trick others into believing your lies. You can have a fake newspaper printed up by searching online for websites that offer these services. It might cost you a few dollars in printing/editing or labor fees, but if it works it'll be well worth it.Make sure the fake newspaper isn't offensive or inappropriate for work.
You can also upload photos to your computer and put together a fake office newsletter to email to your coworkers.
Make it look like a local paper, and have a headline somewhere on the front page about the office filing for bankruptcy or laying off most of its staff.
Be sure the joke doesn't go on for too long, as this could start false rumors that could get you in trouble.

, Nothing gets people excited in the break room like coffee and doughnuts. Imagine your coworkers' surprise when they reach for a glazed doughnut only to find broccoli, carrots, and cucumber slices.Get a doughnut box. You can either buy a dozen doughnuts and eat them all at home, or just ask an employee at a doughnut shop for an empty box.
Fill the box with fresh veggies. Make sure they're not damp so that the packaging doesn't get wet; otherwise you might give your prank away.
Leave the box in the break room or kitchen area with a note that reads, ""Free doughnuts today - take one!""

, Office equipment is something that can allow your prank to reach any of your coworkers equally. These pranks are harmless enough that they'll get laughs without causing any actual damage to the office equipment. Just make sure your coworkers would find these pranks funny before you pull them off.


Print out an official-looking memo that says the office equipment has been upgraded to have voice-activated technology. Then watch as coworkers try to talk (and eventually yell) at the printer or copy machine.You can also tape a funny photograph under the cover of a scanner or copy machine. When your coworkers open the lid to use the equipment they'll be in for a humorous surprise."

Since this is the case, you can play an April Fool's Day prank on your friends by unplugging their mouse or keyboard. Have fun watching them try to figure out what the problem might be.


Make sure you don't unplug something other than the mouse or keyboard.
Tell your friend it was a joke before they get too confused.

, Not everyone enjoys the type of humor behind April Fool's Day pranks. Before you play a prank on anyone, you should be confident that they will find it both fun and funny. Playing a prank on someone who doesn't enjoy this type of humor can be mean and cause them to feel hurt or angry.

, April Fool's Day is all about having fun and playing silly pranks. If you are considering playing a prank, make sure that you aren't being mean in doing so. A good prank should make everyone laugh, including the person it's being played on. Always keep your April Fool's Day pranks in an amusing and inclusive spirit to make the holiday fun for everyone.

, There are some times and places that are better than others to play a prank. While there are no hard rules when it comes to playing pranks, there are some obvious situations where playing a prank might be inappropriate. Take a look at some of these examples to learn when it may or may not be okay to do an April Fool's Prank:


Avoid playing a prank during a class or meeting.
Playing a prank on your friends while hanging out together should be fine.
Don't play a prank on someone if you know they are having a bad day.

, Although almost every culture that participates in April Fool's Day enjoys playing pranks, the type of prank varies. If you are traveling abroad during April Fool's Day or want to include some international pranks in your holiday, try using some of these examples:In France, it's tradition to secretly tape a fish on someones back.
It's normal to throw flour on people in Portugal during April Fool's Day.
In Scotland, people will send others on silly errands that don't actually have a point. For example, they will be asked to deliver a letter to someone. The letter simply tells the recipient to have the person deliver it to someone else.

Eliminate events that can be explained by natal planetary connections. Look at remaining events, and see whether they are concentrated when celestial bodies arrive at specific degrees.Those degrees could correspond to your Ascendant and Midheaven, if the positions work out.
Compare recent outer planet (Jupiter through Pluto) transits to recent life events, to see which house appears to influence you."

Acknowledging that it was a bummer and mourning a little bit is important; if you pretend you’re not upset, it can lead to a prolonged bad mood.Eat some ice cream or have a good cry, but then move on! You have some fun to plan.;
, If your birthday didn’t go the way you wanted it to, take matters into your own hands and have a birthday redo. Pick a day coming up (be sure to give ample time for people to plan ahead) and treat yourself to a party. Some tips for a great post-birthday bash:


Invite as many or as little people as you feel comfortable; you control the guest list!
If you’re going out, pick a favorite restaurant you already love or, if you’re feeling adventurous, go to a new place you’ve been wanting to try.
If you’re staying in, buy or make food and decorations to highlight the birthday theme, or consider incorporating a nontraditional theme, like a favorite era or trend, to liven it up further.
Buy or make a cake to make it feel like a real birthday celebration!

, There’s no rule that says you can only accept gifts on your birthday, so go out and treat yourself to some gifts! During your birthday redo, make sure to do things on that day (or week!) that you will enjoy. This won’t fix your bad birthday completely, but treating yourself can help ease the sting in the meantime.


Buy yourself a present you were hoping to get but did not.
Rent a favorite movie and order takeout from your favorite restaurant.
Invite some friends over or have a solo DIY spa day.

, Take a moment to evaluate why you feel like you had a bad birthday: Did you want more attention from someone in particular? Was there an activity you were hoping to do but did not? Do birthdays always make you bummed? Understanding why you feel disappointed in particular will help you to address your bad mood.

, For some people, birthdays are a time when we worry so much about the big day before it happens that we experience the disappointment as though it has already occurred.Leading up to your birthday, consider whether you were:


Focusing on what you were worried would not happen. If you were so worried about what gifts you would or wouldn’t get, or whether or not someone special would call on your birthday, you have worked yourself up so much before your birthday even started. This type of thinking causes so much anxiety about birthday expectations that having any fun is an uphill battle.
Looking forward to what could happen. Rather than worrying about what won’t happen, this type of thinking is much more hopeful about all of the upcoming possibilities. Instead of looking towards the future with anxiety about what might not happen, you were looking forward to your birthday with feelings of excitement and anticipation.

, Birthday expectations, the anticipations for the day that often lead to a disappointing, bad birthday, typically fall into one of the following categories:Expectations of the birthday celebrations themselves. Because many of us expect birthdays to be a big deal, a full day when you are showered with gifts and attention, when this level of hype is not met, the overall feeling for the day is that it was a big letdown. We focus so much on what the birthday should be that we don’t enjoy what it is.
Expectations of where and what our life should be. Birthdays come once a year and are a prime time to reflect on the past year and consider the future. For some, this means coming to terms with the inaccuracy of the timeline of goals we devise for ourselves. These expectations are often harder to deal with, and can definitely sour a birthday.

, Yes, a birthday is a special day, and yes, you deserve to feel warmth and love on your birthday. But nowhere is there a rule that says the entire world must revolve around you on that day. Disappointment is a feeling that is conjured internally, and thus realizing that you are creating your own misery is key to changing how you think about the day., Because disappointment is a feeling that is created internally, isolating the exact emotion causing the disappointment can help you move past the bad mood.Do you feel rejected? Especially since everything is posted on social media, even small rejections, like not many people writing “Happy birthday!” on your wall, can feel intensely hurtful. Try to remember that anyone reaching out in any manner is a wonderful gesture; it’s not a competition for the most postings or likes.
Are you worried about outstanding goals? If expectations of where your life should be are causing your bad mood, reflect on when and why you came up with that goal in the first place. Comparing yourself to others is never a good idea, and maybe the goals you made for yourself when you were younger no longer match what you really want for yourself now.
Are you brooding over one particular person not wishing you well on your birthday? Perhaps an ex or a crush didn’t reach out on your birthday, which can sting. Instead of thinking about the one person who didn’t call, think about those who did. Reread the cards or wall posts you received, and redirect your thinking.

, Rehashing the negatives of the day will not change the situation or the people you feel neglected you on your birthday. Thinking about it will not change what happened, but it will make you feel worse. Instead, redirect your thoughts and focus on something positive.For example:


Think about all that you have accomplished in the past year and beyond. You might not be where you thought you'd be at this time, but you shouldn’t negate the goals you did accomplish. Take a minute to make a list of “wins” for the year!
Make a plan for what you would like to accomplish this year moving forward. Just remember to make your goals reasonable so that you don’t set yourself up for more disappointment next year.
Make a plan to really celebrate someone else's birthday. If a friend or family members’ birthday is coming up, get over your disappointment by helping to ensure that they aren’t disappointed like you were on their special day. It will make you feel better, and it will make them feel loved.

, Maybe as a child you had a week of birthday celebrations culminating in a huge party with a giant cake. That’s great, but it can profoundly affect what you expect for your current birthdays. Instead of expecting a big celebration, next year try not expecting anyone to do anything. This sounds negative, but this will actually mean that anything good that happens will be an unexpected surprise!

, You cannot make your friends and family celebrate your birthday, but you do have control over what the disappointment does to you. Don’t let it consume you, but don’t ignore it either. Acknowledge that you are disappointed, and then move on with your internal dialogue., It is likely that your friends and family don’t realize that you feel you had a bad birthday. Perhaps this is because they feel like they celebrated your birthday appropriately and your expectations were just higher, or perhaps birthdays are not as big of a deal to them. Either way, consider one of these conversation starters:


“So I'm thinking I might schedule a massage since my birthday was last week.” This should let them know that you were hoping for some more treats on your birthday.
“Can you please help me organize a belated outing for my birthday?” There’s nothing wrong with asking for help; in fact, this will not only let them know that your expectations weren’t met, but will also ensure that the activities are exactly what you want to do!
“I know we went out to dinner for my birthday, but I kind of feel like going dancing too. What do you think?” This is a subtle, but non-passive-aggressive, way of indicating that you enjoyed the birthday activities thus far but were also hoping for a little more fun before the day is over.

, Whether you consistently feel bummed about your birthday or this was the first year you had a bad birthday, learn from your experience and let that knowledge influence your entire year. Also try putting it into perspective: Is this birthday disappointment something that you will remember in 6 months? 3 months?Be thankful for all that you have! Happy Birthday!!

Prepare for a restless night.",How to Go to a Birthday Party with Your Infant," Ask for details about the party, and make sure the event will be baby-friendly. Make a decision about attending the party based on this information. Some things to consider:


Will the party be inside or outside? If outside, what will the weather be like? You may decide that your baby is not yet ready to handle an outdoor party in extreme temperatures or very windy weather.
How many people will be there? If the party will be very noisy and crowded, you may want to skip the event. Babies tend to get distressed in large crowds.
Will there be a lot of smoke? If many of the guests will be smoking, you should either skip the party or find a babysitter. You don’t want to expose your infant to smoke.
Will other babies or children be present? You may not feel comfortable being the only person at the party with a child in tow.;
, More experienced parents may be able to give you some advice about bringing your baby along to a party. If these people will be at the same event, that’s even better!

, You’ll need to pack a diaper bag. When you do so, bring more diapers than you think you’ll need – you never know when your baby will decide to make life inconvenient. Make sure you have wet wipes as well, and a towel or blanket to use for a changing surface.


Towels and blankets can do double-duty as coverings if your baby decides to nap at the party.

, If you breastfeed exclusively, consider bringing a blanket to help you feed your baby discreetly. If your infant drinks formula, bring it – along with bottles and nipples.

, Slings can be fantastic because they let you keep your hands free even as you hold your baby close. If your infant is comfortable in a sling, take it along!

, If the party is outside (or someplace with plenty of room), bring your stroller. Your infant can sleep in it if he or she gets tired, and it works as a good, familiar place to set your baby in the unfamiliar environment of a birthday party.

, Be prepared for diaper-related accidents, spitting up, and other miscellaneous infant messiness. Bring a fresh set of clothes for yourself and your infant.


If this will be the first time many people will see your baby, you may want to pick extra special clothes for the occasion, but don’t choose anything to fussy or difficult, as that will make changes unnecessarily complicated.

, Feed the baby and give it a fresh diaper before you leave. This will maximize the odds of your infant being in a pleasant (or sleepy) mood for the birthday party.

, Avoid placing your baby in the center of a large, busy, noisy gathering. Too much talking and noise can overstimulate an infant, which may be upsetting and may lead to difficulty winding down and sleeping later.

, If your infant is very young, it’s important to avoid unnecessary germs. Children, especially, have notoriously dirty hands; try not to let them hold or touch your baby.


If you have to, you can make up excuses. If there are people who you’d rather did not touch your baby, you can tell them that your baby is nervous or sleepy, or simply say that you’re trying to minimize the risk of your infant getting sick.

, If your spouse or partner is with you, take turns holding your baby so that the other person can relax and enjoy the birthday party. Otherwise, a friend or relative can serve this purpose.

, It’s best to isolate yourself in some quiet corner of the party when it’s time to feed your infant. Otherwise, your baby might be too distracted or overstimulated to eat well.

, Babies tend to sleep a lot, so if you are at a party for more than an hour or two, you will probably need to find a place to let yours nap. Possibilities include:


Sleeping in a sling. This has the advantage of keeping your baby next to you and works well as long as the noise of the party does not keep your baby awake.
Sleeping in a stroller. If you brought the stroller, this works as well.
Sleeping in a quiet room. If the party is indoors, you can ask the host whether you can leave your baby to nap in an unused room. Assuming the baby isn’t mobile yet, you can place him or her on a towel in the middle of a large bed, covered by a blanket. Check on your baby often.

, If your baby gets too fussy, it’s best for everyone – you, your baby, and the other party guests – for you to leave. Even if your baby seems content, you should not stay out much past his or her usual bedtime, as this will disrupt the sleep schedule considerably.

, Birthday parties are full of new faces and new sounds, so your infant may be overstimulated and cranky. When you get home, give your baby a warm bath, and apply lotion.


Baby lotions scented with lavender are particularly relaxing and may help your baby sleep.

, You can either be silent, or speak to your baby in a low, soothing voice; alternatively, you can sing a slow, calming lullaby.

, Even if you do these steps, your baby may not sleep peacefully after an experience like a birthday party. He or she may wake frequently at night.

Make a list of your friends and friends that you would like to share your special day with. The people who come are going to be the most meaningful part of your special day. Twenty somethings report that there are 8-10 people who they feel close enough with to share emotional support. Thirty somethings give the number between 5-10, typically. Write down a list of the people who you feel that support from. You may want to let your close friends bring a friend or two. This might make the group more diverse while also keeping it a more intimate and meaningful celebration.;
, Facebook makes it easy to invite a great big group of people to a get together. However, it can be difficult to estimate how many people will truly come. Additionally, being around many acquaintances on your birthday that you do not feel very connected to can end up making you feel more lonely on your birthday.


This is not to say that there can be no acquaintances at your party. Having a few acquaintances there might be good for the group because they are new people. However, be intentional about the acquaintances you invite, and only invite a couple of people you do not know well.

, Do this about four weeks before your event. Tell your friends what day(s) you are thinking of getting a celebration together and ask them if/when they would be free. Ask them what days and times work best for them. Based on who responds and when they are free, you can start to think about what to do. If you want the group to be a little bigger, ask your friends if they would like to bring a friend or two to the outing. Ask them to get back to you when they know whether they will be attending alone or with a friend so you can plan accordingly.

, Talk to a couple of your closest friends. Tell them that you want to have a birthday celebration with your close friends. You can start to brainstorm who would be the best to get together for a celebration. You want to make sure that the group dynamics will mix well, and your friends might have good input for how that can work out.


Consider having two different celebrations for you birthday. You can get brunch with one group of your friends or family in the morning, and go out for dinner and dancing with the other group, for instance.

, How much money will you realistically be asking your friends to contribute to the outing? A celebration can cost as little as ten dollars per person or cost over a hundred dollars per person. So consider the budgets of you and your friends.


Write down a break down of your night and the approximate varied costs. Include transportation costs, ticket costs, drinks and food.
If you and your friends make different amounts of money, ask one of your close friends how much money they think is appropriate to ask your friends to spend.
Your friends are going to make your birthday great. Keeping everyone within their budgets will help everyone focus on your birthday and not their pocket books.

, If you and your friends have enough money to go out, consider doing something fun like going to a spa, going camping, going a concert, going to a destination like Vegas or going to a sports event. These kinds of events are great because they can be very memorable and last for several hours or days. This will keep everyone together and occupied for a good amount of time. These activities can also do a good job of bonding people and entertaining everyone.


Buying your tickets in advance will also simplify matters for planning.
Plan transportation there and home. Designate a couple of drivers and have everyone get together before and after at a central location for food and/or drinks. Pick a nice restaurant or bar to go to before/after the event.
If you have one friend that may not be able to spend the same amount as the rest of the group, consider asking a few friends to pool the money to buy your friends’ ticket to the event.

, If you or your friends have tighter budgets, consider having a house party, barbecuing or picnicking at the park. Choose a friend to DJ the event and put up a few balloons and streamers. It is easy to make a birthday seem well put together if you plan for a few key details.You can still make this birthday feel rich if you make it a potluck or tell everyone to bring their own alcohol.
Bring a Frisbee, ball or card game. Having a simple game is a good idea to pack, even if it doesn't get used by everyone a small group of people might want to play.
You can also find a free music or art show to attend together. Get together before/after at someone’s house. Ask everyone in advance if they can pitch in 10 dollars for pizza and/or inexpensive drinks.

, For example, if you want to do something outside in winter, consider including a bonfire. Or if you are doing something in the summer, think about asking your friend with a pool to have your party at their house. If you can incorporate something season appropriate into your event, it will make it more fun and memorable.

, Ask them if they will post the pictures to social media and tag your friends. Some people get a big kick out of social media. Appeal to these friends by making sure your celebration is being documented.

, These little touches will make it seem more like a birthday party and are inexpensive to add. Ask one of your friends to be in charge of setting up the decorations.Remember that these decorations will be a hassle to pick up but will be totally worth it.

, For example, if you are going to a Beach House concert, have one of your friends make beach themed drinks. Having special little themed things will help make the day feel even more fun and special.


Be careful not to drink too many special drinks on your birthday. It can be easy to drink more when you are excited. Remember, do not drink so much that you cannot engage with everyone and celebrate the day or night fully.

, No birthday is complete without a cake. Or make or buy your favorite sweet treat! Do not forget to buy the candles. Find the right number or fudge it in a creative way. For example, make the 51 shape out of candles.


You can delegate this task to one of your close friends, siblings or parents.
Have someone else put the candles on the cake and bring it out.
Plan on the time of night you want to bring out the cake. You do not want to forget! You also don’t want everyone to forget. So tell everyone what time you will do the cake.

, If there is an instrument around someone can play, bring it out and play it with the song. Have your friend take pictures. Blow out all the candles at the end of the song and make a wish!

, This is a chance to take stock in the course of your life and what you have accomplished and made it through in this past year. Take advantage of this time to reflect with your close friends. Talk also about this upcoming year and what you hope will happen to you by this time next year.

, Make a point to talk to your close friends one on one, at some point in the night. Tell them that you are grateful for their friendship and that you appreciate them celebrating your birthday with you. Let them know that they are what is making this day the most meaningful, and give them a hug!

Think outside the box.,
Think to yourself, ""Where would I hide it?"",
Check her email.,
Look in the trunk of the car that you don't use or if your parents say "" No, I'll put it in the trunk for you"".,
Be prepared for the right time to look around, such as when no one is around.

,
Ask your parent/guardian where you could hide a present for someone, chances are she or he tells you the same place where they hide your presents too.,
Your parents might drop hints as if to tell you what they got.,
If your parents take you to their workplace, look around there because they might be hiding it in their office.

,
Try to look through receipts that are used and see if anything might possibly be for you.

,
Your parents might not have bought it yet so look around.

,
If you can't find any evidence, then they probably haven't bought anything yet.

",How to Find Where Your Parents Hid Your Birthday Present," This won't help you figure out where to find your present, but it will be better. Remember to point out to your parents what you want the most.;
, Try to figure out where you would hide it if you were getting it for someone.

,, If your mom has a way to get in, you can too. Look for a key somewhere, or some means of opening it.

, Look behind shelves, cabinets, drawers, under coats and blankets, and such places like that.

, Minds think alike, especially if they're from the same gene-pool.

, This is considered an invasion of personal space, but look for items from eBay, Amazon, Overstock, etc. The subject might be like ""You've won on eBay"" or ""confirming your order."" The messages should have the item names inside of them.

, This is for particularly big, heavy presents.

,, However, they are likely to get suspicious if you ask them this when your birthday is nearby.

, Like my parents told me that my uncle would be upset if he wasn't there, and they never get me anything so I figured it would be something expensive.

Be thankful to be alive!",How to Enjoy Your Birthday," Check that your friends and family are free for the day and make sure you choose things to do that can involve the people you'd like to spend time with.;
, The day before your birthday, go to bed at a reasonable hour so that you can get the sleep needed to guarantee that you'll have lots of energy on your birthday.

, You want to feel special on your birthday. Either put together a great outfit from your existing clothes or go to the store and buy something special, just for you on your birthday.

, If you're going to do this, decorate your room on the previous night. When you wake up the next day, you will feel great knowing it's your birthday as you see the decorated room.


A birthday might also be an ideal time to rearrange your room, to see in a new year at a new age.

, Pick a theme for your party and get some helpers to put the party together. This might be your mom, your siblings or your friends.


If you want a theme party, you can have a chocolate party, a dance party, a superhero party or a movie party. Be creative; you can decorate and prepare for almost any theme you like.
One fun idea for your party is to buy mustaches and give them to everyone. Wear them, and take pictures. It's great fun!
You can give your guests goodie bags with candy and little special presents.
If you are holding a party, make sure you have lots of candy, food, and soda. You don't want to run out of these.

, You can choose not to remind anyone too; half the fun can be in seeing if everyone remembers. It's really up to you as to whether you prefer to leap out of bed shouting out that it's your birthday or to wait and see who will be the first to wish you a Happy Birthday.

, It is the best way to start the day and be sure to have what you love!


Some ideas for the perfect breakfast: Chocolate chip waffles, bacon, and doughnuts.

, Take a hot bath for 30 minutes to relax––ask that there be no distractions!

, It's the most fun if you have the party on the same day as your birthday, although this isn't essential. Get dressed up, wait for your friends to arrive and be prepared to have a whole bunch of fun.


Only do things you enjoy.
Don't let anyone bother you. It's your birthday and your party, so if there is any drama, either ignore the person or ask someone else to deal with it.

, Take your friends out for a coffee, or a juice if you are younger. Or, you can go to the cinema. Have a great time with people you love and care about.


If you're a girl, do something girly with your girlfriends. Go to the mall, go get your hair done, go fashion shopping together.

, Don't forget to tell the waitress that it's your birthday - they might have a special surprise dessert for you.

, Go out to a fancy restaurant!


Make it a tradition. For example, on every birthday in your family, you could all celebrate at a fancy restaurant of your choice.

, Always smile and savor the day. Make sure to spend a lot of time with those old folks who made you.

Use inviting words.,
Include important information.,
Let your guests know what to bring.,
Ask your guests to RSVP.",How to Create Your Own Birthday Invitations1," Since birthday parties are about celebration, be sure to translate that excitement onto the birthday invitations. You want them to be just that, inviting. Here are some ideas to keep in mind:


Use phrases like, ""You're invited to..."", ""Come join us for..."", or ""Help us celebrate..."" at the top of your invitation.Keep a positive tone, and avoid saying anything negative or offensive.;
, You want to be specific about everything your guests should know and expect. Here is vital information to include:


List where the party is, when it is, and what time it is. Put this information right below the title.If the birthday is a surprise, emphasize the importance of promptness and be sure to include ""sshhh"" so they know to keep quiet. Ask your guests to arrive at least one hour before the guest of honor in case anyone shows late., If you are having your birthday party at a pool, skating rink, or some other event, let your guests know what they will need to take part in the activity. You do not want someone to be left out of an activity because they were unaware of what they needed to have.Near the bottom of your invitation, you may write, ""Things to bring:"", and then list out important items guests will need.

, This will help you keep track of how much food, beverage, or other goods you may need. The last thing on the invitation should be a request for RSVP. You can provide your phone number, address, or email address. It is up to you whether you want them to call you, reply by mail, or send you an email. Here is what it may look like:RSVP by (insert date), and then add your contact information either next to, or underneath RSVP."

Recognize that all girls like different things.,
Avoid getting jealous of something that she gets.,
Recognize that if your younger sister is having a party, then they will probably be inviting their friends from their class at school.,
Help your little sister get ready for her big party.,
Talk and interact with her often during her birthday.,
Come into her bedroom before she goes to sleep.",How to Celebrate Your Younger Sister's Birthday," Keeping this in mind, make sure that you choose a gift that is unique to her and fits her hobbies and interests. Also, decide on a gift that she will use often. You could get her toys, games, make-up, a football, or anything that she will enjoy using and playing with.


If you have no idea what she likes, because you haven't really spent that much time with her, or if you are just having trouble figuring out a gift, ask your parents. Most likely, they'll give you some good ideas.;
, You need to accept that she has most likely been wanting this and as you are older, you could always buy it yourself or ask her nicely to borrow it. Don't be mean to her about it, otherwise she will be less likely to share anything else with you in the future.

, If this bothers you, then you could have a quiet word with your parents and ask them to see if a really good friend of yours could come. Don't ask for too many though, as your parents will probably say no. Stick to one really close friend, or maybe two if you really want to.

, Help her decide what she wants to wear, making sure it's age appropriate, do her hair if she wishes to have it done, and if your parents allow it, apply very minimal makeup if she would like some. Your parents will definitely appreciate you helping your sister so they can set up, and it can be some time for you to bond and have fun with her.

, Make sure that you are talking to her occasionally, but also giving her some privacy. When she gets up hug her and wish her a happy birthday. Even if she says she doesn't, or she looks mad when you talk to her, she most likely wants you to spend time with and talk to her.

, She will most likely be happy, and even if she is not, you can simply wish her a happy birthday, blow her a kiss, and walk out. If she allows you in, spend more time with her, talking about her birthday and tucking her in.

About a week before the event, help your friend arrange a Wiccan Birthday Altar facing North or East.,
Do not dismantle the altar after the event.,
Sit with your friend in front of the Birthday Altar while he or she meditates quietly on all the events of life leading to this moment.,
Send out special invitation cards to friends and relatives,  Buy cards which have Wiccan symbols outside and blank pages inside.,
Ask your friend if he or she is a cake person.,
If your friend does not like cakes, the alternative is an at-home sit-down dinner, or a wine and cheese evening.,
If it is to be an outdoors get-together, make safe arrangements for a bonfire.,
Carry the food in casseroles so it stays hot till eaten.,
If any of the invitees ring up to find out what to bring as a birthday present, you could suggest perfumed candles of various colours, Wiccan symbols and books on the subject.,
Help your friend pick out a nice birthday outfit and get ready yourself for the big day.

,
Make Incense from Sage.,
Congratulations!",How to Create a Wiccan Birthday Party," Place a small table in a clean corner. Cover it with a pretty white lace tablecloth.  Place perfumed candles or  tealight candles upon it and add a tiny pot containing a small, healthy flowering plant.  Put a happy picture of the birthday girl or boy near the flowers, and surround it with little things she or he holds dear - a favourite ring or jewellery set bought with the person's own money, beloved mementos and souvenirs, and cheerful photographs of family and friends.;
, Your friend can keep refreshing the items on the table and meditate before it every morning and evening. Soon, the good vibes of  prayer and meditation beaming out from the Meditation Corner will bless the whole house with a feeling of peace and inner sunshine.

, You can take a little inward journey yourself and you might just be surprised at the reflections you see inside!

, Use a gold glitter pen to hand-write the invitations and see that they are sent off well in time.

, If the answer is yes, a joint visit to a cake-maker is next; do a tasting and decide on the  flavours the cake will have. The cake can be designed to look like a Wiccan symbol, or a thatched hut with a cauldron boiling over a wood fire outside it. Cake experts are willing and eager to bake new, unusual and exciting cakes for their clients and the more unusual the design, the more of a challenge it is!

, If you can turn the event into an evening outdoors in a wooded area or on a beach, so much the better, as long as you don't disturb the neighbours. 

, Carry a portable battery to the spot and attach battery-operated fairy lights to the surrounding trees and bushes or lay the lights in a giant circle around the party area on the beach for a truly magical effect. Arrange for a makeshift bar and collapsible tables and chairs to be placed inside the circle of lights. Finally, don't forget the birthday person's favourite music and CDs with foot-tapping dance numbers and a portable music system.

, Remember to pack paper plates, cups and napkins, disposable cutlery and a sack to collect the after-party discards.

, If they can't find any, no worries. The traditional bottle of good wine is always very welcome!

,, Gift your friend a packet of sage incense sticks you made yourself.

, You've made a very big, selfless effort to make your friend happy! Just relax and enjoy the evening!

Note if there are any risks involved.,
Consider transportation to and from the party.,
Remember the interests of the honored guest.,
Include your honored guest in the planning.,
Ask the honoree if s/he would rather go out, or stay in.,
Host the party at the home of the guest of honor.,
Hold the party at the home of a family member.,
Book a favorite restaurant.,
Consider a creative alternative option.,
Have the party catered.,
Cook your own party food.,
Create a “set menu” at a restaurant.,

Try a “gentle roast.” A gentle roast can be a great way to get the room (and your birthday honoree) laughing.Ask everyone in the room to write something down about the guest of honor based on a prompt.,
Give a “pop quiz” on the life of the honoree.,
Make a toast.,
Create a souvenir book.",How to Celebrate a 90th Birthday Party," Does he or she get around easily, or only with help? Does he or she have trouble with steps, or walking through crowded rooms?


Make sure your chosen venue is wheelchair-accessible (if necessary). Consider both the guest of honor and his or her friends.;
, For example, if you are planning a party in January and live in Michigan, you must consider the possibility of snowy or bitingly cold weather. It may not be the best decision to bring a senior citizen out in nasty weather conditions as they are more susceptible to catching illnesses.


Be prepared to change plans if the honoree is unwell on the date of the party. It would not be wise to have a 90-year-old attend a party if he or she was under the weather.

, Many (though not all) 90-year-olds no longer drive their own vehicles on a daily basis. Recognize if this will be an issue for your guest of honor.


Offer to be a driver, or find someone who is willing to drive your honoree and his or her friends, if necessary.

, While you are planning a 90th birthday party, it does not have to be solely focused on the number 90. Instead, think of the current or past interests of your honoree and see if you can incorporate these into the party.This is a great opportunity to be creative!


If your birthday honoree loves the outdoors, consider booking a place in a local park and bringing food to cook on a grill.
If your birthday honoree loves Italian food, book a private room at the nicest Italian restaurant in town, and decorate it before the party.
If your honoree’s favorite and most memorable moment was her honeymoon in Paris, recreate a French restaurant in your kitchen and dining room and take her back to her younger days.

, Giving him or her a hand in the party planning can be a great topic of conversation and a fun way for them to stay involved in the party process. Questions you may want to ask include:


Would you rather a small family gathering, or a large event with friends included?
Would you rather a party in the afternoon or in the evening?
Would you like a home-cooked meal or a special meal at a restaurant?
Are there any friends or other guests you would like to invite? (Think about the people you may not know personally).
Would you like a certain theme? (Think color, country, activity, etc.)
What kind of birthday dessert would you like?

, Depending on their health, independence, and cognitive state, senior citizens may feel more comfortable in a familiar setting., This would save your elderly honoree the stress of getting to another location for his or her party. It may be preferable in certain cases, and may be frowned upon in others.


Plan to visit beforehand to lend a hand with cleaning, decorating, and preparing for the party. Do not leave this for the guest of honor to do!

, While this is still a change of scenery for your honored guest, it may be more comfortable and intimate than planning a larger get-together at a public venue.

, A favorite restaurant can be a familiar place that still provides the social and celebratory atmosphere that your nonagenarian may desire.


Consider booking a private room. This is a way to make a regular restaurant reservation into a more luxe experience!

, Depending on the unique personality and interests of your guest of honor, there are many creative venues to hold a fantastic party.


If it’s going to be a summer event, consider an outdoor location such as a beach or a park.
Consider renting a boat and hosting a party on the water for any sea-lovers.
Plan a gathering in multiple venues, such as a pre-theatre dinner at a local restaurant and then a walk over to see a theatre performance.

, Catering a party is a great way to enable you to hold the celebration in a familiar and intimate setting while removing the stress of cooking and cleaning up.


Call your local caterer to see if there is a minimum number of guests required at the party or money that must be spent at the caterer. You don’t want to be blindsided by a higher-than-expected food bill!
Peruse your menu options, and ensure there is food that your guests would enjoy.
Call around to find a reasonably priced caterer. It is always advantageous to get several price quotes from several different companies before settling on a caterer.

, Cooking your own food can be a wonderful way to pay tribute to your guest of honor, or simply to treat him or her with their favorite foods. Cooking your own party food can also be a subtle way to deal with any dietary issues that your guest of honor may have, without having to deal with them publicly at a restaurant.


If your guest of honor loved to cook, serving an old family recipe can bring back good memories and create meaningful conversation.
If your honoree comes from a certain cultural background, making food that can serve of a reminder of a homeland, possibly one not visited in a while, may be appreciated.
If your guest of honor loves to try new or unique food, think of something creative that he or she might not have had for a long time- think sushi, ostrich burgers, calamari, lavender crème brulee- the possibilities are endless!
Ask your guest of honor what he or she would pick if the dining possibilities were endless! This is the best way to ensure that the meal will make the 90th birthday celebration a special one.

, In many cases, it is possible to work with the restaurant to create a “set menu,” which will enable you to include some of the celebrant’s favorite dishes while still providing your guests with a selection.


Consider asking if anyone attending has any dietary issues or food allergies. Some common food allergies include gluten and shellfish, so make sure you are aware of guests with potential dining issues.
Make sure you include at least one veggie dish. Your vegetarian attendees will thank you! A pasta dish with no meat or fish is usually a safe bet.
Ask the restaurant if you can rename your chosen dishes in honor of the 90th birthday celebrating. Something along the lines like “Nonna’s Nineties Nibbles” as an appetizer or “Auntie Sue’s Special Spicy Salmon” can be a fun way to honor your loved one.

, Consider inviting friends and family from both near and far. It is the people who attend the event that will make it the most special for your guest of honor.


Make sure to ask for an RSVP. This will help you know what sort of venue is appropriate for the celebration.
Offer to help friends and family from out of town book hotels, or offer up spare rooms with local family members if possible. This can help defray the cost for people traveling in from far away.
Think about any possible “surprise guests.” Did the guest of honor have a special army buddy that he still writes to? Does she have a childhood friend or a favorite cousin that she doesn’t get to see often? If so, these are the types of surprises that your nonagenarian is sure to appreciate.

, Party decorations are important at any birthday celebration. There are many ways you can go in decorating for a 90th birthday party ranging from very simple to incredibly extravagant.


Include memorabilia from past eras and events. Consider making a photo collage, or digging out an old high school diploma, awards and trophies, or wedding photos that will honor the birthday guest. This can be a great way for the younger generations to connect with the guest of honor.
Make it a party! Include banners, balloons, party hats, a piñata, streamers, confetti, etc. Include anything that reminds you of a great celebration!
Find 90th birthday-themed items! Many card stores (such as Hallmark) or party stores (such as Party City) will sell 90th birthday-themed items. Even a simple hat for the honoree can make them feel special.

, On the day of the party, it may be appreciated to help prepare your guest of honor for their special day by going out of your way to make sure they feel their best.


If the honoree is a woman, consider taking her to get her hair done or nails painted before the party. These simple beauty splurges can make her feel special on her special day. Ask her if she would like a new outfit or new shoes for the party, and make it a point to take her on a special shopping trip before the day of the party.
If the honoree is a man, consider taking him to get a shave or a haircut before the party. Ask him if he would like new clothing, a new hat, or a new belt for the party. Something as simple as a new accessory can help him truly feel honored on his special day.

, Call anyone who would like to speak up one by one, and make sure you have a microphone if you are in a large space.


Make up your own prompts, or try one of these:

An embarrassing moment I had with John was…..
Something I thought I would never confess to John is……
The funniest moment I ever had with John was……
The moment I knew John would be my friend forever was…..
The time John and I got into the most trouble was when…..
The time I was most amazed by John was when….



, Ask questions about the life of the honoree and offer a prize for the person that knows him or her best.Be sure to include some humorous questions as well! Some example questions include:


Where did John go to high school?
Where did John’s family vacation when he was a child?
What was John’s salary at his first job as a grocery delivery boy as a child?
What was John’s favorite sibling’s name?
What kind of pet did John have as a boy?
What is John’s favorite story to tell?
What kind of car did John always want to own?

, Attending their 90th birthday party is a great time to let the guest of honor know how much he or she means to you. Plan a portion of time where people can give toasts if they want to.


Include champagne (or sparkling grape juice). Make it a true toast!
Ask several attendees beforehand to prepare a short toast. You don’t want to be left with a silent room when you propose toasting your honored guest.

, This will help your honoree to remember his or her special day. Ask all in attendance to sign the book and to leave a little message to the birthday celebrant.


Contact those who will be attending beforehand, and ask them to bring a favorite picture or a favorite letter to put in the book. This book can then be given as a gift at the end of the celebration.

Figure out how much time you can devote to your celebration.,
Consider getting away for your birthday.,
Scope out special birthday deals.,
Decide what you'd like as a present.,
Make the final arrangements the day before.,
Have a special breakfast.,
Take some time to enjoy the outdoors on your birthday.,
Be your own date.,
Eat whatever you want for dinner.,
Select a special treat for dessert.,
Unwind and relax before bed.",How to Celebrate Your Birthday Alone," Hardly anyone likes having to work on their birthday (even if you have an awesome job and great coworkers), but as adults most of us have to respond to the alarm and trudge off to work even on our birthdays. As you prepare for your birthday celebration, take a look at the day's calendar to see how much time you can carve out for yourself.


You may have to spend most of your special day at work, but check your calendar to see if you can head out a bit earlier to hit your favorite bakery or take a little extra time lingering over your breakfast at home.
Of course, if you'd rather get every last bit of shut-eye that you can in the morning—especially on your birthday morning, check to see if you can afford to take a longer lunch or possibly take off from work a bit earlier than normal.
If you have vacation or personal days available, consider using them on this special day.;
, If you're able to, getting out of town for a solo birthday celebration is a fantastic way to treat yourself, go exactly where you want to go, and get some precious downtime. Traveling by yourself means you won't have to worry about coordinating your schedule with anyone else, nor will you have to make compromises. If you've always wanted to laze around on a sunny beach, but your normal travel companions prefer to tough it out in the woods, now is your chance to go where you want and do exactly what you want.


If at all possible, try to make travel plans a few weeks in advance in order to get the best deals. This will include making decisions about transportation,making hotel reservations, and packing for your trip.
It's always fun to return to a favorite place, but don't rule out going somewhere entirely new.

, You may not still think it's cool to have a bunch of awkward servers sing you happy birthday (or maybe you do—nothing wrong with that!), but that doesn't mean that there aren't still tons of special deals available for you to take advantage of on your birthday. It used to be the case that all you'd have to do to get a free dessert or coffee on your birthday was say “Today is my birthday” and maybe show your I.D; however, today most businesses that offer special birthday deals or savings require you to sign up in advance.In the weeks and days leading up to your birthday, visit the websites of your favorite restaurants and businesses to see if they offer anything special on customers' birthdays. You may have to sign up to be on a mailing list or more likely an email list.
Alternatively, don't be afraid to ask at the counter of the businesses you frequent in person to see if they have special birthday programs.
Many coffee houses and restaurants have birthday deals available, but don't forget to check in with other places such as your stylist's or masseuse's.

, Just because you're planning on celebrating your birthday alone, it doesn't mean that you should have to forgo presents! Think of your birthday as a day to relax, reward, pamper and celebrate yourself—such a day hardly seems complete without a present. Sure, it's (usually!) nice to be surprised when receiving a gift, but who among us hasn't had to graciously fake enthusiasm for a less-than-ideal birthday gift? (Really, Grandma, a puffy-paint unicorn sweatshirt?) The advantage to being your own gift-giver is that you get to pick out exactly what you want.


You may decide that you want to save the present shopping for the actual day of your birthday, especially if you really enjoy browsing and shopping and want to incorporate that as part of the day's festivities.
However, if won't have time to shop for yourself on your birthday, or if the last thing you want to do in your precious free time is head to the mall, then be sure to select something awesome for yourself in advance, so that you'll have it on your birthday.
If you shop in the store, see if the clerk is able to gift-wrap it for you. Yes, that may sound a bit silly (it's not like you don't know what's in the package, after all), but there's a good chance you'll enjoy the ritual of unwrapping a carefully selected gift.
Alternatively, select something special for yourself online and be sure to arrange the shipping so that it will arrive before or on your birthday.
Whatever you buy should of course be informed by your budget, but keep in mind that you are worth splurging on. Try to choose something that you really want, that seems fun, and that you think would make you happy, even if it seems a bit frivolous. Is there something you've always secretly wished someone else would get for you, even though you swore you'd never buy it for yourself? Be that person for yourself on this very special day!

, If you were preparing for an important interview or hosting a party, you'd make sure to handle the details of cleaning, shopping, selecting outfits, etc. in advance of the big day. Your birthday is a big day too, and your goal is to make it as special and relaxing as possible.


Tidy up your home in the day or two before your birthday. For most people, it's hard to relax in a mess, and you want your home, especially for your solo birthday celebration, to be an oasis.
Make the place look festive: you can go all out with streamers and balloons, or just brighten up the space with a small bunch of fresh flowers (another splurge item you might not buy yourself regularly) or candles.
Choose your birthday outfit the night before: pick something that's comfortable and makes you feel awesome about yourself.
If you're eating breakfast at home and/or bringing your lunch to work, make the preparations the night before so that you don't have to rush in the morning.

, Treat yourself to something special and maybe even a little decadent on your birthday morning. Even if you have to get to work, spend a little extra time making yourself something special, such as French Toast. If you made your preparations the night before, it should be a snap to whip the dish up quickly.


Even if you're just a toast-and-coffee-in-the-morning type, treat yourself to a better brew than you normally drink in the morning.

, As much of your day as possible should be an escape from the regular routine of your life. In your quest to make the most of your birthday, consider finding ways to get outside to enjoy the escape that nature can offer. Exercise and fresh air can help rejuvenate you, and can provide you with a chance to reflect upon your year.


Consider going for a jog around town or on a nearby nature trail, or even a longer hike. You're sure to have a good time on your favorite path or trail, but think about exploring new territory if at all possible.
You may also want to go for a bike ride or just a stroll around town. If you don't own a bike and you live in a city, look to see if there are any bike-share programs near you, which are becoming increasingly common and which offer a cheap way to see the sites.

, What is your dream date? A cozy evening spent on the couch watching old movies and eating your favorite take-out? A leisurely afternoon spent at the museum? Shopping all day? Dinner at the best place in town?


Your solo birthday should be about you doing exactly what you want to do, so whether you decide to stay in or go out, be sure to choose a fun or relaxing activity of some sort. Because the day is completely yours, you don't have to worry about accommodating anyone else's tastes or preferences!

, One of the best things about your birthday is that you get to decide what will be on the menu for your meals. Of course, this is how it should be, but if we're celebrating with other people, we may feel pressured to tailor the selections to the other people at the dinner table. If you're celebrating alone, though, you are in ultimate control! If you want to eat birthday cake and nothing else for dinner, then no one will stop you!


If you enjoy spending time in the kitchen, try your hand at such comforting classics as sweet potatoes and pot roast.
You could also record one of your favorite cooking shows in advance and try out a new recipe; cook along with the host and it will feel like a party (especially if you cook with a glass of wine!).
If you don't feel like cooking or don't have the time, you can order in or go to your favorite restaurant. Be sure that you're ordering something you want and enjoy—today is all about you!

, No birthday celebration is complete without some sort of treat. If you don't want to be tempted by having an entire birthday cake sitting on the counter all week, stop by a local bakery and pick up decadent cupcake or two. You can even have them pipe “Happy Birthday” in icing on top.


If baking is your thing, treat yourself to a made-from-scratch dessert such as cheesecake or French apricot tart.
If you'd rather go out and get a dessert, you can! If you're eating out for dinner as well, considering choosing a place that has a great dessert menu (don't be shy to let your server know that it's your birthday—you may get dessert on the house), but it could be fun to go someplace else for dessert and coffee or wine.
If sweets aren't your thing, then choose a nice cheese platter with a great wine pairing, or anything that you consider to be a treat that you wouldn't eat every day.
If you're celebrating your birthday alone because you're physically separated from your friends and family, this would be an excellent time to FaceTime or Skype with them. Put a candle on your dessert and let someone else sing “Happy Birthday” to you.

, As your solo birthday winds down, find a way to relax and pamper yourself just a bit more. Take a steamy shower or a long soak in the tub. Think about purchasing a super-soft, relaxing, new pair of pajamas as one of your presents to yourself. Hopefully today was one of your best birthdays yet!

Please the birthday girl or boy.,
Let yourself be self-centered.,
Do nothing if that’s what you want.",How to Celebrate Your Birthday1," The main reason so many people find celebrating their own birthday stressful is that they are focused on living up to a standard set forth by others rather than themselves. Remember, it’s a celebration of your existence! Let it be celebratory.;
, For a day, anyways. It’s good to not want to seem self-centered, to want to put others before yourself, but this is your day! Do the things that give you satisfaction. You have permission to go just where you want and do just what you want to do.


Go to a concert or theatre show. Live performances, be they comedy, ballet, music, or stage plays, are a great way to make an outing special.
Have a picnic. Gathering some friends and family and having a leisurely afternoon sitting on a blanket outdoors is a perfect way to enjoy the simple pleasures of your day.Take a blanket, some drinks and snacks, and find a scenic spot. If you’re feeling a bit fancy, wine, cheese, and fruit are ideal for picnics.

, Who says birthdays have to be filled with activity? Many of us want to have a birthday that’s filled to the brim with adventures outside or engaging in special events or parties, but there’s nothing wrong with just relaxing and taking it easy on your birthday.


Plan to cook a favorite meal.
Stay in and watch those rental movies you haven’t had the time for.
Go for a swim or a walk, and take the opportunity to relax and take in the fresh air.
Sleep in. Have a big breakfast and relax.

Take it slow.,
Learn about what you're drinking.,
Eat something first and drink plenty of water.,
Celebrate with friends you can trust.,
Never leave a drink unattended.,
Don't mix different kinds of alcohol together.,
Prepare for recovery.",How to Celebrate a 21st Birthday1," You're 21! You should be excited, and probably anxious to get your first legal taste of alcohol in public. But try to remember that you'll be of legal drinking age for the rest of your life. You don't have to drink all the drinks at once. Starting the rest of that life with a two day hangover isn't probably the best idea. Prepare for a long night of fun and don't rush into things, especially when it comes to alcohol.


A good rule of thumb is that you should have no more than one drink per hour to keep a handle on your sobriety, although alcohol affects everyone differently. Different strengths of alcohol can sneak up on you more quickly, while some take a while to show effects. Keeping it to around one and no more than two drinks per hour will help keep most people in control of their faculties.
One drink in an evening can be enough to register above limit on a breathalyzer test, and one drink is often enough to get one person tipsy. Always use extreme caution any time you're drinking alcohol, and never drive under any circumstances after consuming.;
, Different drinks work in different ways, so it's important to get informed about the differences in the types of alcohol you'll find at a bar or a liquor store, if you're not familiar already.


A shot is usually about 1.5 ounces of hard liquor, and the average liquor is about 40% alcohol by volume, or 80 proof.
A beer is usually about 12 ounces, although beer is often served in pint glasses, which are slightly larger. Regular beers and light beers like Budweiser, Coors, or other beers are usually between 2 and 5% alcohol by volume, while certain microbrews can be much higher, 6-8% in some cases. Drinking a single heavy Indiana Pale Ale, for example, will have about as much alcohol as two Bud Lites.
A glass of wine is about 4 ounces, usually, and is usually between 12 and 18% alcohol by volume, depending on the variety.
Cocktails are mixtures of different hard liquors, flavored liqueurs, sodas, fruit juices, and other liquids, depending on the cocktail itself. Most cocktails contain one or two shots worth of hard liquor, however. Ask the bartender for more specific information.

, Never drink alcohol on an empty stomach. Before you decide to have your first drinks, get something substantial to eat first and try to stay hydrated throughout the evening, if you're planning on having a couple. Going out for a meal at a restaurant that serves alcohol can be a great way of doing both things at once.


Eggs are an excellent precursor to a night of drinking because they contain cysteine, which helps to break down alcohol in your system. Pickles are also an excellent choice, which contain salts and electrolytes, which alcohol depletes in your body.
Drink at least one glass of water for every drink of alcohol you have. Hangovers are primarily the result of dehydration, and it's possible to head a troubling morning-after off at the pass by drinking enough water throughout the night.

, If you're going out and planning on drinking, it's especially important that you're going out with a trusted group of friends who you're confident won't take advantage of you in an inebriated state. Don't celebrate with people who will test your limits or push you into doing things you don't want to do. Bring a supportive and trustworthy group along for the fun, who'll be able to take care of you if necessary.


If you're in a large group, at least one person should be sober, or in the neighborhood of sober, if everyone else is getting out of control. It's important that there be at least one voice of reason, or one good candidate to talk to the cops when the show up at the house.
If you're going anywhere, you must designate a driver to remain sober and act as the chauffeur. Even one or two drinks can be enough to register on a breathalyzer test, leading to a bummer of a birthday night. The cops don't care that it's your special night.

, Especially true at bars, but equally true at house parties, it's important that you keep your drink with you at all times. Go up to the bar to get your own drinks, never accept drinks offered by strangers, and abandon drinks that you're unsure about.


Tainted drinks or drinks spiked with sedatives and other drugs are an unfortunately common occurrence at bars, and inexperienced 21-year-olds make an easy target. Have fun, but keep your friends close and stay safe.

, Everyone reacts differently to different types of alcohol, especially depending on your body type and your sex: men process alcohol much differently than women do. When you're first learning about your tolerance, it's best to not jump around doing a couple beers, a shot, then a glass of wine, then a cocktail. It makes it harder to keep track of what you've already had to drink and control your sobriety.


A classic drinkers' slogan goes ""Beer before liquor, never sicker. Liquor before beer, no fear."" The order of drinks being consumed has no effect, however, on your inebriation, compared to the amount of liquor consumed. It's perfectly possible to get a nasty hangover by taking a shot before a beer.

, Before you go out, stock up for the possibility of a rough morning, even if you're planning on taking it easy. After a night of drinking, it's common that you might experience some nausea, headache, and sensitivity to sound and light, the result of dehydration and a lowered electrolyte count. By preparing correctly, though, you can get on top of your hangover quickly and salvage the day.


Drink a sports drink in the morning, if you're feeling dehydrated, cut with water to make it more palatable, if necessary. The sugar and the electrolytes will help to replenish what the alcohol sapped from your body.try to get something on your stomach the next morning, even if it's just some dry toast. Kickstarting your metabolism is essential to starting recovery. If you need to take an ibuprofen, also, you'll need to have something on your stomach. Mixing ibuprofen with alcohol can irritate the stomach lining.

Use your bucket list.,
Know what’s in your budget.,
Plan for special years.",How to Celebrate Your Birthday2," Most of us have specific activities we want to do in our lives. Things on the bucket list should be large and small-traveling to a particular place in the world, eating at a particular restaurant, engaging in daring adventures-a birthday can be a great opportunity to do the things you’ve always wanted to do but never got around to. Having a literal list is not a bad idea. Writing out your bucket list can have positive effects on your life in general, such as:


Being a motivator. Writing out a list of things you want to do in life can help motivate you toward positive action.
Helping you feel successful and more accomplished. Checking items off your bucket list shows you proof that you’re getting things done.
Increasing focus. A list will help you have a clearer sense of what you want, and what you want to do with your life. , Look at ways to do the things you’ve always wanted to do on a budget. Your list should be expansive, but also include things that won’t be as big of deals to accomplish.


Your list should include things that you can do without too much expense or time.
Include things you can do without leaving your hometown or spending less that $100. , Your bucket list should also include big dreams! Is it your 21st? Your 40th? 50th? Doing something really special on particular milestones is especially memorable (and no one will begrudge you the expense!). Consider checking off a big bucket list item for these special years; major milestones are good years to do the skydiving, or the trip to Paris, or the kayaking down the Grand Canyon.


Look at ways to do the things you’ve always wanted to do on a budget. There are lots of helpful resources out there to make it easier (and cheaper) to get in that trip around the world you’ve always dreamed of, or snorkeling in the Maldives, or even just cooking that special dish you’ve always wanted to try.
If you want to do something major, figure out how much money you can afford to spend on a special milestone birthday.
Select a few possibilities from your list that you think may be within your price range.
Narrow down ideas by looking at any travel expenses, ticket prices, lodging, and food expenses that each item will entail, and deciding if they will be possibilities.

Have yourself a party!,
Plan your party.,
Don’t overplan!,
Get close friends and family involved.,
Ask friends to bring something.",How to Celebrate Your Birthday3," Of course, sometimes you do want to go the most timeless birthday route of them all-that of a birthday party. Remember, there’s nothing wrong with letting yourself be a little bit self focused for your birthday, and so there’s nothing wrong with giving a party in celebration of your birthday!

, Make sure you have the necessary items, the place, and the people to have a party or get together that will be enjoyable to you and your guests.


At the very least, you’ll want to provide some refreshments to your guests. Know how many people you plan to invite and, depending on what sort of refreshments you decide on, crunch the numbers to be sure you’ll have enough food and drink for everyone.
Decide what you’ll serve. Are you having a full dinner or just drinks and appetizers? Think of who’s coming and consider what they might like. Are your guests more carnivores? Vegetarians? If you know your guests’ preferences, use that knowledge.
Is it winter? Summer? Consider the climate when planning your party. If it’s cold, warm dips and hot bread can be a relatively simple path. If your birthday falls in the warmer months (or if you live in a hotter region) cool drinks, fruits, and cold dips are great.
Backyards are made for parties. Be sure that if there’s a chance of rain, you have a backup plan-also consider whether your guests will be exposed to the sun, and look at possibilities for adding some shade if needed. Umbrellas or canopies can be rented at most party supply stores.

, Unless you’re throwing a massive ball at a French chateau, or a state dinner, and even if there’s some serious planning going into your party, i.e caterers and musicians, there’s really no need to overthink it. Parties can take some effort, but consider your guest’s enjoyment and plan a party that you would want to attend, and good times will be had.


A good birthday party involves guests enjoying themselves and celebrating the presence of the birthday girl or boy. Simple as that.
Activities and even food and drink are secondary to the general ambience-people having a good time.
Whether it’s a kid’s party, a backyard barbeque, or a champagne and hors’d’ouvres affair, creating a relaxing atmosphere where guests can mingle and enjoy life is the purpose.
No one likes to feel that something is expected of them at a party. Guests often like to help out with what needs doing at a party; enlisting offered help is great, but don’t demand your guest’s appreciation. Your guests should simply be allowed to enjoy the opportunity to spend social time with each other and you.

, If you’re hosting a house party or a shindig where you will be doing some of the legwork, enlist family and friends to come early to help with the preparations-and get to enjoy your birthday glow before the larger party gets started.

, Rather than accepting gifts, requesting contributions to the birthday party effort. Suggesting that guests bring drinks, snacks, particular dishes, plates, or even music or games is one way to involve the everyone in the putting on of the celebration, and lessen the economic burden on yourself. Also, when guests feel more involved, and feel that they have contributed to a party or gathering, they will feel more invested in the sense of camaraderie and community that a good party creates.


If you’re going for a full meal at your party, potlucks are a great way to make your friends a part of the cooking. Ask everyone to bring a dish, or create a signup sheet with an online invite service for coordination of dishes.
Know anyone who is known amongst friends for a special dish or dessert they make? Ask them if they would like to make it for your birthday-they’ll feel appreciated, and so will you!

Release the reins, release the tension.,
Let yourself be pampered.,
Put aside your responsibilities for a day.",How to Celebrate Your Birthday4," Until fairly recently, modern science didn’t have the abilities to understand the way stress can affect our health. Now we know that not needing to control every little element of say, a birthday party, can make such experiences beneficial to our health rather than a drag on it.


Be flexible. As with any event planning, don’t expect every bit of minutiae to happen exactly as you envisioned it down to each minute or birthday candle. Remember-it’s about having a good time and celebrating, not about accomplishing a task.
When things don’t go exactly as you planned, go with it-it’s your birthday, and, well, you can cry if you want to, but there’s really no need. Everyone will have a good time if the host or guest of honor is relaxed and enjoying themselves-so that’s all you need to worry about.
Things happening differently than planned makes for a great story! So when the section of birthday cake with your name on it falls off the serving knife, don’t sweat it.

, If you have family or friends around that express a desire to help make your birthday memorable, let them!


Going out to breakfast, brunch, or lunch is a good way to spend time with close friends and family members before you get on to the later events of your birthday.
Pamper yourself also! Get some quality spa or massage time, or have a luxurious bath followed by chocolates.

, If possible, allow yourself “check out” on your birthday. Don’t let that big deal at the office go awry, of course, and you should still make sure your kids have a ride home from school, but your birthday can be an annual guilt-free opportunity to not worry about the dishes or that wall that needs painting or other minor tasks that you have on your plate.


If possible, get your birthday (or the day after if you’re planning on being up late) off from work. Take the day and enjoy it.
Let yourself slide a little. On your birthday, especially if you’re a big achiever who likes to be on top of everything, let yourself go just a little. Don’t feel like you need to accomplish every little chore on your birthday. It’ll be good for you.

Stay safe.,
Designate a driver.,
Pick a place, or hop around.,
Travel somewhere.,
Decide how much money you're willing to spend.,
Keep your plans loose.,
Have fun, but don't be obnoxious.,
Try the midnight-to-midnight.,
Know when to pack it in.",How to Celebrate a 21st Birthday2," If you're going to welcome yourself to adulthood by having an all-out crazy celebration of your self and your ability to consume the boozes legally, you have to do it with a plan for staying safe and for being a little responsible. If you're going to party, you might as well party right.


Bring a go-bag with you. Have some emergency supplies on hand in a backpack, purse, or other carrying case: energy drink, sports drink, prophylactic, extra keys, extra cash, cellphone charger, toothbrush, and list of emergency numbers. Never a bad idea.
Let several people know your plans for the night in case things go awry. Let a neighbor, a parent, a housemate, or someone else you trust know where you'll be, what you're planning on doing, and what to do in an emergency. It's not lame to take care of yourself.

, If you're going to celebrate your 21st with a night on the town and you're planning on having a couple drinks, make a designated driver the first priority. Elect a friend to stay sober and chauffeur you around, in exchange for a free dinner, if necessary. If you live in the city, walk around, take public transportation, or use taxi cabs to travel. If you've got the funds, a limo is always a great party option. Don't drive after drinking, under any circumstances.


Before you go out, program the number of late-night taxi services into your phone. That way, if you end up unsure about how to get around, you can call quickly and easily and make sure that you'll be safe.
If you're walking home late at night, always walk in a group and make sure that everyone gets home safely. Make sure that everyone in your group has already exchanged numbers before setting out for the night, in case you get separated.

, Depending on your plants, it might be fun to hit up a bunch of different places in a small area, head to a few special locations, or pick the perfect spot and hole up there for the evening. All approaches can be fun ways to party.


If you want to bar-crawl, find an area that's densely packed with cool bars, so you won't have to worry about transporting yourself in between them, and can walk. Start by eating dinner at the brew-pup and trying a flight of the house made beers to see what you like. Then have an after-dinner cocktail at the fancy bar across the street, and finish off the night with cheap drinks and pool at the dive a few blocks away.
Alternatively, find one place and warn them you're coming. If you've got a favorite restaurant, pick somewhere you'll be able to have a good meal, accommodate a large group, and hang out afterward for drinks, if necessary. A super-trendy or popular restaurant might not want a huge table taking up space for an entire evening. You'll probably want to call ahead to make a reservation and let them know how many people will be attending.

, No place close by where you want to party? Go where the party is. If you plan it out far enough ahead of time and have the funds to pay for lodging, heading somewhere exotic for a birthday celebration will make sure you kick off your drinking years in style.


In America, Las Vegas and New Orleans are great towns in which to turn 21, with a big party-culture, plenty to do for leisure, and friendly open-container laws.
If you head to Europe or elsewhere, know that turning 21 carries less of a cultural significance than in the United States, since the drinking age is usually different. It'll still be a blast for you, but shouting that you're 21 and waving your ID in peoples' faces will probably just earn some confused looks., It's your birthday, so you're the one who gets to decide how classy, trashy, or somewhere in between your birthday is going to be. Your sister might be after you to eat raw oysters at some fancy seaside resort, when all you want to do is hang out with your friends. Consider the guests, the venues, and the type of partying you're after when considering the cost.



Classy option: Plan an exclusive wine tasting with a few close friends and get dressed up in fancy clothes for your 21st. Then score reservations at a trendy small-plate restaurant back in town and sample deserts with after-dinner cocktails somewhere else. Make like you're in Sex and the City, and live it up right. Make it less about ""getting drunk"" and more about ""becoming an adult."" If you happen to get a little tipsy in the process, all the better.Budget option: It's always a popular option to throw a campy bar-crawl, frat-style. Hit up the rankest dive bars in your town with 20 friends, throw darts and dance wearing plastic leis, and end the night with some late night Taco Bell. It's about memories, not spending a ton of money. Cut loose and have a blast on the cheap.

, It's good to make plans, but no night on the town should feel like a forced march. If you make reservations at too many different places and have a really specific list of cocktails, appetizers, and different things you want to try before a certain hour, it can seem less like a party and more like work. Remember that you're supposed to have fun and try to allow some time to fly by the seat of your pants.


If you have to make reservations, make one for dinner, and go there first before you do anything else. Afterwards, leave some of your plans up in the air. Make sure at least one person has a smart phone and can look things up on the fly.
One fun way of celebrating can be to turn over the decision making process to someone else and let them plan everything. That way you can be free to sit back and party. Where you're going next? Who cares! Let someone else lead the way.

, Turning 21 might seem like the biggest deal in the world to you right now, but the guy trying to get a quick bite and a beer after work probably doesn't want to be hassled by 20 drunk college kids, and the wait staff is probably just trying to get through their shift as quickly as possible. Don't make a scene and try to be as considerate as possible with others.


Leave a big tip if you've got a big party. If you've got a big group of drunk people making lots of noise, mess, and drawing lots of attention to itself, you need to compensate your servers with a generous tip. If the party is big enough, an automatic tip may be included, but consider going above in some cases, if you can afford it.
If you've got a large, unwieldy party that's hopping between bars, try a helpful friend-making trick: buy drinks for strangers. A table trying to have a quiet dinner keeps making annoyed faces at your table? Don't make a big deal out of it, or complain. Send them another round on your tab and show a little class.
Pay the fun forward. If it's your 21st, fill a bag with 21 beers and give them out to people at the bar you're worried you might have annoyed, like souvenirs for your party. They'll chill out. Be the beer fairy.

, Some people like to start partying at the first possible minute. Make your 21st birthday start the last night of your 20th by waiting until the very moment the clock strikes midnight to show your ID to the bouncer at a bar. Walk in a liberated 21 year old.


If you want to get especially ambitious, some people try to keep the party going for all 24 hours of your actual birthday. That means you've got to keep partying until the following midnight. If you do this, the name of the game is hydration. Schedule some down time to drink a couple Gatorades, catch up on some bad TV, and chill out. No one can survive 24 hours of straight drinking.

, Eventually, your birthday's going to have to end, and it's better that it ends safely and probably sooner rather than later. Some bars can get a little hairy in the after-hours, and it's not usually a good idea to get caught out too late. Make sure you stay in a group and head home at a reasonable hour.


Before you go out, give yourself a loose curfew, so you won't have to worry about decided when to go home later. Call a cab ahead of time and arrange for it to arrive when you'd like to leave. Then you can enjoy your night worry free.

Kick people out when the time comes.",How to Celebrate a 21st Birthday3," If you're finally 21, a house party can be a great way to ring in the year. Head to the liquor store and stock up on a variety of booze, invite enough friends to tear the place down, and get a DJ. Party time.


You only get so many opportunities in life to throw a kegger. Your 21st is the most obvious. Invite lots of people, make sure they're all over 21, and drink a giant keg of beer together.
Clear everything out of the living room to make a party space, hiding anything breakable, or anything your roommates don't want stolen.
If you're going to throw a loud party with music, warn your neighbors and get on their good side to avoid an uncomfortable house call from the police late at night. try to be considerate of your neighbors, and let them know what you're planning, and try to cut it off at an appropriate hour.
try to resist the urge to supply your underage friends will alcohol. If you're the first of your crew to turn 21, maybe having a house party isn't the best idea.

, If you decide to throw yourself a 21st bash at home, you can afford to get a whole lot weirder than if you go out. That means costumes, games, maybe even feats of strength. Who knows. You only turn 21 once. Some great time-tested theme parties include:


Dork Party. Tell everyone to dress up as their favorite video game character, super-hero, or other nerd-related theme. Wait for hilarity to ensue.
Throwback Party. Make like it's 1984 and make everyone wear washed-out jeans, ugly sweaters, and big perm-style hair. Listen to Flock of Seagulls and discuss Reaganomics over wine coolers. Good times.
Toga Party. A time-tested classic, probably just as popular when your parents turned 21. At a toga party, everyone wraps themselves in a sheet as if they were at the Roman coliseum. Drink ambrosia (coconut rum, orange juice, pineapple juice) and carry on regally.
Heaven and Hell Party. This only works if you've got three floors. Put champagne and wine on the top floor, beer on the ground level, and liquor in the basement. If it's your party, you play god, and send people to respective places.
Box Party. Separate everyone into different groups, preferably into small groups with strangers they won't know. Everyone has to go into a different room. In that room is a box. In that box is a kind of alcohol. The group cannot leave the room until the alcohol is gone. The alcohol, it should be noted, should be something gross, like Smirnoff Ice or blue raspberry jello shots.

, While you're partying on your 21st, take a picture of yourself every hour on the hour with a disposable camera. When you get the pictures developed later, it'll be a hilarious documentary of the night, and may even jog loose some almost-forgotten memories. Who's that wearing a hockey mask and wiping bean dip all over their face? Oh…it's you.

, A great way to liven up a 21st house party is to play a drinking game. You can make one up as you go along, or you can play a classic. If you're just recently turned 21, you should never play a drinking game with hard alcohol. Stick to beer and take a tiny sip when a drink gets doled out, otherwise drinking games can quickly overwhelm your tolerance, making them dangerous. Played safely, drinking games can be a lot of fun, though. Some of the time-tested and party-approved include:



King's Cup. In this game, you'll need a deck of cards and a big communal mug. Each card represents a different action, and the players go around the circle drawing cards. Sometimes you'll have to drink, sometimes you'll have to pour some of whatever you're drinking into the mug, and sometimes you'll have to freestyle rap. Whoever draws the last King from the deck chucks the mug. You can also make up rules as you go along. Good times.

Play Quarters. This simple game involves trying to land quarters into drinks and doling out drinks to the other participants accordingly. It's like an adult version of tiddlywinks.
Play a movie-themed drinking game. Watch Star Wars and take a sip every time Luke complains about something, or watch an episode of Seinfeld and take a drink every time Kramer says something that doesn't make sense. Watch the local news and take a drink every time someone says the name of your town.
Use Edward 40-Hands with caution. In this game, two 40 oz. bottles of malt liquor are taped into the players' hands, and the bottles cannot be removed until both are gone. It can be a hilarious house-party game, and it can also end with someone smashing a bottle on the bathroom floor and crying. Probably not best for a 21st.

, A house party is a great opportunity to make booze art. Before everyone gets there, spend some time with your roommates building an elaborate robot out of the beer cans that everyone will drink, or make a ""birthday cake"" that is made of beers. Instead of cutting the cake, everyone should have a beer.


As you start to accumulate empties, use them to make wizard staffs, taping the cans together. Make the two people with the longest staffs fight each other in a wizard's duel, or use all the empties to make a big tower of cans and act out scenes from Lord of the Rings. Have fun with garbage!

, You don't have to have a fancy charcuterie plate ready to hand out to guests, but a couple of bags of Doritos might come in hand when the drinking munchies come on in a few hours. You don't want people to be coming and going from the party looking for snacks, so it's important to stock up for when the time is right.

, If you've got some stragglers, don't be afraid to ask everyone to leave. It's your party. Especially if the noise level is getting too high and you're getting worried about the party getting cracked up, call a cab and kick them out when it arrives.


Don't make a big deal of it, just say, ""Cool, this has been fun, but the party's over. I called y'all a cab. I'm going to sleep. See you guys later.""
As the host, you need to take some responsibility for the sobriety of your guests. Make all the keys go into a jar when everyone gets to the party, and let a sober person control the jar. Don't let anyone leave with keys who has been drinking. If you're concerned about the drunkenness of anyone leaving the party, have a guest room prepared so they can sleep it off safely.

Party like Taylor Swift.,
Indulge in other ways.,
Plan an elaborate cooking project.,
Head to a concert or show.,
Go to a different kind of bar.",How to Celebrate a 21st Birthday4," Just because you can drink now doesn't mean you have to. Celebrate with your family or some close friends, have a good meal, and a quiet night at home with your pets. That's what Taylor Swift did for her 21st.


Sometimes the pressure of having a big ""blowout"" can be a little much. It's not for everyone. It can be a whole lot more enjoyable and relaxing to stay in, rent a movie, and be with the people you love. Treat it like any other old birthday.

, If you're not going to drink, splurge in some other way. Make 21 cupcakes from an amazing recipe you found on Pinterest and eat more of them than you're willing to admit online. Make your most favorite rich meal and enjoy it with your family.


Splurge for your birthday. Instead of wasting money on drinks, buy a new dress or a new suit and get a table at a fancy restaurant you've always wanted to try. Have a romantic dinner with your partner. Have an extra piece of cake.
Do 21 shots of something else. Do a mock version of the unfortunately common drink challenge. Pour yourself 21 shots of root beer, OJ, or protein shake, and play a drinking game. It'll be tougher than you think.

, Turning 21 is about more than turning the legal drinking age. It's about becoming an adult. Being an adult for you might mean taking on new challenges, projects, or crossing something off your bucket list. Maybe accomplishing a semi-complicaged cooking project might be a fun way to spend your 21st. Eat a cake that you baked from scratch, or try the perfectly cooked steak. Here are some helpful links to common cooking projects, that'll be easier than you think they are:


Make Pie Crust
Make cupcakes
Make lasagna
Make gnocchi
Make sushi

, A great way to spend your birthday is scoring tickets to a big show you've always wanted to see. Get front row seats to your favorite band, or go check out a play or a musical, if you're more interested in the stage. Pick something that you'll enjoy and head out with a few close friends for a night you'll be sure to enjoy.

, Milk bars, oxygen bars, oyster bars, cereal bars, even chocolate bars can all simulate the bar experience without having to worry about negotiating the alcohol. If you know about a hip place that caters to a singular item, check it out and enjoy sampling the fancy items like adults.

Avoid distractions.,
Start the diet by focusing on your faith.,

Reserve time with God during the day by studying the Bible.

,
Seek the Lord diligently for the answers to your prayers.

,
Ask for God's guidance in your life.
,
Make your meals somewhat lighter for a few days leading up to your fast.,
In the first Book of Daniel, the Prophet ate only vegetables and fruit, and drank only water for 10 days.,
Conversely, there is also an agreed upon list of foods to avoid.,
Carefully read food labels.,
Move to stage two.,
Assess how you feel after the two stages.",How to Do a Daniel Fast," This is a sacred time between you and God, so avoid secular television and radio programs.;
, Worship God through sacrifice and love Him more than His gifts.

, Your days should be filled with unselfish prayer. During the fast, increase the frequency of your daily prayer time by a factor of three or more.

,,,, It's an especially good idea to reduce your intake of caffeine.

, A short rundown of acceptable foods include:


All fruits and vegetables
All legumes
Whole grains
Nuts and seeds
Tofu
Herbs and spices.

, Keep in mind that no artificial or processed foods nor any chemicals are allowed in the Daniel Fast.


All meats and animal products
All dairy products
All deep fried foods
All solid fats.

, Foods often contain hidden ingredients. Make sure the foods you buy are compliant with the Daniel Fast.

, In Daniel, Book 10, the Prophet went on a second, 3-week fast. To quote the Bible, Daniel ""ate no pleasant food, no meat or wine."" The second fast is basically the same as the first fast, but the text specifically names three things to avoid:


Wine
All sweeteners (including honey)
All leavened bread.

, If you feel more energetic and healthier, it is likely that you will want to keep up healthier eating habits. While reintroducing many of the items you've not had during the fast is inevitable, you may want to do so with greater consciousness for quality and portion size. And some things, like fried food and sugar are best kept to a new minimum.

Have a clear reason to convert this person.,
Have a clear understanding of Christianity.,
Pray.,
Understand their religion as well.,
Invite him/her to church!,
Be kind to others.,
Be a best friend.,
Don't get discouraged.,
Discuss ""Be peacemakers"".,
See the larger picture.",How to Convert a Muslim to Christianity," Why do you want to convert this person to Christianity? Do you want to prove something to others? Do you feel obligated to do it? Has God put this desire in your heart? Or do you just really love and care for this person and want him/her to go with you to Heaven?;
, Are you a devoted Christian? Do you put God first in your life? Are you a good example of how a Christian should be? Make sure to have a close relationship with God. Attend a church every Sunday, read your Bible, have quiet times, and of course ...

, Prayer is the number one factor here. If you want to convert your Muslim friend to Christianity, you have to tell God first! Tell Him how you feel, and really open your heart to Him, so that He can see how devoted you are, and so that He can help you overcome this challenge and achieve victory. Remember to pray daily and to include your Muslim friend. If you friend is sick or has pain you can also ask to pray directly for them and if they accept and Jesus heals them you then have Jesus backing up your words with His power. Have faith, both in God and in yourself.

, This knowledge may come in handy, especially when it comes to discussions.



Be persuasive, but be respectful. You'll be more successful if the other person doesn't feel threatened, so don't insult their faith, or they'll simply become defensive and stubborn (not because they're Muslim but because they're human). Likewise, don't try to force them to convert; it's disrespectful and will not work.

, If your friend won't attend church, then introduce that person to some of your Christian friends so that he/she can feel the warmth and love that we share with each other.


""Why should I go to church?"" Share your testimony (story of how you came to know Christ or of what God's done in your life) or have a friend share their testimony.
Talk about salvation, but don't overdo it — even if you're friends, they'll see you as preachy and tune you out. Again, the goal is to lead by example. Don't talk about doom and gloom and things to come.

, Showing a good example is also a big key. Be kind, not only to him/her, but to everyone! Always have a smile on your face and always be happy, for God always wants our light to shine. Our actions can have a great impact on others — remember that talk is cheap, but actions are worth so much more.

, Be there whenever you can. If your friend is in a bad situation, don't just sit there and pity them, but rather, do something for them! That way they can see how extraordinary you are.

, Your friend may not ever want to become a Christian, especially when they state something like: ""The Bible is a product of man . . . . Not of God (what about the Qur'an) The Bible did not fall magically from the clouds. Man created it as a historical record of tumultuous times, and it has evolved through countless translations, additions, and revisions. History has never had a definitive version of the book"" from The Da Vinci Code (as referenced in the below-cited essay), but as the essay goes on to say, that shouldn't stop you from spreading Jesus message, nor from turning people (Muslim or otherwise) towards peace.


Remember, even if the person doesn't become a Christian when you are talking to him/her, your witness can make a lasting impact in that life and in a circle of influence, and may be nurtured to accept Christ later.

, Jesus said, ""Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the Sons of God"" (Matthew 5:9). Point out that Jesus/Isa is the Prince of Peace in the Bible. He calls his followers to bring peace to conflict or peace will have little meaning. We may intervene or interfere in warlike situations. We are to bring love and peace, joy,... with us -- Why?: ""...brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you"" (2 Corinthians 13:11).

, Jesus told his disciples in Luke 10:16, ""Anyone who accepts your message is also accepting me. And anyone who rejects you is rejecting me. And anyone who rejects me is rejecting God, who sent me.""

Make an effort to get along with them.,
Try to talk to your Stepparent.,
Don't slander.,
Keep your attitude at bay.,
Remember to let out your pain.,
Try your best.",How to Live with a Step Parent," It's a common thing that personalities clash. In this case, there is an individual taking the position in the household as the substitute 'Father' or 'Mother' of the household. They may not be your biological parent but they still have the same role and responsibility. To make the dynamics of the household livable and comfortable, try to get along with your Stepparent as best as possible by making an effort to be civil and cooperative.


This will also make your biological mother or father whom also lives with you pleased because you are making a considerable effort in contributing to the dynamics of the home.;
, Don't refuse to chat if they're in the room or go places with them upon their request. You could try asking your Stepparent if they want to do some sort of recreational activity to bond. This will smooth out the rough edges that result in awkwardness.

, Avoid complaining about your Stepparent to your biological parent or any other member of the family. This could cause some confrontation between the two and also issues with you and your Stepparent. If you have an issue with your Stepparent, you should try going to them about it openly. That will prove that you are mature and in a way, worthy of their respect.

, If you have acquired an attitude or feel one brewing that portrays some sort of repelling to their presence, Try to address the issue by writing down things that cause you to have such a sentiment toward them.


Another way to keep your attitude at bay, is by keeping in contact (if possible) with your other biological parent that has now been replaced with your Stepparent. If you have a mutual relationship with them, spending time with them releases the sourness you might impose on your Stepparent.

, It's completely rational to feel frustrated about having a Stepparent, because ultimately you hoped your biological mother or father would stay in their parental position and now that they aren't there, the dynamics have changed. Just make sure you speak about your feelings to friends, take deep breaths every now and then and think about how happy your parent is to be remarried.

, If your Stepparent really has some issues with their personality and you really can't get along with them as best as you hoped, just remember that one day you will move out from their headship, just try your best for the time being.

Don't forget grieving is healthy, but don't dwell on the problem.  Accept what has happened but don't mope around feeling sorry for yourself all day.;
,


Decide what you can do to fix the issue.  Be completely honest with yourself.  Sometimes it can help to come up with ridiculous ideas to soothe yourself (I could summon a genie who would cure her and bring her back home).

Avoid sabotaging the faith and your prayer life: so avoid accepting and feeding your mind on non-faith from negative materials.,
Expect, but do not accept the confusion, anger and low levels of respect from the media, some scientists, liberal theologians and modern-humanists.,
Check into the confusion about ""religionists"".,
Do not stumble over the ""unbelieving-belief"" of anyone who is not an example of believing God i.e.,
Do not allow yourself to be confused or surprised by the ""disbelief"" or any ideas of people who do not believe in the things that you do.,
Do not be awed by the anti-god, anti-religious variety of argument.,
Don't hold your breath waiting for reasonable credit or respect for religion and the faith even though it is a constitutional right or a guaranteed freedom.,
Appreciate Inorganic Matter as it exemplifies the weakness of believing (and saying) that life's origins were from non-organic material, ie: do they really scientifically know that: ""Life produces life: they know nothing who do not know that."",
Consider: ""Life is not scientifically known to come from non-organic sources... based on either faith in science or faith in God."",
Do not worry about why non-believers want to ridicule, write articles or sell books against believers and God.,
Expect discriminating opinions as bizarre, biting or biased (skewed, slanted and sassy) portrayals about God and His own.,
Hold onto the faith, hope and love that you have.,
Use Laws of Science to Discover Faith if that helps, but recognize that the faith is not based on intellectualism.",How to Avoid God Confusion or God Delusion (As a Christian)," Be firm, positive and pray to Jesus for guidance. God gives The Holy Spirit with power for believers and guardian angels ""For He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways."" (Psalm 91.11) First and foremost be aware that what opponents to the faith are saying or writing may be intended to create doubt and fear. Understand, before you read a book, what the author's motivation is. Do some research on the Internet to find out about the author, and what their agenda may be.;
, There are many things to consider about low enthusiasm from many believers and ""unbelievers"" alike. Yet, you must resist the humanism of the times; you can act as a Christian ninja and resist such things by the Holy Spirit and in spiritual warfare!


Avoid hate, anger or despair over that media or those people who are challenging belief in God or even trying to make belief in God seem like a mental disability.

, Understand how they are and how they differ from your own Biblical standing.

,:


theist - Someone who conceives God as personal, present and active in the governance and organization of the world and the universe.
pantheist - Someone who believes that the physical universe is equivalent to a god or several gods, and that there is no division between a Creator and the substance of its creation.

, You may think that kind of person is a ""believer,"" but consider the facts; what does the fruit of the person's life reveal.

, Such arguments deserve no credibility in any area of belief about God. They do not know or ""know-about"" the real God! A conscientious scientist might leave religion alone, if one has ones own or professes accepted theories of getting life from non-organic sources/origins but not from a ""Spirit."" Religion receives little or no respect from such vocations as scientists, but rather negative statements on faith and religion, which is not a faithful use of their faith in science.

, Those guarantees don't mean that God or believers will receive anything except arguments as those people allow little or no room for living by faith.

, If they believe that single cell life came from some kind of bubbles in primordial soup, then they should be able to see that God could make that happen, if He wanted to. That would be a cause and effect.


All one has to do is accept that one is not faithful to science (to say nothing of God) if one is not aware that life comes from ""life""...
Life is scientifically known to come from life in some manner (according to logic and facts).

,




God is ""the way, the truth and the life.""



, Of course, they want to make money and make a ""name"" for themselves. Just help your fellow man and be motivated by the thought that he will burn in hell if... think it over and show your faith.

, Read, listen or view these kinds of works at your own risk. Pray effectively: Let no one persuade you to doubt -- but if you do: you can get out of it, and believe.

, It's your soul, and eternity is in view... You, your child, and your nation will need strong faith to see the hard-times of the future sweetened, to be palatable. See the next generation through the bitterness to come!

, Teachings against Christianity and/or God are not necessarily honest factually, and unbelievers may use hypocrites and cruel persons from the past to attempt to discredit the faith. Your faith should not be based on humanism, hypocrisy or cruelty of people, but on God's love and your beliefs that you hold, fastened and sure.

Ask yourself the question, ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"",
Ask, ""Where did design come from, if there were no designer?"",

And just because someone gives you any answer, and they have a degree behind their name, does not mean its an answer worth accepting. So if science can’t answer this question, why can’t religion? What is so bad about religion that it cannot be used to answer the hard questions to life?;
,


Everything comes from something equal or greater than itself. For example: A vehicle came from a factory, the factory came from a mind of a person and a person came from… Well, can you think of anything greater than man? GOD! You wouldn’t think a house appeared there from nowhere would you? Nor would you say it created itself. Those are the only two options you have when you eliminate God. Either we created ourselves or we came from nothing. Neither are logical or reasonable in any way. So that leaves an intelligent designer.
But many will say, “Where did the intelligent designer come from?"" Well, we can use these 4 options. (These are the only options anyone can come up with). Either God created himself, came from nothing, was created by something equal or greater than himself, or God always existed. Even though putting an all powerful God by our own limited mind is illogical on its own, I believe the obvious answer and most logical would be that God always existed.

Why? We know nothing can create itself because it would have to exist in order to create itself, and if it already exists, than it doesn’t need to create itself. So option 1 would be a paradox and fails logic. Option 2 is basically the same thing, but just saying “nothing” created God. So where did “nothing” come from if it doesn’t exist? Option two fails logic. So option 3 and 4 are most logical. But since God has said in His word the Bible (which I will get to later on why the Biblical God is the most logical God that exists) that He is the alpha and the omega (Revelation 22:13) the beginning and the end, this means that God always existed or at the least, existed for a very very very long time. But infinite time does not mean an uncountable amount of time, it actually means “no” time. Which fits just fine with the fact that God always existed. God transcends time. Also, God cannot die, which means He doesn’t rely on anything to support His “life”, further proving God is the perfect creator to create everything.

, Its simple, if you take God out of the equation, everything collapses about the concept of life. You are left with a subjective definition of life. Since subjective truth is not actually truth, you are left with nothing but empty theories that will never hit a satisfactory point where you say “that’s it! that's what life is all about.” As long as there is death, poverty and sickness, any theory removing God out of they equation will leave any reasonable explanation out for our existence too. Atheists often say “if God existed, there would be no poverty, sickness, etc.” That is just like saying that if you give a poor person a million dollars, he will never be poor again. Having money does not make one “secure” from poverty because he can do what he pleases with the money, including not use it at all and stay poor. The same is true with God, the condition of the world has no baring with his existence. If God is powerful and created everything, that means he can do what he pleases with his creation. Nor does he have to explain what he does with his creation. At best, you could say that God is a poor manager of the world. (But God is not like that, God is very good. The Bible says that God is merciful and allows a level of free will because he does not want to control people and make them do good. Also, this life is not all there is, but heaven is the place where everything is perfect and good.)

, No scientist can explain why these things exist. Many animals lack some of these and have no problem surviving. No one can deny the enjoyment of these things yet atheists and scientists give “nothing” credit for these things, carefully making sure they don’t say the word “created” or “designed” when talking about these subjects.

, As addressed above, if God were considered bad for allowing evil in the world (which he is not), that doesn’t mean he doesn’t exist. Also, what is keeping the planet spinning? What is causing rain to fall, the sun to shine, plants to grow, babies to be born, gravity to hold things down, etc.? Why wouldn’t there be an ultimate governing force keeping all these things together? Why does the concept of “nothing” getting credit as cause seem so much better than the concept of an intelligent designer?

, If all this (planets, stars, animals, plants, colors, etc.) came from nothing, what would the world be like if there were a God? If a God can’t create all this, he’s not much of a god. And besides, no one seems to have a solution or reason for death. Why must we die? If your definition of God is just a cosmic “manager” who would supply all your needs, what difference is that from a Genie? So if your version of God is not all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, and having higher requirements for morals and spirituality, you don’t have much of an imagination.

,



Realize that God would speak either directly to us or through someone to us, or through a book. Fortunately we have all three available. Unfortunately we have many versions. So this brings us to the question: ""Are all gods the same, and if not, which one is the true god?""

Consider ""Pascal's Wager"" (argument in apologetic philosophy) states it well when he says, ""It makes more sense to believe in God than to not believe. If you believe, and God exists, you will be rewarded in the afterlife. If you do not believe, and He exists, you will be punished for your disbelief. If He does not exist, you have lost nothing either way.""Expect Atheists to try to discredit the Word strongly with mostly incomplete Bible references, and saying God punishes wrongly (not knowing the plan of salvation), and that life should be lived to the fullest (not addressing that if it ends, what's the point of living life to its fullest, and what do poor, blind, and handicapped people do about this). A person should ""wager"" as though God exists, because living life accordingly has everything to gain, and nothing to lose. Why risk an eternity of pain to live a short life of meaningless pleasure? The value of believing is always greater or equal to the value of not believing regardless of the likelihood that God exists. See Pascal's Wager above for his logical conclusion as to believe God exists.
Since not believing in anything and believing in something that is not, comes to the same conclusion. So believing in something that could be true gives you better odds. Since no other religions promise can contend with the infinite bliss offered by Jesus Christ, you can drop all other religions out of consideration. Therefore, following the God of the Bible is a win-win situation. The Bible is the book that best represents what God would say to mankind.

,



Eliminate the choices of religion with reason/logic: atheists get hung up on the ""dilemma of the wrong hell"" and ""which religion/god is actually worthy of following"". Using deductive reasoning (not personal opinion), one can come to the conclusion that Christianity is the best religion. Whichever religion (when compared to each other) has the best answers for life's questions, has the most evidence for its validity, and can stand up to scientific scrutiny the best (specifically compared to other religions) and doesn't irrefutably and fully collapse under this scrutiny, then that is the best religion to follow (assuming for this argument that one would follow a religion for the sake of Pascal's Wager).

Compare religions that teach a personal God, while others teach an impersonal one. They cannot all be true. If they cannot all be true, it cannot be true that all religions lead to God. This also means that some religions are, at the very least, false in their claims to reveal the true God (or gods). Remember, truth does not contradict itself. If God exists, He will not institute mutually exclusive and contradictory belief systems in an attempt to get people to believe in Him. God is not the author of confusion (1 Corinthians 14:33).
Follow-up on the idea, that if there is only one God (if monotheism is true), then all religions that teach polytheism and pantheism would then of necessity be false. And if it is true that God is a personal God, then all religions that teach an impersonal God must be false. There can only be one reality. Another criteria to choose a religion is in its historical, archaeological and logical significance. Whichever religion's claims in its doctrine is the least verifiable by this criteria, it can be ruled out as well. Also, the inability to prove or say that God absolutely does not exist allows the question to be valid enough to ask. All facts must be weighed before making a claim.

, Eastern religions say those who die will be reincarnated. Now a person could go to heaven or hell, or be reincarnated, but he cannot go to heaven or hell and be reincarnated at the same time. Both views cannot be right. One must be wrong. We could say the same about each of the doctrines of the various religions. So it follows that either A) all of the major world religions are false, or B) only one religion is true. For the necessity of understanding fully the argument, I will briefly go over the core beliefs of some major religions compared to Christianity.

Hinduism, the highest of all truths is believed to be the truth of all religions. With the law of non-contradiction, this teaching cannot possibly be true. Hinduism teaches that our individual identities are part of a large, divine illusion called Maya. In other words, we do not really exist as individuals.

Islam, let's compare Jesus and His teachings to that of Muhammad. Jesus birth was foretold in hundreds of prophecies. Muhammad has no prophecies foretelling his birth or mission. Jesus was miraculously born of a virgin. Muhammad, however, was born of the natural union of a human father and mother. Jesus lived a sinless life (2 Corinthians 5:21) and is considered sinless by the Qur’an (called an all-Righteous one). Muhammad, however was someone who needed forgiveness for his faults (surah 40:55, 41:19). Jesus performed many miracles to substantiate His claims (Luke 7:22), but nowhere in the Qur’an does it state that Muhammad performed any miracles. None of Jesus enemies could find any fault with Him, but even the Qur’an states that Muhammad took his son Zayd's wife from him (sura 33:36-38). Finally, Muhammad is dead today. His grave is in Medina. Jesus is alive forever. There is no body, fulfilling his prophecy (Jesus' life can be verified by secular records).

Buddhism, Buddha also fulfilled no prophecies. Although Buddhists believe that his birth was miraculous (his birth mother claimed to have had a vision of a white elephant entering her side) he was conceived naturally by his mother and father who were definitely married, by the time he was conceived. He became enlightened on his own, and did not rise again from the dead. Buddhism teaches that the question of God's existence is meaningless. Buddha believed in reincarnation. He taught that every evil thing we do ties us more tightly to the cycle of rebirth. Buddha taught that a person can escape the cycle of reincarnation and enter nirvana only by following the ""Noble Eight-fold Path"", a strict ethical system. Buddhism offers no personal salvation. It stands against sin and immorality, but it ignores the issue of God's existence and our need for redemption. At its root, Buddhism is a form of agnosticism or at least practical atheism. At the most, it is polytheism, because although it doesn't believe a Supreme Creator, it believes in numerous non-creator deities. It provides no answers (true or imaginary) about the ultimate meaning of existence.

Animism teaches that the world is populated by a myriad of spirit beings that can be appeased and manipulated through ritual and magic. Animism is a large part of the Wiccan and Voodoo belief system and occurs commonly in occult and spiritual circles. It is also a large factor in the belief in ""luck."" The major weakness of animistic religion is that it is basically non-ethical.

Judaism: Since I believe that Jesus is indeed the promised Messiah of the Old Testament (extensive research is available to prove this), then automatically I must reject Rabbinic/traditional Judaism since they reject Jesus as the Messiah with no valid reasons. (The Bible also predicts that they would reject the true Messiah).

, Making a hasty assumption based on limited research about God or the Bible gets you nothing but the wrong truth. In order to follow something, you must know what it is saying, otherwise you will eventually insert assumption in the place of lack of knowledge and get skewed truth.

,

, Find out what God wants us to do. Now the Bible tells us how to live our lives. There is nothing in the Bible that can be considered, “burdensome” or “unnecessary”. You know why, because the Bible tells us there are two categories we must focus on when living this life, that is to love God and love one another. Does that sound hard? Well, in a sense it is hard, but many things in life are hard. Hard, does not mean its bad or unnecessary. So if we love God, what does that really mean? We use the 10 commandments to find that out. (Deuteronomy 5:4-21)



You shall have no other gods before me

This means God wants you to love Him above all things. A “god” can be a car or anything that makes you focus on out of adoration and admiration.



You shall not make for yourself a carved image.

This means basically the same as #1 except it is saying you should not worship anything but God.


Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.
Simple, if you love God, respect God, and see God as your Lord, you won’t use God’s name in a curse word, unseemly joke, or use his name carelessly.

Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.

When you get to know God, you will also want to know others who know God too. So going to a church or regular Christian gathering will be second nature.
If you do just these 4 things above, you love God. You are now ready to love others in a way that pleases God.



Honor thy father and thy mother (not necessarily do EVERYTHING they say, but to respect them)

Thou shalt not kill (also means to not hate anyone either)

Thou shalt not commit adultery (this also includes ANY sex out of marriage)
8. Thou shalt not steal (this includes pirated DVD’s and even a pen that is not yours)

Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor (don’t lie, PERIOD)

Thou shalt not covet (don’t envy what others have but be happy that they have something good)
If you love others, you will automatically fulfill the other 6 commandments. SIMPLE!

,


The short answer is ""Yes"". Why wouldn’t you want to know your creator? He has to be nice because, remember, He is greater than you are, which means He loves you and created you for a purpose (and it has to be a really good purpose because you are one of a kind.) Fortunately, God is knowable. One way to know him is through the Bible. People have been changed by the message of Love God shows in His word. Even though there are parts in the bible that are confusing at times, or some violent things that make you scratch your head, remember, to be loving is to hate evil. But is God still loving when He punishes someone? Here is an example: If someone were to attack your mother, you would want to fight to stop them. But would that be loving to beat up someone? That is not the issue is it? You want to stop evil from hurting someone that is good, right? God works in a similar way. God has to eliminate some people because they are evil or showing evil intentions and would start extreme evil to appear everywhere like an infection. So since God knows all things, He sometimes has to destroy people or entire nations to stop evil from spreading. God loves babies and children, too. Any child that dies before the age of accountability (which is 12 years old) goes straight to Heaven. Sometimes, if children grow up with the teaching of their evil father, they too will grow up evil. Why make them go through this, just let them go to heaven to be with God forever, is sometimes the best option. God is the ultimate judge and not every action will have an explanation, nor should you look for one. God is all powerful, He also says He is good, just and fair. So we should trust His words.

,


This is the question that everyone asks. Well the short answer is that life actually has only one purpose. And that is to get off this planet and into heaven. And the way to do that is making Jesus the lord of your life and obeying His commands of love for God and for each other. Life is actually “boot camp” for heaven where everyone will get their rewards based on how much the loved here on earth. This life on earth is actually a phase, a testing phase to give you your eternal position in heaven. If you look at this life any other way, you will be decided into thinking that this life is all there is and we should “enjoy life to the fullest”. Well, knowing that people die every day and every hour, young and old, rich and poor, we should focus more on what is after this life, than what is in this life.
And that is why God must exist. Without Jesus and without God, there truly would be no purpose to live, and life would be lived in fear of death. So “what you see” is not always “what you get”. It's “what you believe” is “what you receive”. Will you believe in the lord Jesus today? Will you receive his love, his promise of eternal life, and his promise to save you of your sins?

, I believe you exist, that you created everything in the universe and that you are all powerful. I respect this power and want to worship you. But I also want to love you like a friend and protector. I need your love to come inside me and heal me of all my fears, doubts and disappointments in my life. Jesus, I want you to be a part of my life from this day forward. I don’t want religion, I want a relationship. You promised to be a friend that sticks closer than a brother, and there are many who are experiencing that love now. I want to experience that love, too. So I pray, Jesus come into my heart and into my life. Put in me a desperation for you that I have never felt before; be everything that I have been looking for in this life. Be my purpose, my joy, my peace, my comfort, my provider, and my protector. Show me your glory, Lord in any way you want to reveal it to me. I want to be your son/daughter today. So take me to the next level, forgive me of my wrong doing and help me start new today, with you. I want to fellowship with other loving Christians, I want to read the Bible and see all the places where you say you love me, and I want to pray and worship with passion and adoration as well. Thank you Lord for choosing me, to experience this love. In Jesus name, amen.""

Ideally, have some understanding of Taoism.,
Join a Taoist Temple.,
Compliment your meditation with other practices.,
Develop your virtue.,
Choose your time and place wisely.,
Sit comfortably.,
Summon energy.",How to Practice Taoist Meditation1," Reading texts such as the Tao te Ching, the legends of the 8 immortals, the I Ching and other Taoist texts can give you some familiarity with the focus of Taoism. Taoism, like Buddhism, is not an affair of the intellect, but is based in the heart, with wisdom and gentleness.;
, These are very rare outside of places such as China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia (etc), but they are increasingly common in countries such as Australia, the US and Europe, or anywhere there is a large Chinese population. They tend not to be well advertised and are more frequently Neo-Confucian temples or shrines, (worshipping the 3 jewels of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism), so contacting a Chinese cultural centre in your home state can be a good step forward.

, Examples of these are Tai Chi, Qi Gong, chanting, spiritual Qi healing / reiki and Taoist rituals and offerings.


Rituals are a very important part of Taoism, generally as a means to train the body but also to train the heart and mind. They serve on occasion to invite heavenly protectors, create good tidings and to block harmful spirits. The supernatural, mythological and legendary play a large part of Taoist religion.

, Unless you are enlightened, virtue is an essential component as the mind will never settle in a wild and untrained heart. In Taoism, there are the 5 beauties of character - Kindness, Proper Conduct, Propriety, Wisdom and Trustworthiness. In Buddhism there are the 5, 8 or 10 precepts for lay people and Confucianist training has 8 virtues, but they all serve the same purpose.


Similarly in Buddhism, which meditators are more likely to have encountered, Taoism places great importance on gentleness and proper conduct as a foundation to meditation.

, Actually a fair number of Taoist meditations traditionally are done in the open space or wilderness of the forests and mountains. Small, stuffy rooms devoid of life are not ideal places. The air should be fresh and if indoors, apply principles of Feng Shui to make a more harmonious space. The time of day can also be important. Some practitioners find midnight an ideal time to meditate as well as between 11am and 1pm, but during a very hot, windy or stormy time is not good for meditation.

, This may be on a chair or cushion, you may also wish to lie down, but too much lying meditation may drain Qi, and promote drowsiness and cloud the senses.

, This optional practice is done as a protection, like a guardian angel, and is done by imagining someone you respect, ideally someone with similar qualities to that you wish to practice, so for wisdom you might humbly invite Lao Tzu or Buddha; for compassion, Guan Yin and so on; for general strength and energy, humbly invite your ancestors. They can be from any tradition as long as you have confidence in them. You may also summon inanimate energy from the landscape, the sky or the universe. Be clear that you are inviting wholesome guardian type figures and that the doors aren't open to any trouble-makers.

Start with ""Palms Up to Heaven"": From a standing position, keep both of your arms straight as you raise them above your head.,
""Draw the Bow"": From a standing position, lower into a squat until your knees bend to around 90 degrees.,
Do ""Separating Heaven and Earth"": From a standing position, raise your left arm at full extension sideways up towards the air (again as if you are reaching something).,
Try the ""Wise Owl's Gaze"": From a standing position, look to your left with your head so your chin and shoulder are in line.,
Move on to ""Sway the Head and Shake the Tail"".,
Do the ""Clenched Fists and Angry Glare"": With legs a fair distance apart, punch straight forward with the right and left arms alternately and repeat.,
Try the ""Two Hands Hold the Feet"": With legs straight, bend down and clasp your ankles with your two hands.,
Finish with ""Bounce on the Toes.""",How to Perform Basic Qigong Techniques," Make sure your arms are at maximum extensions (as if you are reaching for something high above you). Lower your arms back down to your sides, keeping them straight all the way through and then repeat.This exercise intends to increase organ vitality, and especially stretch the abdominals before harder work.;
, Reach your left arm in from of you at maximum extension meanwhile use your right arm (bent as much as possible) and pull backwards, similar to the action of drawing a bow. Switch arms and repeat. This focuses on stretching the back muscles and shoulders, as well as the chest.

, With your right arm, reach as far down as you can at full extensions. After a few seconds of holding this positions. Raise the right arms and lower the left arm into opposite directions (imagine a cork bottle opener with the two arms that go in different directions rather than the same). After holding this for a few seconds, repeat. Similarly, this is to improve back muscle endurance and slightly stretch the abdominals.

, Then slowly look over to your right and repeat. This is a neck exercise aim at making the neck flexible (pulling heavy weights can result in injury to the neck area).

, Move into a squatting position with knees far apart. With hands on your knee caps, look over your left and right shoulders alternately and repeat. This intends to be almost a whole body work out, with most of the abdomen moving, as well as the neck and the lower leg muscles contracting.

, The most physically demanding, this intends to increase strength and endurance in the arms, as well as hone punching technique in conjunction with the hips.

, Slowly return to standing position and repeat. This straightens out lower back muscles and as contracting the abdominals.

, Raise your body onto tip toes slowly and lower the body. Repeat. This mostly affects lower legs muscles but also improves stability.

Pre-plan to save the face.,
Practice good qualities.,
Get into a good frame of mind.,
Take the other side out for a meal.,
Invite the other side to present their case first.,
Use the humble position.,
Be gentle.,
Be hesitant.,
Know when to stop.,
Always move on.",How to Use Taoism in Negotiation," This is very important as a face saving gesture for the people sitting opposite you in a negotiation is valued and is central in Taoist etiquette, so it is always important to make sure the other side has at least some positive outcomes - a win-win situation essentially.


Ideally, as in all negotiations you should negotiate for what you want, but be prepared to fall back on what is an acceptable position to you, so it is important to know what that is. For example, you may like to negotiate for an extra $5 per hour pay rise, but if $2.50 is acceptable, then aim for $5, but if always be ready to compromise to the position that you are comfortable with (eg. $2.50). It is important to consider what you can give up to help things along - you may take on extra duties for that pay rise.;
, Generally in Taoism, is is good conduct such as being timely, speaking with good faith, respectful, competent and your affairs are in good order. This makes other people more confident in dealing with you but also makes you more confident in dealing with them.


Good conduct or propriety, as it is often known as, is a central quality in Chinese culture and is well respected due to its rarity and the personal development that you need to undertake.

, This may be to practice meditation, do some Qi Gong or Tai Chi, or just simply sit silently in the park and be around nature for a little while. This can help ease any tension or excitement, and can give a larger sense of perspective.

, Being generous and welcoming to the other side always softens any pre-existing hardness and a friendly environment over a delightful meal always gives a friendly outcome. If a meal is not possible, a morning tea or a simple coffee and doughnut can do the trick just as well. There is a lot of wisdom in the old term ""bring something to the table"".

, This may need some friendly small-talk on your part to break the ice, but generally if you have settled them into a welcoming environment it is easier to do so. By listening to their case you can understand where they are coming from and can adapt your position to make a more harmonious outcome.


The Tao te Ching suggests "" ... Those who look only at themselves see little. Those who justify themselves are not distinguished. Those who boast have no merit. He who brags will not endure long....""

, This may mean the underdog role but more properly means a receptive role. In all negotiation situations, presenting a stiff, inflexible position of authority is the exact opposite position recommended by Taoist philosophy, especially if it is a partnership or a conflict you are negotiating. The aim here is to listen to the other side's position and see how you can adapt both positions to create a generous outcome.


Naturally, wisdom is key in this area, because an unwise position of humbleness (often known as being a doormat) means people will try and take advantage of you in the business world, and in conflict, the person you negotiate with will not take you seriously. So balance is very important and you have to be aware of what this term means.

, A softer attitude overcomes a harder one and so presenting a sincere gentleness not only shows a strength of confidence and prowess on your part, but also helps to breakthrough or at least soften inflexible positions on the other. Being cunning, overly strategic and lacking in trust are qualities that Taoism does not encourage, as they never lead to a good outcome.


There is an important simile in the Tao te Ching; that favour and disgrace bring fear. This is because with favour or fortune, one is afraid of losing them, with disgrace or misfortune, they lead to a fear of greater difficulties. Essentially, you have to come to the table without any worries about your negotiation, otherwise they will cause obstacles.

, In all cultures only a fool rushes in, so although a good negotiator should have authority to deal directly, it can be wise to be hesitant in what you offer and to consult if necessary. Etiquette is very important as stalling a negotiation is not a sign of good faith, and if you aren't aware of all the facts then it puts you in a less able position, so this skill is better put as being patient, but also protect and honour where you come from.


The Tao te Ching uses another beautiful simile as ""...being hesitant as though crossing an icy stream; being watchful as though surrounded; being respectful, like a visiting guest""

, This is probably the most difficult of all because when you are on a roll, you can go too far and when you are not succeeding you may give away too much. The Tao te Ching is full of beautiful similes such as ""Better to stop in time than fill to the brim; sharpen a knife to its sharpest and it will soon be blunt; display your treasures and no one can protect them"" essentially means don't overplay your position, or talk too much.

, No matter what outcome you end up with, it is essential to move on and let today be today. That way you can do your work skillfully and not be hampered by past feelings, and that ability to move on lets you negotiate well.

Close your eyes.,
Imagine a ball of energy.,
Move the ball of energy.,
Breathe comfortably and deeply.,
Repeat the process for as long as you wish.,
Complete the meditation This is done by settling the energy ball back where you started at the lower dantian and allowing the energy to settle there.",How to Practice Taoist Meditation2," Imagine a point of energy at your lower dan tian, or in your lower stomach area. This is your centre of gravity and is usually a few inches below your navel or a few inches above your pelvis near the belly button and is the start position.

, Allow it to expand and contract gently until it is a size that feels right to you. Visualize it glowing with a beautiful colour or a pleasant feeling, and while it is very personal to your character, there is no right or wrong colour at the beginning, as long as it is beautiful to you.

, This is done in a cyclical pattern, typically from the start position at your lower dan tian, then to base of your spine, lower back, upper back, neck, top of the head, forehead, face, neck, heart and back down to your lower dan tian. You may do this in a continuous flow-cycle, or you may stop at each stage as you breath in, then out, or spend a few minutes at each location and then move on.


At each stage, imagine the healing energy from the ball flood that part of your body, releasing any tension or blockages while healing and cleansing the area.
You may allow the colour to change if necessary (it often will do this on its own) or it will let you know by not feeling right or complete. Allowing this energy to adapt will give the best benefits and you may change the colour until it does feel right. Different colours have different energies (see below section on colour healing).

, Ideally, breathe out to expand your lower stomach gently, and breathe in to contract your stomach. This is a natural and not a controlled movement, and is done by filling the whole lungs with air.


Ideally keep the tongue in a gentle contact with the roof of the mouth as that acts as an energy conduit.

, Beginners should start with half a dozen or so cycles, which can be 10 minutes long, but longer practitioners may go for as long as they wish. The longer you practice the more you should let go and allow the energy to move naturally until it forms a complete circuit.

, Allow your heart to be filled. Taoist meditation is a unique form of meditation that although similar to Buddhism has a far stronger emphasis on energy flow, healing, breathing techniques and visualizations. Taoist practices have a deep stillness aspect to connect with the power of the universe and gain deeper insights into the Tao and enlightenment. This tutorial aims to help you start and develop your Taoist meditation.

Close your eyes.,
Spend time here.,
Gently calm and clarify the mist.,
Expand the boundaries.,
Recognise the connection.,
Complete the meditation.",How to Practice Taoist Meditation3," Imagine your whole body relaxing and as it relaxes, it turns into cloud, vapor, smoke, mist or energy. You may also generate a pleasant feeling instead if your mind does not easily visualise. It typically retains the same shape as your body, but it doesn't matter if it doesn't.

, Spend a few minutes allowing the whole body to be consistent - tensions and blockages may express themselves as solids or voids in the mists and movements or currents in the mist often represent energy flow in the body, but can also represent your state of mind and so a busy or anxious state of mind can create turbulent mist.


If you wish, you may imagine this cloud or mist draining out of you through your feet while fresh mist is flowing in through your head, flowing just like a gentle river and cleansing, healing and replenishing your entire body.

, This should be done until it fully clear, but you are still fully aware of the boundary of the energy as your normal space.


This can take some time, so it is best to be in no hurry for this kind of meditation. Take care that you base this energy on love or kindness, as the next stage will not happen unless you are able to love the entire universe and everything in it, which means letting go of any troubles you may be experiencing in your daily life now.

, You will know when it is right by a sense of complete harmony in the body. Gently and slowly allow it to expand to fill the space around you, the room around you, then your house, your suburb and so on until you fill the entire universe. Don't be in any hurry for this to happen, you will generally feel this expansion rather than telling yourself where you are now. It might take a long time before you can expand even to the end of your room.

, By filling the whole universe, you and the universe are becoming one, combining together. Spend as much time here as you wish.


Gather and share your energy with the stars, the planets and all beings. Sharing your energy gives you more energy.

, Thank the universe and gently start to contract back down until you fill your space again. Essentially you are reversing the process. Allow the energy to settle inside your lower dan tian. Allow your heart to be filled with a gentle gratitude and rest for a minute with your eyes closed. Then gently move your body, rub your face and head to stimulate energy and open your eyes.

"
"
Close your eyes.,
Spend time here.,
Find any part of your body that is still.,
Take your time and unify or centre the stillness.,
Complete the meditation.",How to Practice Taoist Meditation4," Take time to relax your entire body and focus gently until the body becomes present to you.

, You should spend your time relaxing any blockages and imagining all your energy channels are opening. When you feel ready, move to the next stage.

, Essentially you are looking for general stillness in the body, but the whole body is, naturally, in a state of flux and movement. You are looking for the stillness within the movement.


A classical metaphor used in Taoism and Chan Buddhism is ""still, flowing water"". This ancient metaphor describes nicely what you are aiming for, it is a state of letting go that you become still, with the flow of time, energy and space happening without your interference, but with your complete acceptance and love.
This comes into Taoist philosophy as a ""returning to the source"". Again like Buddhist philosophy (which is why Buddhist and Taoist meditations can and often are used side by side), all things come from the Tao, which is nothingness or voidness, and this emptiness contains the whole universe. Returning to the source of this energy will not only replenish and heal but lead towards enlightenment. This is because the mind is fundamentally void and clear, and it is simply manifestations we see, feel and interact with, and these come from the emptiness - the Tao. When you deeply understand this, you will not be troubled by thoughts or feelings as you know they are simply manifestations, but you can return to the source; that beautiful, peaceful emptiness and stillness and you know nothing can contaminate your mind. It's also used in the old Taoist riddles and Zen koans of the original mind or nature.

, This is an advanced practice that may not immediately show itself to you until you are well developed in gentleness and kindness. Stay as long as you wish.

, Thank the universe and allow your heart to be filled with a gentle gratitude while you rest for a minute with your eyes closed. Then gently move your body, rub your face and head to stimulate energy and open your eyes.


Use this practice to create serenity as by knowing that the source of everything and nothing is within you, then many of your troubles can seem much smaller - even irrelevant - than they were before.

Live healthfully: The follower of Christ should regard his body as the temple of the Holy Spirit and therefore abstain from all intoxicating beverages, tobacco, coffee, unclean meats, and every soul-defiling habit and practice (1 Corinthians 3:16,17; 9:25; 10:31; Proverbs 23:29-32; Deuteronomy 14:3-20).
Uphold Christian standards: The followers of Christ should manifest true Christian modesty in dress and deportment and should shun all questionable worldly amusements such as the theater and dance (1 Timothy 2:9,10; Matthew 24:37-44; James 1:27; 2 Timothy 3:4,5).

Engage with other attendees and members and ask about their experiences with the church. Decide which one best fulfills what you’re seeking.;
, Ask if their church offers any specific programs designed for prospective members seeking to join.If not, inquire about the congregation’s process for joining the church.

, Inquire about what will be expected of you. At the very least, expect to:


Attend both regular services and additional activities.Support the church financially.Serve the church’s mission locally, regionally, and/or worldwide.Live your life in accordance to a commitment to Christ., Speak with the pastor about the level of commitment you intend to pledge to their congregation. Decide between being a full member, an affiliate, an associate, or a preparatory member.Full members join a new congregation on a permanent basis, with full voting privileges and the ability to run for church offices not held by clergy.Affiliate members join a new congregation on a temporary basis while maintaining full membership in another Methodist congregation. They may vote on issues effecting the United Methodist Church as a whole, but not on issues that solely effect their new, temporary congregation. To become an affiliate, provide the pastor with the name and contact info of your permanent congregation for notification of your new affiliation.Associate members join a new congregation on a temporary basis while maintaining full membership in another Christian denomination. They may not vote on issues pertaining to either their new congregation or the United Methodist Church as a whole. To become an associate, provide the pastor with the name and contact info of your permanent church for notification of your new association.Preparatory members are baptized children under the age of 18 who are still awaiting confirmation within the Methodist faith.While adults are welcome to join the UMC immediately upon receiving baptism, there is a delay for children so that they have the time to mature and absorb what it means to be a member and then make up their own mind about moving forward. Children generally begin taking classes to prepare for confirmation around the age of 12 or older. Speak with the pastor about attending classes., In order to join the UMC at any level of membership, you need to have been baptized within the Christian faith.Inform the pastor if you've already been baptized, since the UMC accepts baptisms performed by other Methodist congregations as well as other Christian denominations, so they won't require you to repeat it in either case.If you’ve already been baptized by another Christian church, either show the pastor a certificate or some other record of baptism, or contact that church and ask them to send you proof.If you’ve never been baptized, the pastor will do so during the service in which you become a member. Talk about your options beforehand. The UMC uses three methods for baptism: sprinkling water over your head, pouring water over your head, or immersing your entire body. Sprinkling is the most common, but if you prefer one method over the others, let the pastor know., Though most if not all services will include an opportunity for new members to join the church, speak with the pastor ahead of time to make sure all prerequisites have been fulfilled and preparations can be made; for example, if the pastor typically baptizes people by sprinkling water, but you choose to be fully immersed, arrangements will probably need to be made in advance. Decide with the pastor on a Sunday service to accept membership., Wait for the congregation to sing the hymn of response during service. When the pastor invites prospective new members to join the church, present yourself., If you've never been baptized before, allow yourself to be now. If you've already been baptized and shown proof, skip this step., Affirm your acceptance of Jesus Christ and your commitment to the United Methodist Church. Answer the following questions in the affirmative when prompted by the pastor:“As a member of Christ’s universal church, will you be loyal to Christ through the United Methodist Church, and do all in your power to strengthen its ministries?”“As a member of this congregation, will you faithfully participate in its ministries by your prayers, your presence, your gifts, your service, and your witness?”, Join the pastor at the end of service to greet your fellow worshipers as a full member of the church."

Put all of your differences aside and start with a new clean slate.,
Ask for forgiveness.,
Find God.,
Now that God is your life you can now forget your past and look forward into your future and ask God to help you everyday.,
After you accomplish this step the hard part will be over.",How to Become a Better Person and Become Closer to God," This may be hard but you must do it. Now to become a better person you must do this step, because this is the most important step. If you don't accomplish this step you will get nowhere.;
, If you have made enemies in you life, and which everybody does. If you have ever done anything hurtful to anyone or they think that you did something wrong, you must ask for forgiveness. Even if you think you haven't done anything wrong, just ask for forgiveness anyway. If someone doesn't forgive you then you must think to yourself that you did your part and be proud and move on.

, The way you find God doesn't mean you have to go to church. You find God with not your mind but your heart. You see the only way you find God is if you ask him in your life, but you must be truthfully honest with this step because God knows if you're lying. Once you ask him in your life and accept him in your life then this is the big turning point in your life.

, Now that you have God, this is the part where the Devil tries to get at you, because he doesn't want you to do good things he wants you to ignore God and do horrible things. This stage is always tough because you have to fight back and say no to the Devil. You must ask God to be with you more than ever during this part of your life.

, Now no one is perfect so you may still do some things wrong but here's the good part. You still have God and ask him to forgive you of your sins and he will. Now doesn't that sound amazing? I asked God to be in my life two years ago and I've had a few rough patches here and there but hey, everyone has those day's that aren't good. So this is the part where I end this particular advice. You must make a decision to become a better person and accept God into your life or not.

Close your eyes.,
Imagine a bright, beautiful colour.,
Allow the colour to flood your body.,
Let the colour cleanse you.,
Repeat for as long as you like.",How to Practice Taoist Meditation5," Take time to relax your entire body and focus gently until the body becomes present to you.

, It can be any colour you like, or you may choose one which has symbolic energy connections. Yellow for example, is useful for a busy mind and the stomach system, white is useful for the breathing system, as well as sorrowful emotions, green is useful for tension or anxiety and the liver system, blue is useful for fear and cleansing the kidney system and finally really red or pink is ideal for the heart system and the happiness & unhappiness emotion.


The colour that arises naturally at the time is usually best and may be symbolic, but it is best not to read into these things, it is a process of healing and complicating it will reduce or stall its effectiveness.

, If you wish, you can sense it as a wave from your head down to your toes, in a body cycle like small universe breathing (above section) or in anyway you like, such as a colour massage.

, As you breathe in, allow the colour to flood to where it is needed, such as an injury or illness, and then as you breathe out, imagine a dark smoke rushing out of your body, or if you are good at imagining, the smoke filling a waste bin.


As you do this, remind yourself that your channels are opening and blockages, toxins and diseases are melting away and leaving your body in the smoke.

, With this meditation, you will usually feel when enough has been done as it no longer feels necessary to continue. At this stage, thank the universe and allow your heart to be filled with a gentle gratitude while you rest for a minute with your eyes closed. Remind yourself with good confidence that your energy channels are open and cleansed and that healing has happened. Then gently move your body, rub your face and head to stimulate energy and open your eyes.

Leave everybody out of it; it’s between you and God.,
Realize that you are a sinner.,
Repent from sins, and change your mind about going your old ways.,
Find a Church that baptizes in the authority of Jesus' Name by His instructions in Matthew 28:19.,
Be glad, and rejoice, now that you have been forgiven (because when you ask for His forgiveness, He forgives).,
Stay connected with God.,
Remember these verses.,
When you need help ask Jesus and expect Him to keep His promises.",How to Be Saved Through Jesus Christ," You have probably heard this spill a ton of times but this “How To” can change your life! And, it’s as easy as 1, 2, 3.;
, Ask yourself these questions, ""Has anything ever been more important to me than God? Have I ever lied (a lie is a lie, no matter how small you may think it is), stolen (cheated on a test, took a piece of gum, etc.), hated (the Bible says it's murder in your heart), lusted, (the Bible says it's adultery in your heart), taken the Lord's name in vain (such as ""OMG!!!""), dishonored my parents, or been jealous of someone else's belonging?"" The Bible says that we have all sinned, and that if you've broken one commandment, it is the same as breaking all of the commandments (the whole law). All sin deserves punishment, and God is a just God. He should give you what you deserve -- Hell. However, He died for your sins and took your punishment, so that you can live eternally.

, That means turn away from sin at a heart level and trust and follow Jesus. On the day of Pentecost, Peter stated, ""Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."" (Acts 2:38), ""Go Ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost..."" Upon repentance and faith, God will then impart into you, His Holy Spirit. He will transform you and make you a new creation in Christ Jesus. He wants you to forgive others as you have been forgiven, love others as you are loved, and help others as Jesus also helps you.

, Be assured that evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost is that He makes you holy, and gives you gifts according to His own will (see 1 Corinthians 12)!

, Pray daily: Praying is vital and essential -- even praying for little things such as asking God to help with a test -- and for more serious things such as, asking God to help the doctors figure out what is wrong with someone close to you.
It’s very exciting to know that Someone is always there for you, and that is Jesus Christ. See examples of God answering our prayers.Read the Bible daily: What kind of relationship is it if you're the only one who talks? You will never know what God is telling you unless you open up His Word and listen in your heart for God to guide you in the right direction. He speaks in a still, small voice but, you'll know it's Him. He can guide you in all things you do.

, JESUS answered, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God""(John 3:5) Be born of the Spirit. according to the Bible as God's gift to you. ""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son that whosoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life."" (John 3:16)

, Casting all your cares (problems) upon Him; for He careth for (looks after) you. (1 Peter 5:7)


Jesus is someone you can count on. Talk to Him like you would to a friend, a close brother, and tell Him everything. He loves you as his brother or sister, so much that He laid His life down to take your death sentence and died in your place! The Holy Spirit will never leave you: He is your comforter and friend!

Read scripture regularly.,
Go to mass on a weekly basis.,
Talk to your priest, pastor, or reverend.,
Join a Bible or Christian group.",How to Become a Better Christian1," Having a knowledge of scripture will help you understand what God intends for you, and will help guide you. Read slowly, internalize the text, and see how it relates to your daily life. Many times, you'll have to read passages much more than once for the teachings to fully sink in.In 2 Timothy 3:16-17 it says, ""In All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.""The Christian Bible is made up of The Old and New Testament.
There are different translations of the Bible that exist, including the King James Bible, the Common English Bible, the English Standard Version, the Holman Christian Standard Bible, among many others.Talk to a member of your church to see which book is preferred for your congregation.
Reading scripture with others may give you different perspectives on the text and help you better understand it.;
, The purpose of mass is to unify Christians in worshiping and praising God's grace.Usually, during mass the pastor, priest, or reverend will perform a sermon which will have stories from the Bible and occurrences from real life. Not only does attending mass make your relationship with the Lord stronger, but it also gives you the opportunity to interact with other Christians.


Most Christian churches celebrate the Eucharist which is also known as The Holy Communion or The Lord's Supper, which is a reenactment of Jesus's last meal.Going to mass may clarify questions you have from reading scripture at home.

, If you have questions about scripture, mass, or your faith, a priest, pastor, or minister may be able to explain things to you. If you attend a Protestant or Baptist church, try visiting your priest after mass, or during the weekdays. Write down any questions that you have such as, questions that arise when reading scripture, questions about a sermon, or a dilemma you're facing in your life.


You can ask your priest by saying something like ""Do you have some time to talk about my faith? I have questions that I can't answer myself.""
In Catholicism, it's regular practice to confess your sins to the priest., Look online for Christian meetups in your area, or if you're younger, ask your parents if you can join your local church's bible group. Being around other people with the same faith can help solidify yours and give you unique insights into how other people praise God. Usually, churches will have youth bible study or classes to help you learn more about Jesus.


Your teacher will also have additional insights in how to be a better Christian.

Pray every day and talk to God.,
Listen to God.,
Incorporate the word of God in your day-to-day life.,
Visit Holy Christian sites.",How to Become a Better Christian2," In Christianity, prayer is the act of reflecting upon your actions and feelings and communicating them with God. While you pray, you can ask God to help you, seek his forgiveness for a sin you committed, or ask for guidance on a problem in your life.The more you truly reflect, the closer you will be to him.


In some forms of Christianity, there are pre-written prayers that you can recite like Our Father, Hail Mary, and The Apostle's Creed.Protestant and Catholic followers recite The Apostle's Creed while Orthodox Christians use the creed from Nicaea and Constantinople.When you talk to God, make sure that you turn off distractions like your cell phone or TV., God is around is everywhere you go and communicates through events that happen in your life. To listen to God, you need to have to be open and receptive to signs that he gives you. Also, you need to have a firm grasp of scripture and morality to be able to discern between personal desire and the desire of your Lord.Take the morality of Scripture and allow it to dictate your actions towards other people.


In Romans 10:17 it says ""Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.""

, When you do God's work, it makes you closer to him. Consider the scripture and morality when you make decisions, and always aim to help other people. The more that you abide by his word and live a good life the closer you will feel to him.


For example, if you need to decide on whether to lie or to be truthful at your job, consider that bearing false witness is a cardinal sin.
If someone comes to you for help and guidance, instead of turning them away, do what you can do for them.

, When Jesus walked the earth, he visited many places in what is now known as Israel. Traveling to Holy sites is sometimes referred to as a pilgrimage for Christians, and is meant to bring you closer to God. While many of the original Holy places are in Israel, many places are considered Holy around the world.


In Israel, some Holy sites include the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Mount Zion, Bethlehem and Nazareth.Other places across the world that are considered Holy include, Zaragoza in Spain, Vatican City in Rome, and Mt. Sinai and St. Catherine’s Monastery in Egypt."

Volunteer at a local homeless shelter or soup kitchen.,
Volunteer at your church.,
Treat people with dignity and respect.,
Help people who need it.",How to Become a Better Christian3," Jesus fed the sick, poor, and downtrodden on his journey to spread the word of God. When you do acts of good like help at a shelter or soup kitchen, it's part of being a Christian.Search online for shelters in your area and give them a call during business hours to inquire about opportunities to volunteer.


In Proverbs 21:13 it says ""Whoever shuts their ears to the cry of the poor will also cry out and not be answered."", The church that you go to will probably be involved in some programs in your town to help others. Some churches will take missions to go to poorer countries and help the people there and disaster response, while others concentrate on improving the neighborhood.Call your local church and inquire about any volunteer opportunities available.


The Bowery Mission in New York City is one example of a church with volunteer opportunities to help the homeless.Things that they might have you do is feed the poor, clean up a community space, or help fix up or repair things at the church itself.

, In Galatians 3:28 it says, ""There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.""This can be interpreted to mean that regardless of their beliefs or nationalities, you should treat all people with dignity and respect. Instead of spreading messages of hate because your theologies differ, extend the olive branch and talk to those that don't share the same belief systems.


Treat those in the LGBT community with dignity and respect as they are also God's children.
Discrimination, racism, and sexism violate the word of God., You can help simply by listening to family or friends when they are going through rough times. Be understanding and caring to those that need the help, and try to refrain from judgment. Think of simple ways to improve the lives of those around you.


You can also help in other ways like stopping for someone who needs assistance on the road or helping an elderly person with their groceries.

Draw people's attention to your best features.,
Smile often.,
Keep your life balanced.,
Be happy.",How to Find Your Inner Goddess1," Learn and make use of what makes you look the best for your shape, size and height. By dressing in a way that puts your best self forward, you will naturally elevate your confidence. This confidence is the first step to revealing your inner goddess.


For instance, if you are blessed with wide, deep, and beautifully coloured eyes, use makeup or clothing colors that help them shine.
If you have curves, consider wearing some curve-hugging clothes.
If you prefer modesty, that's fine too. There are plenty of wonderful options for dressing modestly and fashionably. The inner goddess will only shine forth if you feel comfortable and secure in your reflection to the world.;
, Everybody loves a beautiful smile. Smiling is also like a daily mini workout for your facial muscles. Facial muscles need regular workouts in order for them to be ready when you reach a certain age and your skin starts to droop.Smiling gives you an aura of grace and happiness, which can inspire others. By the time you can feel this aura, you have successfully revealed your inner goddess.

, A stressed woman is like the opposite of a graceful goddess. Don't accept too many tasks, assignments, or stressful things that make your head jumbled up and tangled. If you have no choice other than to do so, give yourself little breaks and keep it organized so that you don't have to do everything last minute. Doing everything at the last minute causes you to lose sleep, which results in terrible dark circles under your eyes. Not an attractive look. Getting enough sleep so that you look beautiful and feel refreshed every morning. Balancing your life can really pull out your inner goddess and keep you healthy and glowing.

, There is no way you can even feel a glimpse of your inner goddess if you don't find out what makes you happy. Keeping your spirits up and feeling some sort of happiness on a daily basis is crucial if you live in a busy place, have a crazy schedule or are loaded up with work and/or studies.


Feel free to indulge in a bar of chocolate after a long, stressful day.
Go ahead and let go of yourself at a karaoke booth with your closest friends after your exams have finished or that deadline is over.
While shopping is fun, don't overdo it. Consuming is not a solution to finding happiness. The inner goddess will only surface when you match what makes you happy internally with what you are doing externally. Shopping will not fill that hole.


Remember, your inner goddess can be revealed at any time, place, occasion... you never know!

As you write, picture the outcome of your want being successful. For example, if you want a happy gathering of your friends, as you write it down on the paper, you should imagine all of you together, smiling and jovial.;
, Pick your cord, being the colour and length you desire. The colour may be either of symbolism of your intention (i.e., love, so pink; or banishing negativity, so black), or it can be of your own choosing. The length, traditionally, is thirteen inches long. If you choose to use symbolism concerning your intention, a list of colour correspondences is listed under the Tips section.

, Tying the knot incorporates charging, chanting as you tie the knot, then drawing the equal-armed cross and dotting the knot with oil. The chant incorporates ""By knot of "" and then something confirming the success of your intention. Here is a famous chant by Silver Ravenwolf, one of the best-known Witches in the world.


""By knot of one, this spell's begun
By knot of two, my words are true
By knot of three, it comes too be
By knot of four, power in store
By knot of five, this spell is alive
By knot of six, this spell is fixed
By knot of seven, the answer's given
By knot of eight, I meld with fate
By knot of nine, the thing is mine!""

, 1---6---4--7---3--8--5--9--2


Disposal of the cord depends on the purpose of the spell. If you are using it for healing or love, keep the cord until it comes true, and then release the magick (by drawing a star over the cord while imagining draining energy) and subsequently burn it. If you are banishing negativity, immediately bury off the lot, far away.

, You have learned cord magick!

Try the Wu-Wei approach to locating your inner goddess.The expression ‘Wu-Wei’ comes from the Taoist beliefs and means “doing by non doing”.

,
Realize that all really essential things cannot be done.,
Stop looking outside.,
Trust your impulse.,
Look for fellow connections.,
Stop doing.",How to Find Your Inner Goddess2,", They can only happen to you. There is no real way “How to fall in love”, there may be a way to pretend that you are in love – but who wants to learn that? The goddess in you is already there, believe it or not. You do not have to do anything to create it. It is your deepest reality. But there are quite a few things that prevent you from feeling the goddess in you.


The most important mistake you can make is to look for your goddess in the eyes of other people. It is not important that other people see you as a goddess, what counts is that you feel your own divine quality. So it is not a good idea to pose a goddess and to show to others those sides of you that you think others may adore.
Stop wearing a mask.
Drop your false smiles.
You can even stop using makeup. You don’t need to make up anything to be a goddess because you already are.

, Cease to define yourself through the eyes of others. Look in. Get to know your body not by looking into the mirror but by feeling it from the inside in every detail of your body.


Become aware of your breathing, as often as possible.
Allow as much as possible times of silence in your day.
Respect your own rhythm.
Say “no” if you mean it. That creates space for the inner goddess to surface.

, Learn the difference of an impulse that comes out of your divinity and a move that comes out of the desire to be a good girl or to get some gratification.

, There are so many women on the way. Connect with them. Get to know about the many forms of the mother-goddess. For example: Gaiya, Kybele, Kali, Lakshmi etc. Sing their songs, dance their dances, chant their mantras, but always look in.


Don’t get lost in a new group-identity of Goddess-Seekers. Use the energy of these songs and mantras to stop more and more things that prevent the goddess in you to emerge.
Ambition is a major obstacle – especially the ambition to let the goddess to surface.

, Relax, trust, let go, melt into every moment. Become more and more aware of you the divinity around you and then it may happen to you. You will realize that you have been a goddess all along.

Look for the symptoms of a scarcity mentality.,
Focus on the abundance, not on the lack.,
Appreciate.,
Get organized.,
Get an abundance vibe from other people.,
Share the wealth.,
Create win-win situations.,
Remind yourself.,
When you face your greatest loss, it may contain your greatest opportunity.",How to Create an Abundance Mentality," If you have a scarcity mentality then you will probably take things too seriously. You may think to yourself: “If I fail, the sky will fall”. It won’t, though, and you know that and need to remind yourself. But you think it will, you become overly nervous and POOF! you have invited that failure because your negativity becomes an obstacle on your path to success. If it’s a game, then you may fumble with the ball. If it’s an exam, then you may not have been able to sleep and will perform poorly on the test. If it’s a date, you may come over as too needy and nervous and not as your usual, more relaxed self. Regain your empowerment by remembering all the opportunities you have been afforded and know that it is all a flow that will always continue.;
, What you focus on, you will see in your world. Since you can’t take in everything around you, your reticular activation system – your focus system in the mind – will bring into focus what you focus your thoughts on.
This will allow you to see the abundance in your world that you may be missing right now. If you, for instance, have a lack of money, then don’t focus on your lack. Focus and think about the abundance of possibilities in the world to make money. Soon ideas and opportunities to make that happen will start to “pop up” in your world. It’s almost a bit freaky how things that hold solutions for you – perhaps books or acquaintances – that have been there in the background for quite a while just one day suddenly jump out at you.

, One quick way to revert from the pretty normal habit of thinking about what you don’t have is simply to appreciate. Appreciate your food, life, your roof, your friends and family and so on. This can not only turn a sour mood into a more positive one within minutes, but it can also help you notice opportunities you have missed or forgotten about. And it'll create a more open vibe within you, a vibe that makes it easier to focus on the abundance. So, make a habit of appreciating something in your life for a few minutes each day.

, When you don't feel abundant or good about yourself or life in general, that can mean you are simply not in order. Have your home clean, your clothes folded, your digital files in place, and your finances organized. Have some order and discipline, and you'll start seeing results.

, Since you get a scarcity mentality from, say, advertising and media, then you can change your input to change your mentality. Cut down on watching the news. Record your favourite shows and skip the commercials. Or just cut down on your TV and media consumption, period.
Replace the scarcity vibe you get from that input. How do you do that? “Hang out” with people that have an abundance mentality. Read, listen to and watch personal development material. Besides reading your favourite personal development blogs, read success stories in books and magazines. Have a positive attitude to the abundance and success of your friends, family and co-workers. Hang out with people in real life who have more of an abundance mentality and less of a scarcity mentality. Be selective with what you put into your mind. Create your own environment of abundance.

, One very good way to acknowledge how much you have is to share it. Do you feel like you're not making enough money? Give some away. Not enough love? Give some away. Not enough validation, appreciation, recognition? Give it all away. It's hard for something to feel scarce when you're giving it away.

, People with a scarcity mentality tend to see every relationship is win-lose, as in: ""It's either you or me, buddy, and I want it to be me."" People with an abundance mentality, on the other hand, try to create mutually beneficial relationships in which both parties can win.Instead of winning an argument, for example, try to reach a consensus that you both can be happy with. Instead of competing, collaborate.

, It’s very easy to slip back into your old thought patterns. You just forget about what you should be thinking about. A useful tool to keep yourself from slipping is to use external reminders. You can, for example, use written notes posted at places you can’t avoid seeing several times each day – your workspace, fridge and mirrors – or put a bracelet on your wrist. Seeing words or quotes that remind you of your new abundance mentality can help your mind snap back into the right headspace once again.

, If you lose your job and are close to losing your housing, you could sell off anything you don't like, want or immediately need to cut back on your physical possessions. That means less to move, so starting over might as well be where you always wanted to live. You have to find a way to make a living, so it might as well be entry level in whatever you always wanted to do instead of just looking for a job, any job. Shoot high. Those crises are the point in life where everything that held you back can be left behind and moving toward something better than you've ever had will make any sacrifices meaningful. It's very different being frugal and living small because you're just starting out or living a reduced lifestyle viewed as a failure. Use the chance to give yourself something that money can't buy, like time and freedom.

Be more light-hearted at home and at work.When you're optimistic, it's easier to see the beauty in life and everyday objects and spread that feeling to those around you.",How to Develop Emotional Intelligence," It's easy to put your feelings about what you experience throughout the day on the back burner. But taking time to acknowledge how you feel about experiences is essential to improving your EQ. If you ignore your feelings, you're ignoring important information that has a big effect on your mindset and the way you behave. Start paying more attention to your feelings and connecting them to experiences.For example, say you’re at work and you get cut off during a meeting. What emotions arise when this happens? On the other hand, how do you feel when you get praised for good work? Getting into the practice of naming your emotions as sadness, embarrassment, joy, contentment, or any other number of feelings will start raising your EQ right away.
Get in the habit of tapping into your emotions at certain times every day. What are your first emotions upon waking? Your last before you fall asleep?;
, Instead of ignoring the physical manifestations of your emotions, start listening to them. Our minds and bodies are not separate; they affect each other quite deeply. You can raise your EQ by learning how to read physical cues that clue you in to what emotions you're feeling.For example:


Stress might feel like a knot in your stomach, tight chest, or quick breathing.
Sadness might feel like waking up with slow, heavy limbs.
Joy, pleasure or nervousness might feel like butterflies in your stomach, a racing heart or increased energy.

, When you feel strong emotions, how do you react? Tune into your gut responses to situations you face every day, instead of just reacting without any reflection. The more you understand what spurs your behavioral impulses, the higher your EQ will be, and you'll be able to use what you know to actually change your behavior in the future. Here are some examples of behaviors and what's behind them:


Feeling embarrassed or insecure might cause you to withdraw from conversation and disconnect.
Feeling angry might cause you to raise your voice or angrily stomp away.
Feeling overwhelmed might cause you to panic and lose track of what you were doing, or cry.

, All the emotions you have are valid, even the negative ones. If you judge your emotions, you’ll inhibit your ability to fully feel, making it more difficult to use your emotions in positive ways. Think of it this way: every emotion you have is a new piece of useful information connected to something that's happening in your world. Without this information, you'd be left in the dark about how to adequately react. That's why the ability to feel your emotions is a form of intelligence.


It's hard at first, but practice letting negative emotions surface and connecting them to what's happening. For example, if you feel bitterly envious, what is that emotion telling you about your situation?
Fully experience positive emotions, too. Connect your joy or satisfaction to what's happening around you, so you can learn how to feel them more often.

, It's another way to learn as much as you can about your own feelings and how they're connected to your experiences. When you have a strong emotion, ask yourself when you last felt like this. What happened before, during and after?


When you see patterns, you can exert more control over your behavior. Observe how you handled a certain situation before, and how you'd like to handle it next time.
Keep a journal of your emotional reactions, or how you feel from day to day, so you can clearly see how you tend to react.

, You can't help what emotions you feel, but you con connected to something that's happening in your world. Without this information, you'd be left in the dark about how to adequately react. That's why the ability to feel your emotions is a form of intelligence.

Keep a journal of your emotional reactions, or how you feel from day to day, so you can clearly see how you tend to react.

, You can't help what emotions you feel, but you can decide how you want to react to them. If you have an issue with lashing out in anger or shutting down when you're hurt, think about how you'd rather react. Instead of letting your emotions overwhelm you, decide how you’re going to behave next time your feelings grow strong.


When something negative happens in your life, take a moment to feel your emotions. Some people describe it as having a wave of sadness or anger wash over them. Once the initial wave has passed, make a decision about how you want to behave. Decide to communicate your feelings instead of repressing them, or get up and try again instead of throwing in the towel.
Don’t turn to escapist habits. It's not easy to let bad feelings fully rise to the surface, and many people tamp them down by drinking too much, watching a lot of TV, or turning to other habits that numb the pain. Do this often enough, and your EQ will begin to suffer.

, Openness and being agreeable go hand-in-hand when it comes to emotional intelligence. A narrow mind is generally an indication of a lower EQ. When your mind is open through understanding and internal reflection, it becomes easier to deal with conflicts in a calm and self-assured manner. You will find yourself socially aware and new possibilities will be open to you. To strengthen this element of your EQ, consider:


Listening to debates on television or the radio. Consider both sides of the argument, and look for the subtleties that require closer inspection.
When someone does not react emotionally the same way you would, consider why this is, and try to see it from their point of view.

, Empathy means being able to recognize how other people are feeling, and share emotions with them.Being a more active listener and really paying attention to what people are saying can help you get a better sense of how they're feeling. When you can use that information to inform your decisions and improve your relationships, that's a sign of emotional intelligence.


To improve empathy, put yourself in other people's shoes. Think about how you would feel if you were in their situation. Actively imagine how it must be to go through the experiences they're having and what might alleviate some of their hardship in terms of support and care.
When you see someone experience a strong emotion, ask yourself, “How would I react in the same situation?”
Be truly interested in what people are saying, so you can react in a sensitive way. Instead of letting your thoughts drift, ask questions and summarize what they’re saying so it’s clear you’re in the conversation.

, Make a point of trying to read between the lines and pick up on people’s true feelings by observing their facial expressions and other body language. Often people say one thing when the look on their face reveals that there's a deeper truth. Practice being more observant and picking up on the less obvious ways that people communicate their emotions.


If you're not sure that you're skilled at interpreting facial expressions, try taking a quiz to telling. A higher tone of voice indicates that someone's stressed.

, Understanding other people's emotions is only half the battle when it comes to EQ; you also need to understand the effect you're having on other people. Do you tend to make people feel nervous, cheerful or angry? What happens to conversation when you walk in the room?


Think about what patterns you might need to change. If you tend to pick fights with your loved ones, your girlfriend cries easily during conversations, or people tend to close up a bit when you come around, you might need to change you attitude so that you have a better emotional effect on people.
Ask trusted friends or loved ones what they think about your emotionality where you have room for improvement.A person's tone of voice can also be of impact. You may have trouble recognizing the effect you have on others, and they can help.

, If you say you’re “fine” and have a scowl on your face, you’re not communicating honestly. Practice being more physically open with your emotions, so people can read you better. Tell people when you’re upset, and share happiness and joy as well.


Being ""yourself"" helps other people really get to know you, and they'll trust you more if they see where you're coming from.
However, understand that there’s a line: control your emotions so as not to hurt others with them.

, Being intellectually capable is important in life, but being emotionally intelligent is just as essential. Having high emotional intelligence can lead to better relationships and job opportunities. There are four core elements to emotional intelligence that help you lead a balanced life. Read this over and decide where you might have room for improvement, then take steps to practice your skills in that area:Self awareness: The ability to recognize your own emotions for what they are and understand their origins. Self awareness means knowing your strengths and limitations.
Self management: The ability to delay gratification, balance your needs with those of others, take initiative and to pull back on impulsivity. Self management means being able to cope with change and to stay committed.
Social awareness: The ability to be attuned to other people's emotions and concerns, as well as being able to notice and adapt to social cues. Being socially aware means being able to see the power dynamics at play within any group or in an organizational context.
Relationship management: The ability to get along well with others, manage conflict, inspire and influence people and to communicate clearly.

, Stress is a catchall word for feeling overwhelmed by a variety of different emotions. Life is filled with difficult situations from relationship breakdowns to job loss. In between, there are myriad stress triggers that can make any daily issue seem much more challenging than it probably is. If you’re stressed a lot, it’s difficult to behave in the way you want to. Having a good plan for relieving stress improves all aspects of your EQ.


Figure out what triggers your stress, and what helps relieve it. Make a list of effective forms of stress relief, like hanging out with a friend or taking a walk in the woods, and put it to good use.
Get help if you need it. If your stress feels too overwhelming to deal with alone, seek the help of a therapist or psychologist who can give you tools to cope (and help you raise your EQ in the process).

, Optimism results in emotional well being and greater opportunities – people want to be around an optimistic person and this draws them to you, with all the possibilities that more connections bring you.


Negativity encourages people to focus only on what can go wrong rather than building resilience.
People with high EQ tend to know how to use fun and humor to make themselves and others feel safer and happier. Use laughter to get through tough times.

There will be moments that you feel more peaceful than others. Remember that you are a work in progress, and although you are always changing you are beautiful in every moment.

, Think only of what is at hand. Think less about the past or future. Today is different from the past.


Being mindful of each moment can help you feel centered, calm, and peaceful. Try a guided meditation available at http://www.mindfulness-solution.com/.

, It is easy to allow negativity into your mind by expecting or fearing unknown situations. Let go of bias and expectation. Be open to experience.


Letting go of the need for control will help you feel peaceful with life's unpredictable circumstances., Take time to do the things that make you happy. Satisfy your desires.


Following your own path is the road to inner peace. Try reaching out and connecting to others. This can help you feel peaceful and content., You are who you are. Take pride in your individuality.


Accept yourself for who you are. Self-acceptance should be unconditional: you deserve to love yourself, strengths, weaknesses, and all., Find contentment in where you are, who you are and what you are doing.


Accepting your life as it is and yourself as you are will help you to feel inner peace., Rectify your errors when possible. Relieve your mind.

While its always ok to share with others if that feels peaceful and freeing to you, never feel obligated to talk about your problems or journey unless you want to. Let no one interfere with your inner needs.


Avoid gossip. Friends who want to talk about others or who leave you feeling drained are toxic to your emotional health., Be kind and courteous. It warms your heart as well.

, See the beauty in everyone and everything. Noticing what is good about others, instead of what is bad, will help you to feel peaceful with the world.

To do this, one must be free of prejudice, ignorance, and dogma.The Philosopher is one who dwells in reflection and observation: they take every experience and seeks to understand it, even if doing so requires one to be brutally honest. This requires one to cast off the preconceived notions that one may have accepted in the past and subject all of one's beliefs to critical scrutiny. No belief or source of ideas is immune, regardless of its origin, authority, or emotional power. To think philosophically, one must think for one's self.Philosophers do not simply form opinions and chat idly. Philosophers, instead, develop arguments, based on premises that can and will be challenged by other philosophers.The goal of philosophical thinking is not to be right, it is to ask good questions and seek understanding.;
, Hundreds of years of philosophical thinking came before your own examinations of the world and, learning about the ideas of other philosophers will raise new ideas, questions, and problems to think about. The more philosophy you can read, the better a philosopher you can become.Few tasks are more important to the philosopher than reading. Professor of philosophy Anthony Grayling described reading as a duty of ""extreme intellectual importance,"" and suggests reading literary works in the morning and philosophical works later in the day.Read the classics. Some of the most enduring and powerful philosophical ideas in Western philosophy come from long-philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus,Hume, Descartes, and Kant, and today's philosophers recommend familiarizing yourself with their important works.In Eastern philosophy, the ideas of Lao-Tse, Confucius, and Buddha have been equally enduring, and deserve attention from any budding philosopher.At the same time, if you start reading something by one of these thinkers and it isn't stimulating to you, don't be afraid to set it aside and pick up something else that you find more compelling.You can always come back to it later.
Pursuing a bachelor's degree in philosophy is a good way to structure these studies, but many great philosophers were also self-taught.
Balance your copious reading with self-investigative writing: where reading broadens your perspective of the world, your writing will give you depth of understanding. Start writing down your reflections on the philosophical texts you are reading right away.

, Spend time thinking about the world, what it means to live, to die, to exist, and what the point of it is.These topics lead to big, unanswered, often unanswerable questions, questions only philosophers, young children, and other highly curious individuals have the imagination and courage to ask.


More ""practical"" topics, like those derived from the social sciences (e.g. political science or sociology), the arts, and even the physical sciences (e.g. biology and physics) can also provide fodder for philosophical thinking., While developing your critical thinking, you should take part in any debate you can. This will increase your ability to think freely and critically. Indeed, many philosophers see the vigorous exchange of ideas as an important path toward truth.The goal here is not to win a contest, but to learn and develop your thinking skills. There will always be someone who knows something better than you, and arrogance will hinder your ability to learn from them. Keep an open mind.Keep your arguments sound and logical. The conclusions should follow from the premises, and the premises should have evidence backing them.Weigh the actual evidence, and avoid being swayed solely due to repetition or ignorance. Practicing the construction and criticism of arguments is crucial to any developing philosopher.

, An important part of philosophy is the investigation and analysis of the world. Put differently, a central task of philosophy is finding ways do define and describe the fundamental structures and patterns of life, often by breaking them down into smaller component parts.There is no single, superior method of investigation, so you will need to develop an approach that is both intellectually rigorous and compelling to you.
The decisions you'll be making in this stage involve what sorts questions you'll be asking or relationships you'll be exploring. Are you interested in the human condition? Political arrangements? Relationships between concepts, or between words and concepts? Different areas of focus may lead you to different approaches to asking questions and forming theories. Your reading of other philosophical works will help you make these determinations by exposing you to the ways others have approached philosophy in the past.
For example, some philosophers only trust their minds and logic, and not the senses, which may at times deceive us. Descartes, one of the most respected philosophers in history, was one who took this approach.By contrast, others use their own first-person observations of the world around them as the basis for investigations into the nature of consciousness.These are two very different but equally valid approaches to philosophizing.
If you can, it's great to be the source of your own investigation. Since you're always available to yourself, any line of investigation about yourself (and there can be many) allows you to always make some progress. Consider the basis for what you believe. Why do you believe what you believe? Start from scratch and interrogate your reasoning.
Wherever you decide to focus your inquiry, try to be systematic in your thinking. Be logical and consistent.Engage in comparison and contrast, take things apart mentally to try to understand how they work, ask what would happen if two things were combined (synthesis), or if something was removed from a process or relationship (deletion). Keep asking these questions in different circumstances.There are 4 domains to help you think: convergent awareness (all existing understandings - your investigations will start here), critical thinking (logic and deduction), creative thinking (induction and extrapolation), and divergent thinking (free association and brainstorming). These strategies progress from what is known to what you wish to discover by increasing the cognitive window, and as such, are very powerful reflective tools.

, Write down what you think about the subjects of your inquiry, including ideas you think you shouldn't write down (possibly because you think others may think they are stupid). While you may not be arriving at any striking conclusions, you will be exposing your own assumptions to yourself. You will probably marvel at how silly some of your assumptions can be, and in the process you will mature.


If you don't know where to begin you can start with questions that other philosophers have explored before, such as how one should treat the existence of god, or whether we have free will or are controlled by fate.The true power of philosophy lies in the continuity of thought that you'll be maintaining in your writing. As you investigate a concern, a single entry may do little on its own, but as you return to that concern throughout the day(s), the different circumstances you encounter in a day will allow you to bring fresh insights to your investigation. It is this cumulative power of thought that will bring you to those 'Eureka!' moments.

, As you write, you should begin to develop your own philosophical perspective, arriving logical and well-considered ideas about life and the world. It is common for philosophers to adopt a perspective over time, especially about a specific issue. These are frameworks, patterns of thought. Many of the greatest philosophers have developed such frameworks. At the same time, remember to examine each issue with a critical eye.
The central task that underlies the effort of the philosopher is that of model development. Whether we're aware of it or not, each of us has an abductive model of reality that is constantly modified to fit our observations. We can employ deductive reasoning (e.g. ""given the existence of gravity, the stone is obviously going to fall when I let it go""), and inductive reasoning (e.g. ""I've seen that weather pattern many times; I'll bet it'll rain again"") to create this model of successive approximations. The process of developing a philosophical theory is the process of making these models explicit and scrutinizing them.

, Through several drafts, you should organize your ideas more formally and let others read your work. You can ask friends, relatives, teachers, or classmates to offer some thoughts on your work, or you can post your writings online (through a website, a blog, or a message board) and look for responses there.


Be prepared to receive criticism, and use it to improve your own ideas. Always remember to analyze the evidence presented in order to find understanding, and let the perspectives and critiques of others help you expand your own thinking.Be wary of criticisms that show little or no signs of thoughtful exchange (e.g. that your premise was understood, or even read). Such critics have assumed that they are thinkers without actually accepting the philosophical discipline presented here, but still feel they are entitled to philosophical consideration. Such 'debates' will go on fruitlessly and ad nausea.
After you receive feedback from your readers, rewrite again, incorporating any feedback you find useful.

, To successfully pursue philosophy as a career, you must acquire a doctorate or, at very least, a master's degree.


Earning a living from philosophy means using your knowledge and (hopefully) wisdom to produce original works of philosophical thought and, usually, to teach others about the field. In other words, the professional philosopher of today is typically an academic, and this requires an advanced degree.
Equally important, the rigors of graduate school will help you further your philosophical thinking. In particular, you'll need to learn how to write in the very disciplined style that academic journals demand.
Spend some time exploring the philosophy programs offered by a variety of different universities. Pick the ones that sound best to you and start applying for programs. Graduate school applications are are highly competitive, so don't expect to be accepted to the first program you apply to. It's a good idea to apply to several schools, ideally 10 to 12.

, Even before you have completed your graduate studies, you should begin the work of trying to publish your philosophical insights.


There are many academic journals that focus on philosophy. Publishing in these journals will help you gain a reputation as a philosophical thinker and improve your chances of getting hired as a philosophy professor.
It's also a good idea to present your work at academic conferences. Taking part in these events is a good opportunity to get more feedback from other professional thinkers and is good for your career prospects as well.

, Many of history's greatest philosophers have been teachers. Beyond this, any university that might want to hire you to study philosophy professionally will also expect you to teach other budding philosophers.


Your graduate program will most likely give you some opportunities to teach undergraduate students and develop your pedagogical skills.

, After you've completed your graduate studies, start looking for a job as a philosophy professor. This process is arguably even more competitive than applying for graduate schools. Be prepared for many rejections before you finally succeed.


Many philosophy graduates are unable to find work in academia. Nonetheless, the skills you'll learn in your graduate studies will be helpful in many fields of employment, and you can always keep working on philosophy in your free time.Remember that the writings of many of history's greatest philosophers were never recognized as important during their lifetimes.
The benefits of disciplined thinking cannot be overestimated, even without serving as a vocation. In today's environment, with ready access to enormous amounts of information, some of it specious, or worse, deliberately poisoning of a person's mental health, it is the investigative mind of the philosopher that possesses the tools to recognize half truths or complete falsehoods.

Self reflect, look at yourself and ask some questions:


What kinds of tasks do or don't come your way regularly?,
Examine critically how you might perform those tasks more efficiently.,
Try to prevent problems from ever arising.,
Develop a mindset that looks to solve problems instead of dwelling on them.,
Get and stay ahead of less-urgent, day-to-day tasks.,
Know which tasks are priorities and which can wait.,
Eliminate any task that is unnecessary.,
Evaluate your procedures and processes as you use them.,
Look for ways to automate routine tasks.,
Learn Something just for the Sake of Learning something Take up an interest.",How to Be Proactive," For example, at work, at home, during study etc.
What kinds of tasks come in large groups?
What kinds of tasks need attention when they arrive?;
, Before the next rush:


Create a plan, procedure, checklist or routine to accomplish the task.
Recruit and instruct others to assist with an urgent or large task.
Gather information you will need to perform a task, or if necessary information comes from a flow of people who bring the tasks, create a script, checklist, or form to capture it consistently.
Look for steps in the process to eliminate, consolidate, or shorten.

, This means tackling possible failings in advance to prevent them from becoming a reality. Get into the habit of taking precautions and developing fallback plans

, Here’s how:


Define the problem (what is it exactly?)
Decide what needs to happen to overcome the problem and how you’re going to do that; and
Get on with it

, Doing so means that they'll be out of the way when rushes come and will not be worrying you unnecessarily. Pay particular attention to preventative maintenance, whether that means checking the fluids in your car, restocking your pantry, or setting aside a bit of money in savings each week. A little effort up front could save you from a larger crisis later.

, Write out daily lists of tasks and head the list, ‘I will do’ and not ‘to do’. Boldly cross off each item as it is achieved. Keep this list nearby and let it direct your actions. If it goes too long without crossing anything off, reassess what you are doing to make sure that you do finish the tasks listed on it.

, Some things do not need doing, or do not need to be done by you. Do not waste time on them and do not allow a misplaced sense of guilt lead you into thinking that somehow you are responsible for them. If tasks are unnecessary, they will not add to your effort and are thus, a waste of energy. Be ruthless in making this assessment about the value of a task.

, What works and what does not? Make notes for improvements, and incorporate those improvements during the next lull. Discard anything that does not work but take care to note when something is in need of tweaking and adjust it accordingly so that it does work.


Try to anticipate needs. Are rushes seasonal? Are there extra activities associated with certain times of the day, week, month, or quarter? Can you prepare in advance? Look ahead and do not be afraid of the unknown. A small amount of future stability can be self-generated by planning and being ready for those things over which you do have some control.
Try to anticipate things you will need to know. Can you learn a new skill ahead of time? Can you apply a skill you already have in a new way? Watch the trends around you; keep up-to-date by reading and continuous learning. Proactive people are successful because they are immersed in unfolding history as well as understanding the lessons of the past.

, Computers can manipulate data in all sorts of ways. Even having a template or a standard plan of action can save time. If you work in a team context, delegation is also a form of automation, in that knowing the best person to do a task will automatically result in its being done to the best level possible, removing it from the pile of ""to-do's"". Thus, have in place a system that automatically moves tasks to those best suited to them.

, Develop a passion.

Meditate immediately.,
Write down the experience.,
Draw a picture of what happened.,
Identify what you were doing when it happened.",How to Analyze an out of Body Experience1," If you can, give yourself a few minutes after the OBE to collect your thoughts. Try to process what just happened. Walk yourself back through the events of your experience. The sooner you actively recall what happened, the more accurate your memory will be., Try to remember everything as it happened. Where did you go? What did it look like? What sensations did you feel? Write all of these details down in a dream journal. Record every detail that you can remember., It may help your memory and understanding if you sketch a picture of the scene to help you place details more vividly. Use colors to express the scenery. Include where you were in the scene. Where were you when the OBE started? Where did it take you? This creative exercise can help you process what happened.

, What you were doing just before the OBE occurred may be able to help you identify what type of OBE it is. Try to identify what happened beforehand to understand why it might have happened.


OBEs that occur in the evening or early morning may be related to sleep processes.Lucid dreaming is a dream that you are aware of. Lucid dreaming often occurs during REM sleep, during intense daydreaming, as a result of purposeful meditation, or from repetitive activities, such as driving or exercising. Most OBEs are considered to be a type of lucid dreaming.Near Death Experiences occur when a person has almost died. These can result from an accident, disease, or other “close calls.” Some people report seeing doctors and nurses treat them while others say they saw a light.
Certain drugs—including meth, cannabis, ketamine, and cough syrups-- can cause hallucinations. Drug-induced OBEs can be extremely dangerous. They may cause the user to harm themselves or others."

Practice viewing your own life from an objective standpoint, or, in other words, from the perspective of somebody else. This might take months of practice, so be patient and keep reminding yourself to take a step back every once in a while to reflect.
Notice how you react to stress, excitement, anger, and anxiety. While these are universal human emotions, we all handle them differently. Do you handle these negative emotions rationally, or let them blow out of proportion? Pay attention to what triggers these emotions: school, work, your family, your spouse, and so on.;
, Your relationships with friends, family members, loved ones, and coworkers reveal a great deal about the kind of person you are. Ask yourself the following questions:


Do you frequently argue with friends and family members? Who is usually the one who instigates these arguments?
How do you reconcile disagreements? Do you compromise, or do you always assert your position?
Are there certain people in your life that make you feel irritated or insecure? Why is that?
Have you been neglecting or ignoring your loved ones? When was the last time you showed a friend or loved one that you care for them?

, This will help you put your fears in perspective, separating rational fears from irrational ones. The key is to determine whether a fear is rational (i.e. a real danger), or if it stems from personal insecurities. Consider the following exercise:


Think of a fear. For example, ""I'm afraid of going back to school because I don't think I'm a strong student."" Now, imagine that one of your good friends or family members told you that he or she felt this way. How would you react? What kind of advice would you give him or her? Would you tell this person to give up, or tell them that it is worth a try? We oftentimes give better advice than we are willing to take ourselves, because of the bias we have toward our own insecurities.
Remember that even the most successful inventors, entrepreneurs, and scientists were at one point in their lives doubtful of their own capacity. They were probably told by people around them that what they wanted to do was impossible, and yet they pushed through and followed their dreams.

, Journals are a great way to keep track of the things that have happened in your life (both ups and downs) and how you reacted to these situations. Reviewing your journal entries will help put your life in perspective, notice patterns, and identify recurring problems.


Go back and re-read old entries once some time has passed. Now that you are no longer in the heat of the moment, do you think that you reacted appropriately to whatever situation took place? How could you have handled it better? Keep these things in mind for the future.

, The best way to have a fulfilling life is to spend your time doing things that you genuinely care about. Consider whether you are interested in art, science, politics, or the environment. Think about what you want your life's legacy to be. How do you want to impact the world around you? These questions will help you find the right career path for you.


Learn how to distinguish between your hobbies and your bigger interests. Just because you like to play guitar, doesn't necessarily mean you should pursue music as a career. But if you eat, sleep and breathe guitar, then continue to practice and perfect your craft and pursue your dream.
Don't give up on your hobbies. Just because your passion isn't lucrative, doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't partake in it. In fact, the opposite is true. Life is about learning to balance work and fun, and giving up either will be detrimental to your emotional health. Remember that if you never worked at anything, you wouldn't be able to appreciate the free time you have to partake in hobbies or spend time with friends.

, If you want to reach your potential, you will have to devote time to strengthening the talents you already have, and uncovering any hidden talents that you haven't discovered yet.


Take classes or private lessons in subjects that you are interested in, even if you have no previous experience. You never know when that one elective class will open the door to an entirely new career that you had never considered.
Don't be discouraged if you realize that you are not skilled at something. Remember that even recognizing what you are not good at is still a step in the right direction, pointing you toward what you are good at.

, Once you have set your mind to doing something, follow through with it. Be prepared for obstacles, and don't expect immediate results. All good things take time and hard work, but it will be well worth it in the end when you achieve your goals.


Remember that at the end of your life, you are much more likely to regret the things you didn't do than the things you did do.

, In life, you will undoubtedly come across people who will try to take advantage of you, whether it is financially or emotionally. While you should strive to be a sensitive, caring person on the one hand, you must also be tough-skinned and not let people walk all over you.


Be skeptical when people ask you to borrow money, constantly expect you to pay for things, or ask for favors without reciprocating. This person is probably taking advantage of you.
Be vocal when something is bothering you. Whether it is your employer, your spouse, or your family member, you should get in the habit of calmly letting people know when they have crossed the line. You might be surprised to learn that this person had no idea that he or she was upsetting you.

, Some people say ""you are what you eat."" Even more so, you are what you think. Positive thinking has the power to transform a mundane or even unpleasant experience into a wonderful one. Thinking positively will give you the foundation for a happier life, regardless of what happens to you.


If you catch yourself having a negative thought, take a step back, identify the thought, and label it as a ""negative"" thought. Learning to isolate negative thoughts will help you put your worries and insecurities to rest.
Begin a regular meditation practice. Meditation is the practice of developing mindful awareness. Meditation not only trains you to silence negative thoughts, it helps you calm all thoughts, good or bad, so that you can learn to enjoy the present moment.

, Remember that other peoples' energy will rub off on you, especially if you spend a great deal of time with them. Make a point to spend time with friends and loved ones who make you feel better, not worse.


Before distancing yourself from friends or family members who you consider to be ""toxic,"" try to be a positive influence in their attitudes rather than succumbing to their negativity.
Terminate any physically or emotionally abusive relationships immediately. No matter how forgiving a person you may be, there is no excuse for violence and abuse.

, Many of us define ourselves in terms of what we want to do or what we want to own. In other words, we define ourselves in terms of what we don't have. This in essence suggests that we are somehow incomplete. Take some time to be thankful for the things you do have, whether they are physical objects or not, on a daily basis.


Remember positive memories. While it seems impossible to forget embarrassing or sad memories, many of us overlook all of the great memories that have taken place in our lives. Think of the best day(s) you have had in the past month or year. Remember special parties, vacations, and holidays.
Appreciate the wonderful people you have in your life. If you are depressed because you don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend, dwelling on this missing element will only make you more unhappy. Take some time to appreciate all the great friends and family members you have in your life.

Identify other presences.,
Determine whether or not there was a cord.,
Discern if you saw a tunnel.,
Locate where you were taken.,
Compare the scene to its real counterpart.,
Tune into the noise.",How to Analyze an out of Body Experience2," In some cases, people may feel as though there is a ghostly or divine presence in the room with them during their OBE. In others, they may simply see a “double” of their own body. Try to remember who, if anyone, was in the room with you. Identify them if possible.Meeting deceased loved ones during this experience may be a way of grieving after their deaths. You may also feel as though they have a message or advice for you.
Encountering a divine presence in the room is a spiritual experience for many.
Some people report seeing ghosts or multiple spirits in the room. Some believe that these spirits have messages to pass on to you. , A silver cord tying your spiritual/floating body to your physical form is seen by some to be symbolic of the relationship between the body and the soul. This cord is what many believe keeps you tethered to your body and to this astral plane. You may have even felt this cord pull you back into your physical body.Did you feel as though you were limited in your movement? There have been a cord or similar force keeping you in place.
Did you feel as though you had free movement around the room? There likely wasn’t a cord.

, A tunnel of light is common in near death experiences. You may have felt you were “moving towards the light” or that you were passing to the afterlife. Some believe this is a spiritual experience wherein you have visited heaven. Some believe it is representative of being reborn. Others believe it is a disruption in brain wave patterns.Visiting paradise or heaven is much more common in naturally induced OBEs (such as near death experiences, sleep paralysis, or unprovoked lucid dreaming) than in forced OBEs (such as hypnosis or provoked lucid dreaming).The reasons for this are unknown.

, Think about whether or not you traveled in your OBE. Did you stay in one room, or did you move from room to room? Did you fly through the heavens? Did you visit another planet? Some people also report visiting distant friends and having conversations. You may be seeking something that is missing in your life. You might also be coming to terms with your beliefs of the afterlife and universe. Consider the reasons why you might have been taken where you were.


Astral projections are a type of OBE wherein people feel as though they have been transported to a “heavenly” or “alien” realm. These may be accompanied by bright colors, spiritual encounters, floating, and teleportation. Some people believe that this is a visit to higher planes of reality., Staying in one place during your OBE is perfectly normal. You may have seen the room you are in from above. This may be your brain reconstructing the location of the room from previous memories.It could also be an illusion of perception.Look around the room. See if objects were in the same place as they were in your OBE.


If objects are in different positions, you may have been imagining your room based on previous memories.
Was there anything you saw from above that you wouldn't be able to see from below? If the answer is yes, you might consider that you really left your body.

, Many people report hearing strange sounds during their OBE. Some believe this is because sound cannot transmit to other astral planes or that your brain is interpreting new sensations as sound.It could also be a neurological response to your condition.


You might hear the sound of static, wind rushing in your ears, or cracking.These sounds could be your brain trying to make sense of your situation.
Voices, both peaceful and malevolent, are common.This could be a result of your dream state, in which your brain is processing things you heard that day. Can you identify what is being said? Was it a coherent sentence, or was it just rambling? If it did not make sense, it was likely insignificant, and you can ignore it.

"

Consider your physical and mental state before the OBE.,
Examine your emotions.,
Explore your fears.,
Find links between your out of body experience and real life.",How to Analyze an out of Body Experience3," OBEs can be caused by exhaustion, stress, or some medical conditions. Take in account how you were feeling before your OBE, and understand that there could be a medical explanation for it.Strokes and epilepsy can cause OBEs, even if the sufferer was not close to death.Many OBEs happen as a result of interrupted sleep patterns. If your OBE happens in middle of the night or just after waking, you may still be dreaming (even though you are awake). In these situations, a paralyzed sensation is common.Stress hormones can trigger OBEs.Carefully consider what is happening in your life. Have you been extremely busy? Is there something that is worrying you?

, Just by recalling how you felt during your OBE, you may be able to piece together what your mental and spiritual state are.Tap into your emotions. Describe the different sensations that you felt. These may be reflective of your overall mental health.


A common sensation is to feel at peace while outside of the body. You may be at peace with yourself, or you may realize that your earthly problems are insignificant.
Returning to the body can cause feelings of pain and discomfort.This may mean that you are hesitant about returning to life. You may be uncomfortable with your body.
Fear and panic are more negative emotions, but because you may see strange beings or objects during your OBE, they are perfectly natural.Once you have identified your emotions, try asking: “Why did I feel this way? What happened that caused this?”

, If you felt afraid during your OBE, try to understand the causes of that fear. Were you afraid you would not return to your body? Did you think you were dead? Were you worried that spirits or other presences would harm you? Try to pinpoint what caused the fear, and consider different reasons why you might have felt that way.Fear of death is common, especially in OBEs. You may have worried that you would never return to your body. You may have anxieties about where you will go when you die.
If you felt another presence in the room with you, you may have been afraid that they would harm you. You may not have been certain if they were friendly or evil. This might explain an underlying fear that spirits can influence your life.
If you were frightened by being transported to another place, you might be scared of change or the unknown.

, OBEs are almost always guided experiences; that is, they are influenced by your memories and experiences in real life.Think about who and what you saw in the OBE. Why do you think they appeared to you then?


Are they a cause of stress in your life?
Are you unable to see certain loved ones because of distance or death?
Are you anxious about death?
Do you have any unresolved problems in your life?

Join a great group.,
Follow the instructions.,
Take up a fencing or Kendo class.",How to Become a Real Jedi," Nothing can prepare you for becoming a real Jedi better than having an understanding of the philosophies which made the idea of the philosophies somewhat religious. Though it was not George Lucas' intent to start an entirely new religion, he did have an intent to awaken the audience's spirituality in a way which transcended religion. Looking for these tidbits is a great start before making contact with the practicing Jedi.;
, Finding the right group--one which expresses its philosophy in a way which agrees with what you yourself believe to be true--is essential. It's best to look at multiple sites before you make your decision. And above all, don't feel pressured to take any oaths before you're fully willing and ready to do so. Some groups require that you take an oath before they will teach; others have absolutely no formalities, and will accept anyone who wants to learn. There are advantages to both, as well as disadvantages. Use your best judgment, but again: resist the urge to be one of the community until you've read through some of what they believe and see if it fits. This step can take a long time!


Remember, some training groups may not use the word ""Jedi"" to avoid copyright conflicts. Try keywords like ""flow arts training"", ""guardian alliance"", ""jedi training intensives"", and also ""jedi training"" from the Egyptian word related to the origins of the word Jedi.

, When you've found a group you're comfortable with, join it! Keep looking if it's not a perfect fit, and accept that each practitioner in the Jedi faiths are on their own tangents much of the time.

, For most groups, the instructions can be found on their web site, though they are often buried in forums. Keep sight of the goal, and be prepared to dig through years of posts in some cases. It's not easy, but it is worthwhile.

, Ever wanted to sword fight like the jedi do? You will be able to learn the light saber fighting techniques that the actors in Star Wars learned and self-defense, too!


In addition, practice Tai Chi and Qigong. These ancient internal martial arts forms give practitioners power through the development of Chi or Qi, an energy force in the body believed to be able to provide healing, and greatly increase the power of a martial artist in all activities. Do a search for Shaolin Monks Qigong to see a National Geographic Special on the secret powers of Qi.

, For example, the existence or nonexistence of immortal beings is outside the realm of humanism, which concerns itself with mortal human only., A humanist believes that through hard work, humans can do good and make life better for others.

, Focus on the present, not the past or the future. Aim to do good and live well now, and leave the world a better place for posterity. The welfare of humanity is the primary concern for a humanist.

, Because humans are the focus of humanism, a humanist will strive to determine right and wrong for himself. Avoid undue influence from others, superstitions, and prejudices.

, For a humanist, happiness is achieved by doing good and living well.Do good unto others, as you would have others do unto you.

Think of your long term goals.",How to Escape Consumerism," Be aware of why, when, how much and how often advertising affects your spending habits. Advertisers are paid a lot of money to influence your subliminal mind with flashing pictures, soothing scenes and jingles that linger in your mind to connect you with a product. They convince you that having things is a lot of fun and that your happiness comes from having things. Notice how companies associate their product with happiness.;
, If advertising is shouting at you everywhere, simply ignore every advertisement that comes on the radio or television, or reduce the amount of time you spend watching television.

, Be sure that you are the right kind of person for this lifestyle. Are you controlled by greed? If you love to keep up with your neighbors, the latest fashion or fads, this is probably not for you. However, if you don't care about what other people think and have a passion to reduce or reuse to maintain our planet, then you should have no problem.

, Go home, twirl around and spend a good amount of time looking at and appreciating all the things you already have. Do you really need another pair of jeans? Or a better toaster? Chances are, the answer is no. Remember, it's not having what you want, it's wanting what you've got.

, Before you buy ANYTHING, be it a new hoody or an overpriced sandwich, ask yourself at least three times if you really need it to live. Walk away from it, sit down, have a think about it, come back and face the object in question.


You can also ask yourself how your purchase will impact other people or the planet. Were people paid fairly in the production process and was care taken for the environment? Is there a fair trade product that is similar to the product you are considering?

, Everyone has a wish list. Just wait a while longer and you'll realize that you can get by without whatever is on the list.

, Ok, let's be realistic - stop buying from places you know to be ethically or environmentally dodgy. This includes clothing shops where you suspect the clothes to be made in sweatshops and huge monopoly supermarkets. Big no-nos include McDonalds, Walmart, and British Petroleum (BP).

, Check out small family run businesses, markets and charity/thrift stores. You can find good bargains at charity shops, especially if you look in a wealthy area!

, Do your friends have something you need and vice versa? Can you recycle something into something else that is more useful? There are many raw materials that already exist within your home - just use your imagination and create something new. Fabrics are a great resource.

Become an independent thinker, and go against the grain.,
Be a leader, not a follower of trends!,
Focus on the greater good.,
Develop a sense of humor.,
Stay traditional, even when society changes around you.,
Avoid collaboration and being part of “the group.” Curmudgeons are known for rejecting collaboration, and civility is not always their strong suit.,
Reject authority or at least don’t buy into the notion that authority is always right.,
Make sure you pick your battles.,
Present a grumpy, or at least a serious vibe.,
Show that you have standards.,
Figure out the kind of curmudgeon you are emulating.,
Realize that sometimes grumpiness is camouflaging a medical issue.,
Study famous curmudgeons to get a sense of how to do it with style.",How to Become a Curmudgeon," Curmudgeons take pride in being contrarians. They don’t just take the popular positions or the easy ones. They aren’t scared to go against the grain.Most settings actually need contrarians, although they can ruffle feathers. Academia is one field that some experts believe has a lot of curmudgeons. Of course, if you have the job protection tenure affords, you can afford to risk being contrary to people in power.
Curmudgeons do not go along with the group in order to get along. They are willing to tick everyone off to voice their stance on an issue, even if they become unpopular as a result. The old Winston Churchill quote comes to mind: “You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life.”;
, Learn to think for yourself. If a popular media figure says something is great, you don't care for it. Curmudgeons don't need to have the newest gadget or the biggest house.


Curmudgeons are the setters of trends. They have their own minds, values, and trends. They are willing to be the one person wearing the bow tie in the group. Their dress often highlights the fact they stand outside the group.
Curmudgeons cultivate their individuality in literature, movies, and food, as well as dress. Above all, they stay true to their own likes. They aren't chameleons who adopt the interests of others or the whole.

, At their best, curmudgeons can be the way they are because they are caring people working for a cause or to champion a set of principles. There is such a thing as a “lovable curmudgeon.” The kind of curmudgeon you should want to be is the grumpy guy (or gal) who’s willing to say what it takes to make things right even if he or she gets painted in a negative fashion as a result, but who does it for a greater good, not to harm someone else.


Deep down, many curmudgeons are caring people who put the interests of others first, and in fact think they are serving some greater good by complaining. They are willing to risk their jobs and reputations to advance values they hold dear. There is something admirable about that.
What curmudgeons are not is cruel. They don’t try to punish or hurt individuals; they are too busy warring against systems for that. They aren't mean. Grouchy? Yes. Cruel? No.

, Curmudgeons aren't always super serious. They can dominate a stage with a big, charismatic personality. They like attention.


Tell good stories. Work up some good short stories that tell about interesting experiences you've had or people you've known. Learn how to time them so they are never boring or repetitive. An ironic twist at the end is helpful.
Find the humor in at least five things you see every day. Smile or laugh and catch someone's eye to share the moment.

, Curmudgeons are throwbacks. They are the guys who stick to the old ways as the world changes around them. Poke around the attic, garage or basement until you find that old thing you used to use, rather than buying something new.


You will see this in the way they dress. The typical curmudgeon wears a flannel shirt and grumpy old man hat. You don’t have to do this. Just be aware that you won’t find a curmudgeon acting slavish to a trend. They don’t care about “fitting in” or seeming modern. They might prefer vintage dress.
In terms of attitude and values, curmudgeons will stick to a core set of principles even if, at times, the world changes around them. Sometimes they advance the positions of their childhood. Curmudgeons know who they are and what they believe in. They aren't insecure.

, At the same time, curmudgeons will at times build alliances with friends and allies on the side.


With their own unique flair and pizzazz, curmudgeons will occupy the center stage with humor or sarcasm. They prefer a heated debate or engaging in lengthy discussion before reaching any consensus with others (if they ever do).
Curmudgeons sometimes style themselves as gadflies or whistle blowers who are willing to say things that other people dare not. Although this can make them very disliked, there are times when they spot things that are real problems. Thus, while written off as cranks sometimes, they can at times offer valuable advice to an institution by playing the role of constant devil’s advocate.

, Curmudgeons are the sort that constantly pokes at administrators or bosses. They don’t naturally accept that people are right just because they have ascended to power.


Sometimes curmudgeons become such because they have become outcasts or don’t belong to the internal network that produces leaders in an institution through “who you know.” They want to have a voice, and they think they have ideas to contribute, but they have no other way to make their voice heard.
At times, leaders aren’t doing a good job but everyone else fears confronting them. Curmudgeons are willing to call out problems that others look the other way on. The leaders may dismiss their complaints.

, If you want to be a curmudgeon who plays an important role versus one who is a negative whiner, you should make sure you ground your complaints in knowledge.


Have legitimate and rational concerns when you do express your opinions. Don't go to war over everything or people will start tuning you out. Take a stand when you think it really matters.
Ground your complaints in evidence. If you back up what you say instead of just complaining all the time, you will be taken more seriously.

, Curmudgeons are not known for their joyous, happy or vibrant personalities. They are more likely to see the world through negative blinders.There are young curmudgeons. They are the kind of people that others deem to be “old souls.” They seem to have a window into aspects of the world that others miss as they go about their happy ways.
Even if curmudgeons do experience happiness and joy, they don’t wear those emotions on their sleeves. They’re introverted about sharing emotions, other than crabbiness or concern, although they periodically break that up with sarcastic humor.

, Curmudgeons stick to the rules, and they aren’t afraid to hold people to them. In a world where sometimes it seems like “anything goes,” curmudgeons aren’t afraid of hurting people’s feelings.


A memo from a curmudgeon might explain that they expect to see no grammatical or typographical errors in your text.They will likely present a lengthy list of rules. In fact, they will use rules as their key weapon. They will know the rules better than anyone else does. They sometimes overplay their hands, though. Still, at a law firm, a curmudgeon might justify his (or her) sticking to the rules because it’s important to win for a client. And you know what? They can be right.

, Some dictionaries say the word stems from the word crab and the word cur, which meant dog or a “disagreeable person” in Gaelic.Some of the definitions of curmudgeon are not positive. For example, a curmudgeon is defined at times as a “crusty, ill-tempered” old man. In popular culture, curmudgeons are typically older men with grouchy attitudes.However, not all definitions of the word are negative. For example, an alternative definition says curmudgeons are people with stubborn ideas or opinions. This might be laughed at by some, but it can be a strength at times. It's certainly necessary for any institution or society to have people willing to say what no one else will.

, Studies show that curmudgeons are more likely to be males and over the age of 70 - although they do exist among all demographics. There are physiological changes that occur with age and that can cause a worsening of mood.


Sometimes men are really experiencing physical symptoms – like declining testosterone levels – that make them grumpier.If you feel like a curmudgeon, but don’t want to be one, see a doctor. Maybe there is a medical issue that a doctor can address.
If you are feeling depressed on a constant basis, that’s not a good place to be. It’s different if you are choosing to be a curmudgeon and are happy in that state (even if you don’t show it). But if you are suffering signs of clinical depression, contact a doctor or therapist. There are many resources available to help you.

, Start paying attention, and you will see curmudgeons in public life everywhere. They are a common character in movies and politics, for starters.


Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is sometimes considered a curmudgeon. This is because he will often play the iconoclast, and his contrary opinions are often filled with words that are designed to have an attention-getting flair. However, he has an underlying mission and stays true to his stated values - he wants to make a point about the problems with the majority decision. Curmudgeons consider themselves lonely arbiters of common sense – and sometimes they are right.Clint Eastwood in the movie “Gran Torino” is a curmudgeon. “Get off my lawn,” is his famous catchphrase. Walter Matthau is a curmudgeon in the movie “Grumpy Old Men.” Bill Murray in the movie ""St. Vincent"". Dana Carvey’s character “Grumpy Old Man” on Saturday Night Live is a curmudgeon."

Bring empathy -- the skill of putting yourself in someone's shoes -- to all of your interactions.,
Listen actively.,
Look past first impressions.,
Recognize that most people are self-centered, not cruel or mean-spirited.,
Pay attention to body language to better understand a person's mood and intentions.,
Note that people, in general, do what is best for themselves.,
Understand that most people have similar thoughts, hopes, and fears as yourself.",How to Be Understanding1," Empathy is the single most important skill when trying to understand others. But empathy is a skill, not a talent, meaning it must be practiced to improve. Every time you meet people, especially those you disagree with, make a point of putting yourself in their shoes. If you were them, why would you be arguing a particular point or acting a particular way? What things in their life might lead them to their particular point of view?


Empathy starts with you -- when you're in an argument, stop and ask why this moment makes you so passionate. Is there a good reason to be worked up, or are you simply getting carried away?
When trying to understand someone's motivations, just ask. ""I never thought of it that way, what makes you think that?"" is a great way to move towards mutual understanding.;
, Listening to someone talk is a vital part of understanding them, but to truly be understanding you need to be an active listener. This means you're engaging in the conversation instead of just nodding. There are several ways to do this, all of which encourage the other person to keep opening up and letting you into their lives:


Ask questions.'"" It shows you care about the story, and also helps you dive a little deeper into understanding.

React to emotional turns: For example, when someone gets to a sad part of the story, wear an expression of concern on your face. If it's a happy moment, don't be afraid to smile along.

Share your related experiences: This doesn't mean you ""went through the same exact thing."" But sharing your feelings in a similar setting helps them share their own feelings., This isn't to say that first impressions aren't important -- they are -- but more often than not people make their mind up completely about someone without enough information to do so. The first time you meet someone they may be frazzled or worried, giving off a wholly different impression than they would normally. People are complex, changing animals, and you only start to understand them when you spend quality time together.


People are a sum of many interactions, not just one.
Try not to judge interactions, deciding if they were good or bad. Consider, instead, what you learned from each interaction, adding to this each time you meet., There is an old adage that you should ""never blame malice for what can easily be explained by conceit."" Simply put, most people aren't out to get anyone, they just have trouble thinking past their own self interest. When trying to understand actions that hurt you, ask yourself if someone is truly mean or just a little short-sighted.


People don't generally have great memories. Forgetting your name, showing up late, etc. is not a coded signal that they don't like you -- it is just forgetfulness.
Remember to stay empathetic. The person cutting you off in traffic may be mean, of course. But more likely than not they are in a hurry, had a tough day at work, or just didn't see you in the other lane.
Think about how frequently say something wrong, or do something totally natural that someone else perceives as mean or directed at them. You rarely mean direct harm on others, and everyone else largely means the same., Use a person's body language to clue into their broader intentions. What a person says is hardly what they mean -- how often have you told someone that something is ""fine"" when you really think the opposite? While the list below is far from exhaustive, these clues will help you understand people more deeply than listening alone:



The Head: Is their chin up confidently, or tilted down in a sign of unhappiness? Do they make confident, direct eye contact, or avoid your gaze (and likely the truth) when talking? When they smile, do their eyes crinkle genuinely or does only their mouth smile?

Shoulders and Torso: Slouching indicates fear, unhappiness, or a lack of confidence, while happy people tend to keep their torso up and back. If their arms are folded and body closed off, they are feeling shy or angry. Open arms and chest indicate an open and confident person.

Waist: Where does a person face their hips? This is almost always at the person or thing they are devoting the majority of their attention to.

Feet and Hands: Are they calm and still or fidgety and nervous? Constant movement belies constantly moving or shifting thoughts, though this could be either anxiety or boundless enthusiasm, depending on the circumstances., This is, of course, not a perfect ""rule."" People perform unselfish or sacrificial acts of kindness every day, after all. But the vast majority of human behavior is done because it directly benefits the person doing it. Knowing this simple truth will help understand most people's actions, and help you understand people as well. If someone does something, it is because they believe it helps them be happy or move towards their goals. Actions speak louder than words, and generally reveal a person's intent and thoughts.Altruistic behavior (the scientific term for generosity or kindness) is generally a win-win sort of situation. Helping other people helps you feel happier, develops useful friendships, and builds a community where everyone can be more successful than they would be alone. Not all selfishness, in other words, is totally selfish.
When trying to understand a person, look for the patterns in their actions. What sorts of goals, ideals, and morals do these actions generally point to?, One of the great benefits of empathy and understanding is realizing how similar we really are. While everyone's goals and fears might have different aims, the truth is that we all want to be successful, have a network of friends, and feel happy. It doesn't matter where you go in the world, the desire to have a comfortable, enjoyable life is a human trait, not an American one.When understanding someone, the simplest answer is usually the right one. Think about how you'd feel in their position and you're well on your way to understanding.

Of course, you can ask people you know, but their experience of you will lead them to the same biases that you have. Getting some objective opinions will give you a more accurate picture and lead you to consider some things you might not even have thought of. There are a number of established tests that you can take to learn about the different aspects of yourself (and more than a few less-reputable ones):


The Myers-Briggs Personality type theory says that all people have 1 of 16 different basic personalities. These personalities can predict how you interact with people, the kinds of interpersonal problems and strengths that you have, and what kind of environment you live and work in best.A basic version of this test can be found online, if you want to find out what you can learn from better understanding your personality.
If you're struggling to understand what makes you happy and what you should do with your life, consider taking a career test. These types of tests can help you decide what you might find the most satisfying, usually based on your personality and what you do for fun. There are lots of different ones available online, usually for free, but if you're in school you can probably get a more reputable one administered by your career counselor.
There is a theory that every person learns and processes their experience of the world in one of a number of different ways. This is called your “learning style”. Knowing what learning style you have will help you even once you're out of school and can help you to understand why you struggle with some activities and excel at others. As with the others, there are a number of free tests that you can take online. Just be aware that this is a disputed science, with many theories about how many learning styles exist, and you may get different results depending on which test you take.
You can also find lots of other tests covering many subjects at Psychology Today.;
, When writers go to write a book, they will often do writing exercises which help them to better understand the characters that they're writing about. You can do these same exercises to get a better understanding of yourself and many can be found online for free. Theses exercises may not have anything official to say about you, often relying on you to draw you own conclusions about what your answers say about you, but they may lead you to think about things you never thought about before. Try answering the following questions to get an idea of what this is like:


How would you describe yourself in one sentence?
What is your purpose in your life's story?
What is the most important thing that has ever happened to you? How did it change you?
How are you different than the people around you?

, You can come to a better understanding of who you are and what is most important to you by thinking about your strengths and weaknesses. Importantly, you’ll want to compare your perception with your strengths and weaknesses to the strengths and weaknesses identified by your friends, family, and coworkers. The things that they see that you don’t can tell you a lot about yourself and how you see yourself.


Examples of strengths include determination, devotion, self-discipline, thoughtfulness, decisiveness, patience, diplomacy, communication skills, and imagination or creativity.
Examples of weaknesses include close-mindedness, self-centeredness, difficulty perceiving reality, judgement of others, and issues with control.

, What you think is most important in life and in your day-to-day interactions can tell you a lot about yourself. Think about your priorities, compare them to the priorities of other people you respect, and think what your conclusions say about you. Of course, you need to be open to the idea that you might not have your priorities in the best order (many people don’t), which can also teach you a lot about yourself.


If your house were burning down, what would you do? What would you save? It’s amazing how fire exposes our priorities. Even if you’d save something practical, like your tax records, that still says something about you (probably that you prefer to be prepared and not meet resistance in life).
Another way to tell what your priorities are is to imagine that someone you love was being openly criticized for something that you don’t support (let’s say, they’re gay but you don’t agree with the lifestyle). Do you support them? Protect them? How? What would you say? Our actions in the face of peer criticism and possible ostracization can reveal our priorities.
Some examples of priorities that people often have include: money, family, sex, respect, security, stability, material possessions, and comfort.

, Look at your past and think about how what has happened to you over your lifetime has affected how you act and think today. Looking at how you’ve changed as a person can reveal a lot about why you act the way that you do, because our current behaviors are built on our past experiences.


For example, maybe you tend to get really defensive around shoplifters and are very harsh to people you perceive as stealing. When you think about it, you might remember stealing a candy from a store as a child and your parents punishing you very harshly, which would explain your stronger than normal reaction to that behavior now.

, Sometimes, you’ll find yourself getting really, strongly angry, sad, happy, or excited. Understanding what sets off these stronger-than-normal reactions, what their root cause is, can help you understand yourself better.


For example, maybe you get really violently angry about people talking during a movie. Are you really angry about the talking or are you angry because you felt like it was a personal sign of disrespect towards you? Since this anger doesn’t help the situation, you might be better off trying to find ways that you can be less concerned about people respecting you, just to keep your own blood pressure down.

, Repression is when you don’t want to think about something so you help yourself to forget it even happened. Transference is when you emotionally react to one thing, but what you’re really reacting to is something else. Both of these behaviors, which are very common, are unhealthy and finding out why you do them and finding ways to handle those emotions in a healthier way will make you a much happier person.


For example, you might think that you’re not sad about your grandma dying, but when your family decides to get rid of her favorite old chair you get really angry and upset. You’re not really upset about the chair being gone. It was stained, smelled funny, and probably contained radioactive foam for all you know. You’re upset that your grandma is gone.

, Do you turn every conversation you have into a conversation about yourself? Do you make jokes at your own expense whenever you talk about yourself? How and when you talk about yourself can reveal a lot about how you think and how you perceive yourself. It’s healthy to talk about yourself sometimes and it’s good to realize that you can’t do everything, but you should pay attention to extremes and think about why you go to those extremes.


For example, your friend might have just finished her PhD, but when you’re all talking about it, you turn the conversation to be about when you were working on your master's. This might be because you feel embarrassed that you only got a master's and they finished a PhD, so you want to make yourself feel more important or accomplished by making the conversation about you.

, When you interact with people, do you tend to put them down? Maybe you’ve noticed that you only choose to spend time with people that have more money than you. Behaviors like this can also teach you things about yourself and what is really important to you.


For example, if you’re choosing to only spend time with friends that have more money than you, it may show that you want to feel more wealthy by letting yourself pretend you’re equal to your friends in that way.
Think about what you ""hear"" vs what was said. This is another thing you can look out for when examining your interactions with your friends and family. You might find that what you hear is something like “I need your help” when what they actually said was “I want your company”, revealing that you have a strong need to feel useful to others.

, Write your biography in 500 words in 20 minutes. This will require you to type very fast and think less about what you will include, helping you to identify what your brain thinks is most important when defining who you are. For many people, 20 minutes won’t even be enough time to type 500 words. Thinking about what you are upset you weren’t able to get out vs what you did say can also tell you things about yourself.

, Studies have shown that people who can delay satisfaction have a generally better time getting through life, getting better grades, more education, and maintaining a healthier body. Think about situations where you could have delayed gratification. What did you do? If you have trouble delaying gratification, this is something to look out for a work on, since it often play a role in success.


Stanford did a famous experiment with this called the Marshmallow Experiment , where they watched how some kids reacted when presented with marshmallow treats and then followed their progress through life, over the course of many decades. The children who put off their treat in favor of a bigger reward did better in school, work, and health-related areas.

, When you’re doing something, like work, think about whether you seek out your next task without having to be asked, whether you need someone else to tell you what to do before you act, or whether you’d rather skip all of that in favor of just telling someone else what to do. Each of these things can say different things about you, depending on the situation.


Remember that there’s nothing wrong with needing someone to give you instructions and guidance before doing a task. It’s just something to be aware of so that you can better understand and control your own behavior when important things come up. For example, if you know you’re bad at taking control in a situation but you know you need to, you can think about how your reluctance is just “a habit” that you can break and not a necessity.

, When things get really tough, such as when you lose your job, a loved one dies, or someone is threatening you, the more hidden or restrained parts of your character tend to come out.Think about how you’ve reacted in the past when the tension has gotten high. Why did you react the way that you did? How do you wish that you’d reacted? Would you be more likely to react that way now?


You can also imagine these scenarios, but be aware that your hypothetical responses may be clouded by your bias and not accurate to how you’d really react.
For example, imagine you were moving to a new town where no one knows you. Where would you go to make friends? What kind of people would you try to make friends with? Is there anything you’d change in terms of what you tell people about yourself vs what all your current friends know about you? This can reveal your priorities and what you’re looking for in your social interactions.

, If you’re in any kind of position of power, you might want to think about the effect it has on your behavior. Many people, when put in a position of power, will become harsher, less open-minded, more controlling, and more suspicious.When you find yourself making decisions that affect others, think about why you’re really making that choice: is it because it’s the right thing to do or is it because you need to feel in-control of the situation?


For example, when you’re babysitting your little brother, do you put him in timeout just for a small problem? Does this really help him learn or are you just trying to find reasons to put him in timeout?

, The things that have an influence on how you think and how you see the world can say a lot about you, whether you actually conform to what they teach or not. In seeing where your influences have shaped your behavior, you can better understand the root of the behaviors you do have. In seeing where you deviate from those taught behaviors, you can also identify your uniqueness and your own personal thinking. Thinks that influence you include:


Your media intake, such as TV shows, movies, books, and even what porn you watch.
Your parents, who might teach you things varying from tolerance vs racism to material wealth vs spiritual wealth.
Your friends, who will pressure you into enjoying certain things or introduce you to new and wonderful experiences.

, If you want to really reflect and understand yourself better, you're going to need to think about parts of yourself that you really don't like and admit to some things you might not want to admit to. You'll be naturally defensive about admitting these kinds of things to yourself, but if you're really going to understand how you work, then you're going to need to let go of that defensiveness. Even if you don't let those barriers down for other people, you at least have to let them down for yourself.


Becoming less defensive about your weaknesses can also mean opening yourself up to getting help from other people and making amends for past mistakes. If you're more open to discussion, criticism, and change, then other people can really help you understand and improve yourself.

, We lie to ourselves a lot more than we'd like to think about sometimes.We'll help ourselves to think that we made some questionable choices for noble or logical reasons, even when we were really just being vindictive or lazy. But hiding from the real reason behind our motives doesn't help us change and develop into better people. Remember: there's no point in lying to yourself. Even if you discover truths about yourself that you really don't like, this only give you the opportunity to take those problems head on instead of just pretending like they don't exist.

, Sometimes, especially when we do bad things, others will try to warn us against those behaviors. We also have a tendency not to listen. Sometimes this is good, because lots of people will say things about you just because they want to hurt you and their comment will have no basis in fact. But sometimes what they say is a good, outsider’s analysis of how you behave. Think about what people have said in the past and ask for some new opinions about your behavior.


For example, your sister might notice that you tend to exaggerate. But, this is unintentional on your part, which can serve to show you that your perception of reality is a bit off.
There’s a big difference between evaluating what they say about you and letting that opinion control your life and actions. You shouldn't tailor your behavior to suit other people unless it is having a significantly negative impact on your life (and even then, you might want to consider that your environment might be the problem, not your behavior). Make changes because you want to change, not because someone else tells you that you should.

, Giving advice will often give you a great opportunity to think through your own problems and reevaluate them from the outside. When looking at someone else’s situation, you will be more likely to think about situations and circumstances that you never thought of before.


You don’t even have to do this activity for real, although helping your friends, family, and even strangers is a nice thing to do. You can give advice to your older and younger selves, in the form of a letter. This will help you think through your past experiences and what you took away from them, as well as what is really important to you for the future.

, The best way to really get to know yourself, however, is to just experience life. Just like getting to know another person, understanding yourself takes time and you’ll learn far more through experiencing life than by interviewing yourself and taking tests. You can try:


Traveling. Traveling will put you in lots of different situations and test your ability to handle stress and adapt to change. You’ll come to a greater understanding of your happiness, priorities, and dreams than you ever could just sitting in your same old boring life.
Getting more education. Education, real education, challenges us to think in new ways. Getting education will open your mind and lead you to think about things you’d never even considered. Your interests and how you feel about these new things you learn can reveal things about you.
Letting go of expectations. Let go of other people’s expectations for you. Let go of your expectations for yourself. Let go of your expectations for what life should be like. When you do this, you’ll be more open to seeing what new experiences might make you happy and fulfilled. Life is a crazy roller-coaster and you're going to encounter a lot of things that scare you because they're new or different but don't close yourself to those experiences. They might make you happier than you've ever been.

Determine your unique TRAP.,
Discover and inventory your talents


Make a list of your talents: A talent is something that you can do with great skill but did not have to study or train to obtain.,
Calculate your resources


Make a list of ALL of your resources: We all have resources.,
Decide all your abilities


Make a list of your abilities: Abilities are things that you must learn to do.,
Discover your passions


Decide what gives you the most joy and fulfillment.,
Meditate on your lists after looking at them carefully.,
Look carefully at the image .",How to Discover Your Purpose and Fulfill Your Destiny," Each one of us is given gifts and talents. Some may have more talents than others but we all have at least one. We also each have resources, abilities, and passions. Let’s take a brief look at how these lead to discovering why you are here and what you are to do with your life (purpose).


Take a blank sheet of paper and fold it vertically (in the center) and then horizontally (in the center). This should give you four quadrants.
In the first upper left quadrant (at the very top) write the word TALENTS.
In the second quadrant write the word RESOURCES.
In the third quadrant write the word ABILITIES.
In the fourth and last quadrant write the word PASSIONS. We call this the Unique TRAP.;
, Examples:

A gift to play an instrument but never have taken one music lesson.
A gift to speak in public without any fear or apprehension.
Paint great works of art without any training or mentoring. These are truly amazing to most of us. We would say that you have a talent.



, A resource is anything that you have access to; such as your home, car, cash, bank, cell phone, office, job, clothing, food, storage, garage, extra bedroom, collection, computer, Internet, friends, family, and associates. All and more of these can be used in fulfilling your purpose. If used properly they can make you rich as well. If you sat down and made a list of all your resources you would be amazed.
Begin looking at everything that you have access to as a resource. It will change your life.
We have access to both private and public resources. Public resources are libraries, roads, public education centers, and government. In many countries there just is no excuse for not actualizing purpose. Our private and public resources are vast.

,

Can you type?
Can you use a computer?
Can you write? Then you can write a novel or screenplay.
Can you drive? Someone had to teach you or at least let you use her car to learn.
Can you cook? Then is there a national catering franchise waiting to be born?


So you don’t know how to write a business plan you say. Someone within your Resource List of resources does; even if that someone is the librarian who shows you where the book is located on the shelf.

, Is it helping the elderly or teaching a child to learn? Is it music, art or sports? Is it reading, writing, or meditating? Is it negotiating the deal?
Discover what gets your blood going. It is something that you almost crave. What is that thing that you might be willing to gamble everything you have to do, to be, or to experience? What is it? Discovering the “IT” is to discover your passion.

Passion is the single most powerful force to drive you to true purpose. It is that part of you that connects you with oxygen. It is the fuel that burns in your veins. It is the nitro that ignites your power to live. Think about it.



, Quietly meditate on them for a moment.


What is the “common thread” or “familiar theme” running through all of these?

Is music that common thread?
Is compassion for people that familiar theme?
Is boating or water sport your thing?
Is it children?
Is it fashion?
Is it ministry?
Is it politics?


Discover the common thread and you are halfway to discovering your purpose. There is more work to be done. You then must determine if you have developed each of these to the fullest of your ability. If not, set out a plan to increase your knowledge, understanding, and resources in the area of your strengths.

, We can see this person has something about baking and/or writing in every quadrant. It is very possible that with some courses or extra training they could become a great baker because they have the talent for it, the resources for it, and the passion for baking cakes.


Perhaps they may come to write articles or even a book about unique cake recipes and cake design from around the world. For them it is no WORK but ART. This doesn’t mean it will be easy. It simply means they will benefit from every moment of it because they are fulfilling purpose.

Be happy.,
Stop being frustrated.,
Be calm.,
Stop comparing yourself to others.,
Enjoy happiness now.,
Overcome addictions.,
Live simply.,
Be grateful.,
Get out in the fresh air, appreciate nature, spend time with loved ones.,
Be confident.",How to Be Satisfied With What You Have," Whenever you are feeling down, think of something that makes you feel happy and calm. It can be an ocean wave, open sky or a guy/girl that you like.;
, Replace anger. Know that you have an inability to control things and other people. So stop trying to.

, Relax & or meditate. Remember- what we now have was once among the things we wished for.

, When you compare yourself to someone else, you'll always find someone who has it better than you. ALWAYS. So- why do it? Sometimes it's better to enjoy the moonlight than to reach for the moon.

, Since there's always someone who has it better, there's always someone who has it worse as well. So just enjoy life, let things go, & do whatever makes you happy.

, Addictions are a sign that you're not focusing on the world around you but are trying to seek an escape. Don't ignore reality, find the good things & make your reality as good as your dreams. It can happen. Just believe.

, So that others may simply live goes the adage... but the truth is, have too much stuff just becomes clutter and weighs us down. Realistically, how much of that stuff in your house do you really need and use regularly?

, Be thankful. Being grateful is healthy for you. Whatever you already have- be it health, loved ones, a good career, interests, hobbies, a car, clothes, a home, great views, talents, etc., make the most of it and be grateful for it. We take it all for granted, and many people would kill for what we have.

, This is all free but deeply satisfying.

, Much of our own unhappiness stems from the fact that we focus on the negatives of our life more than the positives. Having a confident attitude will help you to focus on your strengths. Try walking away from a situation and dwell with contentment on what went right, instead of what went wrong or what could have gone better.

Recognize that cultures are far more diverse and complicated than the sum of their parts.,
Consider the all-important impact of geography on a region's culture.,
Dive into the greater history of the region to uncover long-standing influences.,
Leave your existing biases and ideas at the door.,
Share parts of your own culture to encourage others to share theirs.,
Read, watch, and listen to other cultures' media.",How to Be Understanding2," For the sake of discussion, consider the myriad issues and problems plaguing the Middle East. While complete understanding of these problems is impossible, there is a lot more to the area than ISIS and oil wars. To start better understanding it, you have to dive into the broader events and issues that have been affecting the Middle East for thousands of years, not just the events of the last six months.


What sorts of things do you think about when you think about the Middle East (or any region)? Do you have any actual evidence or proof of these beliefs, or could they be explored further?
Being understanding requires forgetting about your baseless ideas and stereotypes and diving deeper. Very few things in the world are black and white, and believing they are will get in the way of an open, inquisitive mind., More often than not, where a person lives has a far greater impact on what they do than any sort of conscience choice. The violence in the Middle East is caused by a myriad of sources, by one very large one is the incredible and lasting drought in the region -- the worst drought in 900 years.When people can't get basic amenities like water, they are much more prone using violence to protect themselves. Think about where people live to gain a deeper, more nuanced understanding of how they live.


Look no further than the United States for proof. While there is an overarching ""American"" culture, even light travel reveals that people have different attitudes and customs from state to state. Geography matters., Continuing with the Middle East, the current cycle of violence makes much more sense when you realize that, after World War I, European nations re-drew country boundaries to force warring tribes to live together.These long-standing conflicts were ignored by the British and French colonists, who wanted in-fighting to prevent rebelling against the Europeans. Unfortunately, this inter-country strife is rearing it's head again today in bloody civil wars, but these wars make much more sense when you know the underlying historical issues.


Understanding goes hand and hand with knowledge. The more you know about a region or group of people, the easier it will be to understand them., Understanding is less of a goal and more of a process. You can never ""completely"" understand a culture, but you can remain open-minded to new ideas and practices as they come to you. By trying to keep an open mind, letting go of old ideas in favor of learning everything you can, you remove the biggest roadblock to understanding others.


It is easy to say that ""Islam is a violent religion"" because of recent violence in the Middle East. But such a claim blinds you to the millions of peaceful, driven, and kind Muslims in the world, as well as Islam's own peaceful aspects.

, If you're traveling, bring around a collection of photographs from home, as this is an easy and immediate way to start conversations. Don't be afraid to share foods, experiences, and ideas. Understanding is a two-way street -- if you make an effort to share something from your life, most people will make an effort to share parts of theirs.


You don't have to travel to start this -- host an exchange student or family, go see a traveling cultural event from another country, or volunteer with a refugee program.

, The sorts of books, music, and movies people enjoy can say a lot about what they value. What are the sorts of quests their heroes embark on, for example? Currently, the US is in the grips of ""superhero mania,"" which may suggest a desire that anyone can be extraordinary, as well as the growing powers and responsibility of god-like technologies. Even if your insight isn't quite as clear-cut, just sharing in the arts of another culture is a wonderful way to begin understanding it.


Think about how often you ask new friends, ""what music/movies/tv shows do you like?"" Humans bond and socialize over art, learning about each other indirectly."
"
Make learning a priority in everything you do.,
Consider your goals to figure out where you want life to go.,
Ask yourself how you handle stress and conflict.,
Be open and upfront in your interactions.,
Honestly examine the roots of your biases.,
Embrace the truth that you will never know everything about yourself -- and that's okay.,
Continue re-evaluating and thinking about yourself throughout life.",How to Be Understanding3," Knowing is the first step towards understanding. Thus, you need be reading, listening and reflecting to grow more understanding, no matter what the task. The more you learn and expose yourself to, the more question you can ask and conclusions you can reach. Understanding, whether it is yourself, others, or other countries, is when you can take the facts and use them to draw broader conclusions, but you can only do that if you first study the facts.


It sounds cliche, but make an effort to learn something every single day. Read a news story, watch a documentary, pick up a skill, or test out a new song on guitar. Knowledge is power -- start accumulating it!, Don't worry if you don't have concrete plans for you future just yet -- most people don't. The people that do, however, have spent time thinking about what basic things they need to be happy. You can then figure out ways to achieve that happiness. If you don't have plans yet, start with the basics:


What sort of work do you enjoy doing, even if it seems ""unrealistic"" for a career. What sort of work do you detest?
What sort of environment do you ultimately see yourself in, rural or urban? Hot or cold? Near a city or near the middle of nowhere?
What is important to you outside of work? What hobbies and passions are important to you and you can't live without?, One of the best ways to learn about yourself is to look back on how you do under pressure. Do you thrive under challenges, or prefer a more laid-back approach to life? When under stress, do you like to take private time to collect your thoughts or do you seek out the comfort of close friends? Life is not always easy, and thinking about how you handle the difficult parts is a great way to deal with them more effectively next time.

, Sometimes honesty isn't easy in the short term. But by acting and talking to others with openness and honestly you make these two traits a bigger part of yourself. By thinking honestly about your goals, biases, and ideas, you get a good idea of who you are. By putting them into actions and words you start to reveal new roads towards self-understanding and awareness., The trick is to understand your biases, since they point, generally, to what is important in your life. Take political bias, for example. Perhaps you consider yourself a conservative -- minimal government intervention in life, lots of personal freedom, lower taxes, etc. Knowing this, ask yourself why? Were your parents conservative? Have you had bad experiences with government regulators or taxes? Thinking about these causes will help recognize the personal reason behind your beliefs, creating greater self-awareness.

, Consider the common but profound realization that you actually like a food that you've ""hated"" your entire life. People change, and you are no different. Just like you should recognize biases when dealing with others, know that you have a personal bias as well. When you said you ""hated"" tomatoes, you were likely basing this on one bad experience you had as a kid. Realizing that you have your own biases will help your explore new ideas and parts of yourself.


We are just as often wrong about ourselves as we are about other people. Keeping an open mind is the best way to avoid issues of misunderstanding.
While the tomato example is on the lighter side, think about something like politics. How often have you become friends with someone, even briefly, only to realize later that they are the exact opposite side of the political spectrum as you?, You are an incredibly complex, interesting, and multi-faceted person, and you'll only keep changing as life continues. Never assume you ""know everything about yourself,"" otherwise you close yourself off to greater understanding as you grow older and wiser. The process of ""knowing thyself"" is one that will continue revealing little insights about yourself every year as long as you keep trying it.


Read over old notes, journals, or scribbles from your past. How have you changed, and how have you stayed the same?"

Escape to reality.",How to Get Away from Reality," Exercise can be a good way to get your mind off of the world around you, while also making you into a stronger, healthier person. Scientists have established that exercise has some natural neurological effects that make us happier. Long distance running, for example, will eventually cause a “runner’s high,” but even short workouts make us feel better.Thirty minutes of brisk walking per day is enough to significantly decrease anxiety and depression.;
, Meditation involves, by its very nature, taking your mind off of the world around you. However, it has been shown to have positive psychological and neurological effects.Although there are various types of meditation, the one that is best established scientifically (and most likely to distract you) is mindful meditation.


Mindful meditation is when you focus exclusively on one thing around you. The standard practice is to think about only your breathing, though you could also focus on a different sensation in your body or on an object in your environment. When your mind begins to stray, try to direct it back to the object of your meditation.
This practice has been shown to increase your ability to recruit high order pre-frontal regions of the brain, essentially allowing your conscious mind to suppress unconscious anxieties.If you are having trouble controlling your emotions, mindful meditation might be the solution for you., Traveling, especially spending an extended period of time in someplace culturally foreign, is shown to make people more agreeable and emotionally stable.Travel is a good way to escape the daily humdrum of your life, while learning something about the wider world around you. Like most forms of escapism though, travel can be harmfully addictive if you rely too heavily on it for your happiness.


You might be addicted to travel if you feel depressed for an extended period of time upon your return from a trip or if travel is impeding your ability to establish a financial and social foundation at home. If you find this to be the case, consider taking a break from travel., Sitting back with a book can be a great way to escape the world around you while expanding your vocabulary, reading comprehension, and other language arts skills. The best books for escapism are typically those that don’t remind us of real world problems.


Experts say that the best books for escapism are fantasy and children’s stories. These usually take us to a very different world, without any of the issues that we experience in our own lives., Music can be a great way to regulate your moods. It is used both to make us happier and to cope with sadness. It can distract us, but it can also foster an awareness of our emotions. It can be used, therefore, both to seek escape and come to grips with what we’re escaping., Knitting, art, music, woodworking, and other crafts require attention to detail. They compel you to take your mind off of what is bothering you and to focus on what you create. When everything is said and done, you will have distracted yourself and learned a useful skill. Perhaps you will even have produced something that can either earn you money or provide enjoyment to other people.

, TV is a great way to distract yourself, because it naturally quiets your thoughts.However, TV isn’t great for you; every hour of TV you watch is estimated to reduce your life expectancy by 22 minutes. While the science is still developing, limiting yourself to something like two hours of TV per day is probably ideal., Video games, especially those that involve expansive fantasy worlds, can help us relax and escape the world around us. Because they’re more active than TV, moderate video game use can actually be helpful, making kids more social and happy as well as encouraging certain types of mental development. However, the benefits of video games stop accumulating after an hour of play per day., The internet can be a great place to learn things and keep in touch with people. Excessive time online, however, will make us lonelier, less productive, and keep us up at night. Experts suggest that we spend no more than two hours per day online.


Don’t interpret the time allotted to surfing the web, playing video games, or watching TV as cumulative. In general, you should try to only spend about two hours per day in front of a screen of any sort.

, Coffee and conversation is a good way to perk yourself up. Even a milkshake can help you out. Alcohol and socialization is also an obvious way to change your mood. Less obvious is what role alcohol should play in our lives. Studies have shown that moderate drinking can have small health benefits, but extreme alcohol consumption is very detrimental to us. Experts recommend no more than two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women., A host of studies have shown that people who regularly try to escape reality experience anxiety and depression. Although the things they use to escape reality make them happier in the short-term, they’re usually using them to escape a situation that will only get worse if it isn’t addressed.Escapism can be divided into four stages, healthy enjoyment, avoidance, neglect, and obsession. Once you begin putting off important issues you have reached “avoidance” and when you allow your life to begin falling apart you have entered “neglect.” By “obsession,” you have difficulty finding enjoyment in the real world. If you find that you are engaged in anything other than healthy enjoyment, you should consider changing your lifestyle., Escapism is, by its definition, an effort to run from something you don’t want to confront. Diagnosing what that is can be difficult, precisely because you are afraid of it. Find strength in the knowledge that the situation will only get worse if you don’t do anything about it.Sometimes it can also be hard for us to see what we’re running from because we’ve never known anything different. Talking to someone else, especially a professional therapist, will give us new perspective and help us diagnose what we dislike about our lives.

, Once we know what is bothering with us we can make an effort to fix it. Try to channel the energy that you had been expending on escapism into something that will fix your problems. For example, if you are discontent with your romantic life, go out and meet people instead of staying inside.


Many of our issues are really about confidence, and for those, positive self talk can be useful. Your own mental dialogue defines how you perceive yourself. To be more confident, spend more time thinking positive things about yourself.You can also spend more time trying to rectify whatever you have problems with. If, after some self searching, you find that you are upset with your physical condition, invest some time into exercise. If you are concerned about your grades, spend more time studying. If your financial situation bothers you, begin researching new career opportunities.

, Try to have a good time in the real world. Explore the city that you live in, try to pick up new skills or languages.Most importantly, go out and see people. While talking to people online might seem to fill a social need, studies show that people who primarily socialize online are actually lonelier.


The exception to this rule is if you are using the internet to stay in touch with real world friends and family. That is different than trying to carve out a social life that is entirely digital.You can also use the internet as a jumping point to find people with similar interests whom you can socialize with in person. Meetup.com is a good resource for taking online interactions into a healthier real world environment.

Know what you like, what you don't like, and what your morals are.,
Realize that you don't have to do any of the things that you don't like.,
Learn to be independent.,
Fill your mind with whatever you want it to be filled with!,
Do what you want!,
If you do want friends, hang out with them!,
Love yourself.",How to Live in Your Own Little World," Don't pay attention to if it's right etiquette, or awkward or something. Like, for instance, if you like Peter pan lunch boxes, don't like people who talk on their cell phones really loud, and don't want to swear, or something.;
, It's good to help people, and stuff, it's never okay to not be good, but you don't have to do things with culture. If you want to wear ""girls clothes"" and you're a boy, GO AHEAD! Even if people will make fun of you. (Who ever said that boys can't wear girls clothes and girls can't wear boys clothes? It's all culture, ! Back in the day, girls weren't supposed to wear pants because of culture and etiquette, but they are now!)

, Being independent is helpful in a way that it will teach you the pride of doing your tasks yourself and the way you want.

, You could have it filled with good thoughts, what your goals are, what you want to do, butterflies and pixies, whatever.

, Good suggestions would be:


Read Books,
Play Tennis on a wall at a school or tennis court or something,
Learn to play an instrument like the Piano, or Violin, or something. Or, you could learn a new Language.
Take up a hobby like juggling, baton twirling, etc.
If you don't want friends, You could go to https://www.wikihow.com/Live-Without-Friends-During-School-Years


, But never compromise who you want to be. If they don't like you, they're not your real friend. Unless you're doing bad things and they're worried about you. But, if you're doing the right thing, you're never wrong.

, Realize that you're a REALLY cool person! There is no one in the world like you. Did you know that? You probably heard it before, but think about it. You are different than anyone else in the world. Now one sees the world the way you do. You have a whole new perspective no one has ever seen the world before!

Swap “sharing” for “shopping.” We often mistakenly believe that an abundant life comes from having stuff.,
Swap “enough” for “greed.” In the years leading up to the Great Recession, we defined abundance as being able to accumulate.,
Swap “morality” for “market.” Many people say they are looking to the marketplace to “innovate” our way out of this economic crisis.,
Swap “trust” for “fear.” This step flows out of the previous one.,
Swap “spiritual” for “material.” This step also builds on the previous one.",How to Live an Abundant Life," We use shopping for things we don’t need like a drug to try to fill the emptiness within. Paradoxically, what will fill that void is not buying more stuff, but sharing the stuff we have. When we are generous, we begin to believe that we have plenty. We tap into the abundant life. In her book ""Money Secrets of the Amish,"" author and journalist Lorilee Craker points out that Amish, who live simply, also enjoy financial freedom that goes with it. They share what they have, often bartering with neighbors and friends for what they need.;
, But true abundance is based not on the idea of greed, but the idea of “enough.” Pastor and activist Jim Wallis writes: “Perhaps the best counter to the culture of ‘greed is good’ is an admonition that comes from the heart of our moral and religious traditions that remind us that ‘enough is enough.’” , But that is the equivalent of making the “market” a god—giving it power it really should not have. When people are simply pursuing financial self-interest (the highest market value) they won’t always do what’s right. Sure, the laws of supply and demand come into play, but they must be tempered by morality. In his book Rediscovering Values, Wallis writes: “The market can be a good thing and even necessary; but it now commands too much, claims ultimate significance, controls too much space in our lives, and has gone far beyond its proper limits… if the market ultimately defines what gets our attention, we will be defined by the moral limits of the marketplace.” (p. 30, 38) , Materialism is driven, in part, by fear—that we don’t have enough, that we aren’t good enough unless we have certain possessions. Choose not to fear. Wallis observes: “The market’s fear of scarcity must be replaced with the abundance of a loving God.” (p. 40)

, True abundance comes when you are in touch with the spiritual. Seek God. Regardless of your faith tradition, or even if you don’t have one at all, taking time to pray and meditate will bring you joy. The spiritual is not just internal, however. Every major religion includes a tradition of caring for the poor and living more simply. Generosity and simplicity are an essential part of spirituality, and the key to an abundant and meaningful life. ""Money Secrets"" author Craker() writes that today's recessionary times ""call for a different mentality, one of reassessing spending habits and values, and of focusing not on what we lost but what we have."" She adds that as she swapped spiritual for material, it changed her family's dynamics for the better: ""ironically, the less we spend on family time, the closer we get. The Amish would not be surprised by this. They know investing in relationships is a far greater venture than devoting money for material things.""

Wander.,
Choose doors to enter.,
Enter your flow state.,
Spend time alone.,
Practice forgiveness.",How to Live for Today1," Go out in the world on foot, weather permitting. Instead of making a plan, let your feet carry you around. Walk to a neighborhood you rarely visit, or a park. Take a bus and walk around somewhere you don't spend much time. Spend as much time on your feet and without a map or a phone as you comfortably can.


If you find yourself automatically taking routes you always take, reprogram yourself. For example, take an ordinary route but take a crucial wrong turn.
Take a map and draw a shape on it with your eyes closed. Now follow the ""route"" you drew through the city as closely as you safely can.
Call a friend and ask them what their favorite point in your town is. Ask for very rough directions and see if you can find it before sunset.
Feel free to change your mind at any point and walk in the directions that attract you. You're getting lost in order to live fully, not enact a strict plan.;
, Take the opportunities given to you today, whether they be invitations from friends or samples at the grocery store. Don't do anything that makes you feel truly wrong, but do encourage yourself to try new things. Say ""yes"" to more than you usually do, and you might surprise yourself.

, Do work that compels your attention completely. Do not time yourself, but let yourself focus for as long as you naturally can. Play music, read, write, dance, walk, or work on a project or hobby. Flow state means you are in the moment, creative, focused, and undistracted.


If you have no work or hobby that can completely occupy your attention, work on developing one.
Pick a project that involves your most developed skills and is meaningful to you.
Eliminate distractions. Do not check your email, any websites, or your phone while you work.
If you were productive, lost track of time, and felt good after working, you were in flow state.

, You can be alone in public or privately alone, but take some solitary time. If most of your solitary time is spent a certain way, find another way to spend it. For instance, if you work from home, go somewhere else to be alone. Visit a library, a museum, or take yourself out to lunch.


Spend time away from your phone and your computer. Forgetting your ordinary obligations will help you live in the moment.

, Choose to move on from feelings of resentment. Nothing takes you away from the present like dwelling in the past. To clear your day of resentment, make a list of people who have hurt you, or, if there is one person strongly on your mind, write only that name. Spend some time thinking about how much they hurt you, and what effect that has had on you.Decide to attempt forgiveness. Say it aloud if that sometimes helps you.
Ask yourself what you know about the person who hurt you. Try to reconstruct the stresses, pressures, traumas, and fears that this person has experienced.
Let go of your anger. Allow yourself to feel compassion for the person who wronged you. You don't have to reconcile them, just let yourself feel some goodwill towards them.
Forgiveness can have a positive effect on your health and wellbeing. Choosing to forgive a betrayal can lower your blood pressure, improve your heart health, and diminish anxiety and depression."
"
Connect with another person.,
Find a creative outlet.,
Discuss the situation with a professional.,
Join a support group.",How to Learn to Let Go of Things1," Go to social gatherings and spend time with friends or make new ones. Allowing yourself to have genuine connections with other people will start giving you positive experiences to talk about and relate to. These experiences can start shifting a negative mindset to a more optimistic one.You may or may not talk to your friends about what is bothering you, but just knowing that they are there is reassuring.
And if you decide to confide in someone you trust, you may experience some relief, or your friend's feedback may be useful.;
, Create works of art to help your brain integrate emotions and thoughts. By creating something, you form new neural pathways in your brain and utilize your entire brain during the process. Aside from being a great way to pour your focus into something positive, creating a work of art can be healing.This does not have to be a “traditional” kind of art. You might choose to paint a picture, but you can create art in many other ways, too. For example, you could build a birdhouse as a creative project, or use online coloring apps or puzzles.

, If your pain is severe and causes you to feel depressed, anxious, or otherwise mentally unstable, you should seek help from a mental health professional. You should also seek out a professional if you have dealt with the pain for a long time and still struggle to cope with the incident. Your doctor can refer you to a mental health professional.The time required to heal from an incident can vary from incident to incident and person to person. For example, it may take you longer to heal after a parent dies than it takes someone to heal from losing their dog.

, Support groups will allow you to connect directly with people who are struggling with the same pains. These groups will allow you to share your story and encourage others with similar stories. You will also be held accountable for taking steps to heal yourself since you will be talking about it at each meeting.Support groups are understanding of people working through all stages of pain. You will not be required to share or talk in most support groups.

Deconstruct your ordinary procedures.,
Do nothing.,
Practice mindfulness.",How to Live for Today2," Instead of buying lunch, buy groceries and cook a meal. To buy ingredients, walk somewhere you can buy them, such as a corner store, a farmer's market, or a grocery store. Buy as many parts of the meal from scratch as you can.


For instance, if you would normally buy a chicken sandwich, consider baking bread, sautéing some chicken, and making fresh mayonnaise and quick pickles.
Visit a pick-your-own orchard and pick fruit that is in season. Eat some, bake some, freeze some, and make sauce from the rest.

, Living fully in the day means not filling in all the empty space. Do nothing, or do one thing at a time. When you eat, focus on your food. Let your mind wander. You are likely to remember things you need to do when your mind wanders: make a note of them, and continue doing nothing.

, So much of living in the day means allowing yourself to be open in the moment. Leave yourself vulnerable to any thoughts, senses, and feelings that come to you. Rather than interpreting or judging them, let lean into them.If you feel yourself getting worried, distracted, or unhappy, do exercises that help you regain the present.


Name the emotions that come to you. Do not shut out unpleasant thoughts or feelings, but say what they are, and what you think brought them up.
You don't need to go deep, in fact you want to avoid spiraling into negative thoughts. Negative thoughts don't usually lead anywhere but back to themselves, so it's important to recognize them and let them go.
Turn your attention to your senses. Notice what you can see, smell, hear, and feel in the moment.Feel the breath coming in and out of you. Take deep breaths and let them out slowly. Focus only on your breath for a while.Relax your whole body by tensing and relaxing each muscle in turn.

Focus on your body.,
Practice gratitude.,
Commune with others.,
Spend time enjoying art.,
Be outside.,
Do something you haven't done before.",How to Live for Today3," Wear clothing that feels good on your skin. Eat food that makes your body feel energized. Avoid overeating or undereating. Take a nap if you feel tired. Exercise. Take a dance class, ride your bike, or go on a long, brisk walk.


If you can't tell what your body wants, do some mindfulness exercises. They will help put you back in your body.
Get a full night's sleep. Sleep without an alarm, and make your room as dark as possible.

, To live for today, focus on what you have. Appreciate the things that make each day yours. When someone does something you appreciate, thank them. Let everyone you love know one thing you love about them. Make a list of things you are grateful for, and share it with those you love.


If something happens in your day that you appreciate, write it down, title it, and include as much detail as you can, including how it came to be and how it made you feel.Make up a list of people you are grateful for, and write a letter a day., Spend time with friends or family doing relaxed, focused activites. Talk, eat, cook, or go on a walk with someone you love. Pay attention to the people you are with: ask questions, and listen to their answers. Hug, touch, and hold hands with your loved ones.


Spend time face to face if you can, but also call a loved one on the phone if they are on your mind.
Commune with a crowd. Go to a concert, a club, a church, a sporting event, a protest or a rally. Cheer, chant, move, and sing with others. Go to an event you feel welcome at, so you can enter into the group feeling.

, Paying deep attention to art can induce a state of heightened mindfulness. By paying attention to images, sounds, patterns and textures, you can experience deep emotion without judgment. Visit a museum, listen to music, and read poetry.


Don't force yourself to understand or analyze what you see, hear, and read. Don't force yourself to enjoy, either. Instead, let yourself relax and pay attention to the sensory information you receive.
If you are having trouble being present with art, try noticing five things about what you are experiencing. If you are looking at a painting, try to distinguish the brush strokes. If you are reading a poem, notice the vowels and see if they repeat.

, Spend time in the sun to improve your mood and feel present in your body.Visit a park, the forest, the beach, or another natural setting to lower your stress.Spend time outside without doing anything else. Don't listen to music or talk on the phone.


You can also spend time outside as part of your everyday activities. If you have something you need to do, ask yourself if you can do it outside.

, If you are feeling relaxed, mindful, and pleased with your day, you might be ready for the thrill of doing something new. Make a list of five things you never have done: places you haven't gone, things you haven't said, ways of participating in public or social spheres you haven't tried.


Ask yourself: have I ever had a friendly conversation with my friend about our different political beliefs? Have I ever told a joke in class or at work? Have I ever been the first person to get up and dance at a party?
Ask: have I ever memorized a song to sing to myself? Have I ever written a letter on paper to my mother? Have I ever spent a day riding my bike instead of driving my car?
Ask: Have I ridden a horse? Have I made my own cards? Have I traveled by train?
You'll know the right thing to do when you get a little thrill of fear.

Take time to remember the person.,
Visualize yourself without that person.,
Move on with your life.,
Focus your mind on the present.",How to Learn to Let Go of Things2," Whether the person is an ex, a friend, or a relative you need to take some time to remember your relationship. Remember the good parts as well as the bad parts. Make an effort to see the person as a whole and look past the one incident that has hurt you. Doing so will help you empathize with the person and forgive them.For example, if your friend said something that hurt you, acknowledge that the same friend has said things that made you happy before, too. You don’t have remain friends, but you will retain a level of respect for them as a person. Assess if only one or two things have been said, or if there has been a repetitive pattern over time.
One good way to remember the person is to write them a letter. You do not need to send the letter to them, just writing it will allow you to think back on the good times and the bad times, and often you may release some of the pain you having been dealing with in the process.

, Think back to a time before you were hurt by this person. Remember the person you were before you met that person. Imagine the person that you would like to be without that person in your life. Having a clear picture of what you want in life can make it easier to let go of a painful relationship.Friends are difficult to let go. Still, partners and family can often be even harder relationships to move past. Motivate yourself to move past the relationship by having a clear picture of the life you want to live.

, Let go of the things or people that have hurt you in the past. Holding onto this hurt only hurts you, not the person. This hurt can also be carried over to new relationships, friendships, and even careers. Learn a lesson from this pain, but forgive the person and move on, and remember that forgiving does not mean that you return to having the same degree of connection or intimacy. It has more to do with freeing yourself up.Forgive an old partner for hurting you in a relationship.
Forgive a friend that did something wrong.
Forgive your family members for things that happened in your childhood.

, Avoid venturing down the road of asking “What if?” Thinking emotionally about the past instead of factually about the present will leave you in pain. Put up pictures and other adornments that reflect your life now, not your old life.For example, take down pictures of you and your old lover and put up pictures of you with your friends.
You can also use quotes or mantras to inspire yourself to focus on the present. For example, when you feel like dwelling on the past, you could repeat something like “To be happy now, I have to think about now.”

"
"
Learn how to meditate.,
Use deep breathing exercises.,
Do something positive.,
Find an outlet to release stress.",How to Learn to Let Go of Things3," Spend time each day clearing your head through meditation. Choose a meditation technique that works for you, and find a quiet space away from any distractions. The goal of your meditation is to be present and mindful of your current life and avoid dwelling on the pain or negativity.Consider using a guided meditation if you are new to meditation.

, Practicing deep breathing reduces cortisol levels in your body. Cortisol is the hormone that your body creates when you are stressed. Deep breathing will also help to reduce your blood pressure. This will help you feel better physically and emotionally.When you are healthier and feel better, you can focus on the positive more easily.

, Counter the negative stress in your life by adding something positive to your life. Take the time that you spend having negative thoughts and channel that energy into something positive and productive. This will also create less time to have negative thoughts.Volunteer at a local food bank or non-profit organization.
Consider new job possibilities if you current job is too stressful.
Join a club or a local sports team.

, Your outlet should be something that you enjoy doing. Anything from exercise to art can help you let go of stress. You can also use your outlet as an opportunity to meet and interact with new people.For example, you might take an art class or spend time with new friends at the gym.

Find doctors who will look beyond your weight to actually help you.,
Search the internet for fat-friendly doctors in your area, if you have a choice of doctors.,
State exactly what symptoms you are facing and what you would like to seek treatment for when speaking to a doctor, or when you’re going to the doctor with someone.,
Decide not to be weighed in a doctor's office, if you would prefer not to be.,
Stand your ground.,
Ask the doctor what treatment they would suggest if a thin person presented with the same symptoms.,
Bring along a supportive friend to help you to stick to your guns.,
Find a way of providing yourself with adequate nutrition, if at all possible.,
If you are afflicted with an eating disorder or recovering from one, get the help you can.,
Do your best to keep yourself safe.",How to Live in a Thin Centric World1," There is a strong bias within the medical community against fat patients. Many hospital personnel would prefer not to treat fat patients at all. They do not want to be around them or have to touch them. As a result, many fat people do not receive adequate medical attention. This has, in many cases, resulted in the death of the patient, since they are often simply told to ""lose weight and your ailment will go away"", even when presenting with dangerous conditions (heart conditions, asthma, or auto-immune diseases) or had important medication withheld from them because it might cause weight gain or because they did not lose a certain amount of weight imposed by medical personnel.;
, There are compilations made by fat-positive blogs and activists.

, In this way, you make it clear that you want a full, honest investigation of the problems that you’re having and that you won’t accept the “Lose weight” prescription as the be-all, end-all of your issue.

, This is something that people tend to forget that they can ask for. But going into the appointment not wanting your weight to be at all discussed can make your approach strong and firm. A possible way of saying this is to answer when you are asked to step on the scale: ""No, thank you, it really isn't relevant to my visit.""

, If the nurse, doctor, or anyone asks about why you don’t want to be weighed or any other weight-related questions, you can use a response like “I did not come to discuss my weight today; I would like to focus on ________.” If they push, repeat yourself. And if they still will not stop, tell them that you are prepared to seek out another doctor for the treatment you are wanting.

, That can be a way to show up the fat phobia and give you an idea of what therapies are possible for your condition.

, That way, you can have someone to support you.

, Many fat people have trouble being hired at all, and if they are, they often receive lower wages than their thinner colleagues. Nutrition can suffer if you only have a small budget to work with. Negative social attitudes to fat people eating anything at all can result in a disordered relationship to food in general. Useful online resources include articles and studies provided on www.ellynsatter.org, fatnutritionist.com, as well as food blogs directed at people with little time and money, who often have food intolerances. One good example is no-more-ramen.tumblr.com.

, Often, eating disorders are either not diagnosed in fat people because they don't ""look malnourished"" based on not being thin, or they are diagnosed with binge-eating disorder when they do not have it. If you know or suspect that you have an eating disorder, you restrict your food intake, or you harm yourself in other ways, find a clinic near you to receive treatment. If they will not treat you, widen your search. Use online support resources to manage as well as possible while seeking treatment.

, It is not your responsibility to not become the victim of abuse, but you are at a high risk of being harassed or even attacked, simply for living in a fat body. This is particularly ironic because many fat people experience harassment while they are walking or running for exercise, something they are often pressed to do to receive social acceptance based on the trope of the ""good fat person"", someone who is outwardly seeming to strive for weight loss or fitness. Do whatever you want in public, just like thin people get to. Avoid dark areas by yourself, if you can.

Learn new skills.,
Cultivate curiosity.,
Read.,
Do brain games and puzzles.,
Focus and review.,
Write things down--longhand.,
Involve your senses.",How to Improve Mind Power1," By learning new skills, you keep your brain engaged and challenged, which can build new neural connections and improve your cognitive function.


Learning a new language is an excellent way to expand your mind. It will force your brain to work in ways it isn’t accustomed to and can help you see the world around you from a new linguistic perspective.
Trying new activities or hobbies can also help keep your brain tuned up. Look for opportunities to learn how to do new things, like taking ballroom dance, a martial art, a sewing class, or a writing workshop.
Play games. Playing new games with friends or family, particularly more intensive games like chess or cribbage, can help you add to and enhance your cognitive abilities.;
, Don’t accept things as they are. Instead, learn to constantly question things--even things that seem obvious or basic.Deliberately seek out things that are new and different. While it may be tempting to avoid rather than pursue things that are strange or different--new foods or dining styles, new religious ceremonies, new neighborhoods, etc.--your brain builds new and more diverse connections each time it encounters something unfamiliar or difficult to understand. Embrace challenges to your ideas, beliefs, and experiences.

, Reading engages your brain as well as your imagination and is an excellent way to learn new things and to learn to see people, places, things, and ideas in new and different ways.


Seek out reading that’s at least moderately challenging in terms of its vocabulary, content, or ideas. Look for readings that can not only grant you access to new knowledge, but allow you to explore new and different ideas, perspectives, and beliefs as well.

, There are all kinds of games available designed to keep your brain limber and fit. Look around, experiment, and find what works for you.The old standbys of crossword puzzles and logic games have been around for some time, and they persist today because they work--they’re excellent ways to challenge and expand your thinking skills.
Newer alternatives for challenging your brain are available online and as smartphone apps. Many sites offer games designed to keep your mind active and engaged, so rather than spend your downtime browsing cat pictures, consider trying a virtual brain-game.

, Commit to focusing closely on learning and improving your thinking. When you come across a new idea or fact, focus on learning about it and committing it to memory. Then, periodically go back over the new ideas and facts you’ve learned and rehearse them to yourself.


Revisiting new information this way--particularly soon after learning it--is key to incorporating it in a meaningful and lasting way into your memory.
It may seem trivial, but it turns out that just making up your mind to focus and commit to a new idea will help you retain it.

, Research has shown that writing down new information longhand helps you integrate it more thoroughly and recall it more easily.For example, while listening to new information in a meeting, conference, or class, write out the most important information. Be sure to write legibly and to review what you’ve written down afterwards to help it stay fixed in your mind.

, Try to relate new information to your five senses to help you absorb and retain it.


Relate the idea or fact to a taste, tactile feeling, smell, or image. The more multi-sensory you can make it, the more powerfully it will stay with you.Most people already relate the smell of their favorite food to it's taste and to the experiences they've had consuming it.


Another thing to try is counting the number of people in a room. This will help you quickly develop a sharper mind when it comes to remembering, especially if the people are milling around in a hallway or something like that.
For example, if you want to remember that you left your keys on the counter next to the sugar bowl, make an effort to associate the thought of your keys with the taste of sugar and the whiteness (or whatever color) or the countertop.

Stop believing that something is not possible until you are thin(ner).,
Find out who you want to be and how you want to live.,
Surround yourself with people who support you.,
Understand that you are entitled to happiness and joy.,
Do things you wanted to do, but shied away from.,
Take your time if you are making changes in your life.",How to Live in a Thin Centric World2," Many people are brought up from very early childhood to believe that they can achieve nothing until they are thin. ""You'll never find a husband looking like that""/""Nobody wants to date someone like you"" are statements that especially fat girls and young women are pressured with. This, among other things, instills the belief that you do not deserve anything good - a loving relationship, success at work, financial wealth, or friendship - unless you are thin. This type of thinking is very dangerous and opens fat people up to both abusive relationships and exploitation at work. Stop believing it. It is untrue. You are a human being and deserving of everything good. You do not have to ""earn"" respect and dignity.

, Since becoming thin is made such a priority for fat people (either by themselves or through outward pressure), they often have no space or energy to define themselves as people. All other interests are seen as a waste of energy or time that could go to weight loss attempts instead. Free yourself of that notion as much as you can. You have one life, and you get to live that life in the body you have. What do you want to do with it? What are your interests? What do you like to do?

, They may be your family members, friends, or people you know only online, but get in touch with others. Find body-positive and fat positive blogs and activists online. Read their blogs, share your experiences, and read those of others to see you are not alone. If it gives you strength, claim certain words for yourself, such as ""beautiful"". If you do not subscribe to beauty as a goal, don't feel pressured. You don't have to love yourself or feel beautiful if you don't want to.

, Most commodities available for fun are not inclusive of fat people. Movie theatre seats, airline seats, fun ride seats, restaurant seating, public transport, clothing sizes, gym equipment, and online dating, to name a few, are engineered to serve thin people, in spite of the fact that a large percentage of the population of any given country is not thin. This states ""you do not belong here"" to fat people. Understand that you do belong anywhere you wish to be. You have the right to go out and enjoy yourself. You have the right to wear what you wish to wear (provided that you can find it). You have the right to eat in public. You don't have to put up with abusive friendships or relationships because someone is deigning to spend time with you.

, This can be due to the fact that they are a lot more expensive, (for example, buying a bike that does not have a 180-pound weight limit will cost up to 20 times as much as a run-of-the-mill bike that any thin person can use), or because you were held back by others or their criticism, or because you wanted to wait until you were thinner before doing whatever it is. Don't wait. It is your life to live. It is impossible to please others completely. Focus on doing the things that make you feel good, safe, confident, and happy.

, If you want to go to the beach, but you panic when you get there and are afraid of negative comments, sit in the sand or put your feet in the water. Enjoy it on your own terms and make it a positive experience. Maybe after a couple of times you feel like rolling up your pants or sleeves, maybe you eventually move on to wearing shorts, etc. Consider taking a friend or family members with you. If you do receive negative comments, have even more fun. Understand that your body is not public property. You are not infringing on anyone's rights by existing. Someone who thinks you should disappear because they ""don't want to look at you"" severely overestimates the importance of their personal aesthetic. They are not more important than you by default because they are thin(ner). Their opinions are irrelevant.

Stop smoking.,
Eat well.,
Exercise regularly.,
Get enough sleep.,
Meditate.",How to Improve Mind Power2," Researchers have found evidence that smoking impedes cognitive function and may even shrink the size of your brain’s hippocampus.Research has shown that smoking can decrease abilities related to memory, planning, and overall mental ability., There are a number of foods that researchers believe can lend themselves to improved brain function. Of course, eating walnuts won’t make you a genius, but it may help your brain do what it needs to, and maybe do it a bit better.


Food high in omega-3 fatty acids, like walnuts and fish, are important to brain development and may help regulate mood and concentration.Eating foods rich in magnesium is also believed to improve brain function, and, because many people are magnesium deficient, increasing your intake might also be a good idea in general.
Antioxidant-rich foods are believed to help protect the brain from degeneration and are primarily found in fruits and vegetables. The darker the fruit or vegetable, the higher it usually is in antioxidants.For example, blueberries, blackberries, plums, red beans, and black beans are all high in antioxidants.Food rich in whole grains helps to regulate your body’s glucose levels, and because glucose is what your brain uses for fuel, keeping your levels steady is important to your mood and ability to concentrate. Good sources of whole grains include foods like steel-cut oatmeal, brown rice, and oat bran., Maintaining an exercise routine and a healthy diet is important for not just your physical health but for your mental health as well.Cardio activity releases a potent mix of hormones important to improving mood, relieving stress, and boosting concentration.A number of studies have connected exercise with improved cognitive function, including memory, attention, and the ability to move easily between different tasks.Though there isn’t an absolute consensus, many experts recommend moderate cardio activity 2-3 times a week in order to get the full mental benefit of exercise.

, You’ve certainly been admonished about it often enough, but sleep is important. And it turns out it’s notably important to good brain function.


Get at least 6 to 8 hours of sleep each night. Not only will it help you to concentrate and keep you alert, it will also help prevent loss of gray matter in your brain over time.

, Research has shown that daily meditation can improve your brain as well as your well-being. Meditation is believed to particularly improve decision-making and information-processing abilities.Meditative practices like yoga and tai chi have also been found to improve mood and mental function."

Abstain from pleasurable activities temporarily.",How to Live a Good Life," When looking for a life plan, it makes sense to prioritize some areas of your life. List all the things that you value in your life. You might list your family, friends, a certain hobby, nature, or career. Take the time to think deeply about the things without which you could not imagine living.


For example, while you might like playing basketball, is this one of the most important things in your life? Perhaps it is. If not, it is likely a hobby.;
, You have your own moral compass, which guides you through life. What are the values you want your life to reflect? Do you strive to be honest? Perhaps you want to be caring and considerate towards others. Maybe you have a strong sense of social justice. Defining your values will help you determine your future actions.


For example, if you prize honesty, there are some careers that might not be the best for you. CIA agents, for example, cannot disclose to others what they really do.
On the other hand, if you care passionately about social justice, perhaps you could consider studying social work.
For additional tips, see Live Life to the Fullest.

, Every person has his or her own talents and strengths. Aim to live your life in reflection of your unique calling. Finding your calling does not mean following someone else’s path.Instead, seek to define what you do well and how you can live a life that incorporates your strength and perhaps helps other people as well.


For example, you might be a talented teacher and musician. Perhaps your calling is to teach children piano lessons.
On the other hand, you might be a great listener and care about helping others. You might be well-suited to be a psychologist.
If dinosaur bones excite you to no end, perhaps your calling is paleontology and spreading knowledge about dinosaurs and environmental change to a new generation.

, By making goals for life, we can live with a purpose. Do know that at any given time, your goals might change. You can adapt your goals as you move through life. If you have some structure, however, your life likely will be a bit easier.


For example, you might want to become a physician. Your mini goals could be attending college, gaining entrance to medical school, graduating, and beginning to practice medicine. Each of these goals will have sub-goals.
If your goal, on the other hand, is to have children, first you should think about how you want to have them. Do you want a partner with whom you can raise them? Do you prefer to adopt? What are the different strategies you can pursue to fulfill this goal?

, After you have ascertained the people who matter to you, your values, and your goals, create priorities. At different points in life, you might prioritize different aspects. For example, while in school, your studies might take precedence. Later, your relationship or children might take more of your focus. By keeping your priorities in mind, you can better schedule your life.


See Prioritize for additional tips.

, Take the time to build solid relationships with the people about whom you care. Listen to their problems. Help them when necessary. When you offend them, apologize and strive to do better. Practice kind gestures like giving people rides or birthday cards. See Have a Healthy Relationship for more advice. Additionally, practice these behaviors:


Build a circle of trust. Make sure your family members and friends know they can share their thoughts openly with you. Do not tell other people's secrets. If someone asks you to keep a confidence, do so.
Be compassionate towards others. Even if someone wrongs you, if they are sincere in their repentance, show them forgiveness. Do not bring up their past transgressions in moments of anger.

, Be direct when speaking to others. Listen carefully and attentively. If you have disagreements, try to fight effectively. That is, do not call each other names. Instead, discuss your problems calmly. Make sure you listen to the other person's point of view.


For example, it might be wise during arguments to repeat the other person's point of view. This shows you understand. You might say, ""What I'm hearing you say is that you are annoyed by the fact that I am always home so late.""
Ask rather than assume. If you feel a relationship is suffering in some way, talk to the other person openly and candidly., Part of living a good life comes from building a tight-knit local network. If you have neighbors, be helpful to them. Watch their cat when they go on vacation. Offer to shovel an elderly neighbor’s driveway. Practice neighborliness and you might find it is contagious.

, One way to live a good life is to contribute to the community in which you live. You might volunteer at a soup kitchen or run a clothes drive for refugees. Ask your local government representatives or religious organizations for tips on which causes could use help. You also could plan a fundraiser for a cause in the global community.

, See what there is to see in the world around you. Explore new areas in your neighborhood or town or if your budget allows, travel farther. There is no way we can visit every place in our lifetime. We can create awareness and develop empathy by traveling to other places, though.

, In addition to your calling and life purpose, you also need to have plain fun! Find hobbies that interest you and incorporate them into your routine. For example, you might join a knitting group or start rock climbing. By doing hobbies, you also will meet more people and have a more fulfilled life.


See Find a Hobby.

, Eat fresh fruits and vegetables and look for whole-grain pastas and breads. Incorporate more poultry and fish into your diet (unless you’re vegetarian). Beans, nuts, and eggs also offer you good nutrition. Do not overdo your sodium, carbohydrate, or saturated fat intakes.Drink 9 cups of fluids per day if you are female and 13 cups a day if you are male., Try to incorporate 2.5 hours of moderate or 1.25 hours of strenuous cardio exercise per week. To strengthen your muscles, lift twice a week. By exercising regularly, you likely will lead a longer and healthier life. Your heart, muscles, and bones will all benefit.Moderate exercise could be walking, yoga, dancing, or swimming.
Strenuous exercise could be running or doing a spin class.

, Whether or not you follow a particular religion, find what gives you meaning in your life. Why are you on earth? What nurtures your soul? Particularly when you face difficult moments in life, practicing spirituality can help you cope. Being spiritual also helps you forgive others.Prayer and meditation can help you relax and refocus.Having a community built around spirituality or religion can support you when you are in need., Every day, when you wake up, express three things for which you are grateful. Perhaps you have a job you love. Maybe you have a very supportive partner. You might have no illnesses. Always taking a moment to reflect on the things for which you are grateful can be very helpful.


See Express Gratitude for ideas on how to express your gratitude to others.
Practice counting your blessings before bedtime by journalling about three positive moments from your day. Contemplate why these moments occurred and what actions of yours did or did not lead to them., Part of living a good life is not getting wrapped up in the daily problems we all face. While it is important to Handle Problems, take a moment to think about what is going well in your world. Perhaps you saw someone escort an elderly lady across the street. Maybe the children at your local school are collecting food for the homeless. Do you still have your health? Are you not penniless? Do you still have loved ones? Though you might be missing some of these things, keeping your problems in a relative position is helpful.

, One way to be grateful for life and to enjoy life is to engage with nature. Ride your bike along the river or take a walk in the forest. Listen carefully for the different animals’ and insects’ noises. Smell the plants or fresh rain. The world is filled with amazing attributes. Take a moment to let it sink in.


Consider taking a reflective, multi-sensory walk in which you do not focus on any technology. Rather, look around you, notice different buildings or trees in your environment. Focus on the smells coming from a bakery or fresh-cut grass. Listen to people's voices or the wind in the trees., Sometimes to appreciate the good things we have in life, we need to take a pause from them. The pause could be a week or a month. When we return to our activities, we are more likely to realize how lucky we are to have them.For example, perhaps you have a pumpkin latte every day in October. Try taking a week off. You will appreciate the drink and its impact on your happiness even more.

Read Investigate the Feeling Aggregate or other similar works on the subject.,
Select a comfortable meditation posture.,
Examine whatever feelings arise.,
Study the recognition of those feelings - how, where, when and why.,
Look for the distinction or separation as well as the link connection between feelings and what happens afterwards in the mind.,
Consider the accuracy of it, is it 100% accurate and perceives everything?

,
Understand the order that it arises:


first materiality - the body, physical objects and their characteristics,
then feeling,
then perception,
then mental fabrications, activities, constructions, formations, responses or any word that works for you.,
Try to see it happen in action.,
Try to consider why there is only 5 of these aggregates and explore things that happen.,
Consider these 3 similes.,
Finally consider the ""un-manageability"" or the ""auto-pilot"" nature of perception.",How to Investigate the Perception Aggregate," Feeling and perceptions are very closely linked.;
, You can do this in day to day circumstances, but this one is harder to see as its usually buried under all the other feelings and senses.

, Try to see the process of ""recognition"" or ""awareness"" or any words that mean knowing that a feeling has happened.

, The aim of the game is to see the micro-processes in action.


Think about this. Feeling requires contact of the body (nerve endings etc) and the sense object (such as tension, body chemicals, sound, sight, taste etc), if there is no perception of the contact or feeling, the mind doesn't recognize either and feeling just doesn't register.

, That distinction & link is perception.

,,
After that comes the conscious states or any words that describes the mental states that support and dominate the others.

, Trying to understand does not make understanding happen, although exploring the ideas can start the process.

, You might find everything slots into these 5.

, They are more for the serious investigator of this subject, but make sense when you test them.


Materiality is like the sick room and the patient, feeling is the affliction of the sickness, perception is the provoking of the illness (because it makes you want it to go away), formations is the wanting of it to go away and the consciousness is like an incurable illness because it isn't ever free of feeling.
Materiality is the prison, feeling is the punishment, perception is the crime, mental formations are the punisher and the consciousness the punished.
Materiality is like a lump of atomic foam, feeling like a bubble on the water (because it doesn't last), perception is a mirage because it makes illusions (perception of the ""me, mine"" etc), mental formations like a banana or plantain trunk, because while it grows it doesn't have a core of solid heartwood. Consciousness is like a stage illusion. It isn't ever how it seems.

, Its not something we can turn on or off. When someone who studies perceptions with the angle of testing ownership, self or entity, they can make a breakthrough this way as they'll see the starting blocks of new thoughts, feelings and mental processes and that they are empty of any entity. Then illusions are broken and there are no mysteries left.

Study ethics.",How to Follow a Personal Code," Remove distractions so that you are able to think clearly. You want to focus on what is important so that you can absorb and retain the information. The more familiar you are with your personal code, the more likely you will be able to apply it to your life.;
, Decide what makes your life meaningful. Determine what guidelines you want to employ in your daily life to help you make decisions. Come up with your code and go over specific details about why each value is important to you.


Values are the unique life beliefs and principles that you feel are most important to you.They are the things you believe in and want to support or that you feel are not beneficial or harmful and want to avoid.Think about what being honorable or ethical means to you. What do honorable or ethical people do or not do? When you think about people who represent these values, what is it about them that you admire?
If there are things you want to change about your community or the world, figure out what they are and why. This can help you narrow down what your personal values are.
Consider the issues that you feel most strongly about. What are you passionate about during conversations or when you hear others talking? Is there an underlying moral principle here that you feel is essential to living a good life?

, Writing down your personal code and associated goals means you can clarify what you want. Writing down your intention motivates you to take action. Plus, you’re much more likely to realize your goals when you write them down.Write short sentences with tangible meaning, such as, “I will refrain from causing physical harm to those who threaten to physically harm me or my loved ones.""
Include conditional modifiers for various situations, such as, “I will not steal unless there is no other option to feed my family, e.g. during a time of war or natural disaster.”

, Confirm your decision with a signature. This makes it more ‘official’ for you and increases your commitment level. Know that you mean to follow through.

, Goals direct us, allow us keep pace with our values, help us to be happier and even achieve more.In order to stick to your personal code, set goals for when you want to follow each part of your code and how often you want to apply it.


Make a list of challenges related to your goal. Things will stand in the way. Be prepared for them by thinking about what situations could arise that might test your personal code. Think about how you can handle or minimize those obstacles.
If a friend wants you to do something you're not sure about, refer to your personal code to see whether the action conflicts with one of them. If your code dictates not hurting someone else, then consider whether your action might hurt or cause someone distress. Popping tires, for example, might seem funny at the time but maybe the person can't afford new ones and can no longer get to work to provide for their entire family.
Break down your goals into smaller actions. If you want to be an honorable person, decide what actions will make you honorable—preferably ones you can practice in your day-to-day life. Helping an elderly person pick up items they drop, returning lost money and not using offensive language are all opportunities for you to be an honorable person.

, Imagine who you will be in the future once you have mastered your personal code. Try to make your visualization as real and detailed to you as possible. You can also write down the person you imagine to make it feel more tangible.


Choose a timeline in the future, whether it's a week, a year or 10 years from right now. During your visualization exercise, imagine that you are living your personal code and have achieved your short and long term goals.See the areas of your life that you have mastered. Be very specific about the person you visualize. What are you wearing? Are you smiling? What will your day-to-day life be like?
Write down what you see and turn your visualization into a real possibility organized around concrete goals and values. Concentrate on the character strengths that have helped you reach your goals, be the person you want to be and achieve the life you want to live.An example might be: ""I will need to use my positive attitude, teambuilding skills and compassionate personality to help develop services for the homeless in my community within 5 years. I will also be a good friend, father and husband by supporting those I care about, conquering selfish desires, spending wisely and referring to my code.""

, You want to be able to live your code and minimize the things that distract from living your life the way you want to. Life isn’t always going to go smoothly so you need to practice applying your code to multiple situations. The more you think about how you want to react to certain situations and then actually do it, the easier it will get.


During an emotional episode, your personal code can help you to make the best decision—but you have to remember to use it. Otherwise, you may be left to deal with a persuasive personality or circumstance without any personal guidance.
While horsing around with your teenage friends, one of them may suddenly dare you to put something in your coat and walk out a store. However, if you have previously decided that you won’t steal, you'll have an automatic response.

, Some values will be easier to apply than others. Start using the ones that come more naturally first and build on those. If you want to help people, start off smiling at strangers who may be having a hard day, then move up to volunteering or donating. The more you can use your code in day-to-day activities, the more you will start to live it.

, Every time you come up with a plan or goal that is important to your life, you will encounter some form of resistance. Things that take time and effort can be demanding mentally and physically. You can overcome this by focusing on the reason you want to reach your goal. In this case, your personal code gives value to your entire life.

, When you apply your code successfully to a challenge or experience in your life, recognize it. Write it down, if you can, or mark it in some way to show how far you have come. Celebrate victories, even small ones—all together, they will get you where you need to be.

, Things will get in your way, and it will be easier sometimes to give up and do what is easiest instead of following your code. Instead, just keep applying your personal code to your life every day and with every decision you make. Know that practicing discipline and making your code a habit will make your code second nature.


If you make a mistake, don’t use that as an excuse to throw away your personal code. Use it as a chance to learn why you weren’t able to apply your personal code to the situation. This kind of insight will allow you to do better next time.

, Find someone else with a similar code or goals in life. It could be a friend or family member. Look out for each other. A partner can be a great motivator as well as the voice of reason, reminding you about your code when tough situations happen.Make sure your partner supports you and your personal code. Even if you share different values and beliefs, your partner should understand the importance of your personal code to you. Never let someone demean you or make you feel bad for trying to better yourself. If they do, it is probably time to seek counseling or move on.

, Writing a code gives definition and meaning to who you are, but remember that it is not written in stone. Like you, your code should grow and be adaptable as your experiences, convictions and ideals expand.


Look back over your code and your life to see where you have been successful in implementing it as well as the times you might be able to do a little better now. You can use all this information as a roadmap to help you see where you want to be more clearly and perhaps show you how to get there (or how not to).

, If you attempt to apply your code to real life experiences and find that you feel differently in practice, then reconsider one or more of your ideals. Values and personal ethics are developed through trial and error. Make adjustments based on new opinions or advice.


Perhaps you became a vegan because you did not want to cause harm to any living thing. Maybe you then got sick from lack of protein or lost too much weight. In a way, this could be considered causing harm to yourself, so you may need to reconsider your values.

, If you have weaknesses, learn how to control or overcome them so you can be the person you want to be. If you make a mistake, move passed it and choose to do better next time. Your life will be richer when you can continually use your code every day.

, Read books or information online about ethics and philosophy. Study up on the virtues. Use religious, spiritual and philosophical texts to guide you further.


Speak to an expert in ethics, such as professor at your local college. They may have some advice to offer or engage you in discussion that opens new possibilities. You might also consider taking some courses in the field.
Research a role model who motivates you. Try to connect with them at some point, if you can. Study the positive things they have done and continue to do. Think about how you can apply this to your own life.
Alternately, you can think up an example of someone you don't want to be like to motivate you to do differently."

To bring meaning to your life, you must be able to perceive it without language.,

Know that your life in civilization is a construct, not a law of nature.,
Understanding yourself, the universe, and your place in society, it will be easy to find meaning because you will determine what is meaningful.,

Being a ""True Believer"", however, will only result in giving up your identity for the identity of the collective. Conflicts and mid-life crises inevitably arise when the adopted concept of self conflicts with the true self. If you are inquisitive and trusting of your own intelligence, the first step is to find your true self. Self revelation is not for the squeamish. Take the time to let go of societal and personal preconceptions, letting your identity emerge without construct.;
, The universe was here before Humans and certainly before language, and requires no pedantic explanation. Words are not things or actions. They are vibrations of the air molecules or squiggles on a page. Mistaking words for reality is the mistake that puts politicians in office and sells all of the products, religions, and systems of government on the planet. Saying ""Tree"" is no more a tree than saying ""I love you"" means that someone loves you. To perceive reality as it is, one must accept that words are a vehicle for the transference of our perception of reality, not reality itself.

, The fragility of language will undermine your search.

, The universe will unfold and become clear when you seek knowledge without prejudice. Knowledge is not a destination, but a journey. Human knowledge is also imperfect. But don't despair, we know enough to come to firm conclusions. A 'fact' can only mean 'confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.' I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms. Work with what you can know, not what you can imagine.

, It is what it is whether or not you exist.

, Our lives and the way we live them are human constructs of what we think is the best way to live. It is littered with over 6000 years of myth, superstition, and dogma. Don't confuse the truth with the things you do to survive. Society doesn't, and very often won't make sense.

, You will be able to separate the noise of language and society from the true sound of yourself. Define for yourself what brings meaning to your existence. Your meaning will be different from everyone else. You will know your life is meaningful because you will not fear death, getting old,or the various travails all of us encounter. Your destiny, your reason for being here will be apparent every waking hour. Contentment and bliss will follow.

, Start to see life in a bigger picture and know that the small things you do now fits into the bigger picture. For example if you want to save some amount of money, all you have to do is break down to how much you want to save in a day, one day at a time and in a number of years, you will save the money you wanted.

Organize your life.,
Know your purpose for doing what you do.,
Trust other people to do things.,
Regularly make sure you know your priorities.,
Pace yourself and don't be afraid of distractions.,
Don't be afraid to ask others for advice.,
Don't lose track of what you want.",How to Focus in Life," Often people lose focus because they are working too hard or not hard enough. When you understand what led you to act a certain way and lose focus, you can react accordingly. Keep in mind why you aren't focused throughout reading this article. You know you best. If you analyze yourself, you can use the steps below according to how you think.;
, You can't be clear on what you're doing unless you organize your thoughts. Think through what your goals are. Be very clear an deliberate in titling what is a goal to you. Think about the big picture when you organize your thoughts. Where Decide where you want to go physically, mentally, or even emotionally. But try to have a solid and tangible goal such as working or living in a particular place. Make sure that this goal is reasonable, however.

, If you want to work in a particular place, know why. Is it for money, happiness, or even for others? You can't focus unless you know exactly why you do what you do. If you said yes to a task or goal because you were afraid of disappointing or hurting someone, rethink your goal. Doing something because you want to avoid hurting another drains your energy. In some regards, you have to do what is best for you and not others.

, Don't put the weight all on yourself to get somewhere. Absolutely focus on what you want to do and understand why, however know that you can't do everything. There are some jobs that others will volunteer to do and it's your job to let them do it. If there are tasks on your to do list that keep you from doing what you feel you really need to do, then let others know you need a hand. If they realize you trust them and think they're capable, others will step up and help you. If they aren't doing a good job at a task, then take a short amount of time to help them out with it. Just be sure not to criticize them but rather coach. They're helping you, not the other way around.

, Understand what it most important to you reaching your ultimate goal. Every day set aside some time for yourself to jot down everything that's important for you to accomplish. Always stop and question why you're doing something and double check that it's an important thing for you to do. Never lose track of why you're doing a specific thing or else you will lose focus.

, If you overwork yourself, you will eventually get tired and lose focus. Non-productive time is absolutely okay. In fact, you may find that non-productive moments in your life are priceless. Don't be afraid to go out with friends for a night or two. Don't make it a habit, but absolutely give yourself a break occasionally. Creativity and focus demand you give yourself some breathing time. You can't let your creative juices flow if you're constantly working.

, When you're taking the occasional break, tell your friend or family member what task you're finding difficult. Not only may you get some good ideas from them, but talking about it could also make the task at hand much easier for you to work around because you're in a creative atmosphere. Work is often a recited, repetitive task. Talking instills more freedom. By talking, you are giving yourself the freedom to converse your thoughts on a project and quite possibly come up with brand new and interesting ideas.

, Even though you want to distract yourself occasionally, don't make a habit of it. Keep a mindset in which you focus on your goals without burning yourself out. An underlying focus you should always have is maintaining or finding happiness. Finding a balance between work and distractions is ideal. Every day make sure you remember your motives to do what you do.

Use reason as your conscience if you don’t feel an immediate gut reaction.,
Think about the values and behaviour of people you do and don’t respect.,
Educate yourself by reading about people who lived conscience-guided lives.,
Study some unexpected sources of inspiration.",How to Get a Conscience1," You can get a quick bearing if something is right or wrong by asking: ""How would that make me feel?""


Treating others as you would like to be treated is the golden rule of humanity. It is shared by religions, philosophers, humanists and atheists alike and has been expressed by every culture in history:

Buddhism: “Treat not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful.”
Hinduism: “Do not do to others what would cause pain to you.”
Ancient Greece (Aristotle): “Conduct ourselves towards others as we would have them act toward us.”


Applying this rule triggers your conscience to consider if you could be more helpful, listen to others and treat people with more respect. Read up on ways that you can live the golden rule.;
, Focus on how they treat others and if their words (what they say) and actions (what they do) match up to one another. This will sharpen up your knowledge of right and wrong and provide positive and negative role models to learn from. Some positive role models might be people who always keep their word, go out of their way to help, stand up for what is right, or are patient and kind.
Some negative role models might be people who lie, are unkind to others, or feel no remorse or concern when they hurt or upset others.
Be wary of people who show by their words or actions that they lack a conscience. They are termed sociopaths and can be manipulative and dangerous. If you know someone like this you can protect yourself by limiting your contact with them. You can learn how to spot a sociopath here:, You can learn from famous examples such as Gandhi and also from daily news stories of ordinary people living in line with their conscience.


Gandhi famously called his conscience his “little voice within.” It enabled him to oppose injustice in the face of huge difficulty.The Abolitionists are another example of how a strong moral conscience can create change and right injustice. They relied on their moral conscience to successfully end slavery. Conscientious objectors oppose war due their religious, moral or ethical conscience. At times of war they are in a tiny minority and their strong conscience is what enables them to maintain their beliefs in the face of huge opposition. Reading about the atrocities and moral failings of the Holocaust shows how vital keeping a conscience is to protect people from harm. , Three such sources are fiction, films and reality television. They are great practice at tuning up your conscience. Each time you watch a storyline develop or see a character make a difficult choice you are getting a free lesson in how a person's conscience directs their actions.

Read as much as you can.,
Realize that everyone is fallible.,
Be humble in new situations.,

Learn from your mistakes.,
Share your wisdom with others.",How to Gain Wisdom," It's hard to gain wisdom when you stay in and do the same thing day after day. You get wiser when you put yourself out there and give yourself the opportunity to learn, make mistakes and reflect on the experience. If you tend to be on the inhibited side, work on cultivating an inquisitive spirit and the willingness to put yourself in new situations.Every time you experience something new, you open yourself up to the possibility of learning and getting a little wiser for having tried it.


Going to places you've never been before is a great way to get some life experience. Such as booking a trip to another city, or taking a road trip to the next town over. Make an effort to eat at a restaurant that's popular with the locals, rather than going to your favorite chain. Every chance you get, choose newness over the familiar.
Trying new social activities is another good way to open up your world. If you tend to spend your time watching sports, get tickets to see a play. If you're a total bookworm, you could sign up for a hiking club or join a bowling team.;
, If you’re afraid to do something, perhaps that’s the very thing you should try to do. When you have to deal with an awkward or scary situation, you come out on the other side better equipped to handle fear the next time you face it. As Eleanor Roosevelt said, “We gain strength, and courage, and confidence by each experience in which we really stop to look fear in the face . . . we must do that which we think we cannot.”


For example, if you’re afraid of public speaking, volunteer to give a presentation.
If you dislike talking about your feelings, make an effort to have a conversation with a loved one telling the person how much you care. Ask the person how he or she feels, too.

, Talk to people from different backgrounds and with different perspectives from yours, and pay attention to what you can learn from them. Try not to judge them based on your own narrow point of view. The more you're able to empathize with others, the wiser you will be.Practice being a good listener, and ask a lot of questions to find out more. Really pay attention to what people are saying instead of letting your mind wander. Every conversation gives you the chance to understand someone better, broaden your views and thus become wiser.
Share yourself with the people you're talking to, too. Work on going deeper than casual conversation and fostering new friendships.

, Instead of judging things you don’t know much about, consider them from every angle and make an effort to understand.It's easy to base our views on the limited experiences we've had in life, but that's not the way to gain wisdom. You can't help that you've grown up in a certain place with certain people, but you can decide how open you are to learning about different ways of life.


Don’t base your opinions of things on what other people think, or whether something is popular. Do your own research and look at both sides of the story before you decide what you think about something.
For example, maybe you think a certain type of music isn’t cool because none of your friends like it. Before you jump on the bandwagon, try seeing a band play the music live, and read up on its history. When you've taken time to understand something, you can decide you don't like it, but not before then.

, If you’re interested in learning something new, one of the best ways to do it is by taking a class. The classes you take can be affiliated with a university, but they don’t have to be. Do some research to find out if community members where you live teach classes or workshops on their areas of expertise.


Self-directed learning is just as valuable as taking classes. If you don't have access to a class on a subject you'd like to know more about, find alternate ways to learn. Check out books from the library, interview people, and learn by doing.
For example, if you want to learn a new language, you could take a class or do so completely on your own. Find a group of people who speak the language, read books written in the language, and travel to the country where the language is spoken.

, Who in your life strikes you as wise? Wisdom comes in many forms. It could be a pastor who gives people something important to reflect on each week. It could be a teacher who has the ability to inspire people with his or her knowledge. Maybe it’s a family member who reacts to every difficult situation with a level head.Identify why you feel the person is wise. Is it because the person is extremely well read? Does she give excellent advice when people are in need? Does he seem like he's figured out the meaning of life?
What can you learn from him or her? What life choices and behaviors can serve as an example to you? In a given situation, try asking yourself yourself what he or she would do.

, Reading is a way to absorb other people’s perspectives, no matter what subject they’re writing about. It gives you an insight into the way other people think that’s impossible to get in any other way. Reading up on both sides of important matters gives you the information you need to form valid opinions and make reasoned decisions.

, As you gain your own wisdom and experience, you’ll find that those you looked up to as mentors have their own failings. Don’t hold people to such high standards that their mistakes shock and repel you. Strive to see people’s humanity, which means not holding them up on pedestals but taking the bad along with the good.


Every child reaches a moment when he realizes his parents aren’t perfect, that they’re struggling to find the right path just like everyone else. Reaching the point where you see your parents as equals, people who mistakes just like everyone else, is a sign of maturity and wisdom.

Practice forgiveness when someone you revered makes a mistake. Try to empathize with people instead of kicking them when they're down.

, As Socrates said, ""The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing."" It's difficult to fully grasp this concept until you're faced with a life situation that completely stumps you. No matter how smart you are, and how many experiences you've had, you'll encounter times when the line between right and wrong seems fuzzy and you aren't sure what choice to make.Don't go into a new situation presuming that you know just what to do. Examine the problem from all angles, meditate or pray, and then act according to your conscience. It's all you can do.
Accepting your limitations is a high form of wisdom. Know what you have to work with and use your talents to the fullest, but don’t pretend you have more than you do.

, Take as much time as you need to deliberate on a problem before making a decision. Think about the pros and cons, taking your experience as well as others’ advice into account, so you make the wisest possible choice.


Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Turn to someone you think of as wise and ask for advice. However, even advice offered by someone you wholly trust should be taken with a grain of salt. Ultimately, you are the only person who can decide what's right for you to do.

, Looking to people, religious tenets and books for advice and wisdom will only get you so far. Don't just accept a set of values because that's what you were taught. Ultimately, your values should be aligned with your conscience, that gut feeling that tells you what to do based on what you know to be true. When you have a big decision to make, call up your values and stick to them.


For example, let's say there's a person at work who's getting bullied, and you know sticking up for him will make your boss angry. What's the right thing to do? Think carefully and decide what's most important to you: keeping your job or helping someone who's hurting.
Stand up for your values in the face of criticism. This is no easy task, since throughout life people will tell you what they want you to do. Separate your values from those of other people and do what you know is right, no matter what.

, Even a carefully considered decision can end up being the wrong one. Each time you have a new experience, reflect on it and think about what went well and what didn't. When you realize you’ve made a mistake, see what new findings you can apply the next time you face a similar situation.Don’t kick yourself for making a mistake. You’re human, and all you can do is learn from the growing pains you experience.
Realize there’s no such thing as perfection. The goal isn’t to be perfect or godlike, but to do your best to act on your conscience and be a good person throughout life.

, That’s not to say you should tell people what to do; rather, lead by example. Show others the wisdom of being open, nonjudgmental and thoughtful in all situations. Think about the mentors who helped you along the way, and find ways to play that role for other people who might be able to benefit from what you've learned.


If someone asks for advice, do your best to point them in the direction that seems right. Don’t let your personal desires cloud your advice.

Take a personal inventory.,
Focus on what you are grateful for.,
Give up control over things you can't change.",How to Find Inner Peace1," Acceptance of yourself is crucial to the promotion of inner peace because it enables us to be okay with what is currently happening no matter what the circumstances.If we try to avoid pain we may only enhance it. You can start by practicing acceptance of yourself by taking a personal inventory- who you are, what you look like, how you feel, and what you’ve done.


Write down a personal inventory of your personality, characteristics (positive ones and ones you want to work on), actions, and appearance. Make a point to accept each and every part of your inventory – even the stuff you aren’t proud of. Forgive yourself for the wrongs you have done if you need to, and focus on what you can do today to better yourself.
Take an inventory of your goals. Having dreams and aspirations is sometimes what keeps us moving forward in self-acceptance. Set personal goals for yourself and move toward them every day. Some examples of personal goals include: losing weight, eating healthier, exercising more often, picking up a new hobby (such as playing an instrument), or watching less television. On a daily basis, ask yourself if what you are doing is currently in line with your goals and values.
Re-frame your negative traits into positive ones to promote self-acceptance. For example, perhaps you typically think that you are not tall enough and therefore, do not fully accept your height. You can practice self-acceptance by meaning-making about your height. What meaning or purpose might your height have? Does it help you do certain activities that a taller person might not be able to do? How does your height benefit you?;
, One way to practice acceptance of your life is to be grateful for what you have instead of focusing on what you do not have.Take an inventory of everything that you value in your life; this can include: family, friends, a roof over your head, enough food to eat, an education, the government, laws, nature, roads, and transportation. Remember that some people in the world may have little access to some of these things that we see as basic.
You can even create a digital gratitude journal online through Thnx4.org and share your thoughts with others., As humans, we often want to control others (what they do or how they act) and our environments (home, work, school, society, world). We want our spouse to be a better person, our boss to be nicer, our house to be cleaner, and traffic to evaporate. This is likely because we fear the unknown, or what we cannot control, including our own mortality. Unfortunately, we cannot always control these outcomes. Ultimately, we cannot control what others think, feel, or do.


Focus only on what you can control.Ask yourself, “What can I do in this situation?” If you can’t change it then accept it and let it go.

Unlock your conscience by practising empathy.,
Educate yourself on how you can effectively put your empathy skills into practice.,
Challenge how you think about the world.,
Travel and experience other cultures.,
Think about your own behaviour.",How to Get a Conscience2," The ability to truly see things from different points of view is essential. This means really listening to what people say and trying to understand them before jumping to decide what is right or wrong.


Applying the golden rule is a good rule of thumb. In any situation you can quickly ask yourself: ""How would I feel if I were in their situation right now?""
It is important to also realise that their life experience may have been very different to yours. How you would feel in this situation and how they feel might not be the same. Go beyond thinking how you would feel and honestly try to put yourself in their shoes. Ask yourself: “What are they feeling? Why do they feel that way?”

, Once you have read about how to communicate more effectively it will guide you in your everyday interactions with people.


Try to actively listen - really try to hear them, not just wait for your turn to speak.
Don't judge them. Try and understand the feelings behind their words even if you don’t agree with the views they are expressing it is always possible to understand why they think that way. Show them you have listened to what they have said.

, It is easy to stay in the same, safe routine and think you know what is right and wrong, but you miss the opportunity to learn from other possibilities.


Be curious about other people. Get to know people you would normally not stop and talk to. Ask questions about their lives. Speaking to people from different cultures can bring surprising changes in your own beliefs about life.
Speak to older people who have a lifetime of experience. Have meaningful conversations and ask for their advice on life and how to live it. This will bring unexpected information that can be of great value to you in the future.

, Trying places or activities outside your comfort zone will challenge and sharpen your ideas. Different does not mean wrong, it just means different.


Visiting different countries exposes you to all new ways of thinking. It will help you to empathize with different people in different situations.
If you can’t afford to travel, you can experience different cultures at home. Most cities have a variety of ethnic communities and restaurants that you can visit and learn about other cultures. Even watching foreign language films or reading about other cultures can go a long way to opening up your ideas.

, Are you truly treating others as you would like to be treated? Tell the truth to yourself and others, even when it is hard.


Recognize when you've done something right and be proud of it. This will have two benefits, you will see the positive effect it had on others and it will increase your belief and confidence that you are a person who does the right thing.
Recognize when you have done something wrong and learn from it. Reflect on what you did wrong, and work out how you can do better next time. This will help you get back on track.
If you have made a mistake or done something wrong, admit it. You will gain respect for being honest.

Trigger your conscience by asking: “How would I feel if someone did this to me? What would the people I respect think or do in this situation?”

, Think about how you speak, stand, listen, and engage with your family, friends and co-workers. How could it be improved?


Just small differences in your communication style can make a big difference in how effectively you get along with others. Learn about how to practice respectful communication and practice non violent communication.
Show goodwill to everyone, even if they don’t seem to deserve it at the time. Remember that you don’t know the circumstance behind their bad behaviour. Choose to show kindness and respect to everyone. As Plato said: ”Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.”
Make what you think, say and do agree. Using your conscience will make decisions and personal relationships easier and give you peace of mind.

, At first you will have to think about it, but in time these will turn into habits.


You could decide to do a random act of kindness each day such as paying for the coffee of the person behind you.
You could decide that each day you will stop and tell someone how much you appreciate something they do.

, You might decide to make effort to really listen to others with full attention when they ask for it instead of waiting for your turn to talk or multi-tasking.


Use reminders to keep you on track such as the simple Buddhist mantra: “Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action.”
You can read 18 practical tips on living the golden rule here:, If you believe that helping others less fortunate than you is the right thing to do, then get out there and do it.


Reach out and volunteer in your community on issues that your conscience feels strongly about, whether it is people, animals, or the environment. You could offer to be a mentor to children or a tutor to students, or simply donate food and clothing to people in need.
If you can’t volunteer in the community, you can find many opportunities as a virtual volunteer., Each time you do it will increase your belief and confidence that you are a person who can be relied on to do the right thing.


Trust your own beliefs and decisions of what it right. Do not let yourself be swayed by what others think, say or do.
Speak up when you see an injustice being done. Many people have a strong conscience but are afraid to act. Make sure you are a person who not only knows the right thing but does the right thing.

Focus on right now.,
Increase your awareness.,
Observe your thoughts.,
Engage in mindfulness exercises.",How to Find Inner Peace2," Mindfulness can help increase inner peace.Mindfulness is being aware of the current moment, the here and now, instead of thinking about the future or the past. Thinking of the past may lead to depressed mood or regrets, and thinking about the future can increase anxiety and worry. Being completely present in the current moment can increase your feelings of contentment.Attempt to appreciate the current moment. Find positives about what is going on around you. For example, if you are at home – look out the window at the blue sky. What do you appreciate about the sky? What does it look like? Are there clouds, birds, or planes in the sky?

, Mindfulness is about increasing your awareness of yourself and the world around you. You can become more aware by focusing and taking control of your attention.


Take a moment to look around you and notice the objects and people that are near. Focus on one particular object and become aware of what it looks like – it’s shape, color, texture, and purpose. Then touch that object; Is it soft, hard, or bumpy? Close your eyes and move your hands over the object. What does it feel like? It is cold or warm? What are the new and different things you notice about the object that you didn’t before?

, Notice what thoughts come into your mind, like clouds passing through the sky, without judging, rejecting, or clinging to them. Simply let them pass through your mind.


When you have a thought, notice it, and then let it go.
One way to let go of thoughts is through visualization. Close your eyes and visualize a stream with leaves flowing down it. As you think a thought that is negative, place that thought on a leaf and watch it run down the stream until you cannot see it anymore.

, Mindfulness techniques are a great way to practice mindfulness.


One mindfulness technique is where you eat a piece of food (fruit, chocolate, etc.). Instead of just popping it into your mouth and chewing, start by observing the color and texture of the food, and then biting off a small piece. Eat that piece very slowly and notice how it tastes and feels in your mouth.
Go on a mindfulness walk. This means you go for a walk, and while you are walking you notice everything that is going on in your mind, as well as around you. You can observe your own physical body in action and what is feels like to move (in your muscles, arms, legs).
You can find many more mindfulness exercises online by conducting a google search, or locating videos on YouTube."

Limit distractions and get comfortable.,
Close your eyes and begin the meditation.,
Try imagining or visualizing.,
Meditate on art.,
Explore alternative forms of meditation.",How to Find Inner Peace3," Meditation is associated with quiet reflection. First, find a good environment for meditation; this could be a quiet room, a peaceful meadow or sitting near a stream in the woods. Remove yourself from the rest of the world if you can.


You may find this useful to do before you go to sleep.

, Close doors and windows, and dim harsh lights. Limit clutter, traffic and noise levels. Light an aromatic candle if you wish.


Ask others for this time alone. Place a ""do not disturb"" sign on the door to your room.
If you choose, you can listen to slow, calming music.Songs with harps, guitars or piano are particularly calming. If possible, avoid music with lyrics, as this may cause distraction and make it more difficult to focus.Rest on your bed, in a chair, on the grass or a blanket. You can also choose to sit with your legs crossed., Meditation can be done with eyes open or closed, but for beginners it can be easier with closed eyes in order to limit outside distractions.


When you begin to meditate try not to think of anything else but inner peace (whatever that may mean to you). If images or thoughts stray, use encouraging words to concentrate or simply bring your attention back to the meditation.
It's natural for your mind to wander - do not over-discipline. Brilliant ideas may arise from a wandering mind.
After meditating, record any thoughts or feelings that may be helpful or of interest. Write the date and time to review progress.

, There are other types of meditation such as visualization and imagery that prove useful for some individuals.Try to control what you imagine or think of in your mind. This outcome may help you with everyday life and achievement of goals.


Close your eyes and imagine yourself in a safe place where you can relax and be calm. This might be a beach, your bedroom, or in the middle of a garden. Notice how it feels in your safe place. Is it warm, soft, comforting? What do you hear? What do you see? Think about how it smells in your safe space. You can choose to stay there a while and when you are ready, open your eyes.Reflect on how it felt to go to your safe place. Use this visualization any time you feel like you are not a peace.
Imagine that you woke up in the morning and a miracle occurred - every problem you have was solved overnight. Visualize what you and your surroundings would look like. Where are you? What does it feel like? Who is around you? What do you hear? What are you doing?This visualization helps with goal setting and achievement., Art education promotes inner peace and helps individuals feel relaxed and satisfied. Focusing art while you meditate can help inspire you, and give you a sense of freedom and wonderment.Pick a piece of art (painting, sculpture, etc.) and focus on it for 5 minutes. What do you observe about the art? What emotions come up? Does a story play out in your mind? What thoughts come up for you?
Appreciate the art and what it means to you. Enjoy it.

, There are so many different types of meditation available to you. The more forms you explore, the more of an expert you will become at meditation and finding inner peace.Try mantra or transcendental meditation where you repeat a word or phrase over and over again during your meditation.
Do Yoga. Yoga involves doing poses that require concentration; this increases a sense of calm and presence in the current moment.
Qi gong is a type of traditional Chinese medicine which focuses on creating balance through the combination of deep breathing, meditation, and physical movement.Tai Chi is a Chinese marital art, which combines deep breathing with traditional Chinese poses in order to promote relaxation and wellness."

Speak with a therapist.,

Change your thinking.,
Set healthy boundaries.",How to Find Inner Peace4," If you have have experienced past traumas or abuse, it can be difficult to move past these experiences to attain inner peace. It can also be difficult to work on processing these experiences without help. If you are experiencing any of the following, especially if these feelings interfere with your ability to function in daily life, consider seeing a mental health professional:Anxiety
Insomnia or changes in your sleep habits
Irritability or mood swings
Flashbacks or memories that come upon you unwanted
Feeling disconnected or isolated
Feeling “shut down” or emotionless
Depression
Fears or phobias
Difficulty concentrating or making decisions
Feeling threatened or unsafe
Thoughts or feelings of wanting to hurt yourself

, In many cases, resolving the past can be helped along by sharing your feelings and experiences with others, especially if they’ve had similar experiences. Talking to others about your past and how it has affected you allows you to explore the influence of these experiences. This can help you resolve and move through them to attain inner peace.Support groups may be particularly helpful for victims of domestic violence and those who are struggling with an addiction.
Try to share positive feelings and experiences with your support group as well as the pain.
You may also find that joining a spiritual group is helpful to you., Writing about your feelings and past experiences can help you process them. A journal gives you a safe space to record and explore your feelings without fearing anyone’s judgment.You can also use your journal to reflect on possible solutions and things you can do in the future.


Just make sure that you do not end up judging yourself. Show yourself the compassion you would a beloved friend. For example, if you write about a painful experience that made you feel unloved, refrain from making judgments such as “I’m just unlovable.” Instead, show yourself kindness; “That experience really hurt, and that reaction is natural. I may need to look for love and support from others if this person continues to treat me this way.”

, Many times, we learn negative habits of thinking from those in our lives, even when nobody realizes it. For example, if your father took things very personally, you may have learned to do so too. Try to note when you have a “gut reaction” or negative thought. Take a moment to examine the evidence for your reaction.Watch for personalization. It’s hard to have inner peace when you’re convinced everything is about you.For example, if your child’s teacher says that he needs more help with his homework, you might interpret this as a personal attack instead of what it really is: a statement of fact that your child needs help, and his teacher thinks you can offer it. Remind yourself that most things are not directed as personal attacks, and that you aren’t entirely responsible for everything.
When you notice thoughts like this, or other thoughts that feel negative or disruptive, try looking for the evidence for your thought or feeling. Try to consider other ways to look at the situation. Remind yourself that a single negative experience does not characterize you, nor does it determine the future., Sometimes, our relationships can keep us from attaining inner peace, especially if they’re unhealthy or insecure. It can be hard to set boundaries with people you’ve had in your life for a long time. Strengthen yourself and find your inner peace by setting healthy boundaries for yourself. Determine what your needs and values are and set guidelines according to those.For example, perhaps your mother calls you five times a day, even though you’re done with college and have moved out on your own and are not under her charge anymore. This may cause you a lot of stress. It’s okay to talk with her and say, “Mom, I appreciate that you want to stay in touch with me. I’ve got a lot of other things going on now that I’m out on my own, and I need to make enough time for them. Right now all these calls are making it hard for me. Let’s make a date to talk on Saturdays, okay? That way we can stay in touch and I can still get my other things done.”

There are many kinds of enjoyment. You may find that you enjoy passive pleasures, but that you also enjoy challenging yourself. Look for the most fulfilling ways that you can challenge yourself.
Happiness is a solid foundation for success. If you spend your time on things that you do not love, then you may not put as much of yourself into your work. Ask yourself whether it is enough to be merely content.;
, Purpose comes from people. Find your Don't expect your direction to well up unprompted from within. To find your direction, you will need to be inspired – and inspiration is often sparked by a catalyst in the world around you., ""Success"" means something slightly different to everyone, and it is ultimately up to you to decide what makes a meaningful life. Make a list of things that you value: e.g. love, adventure, justice, fame. What do you need to feel happy and fulfilled? What is ""enough?""Think about how these values might spur you in a certain direction. If you feel deeply called to help people, then you should look into careers focused on helping people. If you feel that it is most important for you to exercise your creativity, then you should do that.
It's okay to seek advice from friends, parents, and teachers whom you admire. Speak to successful people in your community and find out how they got to where they are today.

You can always adjust your course as you go: but you cannot know which adjustments you'll need to make until you get started.The important thing is that you are engaging with your life. Don't just sit back and watch time go by. Live passionately, even if you are never absolutely certain.

, There is no telling whether anything will ""work out,"" and you cannot predict exactly where any given choice will take you. You may fail, and you may succeed. You may find that you completely redefine what it means to fail and to succeed. Take a chance on yourself and follow a spark of passion. This is the only life you've got., You don't need to quit your job, drop out of school, or book a one-way plane ticket to a faraway place in order to find your direction. Granted: these grand leaps can be wonderful, catalyzing forces that lead to understanding yourself and discovering your deepest passions. First, however, look for ways to test out your ideas in the margins of your everyday life.


Volunteer. If you think you might be interested in working within a particular field, consider taking volunteer opportunities that allow you to get a better sense of what it's like to work in that field. Volunteer at an animal shelter, or at a nonprofit, or as a research assistant, or at a museum.
Look for internships. An internship can be a great way to explore a given company or field without fully committing to that direction. Internships may be paid or unpaid.
Learn something new. Make productive use of your free time by learning a skill that strikes your interest. Perhaps your direction in life lies in music, or dance, or programming, or painting. Don't worry too much about why you're learning something – just follow the spark of passion.

, Challenge yourself to try something new each week: something that scares you and takes you out of your comfort zone. Make learning a conscious practice. Do not wait for life to come to you!

Commit to a direction.,
Work hard and be present.,
Believe in yourself.,
Check in with yourself.",How to Find Direction in Life3," You don't have to be absolutely certain that this is the ""right"" path. Trust yourself, and trust that you will be able to escape any given set of circumstances if you no longer feel that you are moving forward. Make your choice and see where it goes. Throw yourself into a job, a journey, a practice, or a community that inspires a flare of passion within you.


Do not be afraid to make sacrifices. Do not be afraid to commit. Remember that no commitment is permanent. You can always drop out and change direction.

, If you're always halfway in and halfway out of a commitment, then you won't be able to say that you have given a direction a fair chance. Suspend your doubts for a time, and focus on the joys of doing exactly what you are doing.

, Follow your dreams despite the ups and downs of life. Let your passion and your intention guide you as you build momentum in the right direction. Direction is knowing where you're going. Trust yourself.Persevere even if nobody else believes in you. This not to say, however, that you should ignore good advice.
Have confidence in your abilities. Follow through on your decisions.

, Accept that you will change, that your needs will change, and that your purpose will change.Pursue your choices wholeheartedly, but do not let yourself become trapped in a situation that doesn't fulfill you. Every so often, ask yourself whether you are still engaged and invested in what you're doing. Perhaps you need to change direction, and perhaps you merely need to adjust your sails.Ask yourself:

""Am I growing in the ways that I want to be growing?""
""Am I happy? Am I satisfied?""
""Does this direction feel worthwhile?""
""What can I do to make things better?""

Think about the moments you are most proud of in your life.,
Identify your values.,
Determine the things you want in life.,
Think about how you'd spend your time if you had total freedom.,
Reconsider the facts, ideas, and outlooks you grew up with or take for granted.,
Dig beyond the simplistic labels given to you by others.,
Consider taking an in-depth personality test as a jumping off point.,
Meditate or spend 10 minutes each day in quiet reflection.,
Remember that this is a life-long process, not an quickly accomplished goal.",How to Find Your Inner Self1," Finding meaning in your life is not easy, nor should it be, but you can get wonderful clues from your own past. Think about the things that brought your great pride in yourself, as these are often the moments where you found the most meaning and purpose while working, traveling, or learning.


What makes these moments so special?
What challenged or excited you about the work? What motivated you to succeed?;
, Identifying your values is an important part of finding your inner self. As you reflect on things that made you proud, think about what these experiences reveal about your values. Try asking yourself, what values are connected with the things that make me feel proud?For example, if you felt proud at your high school graduation, then you might value education. If you felt proud when you received a promotion at work, then you might value professional achievement. If you felt proud when you planned a surprise party for your mother, then you might value family and doing nice things for other people.
Start creating a list of all of your values. You might even rank them in order of their importance to you.

, Finding your inner self is as much about looking forward as looking back. Whether it is a job, a house in your favorite town, a loving partner, or lazy Sundays with a book, your desires reveal a lot about you. Simply jot down the things you want in life. Don't be shy, and don't filter this list of things in any way. Which ones are you pursuing? Which ones have your forgotten about? Which ones matter most?


What kind of person do you imagine when looking at your own list of wants and priorities?

, Would you write the novel you always talk about, or would you get to work constructing a patio? Would you travel the world or sit inside with a good movie? If money wasn't an option, would you grab the non-profit job you've always eyed or pursue an old hobby? These ideas are not just fantasies, they are a version of you unburdened by stress and logistics. Finding that version of yourself is the first step in making it a reality.


Be specific in your thoughts, imagining a full day in the life of your dreams.
These dreams aren't always easy to attain, but that is okay. The point is to become conscious of your hopes and goals, as they reveal a lot about your priorities., A simple example is with food: you may have detested pickles growing up, only to find years later that they aren't so bad. You often convince yourself things like, ""I hate pickles,"" ""I am a morning person,"" ""I am good at math but bad at English,"" when it is the thought alone, not any real fact, that makes this true. Whenever you're absolutely sure about some part of yourself, flip the thought on its head before believing it. Do you believe it out of habit, or because it is true?


People change, and by firmly saying ""I am _______,"" you risk missing those changes within yourself.
More often than not, these ideas are self-fulfilling. If you always tell yourself you are awkward on dates, then any date you go on makes you nervous and self-conscience. This of course, makes you more awkward., At any one time, you may be considered a daughter, a girlfriend, an employee, and a tennis player. These labels are important to help define your roles and responsibilities in the world, but they are not you. They are just labels, and you are far more complex and nuanced than a few words. Instead, look beyond these labels at the concepts behind them.


If you see yourself as a daughter, ask why that role is important to you. Is family an essential anchor in your life? When stressed, do you turn often to parents and relatives?
If you see yourself as a girlfriend, ask yourself what your partner highlights or brings out in you. Remember that are not defined by romance, but you can learn about yourself by growing intimate with someone.
If you see yourself as an employee, ask where your personal goals or ideas meet with your company's. They won't perfectly align, and that's okay -- you are not just an employee.
If you see yourself as a tennis player, ask yourself what goals or aspirations you have on the court. What draws you to the sport?, Personality tests, like the psychologically-based Meyers-Briggs test, are great places to ask good, insightful questions about yourself. They also provide broad but generally useful thoughts on how you handle stress, relationships, creativity, and emotions. They are not, however, perfect representations of your personality. The important thing to remember is that they are jumping off points to understanding, not the end of the road.When you get test results, ask yourself which parts ring true to you? What parts surprise you? Most importantly, what parts feel false or untrue, and why?
You can find many of these tests online for free. If you do, prioritize tests that ask lots of questions, at least thirty or more, and compare the results of 2-3 tests to minimize mistakes.

, You're not going to find your inner self if you don't go looking for it. Meditation is not as difficult or complex as people claim, as even sitting for a few minutes in a quiet room is a great way to tune into yourself. Remember that mediation is not an end but a mean, meant to help you think about the difficult questions that you otherwise don't make time for.


If you're struggling to relax, concentrate on your breathing. Where is it coming from? How does your body react to inhalations and exhalations? What is your natural rhythm?
If your thoughts are racing or you feel bored, that's okay! Instead of feeling like you somehow failed, ask yourself why you're feeling these things. What in your life is taking up so much headspace?, Understanding your inner self is a never-ending process because you are always changing. Instead of viewing your inner self as something you find once and know forever, you should always be looking inward to learn more about yourself. As you life and surroundings change, you do too. Don't close yourself off to these new realizations because you believe you know everything there is to know about yourself.


Looking back on your life, note how often you were wrong about yourself. How often did your likes, desires, goals, etc. change as you grew older? Even if you're sure about yourself now, this change will always happen as you move through life."
"
Check in with yourself regularly.,
Note goal progress and re-evaluate your goals regularly.,
Stop trusting your internal critic so much.,
Surround yourself with other self-aware people.,
Learn to say no.,
Accept and embrace occasional contradictions.,
Challenge yourself daily.,
Do your research, but trust your gut.,
Expose yourself to new ideas, people, and activities regularly.,
Ask for guidance and advice from trusted mentors or role models.",How to Find Your Inner Self2," Checking in with yourself to see how you are feeling is a great way to stay tuned in to your thoughts and feelings. Try to check in with yourself once per day. You can do this by following a simple pattern of questioning yourself and answering your questions.What’s wrong? To this, you might answer something like, “I am worried about my finances for this month because I had an expensive car repair to make.”
What can I do to feel better about the situation? To this you might respond, “I can use the emergency credit card if necessary. However, I will probably be able to get by without it if I can reduce sending in a few other areas. This was a necessary repair, so it is okay that I spent money on it.”
What is going well in my life? You might respond to this question by saying something like, “I have a nice home, good friends, and a fun job.”

, Successful and happy people do not just set out a path and blindly follow it. Just like your inner self matures and evolves, your goals need care and attention as you grow, too. Once a month or so, ask yourself the following questions.


Are my goals and priorities still the same? Are there any new ones?
What have I done to get closer to my goals? How can I repeat that success?
What can I do in the next two weeks to actively pursue my goals?

, Many people are plagued daily by self-doubts, criticisms, and worries. This is natural, but that doesn't mean you always need to listen to them. When your brain tells you something is too hard, that you might fail, that you're unpopular-- whatever your stress is -- remember that this is not who you are. Your inner self is not a critic, these are just anxieties and worries that you need to address.


Ask yourself what emotion, usually anger or fear, is at the center of your unpleasant thoughts. You can then confront these emotions instead of letting the thoughts circle your brain.
If you're struggling to get past this voice, set a timer and indulge it for 5 minutes. Let yourself be worried, scared, or confused and, when the timer is up, move on., Good friends make everything easier, and finding people who are equally interested in being their best self will help you be yours. Try to avoid constantly negative people, or those that refuse to think critically about themselves. Instead, look for people who:


Are pursuing personal goals.
Talk honestly about themselves and their feelings.
Look for the best in situations, finding solutions instead of excuses., Saying no, especially to friends, family, and coworkers, is difficult but necessary if you want to find your inner self. This doesn't mean you should be selfish, it just means to be confident in your ideas and decisions. If something doesn't mesh with your idea of yourself, trust yourself and turn the offer down.


Pursuing a goal, whether it is personal or professional, requires some sacrifice. But you can only choose what is important and what is less crucial once you start to find your inner self.
Peer pressure isn't always obvious or cruel. It might be fun, for example, to go out with your roommates instead of finishing work or relaxing. But if you want or need to stay in it's okay to temporarily disappoint them -- they'll understand.

, Ralph Waldo Emerson famously said that ""a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."" What he means is that truly self-aware people accept that their opinions and ideas can change, and that is okay. Don't worry about appearing hypocritical -- the goal is to be honest and truthful to yourself in the present moment, not to who you were yesterday or last year., Staying true to your inner self is not supposed to be easy. Through challenging yourself to reach difficult goals, complete projects, or just try something new, you can break the rut you're in and further develop your skills. Even better, the moments when you challenge yourself are often the most rewarding because they require you to learn or expose new parts of yourself.


This doesn't mean you must live a difficult life to know yourself. It simply means you don't shy away from things you love or want because they are challenging.

, Some people love to think about every possible outcome before they do something. Others will take a risk at the drop of a hat without any prior knowledge. Somewhere in the middle of these two extremes, however, is a healthy and productive philosophy. Once you've reached a point where further research is just delaying a decision, it's time to look inward and make a choice.

, When you're placed in unfamiliar circumstances, whether it is a new country or a party full of strangers, you remove the context and labels that once defined you. You're free to be yourself, and these new experiences will expose parts of yourself that never needed to come out in the past.Learn something every day, even if it is small. By broadening your understanding of the world around you, you gain a greater context to examine yourself.

, Finding your inner self is, paradoxically, not a solitary effort. Other people can illuminate parts of yourself that are difficult to see yourself, helping shape your self-understanding. A good mentor will not tell you what to do or who to be, but will instead help you find the answers yourself.


A mentor or role model is just someone whose opinion you trust, and who you can talk openly and honestly to.
A mentor isn't someone who is right every time. When asking advice, remember that it is ultimately up to you whether or not to follow it.

Think about the reasons that you are feeling this way.,
Begin by learning to cope.,
Take care of your family.,
Help others out.,
Spend time with friends.,
Change your job or career.,
Stay positive.,
Remember that life has a different meaning for different people.,
Savor the good things in life.","How to Exude, Escape, or Enact an Existential Crisis"," Trace the origin of your thoughts - What made you start to question the meaning in your life? Are you depressed or just going through a little slump?;
, Reach out to friends and family members for help, even if you feel like there is nothing they could possibly do.

, Focusing on the things you love will help you remember that there is indeed a point to existence. Play with your kids in the park, grab some ice cream, or read a story with them. Go out to dinner with your parents and/or siblings. Take the dog for a long walk or a run at least once a day.

, Start volunteering at a local charity, offer to babysit for struggling parents, or cook a meal for someone else who is depressed or going through a rough patch.

, It can be hard for people to watch their friends struggle through something as big as an existential crisis. Be receptive to their aid; while you may feel annoyed you should understand that they really are trying to help you. Unfortunately, it’s not uncommon for one to drift from one’s friends during an existentialist crisis if he or she is not receptive to the aid offered. If this has happened to you and you do not feel comfortable reaching out to your old friends, make an effort to meet new ones. Strike up conversations at a coffee shop, talk more to colleagues, or spend time with your neighbors.

, If you are beginning to think that you don’t have an impact on the world, you may be in a career slump. Find something you love to do and work to get there. Make sure that when you wake up in the morning, you feel like the work that you will do that day will make a positive difference in the world, no matter how small.

, Try to contradict the part of you that says that life has no point by letting yourself have fun. Remember that it’s okay to let go and allow yourself to be happy—even if that happiness is ultimately, in your mind, useless.


Keep in mind that your attitude and outlook on life affects those around you. Having a negative outlook on life can sour the mood around you, bringing down the emotions of your family, co-workers, and neighbors. Try to stay positive to allow others to feel happy around you.

, There is no right or wrong answer. Even if the meaning you thought to have existed before is gone, you can still find meaning in other things, even if they seem small to the rest of the world.

, Learn to cook better or go on a quest to find the best restaurant in town. Go wine tasting, or sample olive oil at a local manufacturer. Go on a hike in a state park, or take a picnic to a nearby lake.

Keep your theme and chosen audience in mind as you research and collect materials for your devotional.


For instance, you may choose to write a devotional for new mothers. “New mothers” are your audience and “motherhood” is the general theme. While you do not need to limit each individual entry to a topic that relates directly to motherhood, the overall tone of your book should address that theme.





;
, More specifically, start from a place deeply rooted in your personal relationship with God. Doing so will make it easier to be passionate and write spiritually sincere words.


Ask yourself what topics have been spiritually significant in your own life or which target audiences you feel called to work with.






As you prepare to write, consider writing devotionals based on your personal Bible study, life experiences, or everyday circumstances., Each individual devotional entry has four main components: a scriptural passage, a meditation, a prayer, and a key thought.The Scripture portion can be a few short verses or a long passage. For longer passages, consider writing out a short portion of that passage and providing the citation for the full passage below or above the quotation. Including a long passage on a page can make that entry seem cluttered.






The meditation or reflection should connect directly to the verses you quoted before it. Seek to explain those verses with fresh insight.






The prayer should be short and simple. Construct a few sentences that are related to the lesson you reviewed in your meditation.






The key thought is usually a simple, one-sentence summary of the lesson learned. It can also be a call to action.







, Meditations can be personal or objective, but they need to address the topic at hand in a meaningful way. There are four main types of meditation you can expect to use: commentaries on scriptures, anecdotes, facts, and compilations.


Commentaries are usually used when your scripture passages are notably long. Break down the story or idea presented in that passage into further detail.






Stories are fairly common, as well. When you use a short verse, you might retell a longer Biblical story connected to that verse. Alternatively, you might tell a more personal story connected to your life or the life of someone you know.






Factual meditations use scientific or historical facts to explain the significance of the verses presented before the meditation.






Compilations are a combination of multiple meditation types.







, When putting together a collection of devotions, consider how many devotions to include and how long the overall work should be. The right answer will vary depending on the market and purpose of your devotional.


Many devotional books are monthly and include 30 to 31 individual devotions. If you are publishing a booklet, a week's worth of devotionals might be all you need, though. Conversely, if you have enough to say on the theme of your devotional, you can write several months' worth, instead.






Some devotional books are also written by liturgical seasons. For instance, a Lenten devotional will usually cover the 40 days of Lent, the rest of Holy Week, and Easter.







, You should be prayerful throughout the entire process, but it is especially important to pray for guidance when developing individual devotional entries. Good devotionals will help the reader draw closer to God, so God needs to be at the center of your writing. Pray for the ability to convey the truth in clarity, humility, and courage.


Ask God what He would have you write about. You may already have an idea in your head, but be open to other ideas and thoughts that come to mind as you pray.






On the other hand, if you don't ""hear"" anything specific as you pray for guidance, don't let that stop you from pressing forward. Writer's block can happen even when you're working on a project like this. You need to write your way through it if you want the ideas to start flowing again.







, A standard entry in a devotional book is no longer than 500 words. Keeping the entry short will keep your writing concise and poignant. Short writings are also easier for readers to pay attention to.


If you tend to get carried away as you write, aim for writing something between 250 and 350 words. That way, if you end up writing too much by accident, you'll probably still be under 500 words.The other option is simply to cut out and revise a lengthy entry until you can trim it down to 500 words.







, If you're writing a collection of devotionals, your overall work will have a somewhat broad theme. Each individual entry will need to be even more focused, but the subtopic you choose for the entry must still fit in with the overall theme of the collection as a whole.


Try to connect the idea presented to at least one of your readers' physical senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, or smell). For instance, you could describe the sound of a church bell or the smell of incense.







, This might seem like an obvious statement, but any narrative meditation you include must have some form of exposition/rising action, climax, and falling action. Build up to your main point, declare your main point, and explain that point in further detail as needed.


When describing your own experience, for example, provide context for the experience, describe the experience itself, and share with readers the lesson you learned from your experience.







, Sometimes, you will need to build a reflection around a chosen verse. Other times, you will write a meditation first and find the verse you need afterward. Make sure that the verse connects directly to the idea behind your meditation.


When quoting scripture, always cite the version of the Bible you are quoting from since translations often vary.






Never take a verse out of context or try to bend it into a shape that matches your meditation. If necessary, revise your meditation rather than revising the verse.







, Check and recheck everything you write. This applies to scriptural passages you include as well as any external facts you mentioned.


When verifying the verses you used, make sure that you have the correct wording for the translation version you cited.







, Each individual entry needs to prompt the reader to take action in his or her own relationship with God. The action can be major or minor, as well as internal or external. Regardless of the action itself, you need to encourage the reader to be an active part of the experience.


The action should relate directly to the message of that devotional entry. For example, if the entry was about forgiveness, ask the reader to consider whether he or she has been holding a grudge against someone and, if so, what the reader needs to do to let go of that anger and forgive the offender in question.







, You don't need to have all the answers. Your primary task is to prod the reader forward on his or her faith journey. There are times when a deep, reflective question may accomplish that goal better than a halfhearted answer could.


Good devotional writing has an exploratory nature to it. Sometimes you will arrive at a conclusion, and sometimes you won't. This is a natural part of spiritual growth, so you needn't force an answer when a question is all that remains at the end of your exploration.On a similar note, don't be afraid to present yourself in a somewhat unfavorable way in a particular meditation. Readers can learn from your struggles and mistakes in the same way they learn from your questions.







, Most devotionals are written in a conversational and fairly casual tone of voice. You still need to use good grammar and proper spelling, but keep the tone as natural and comfortable as you can.

, Writers who try their hand at a devotional often make similar mistakes in regards to content and language. Make yourself aware of these potential pitfalls beforehand so that you can avoid them as much as possible.


Use the first person point of view as little as possible. You can use ""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc., when sharing a personal experience. At all other points, however, the first person should be avoided. Stick with the third person (""he,"" ""she,"" ""they"") or second person (""you"") as much as possible.






Watch your wording, as well. Avoid preaching, pouting, or pointing fingers.






Meditations can take a lot of different forms, but they are not testimonies, tributes to specific people, sermons, formal Bible teachings, journal entries, fine literature, or biographical/autobiographical sketches.






Avoid common or trivial symbols. A flower struggling to grow in a cement parking lot conveys the beauty of struggle, but it's overused and should be avoided unless you have a unique spin to present.






Show, don't tell. Resist the temptation to spell everything out to your readers.







, Your devotional might be honest, fresh, and from the heart, but if there are structural problems with your writing, no one will be able to see the value of your work underneath all the muck. Revise your work until it is as clean, cohesive, and coherent as possible.


Aim to sell with each work you complete. Be confident in your writing, but make sure that your writing is up to par with other words you would expect to find on the shelf of your nearest Christian bookstore. If you wouldn't buy a book of its quality from someone else, don't expect someone else to buy it from you.







, Some criticism is constructive and should be taken to heart. Other criticism is destructive and should be ignored. Learn to tell the two types apart from each other. Use constructive criticism to improve your writing, and try not to let yourself get discouraged when you hear destructive criticism.


You might also receive criticism from those outside of the publishing industry for wanting to make money on the devotionals you write. You can give you work away for free if that's what you feel God has called you to do; however, there is no shame in using your God-given talents to support yourself financially., Send your devotional to the market that is most likely to publish it. No matter how great your writing is, a publisher that doesn't publish devotionals (or one that doesn't publish your type of devotional) will not accept it.


Pay attention to things like target audience, length, and theme. Don't send a year-long devotional to a publisher that only publishes month-long devotionals. If your devotional is geared toward teenagers dealing with illness, don't send it to a publisher that deals exclusively with devotionals for adults.






Every publisher has writer's guidelines. Publishers with websites usually post these guidelines online. If you can't find those guidelines posted anywhere, though, write to that publisher and ask for their writer's guidelines before you submit your work.







, The vast majority of writers will receive plenty of rejection letters, and devotional writers are no exception. If your submission is rejected, don't get discouraged. Instead, take the opportunity to revise it one more time before sending it out to another publisher for consideration.

Refusing to accept your current life, though, can have major consequences on your mental and physical health, leading to anxiety, chronic physical pain, or bodily harm caused by escapist behaviors like eating unhealthy foods or drinking too much alcohol. If you are in a situation that affects your well-being, then you might be using denial to cope with your feelings.You may need to seek professional help for certain types of denial, such as if you are in an abusive relationship or if you are addicted to drugs or alcohol. Try talking to a trustworthy friend to start moving towards acceptance and then find some tailored help for your situation.
For example, if you have been denying that you have a problem controlling your drinking, but you drink on a daily basis and can’t stop once you start, then you may need to admit you have a problem and enter a treatment program. If you have been denying that there is anything wrong with your relationship even though you have a verbally abusive partner, then you might need to ask your partner to visit a couples’ counselor with you.;
, Denying a situation will not make it cease to exist. Denying can also have negative consequences, such as leading you to feel depressed or anxious. Some people also turn to substances to escape the pain caused by denying a situation. That is why the best way to move towards healing is to practice radical acceptance of a situation.Try creating an acceptance mantra for yourself and repeat it several times daily or whenever you have thoughts of denial. For example, you can say something like, “This the situation. I may not like it, but I can’t change it.”

, To fully accept some situations, it is important to acknowledge the role that you played in causing the problem. Ask yourself questions related to your particular situation to help you work towards solutions.If you are overweight and wish you weighed less, think about the reasons you are overweight. Do you eat a healthy diet with lots of produce? Do you exercise regularly? If not, is there a valid medical reason why you cannot exercise in certain ways, and are there other types you could do instead?
If you are unhappy with a relationship, consider why you continue to stay with this person. Are you afraid that you might end up alone? Do you worry that separating or divorcing will lead to financial problems?
If you hate your job, ask yourself why you continue to work there. Do you need more education or training to do what you really want to do? And if so, why haven’t you gotten it yet? Are there other jobs you could be applying for? Are you staying because it is convenient, even if unhealthy for your well-being?

, Planning for a more positive future may help you to accept the situation you are in now and it can also give you something to look forward to.Consider what your ideal situation would be and write down some notes about what this ideal future might look like.


For example, if you are in an abusive relationship, then you might imagine a future with a partner who is kind, caring, and loving towards you. If you are consumed by grief over the death of a loved one, then you might imagine feeling peace over your loss and celebrating your loved one’s memory in a positive way.

, Journaling can help you to get through difficult situations and process your emotions. Journaling can also benefit your physical health and reduce stress.Especially with emotional situations, like losing someone you love or realizing you don’t want to be a doctor after three years of medical school, facing the reality of your present situation changing so drastically is hard and takes time. Writing it down helps you acknowledge that the situation is real.


If you already keep a journal, continue writing daily and add a new component such as a list of things you are grateful for every day.
Or, write about your day as usual and then add a reflection of what you did that day to change your situation.

, Mindfulness can help to reduce the amount of time that you spend ruminating. That means that is can prevent you from dwelling so much on the negative aspects of your situation. Among other benefits, practicing mindfulness is also a powerful way to relieve stress and it can improve your ability to focus.You can practice mindfulness as you do daily activities, such as brushing your teeth or washing the dishes. For example, as you brush your teeth, focus on the sound of the toothbrush, the feeling of the bristles, and the taste of the peppermint toothpaste.
When you are doing dishes, think about the temperature of the water, the sounds you hear, the smell of the dish soap, and how you move your hands as you wash. Be present in the experience of doing the dishes instead of thinking about all the other things you need to do.

, Whether you start a gratitude journal, or just write three to five things you are grateful for on a dry-erase board every morning, start making it a daily practice to reflect on what you have instead of what you think you are missing. Gratitude can help you to let go of emotions such as regret, resentment, and frustration.Start out by jotting down basic things that make you feel grateful, such as having a place to live, clothes on your back, a good friend, or nice meal. As your list builds, look for smaller things that make you feel grateful, such as a beautiful sunset, a good cup of coffee, or sharing a laugh with a friend.

, Replacing negative thoughts with positive ones is a good way to help yourself feel better. Whenever you have a negative thought, try to replace it with a positive version of that thought.If someone you love passes away, and you constantly think that your life will never be happy again, then this can affect your outlook on life. To counteract these thoughts, you might tell yourself something like, “I will experience love and happiness again.”
Or, if you have lost your job and money is tight, then you might focus on something positive that you are doing to improve your situation, such as, “I am learning effective ways to manage the money that I have.”

, Self-soothing is an important part of managing your emotions on a day-to-day basis. You might be feeling anxious, overwhelmed, angry, or just frustrated in general. To cope with the emotions you are feeling, you can use self-soothing strategies.Identify self-soothing activities that work for you and use them as needed.


Try taking a bubble bath, watching a funny movie, or sipping a cup of tea when you are feeling sad or lonely.
If you are feeling angry or anxious, then taking a long walk or going for a bike ride might be a good way to self-soothe.

, You can plan out your whole day ahead of time to go as smoothly and successfully as possible, but get a flat tire on the way to work that throws off your whole schedule. Adapting to changes like this and keeping your focus on how to alter your schedule can help you remain positive and mindful the rest of your day instead of feeling resentful or helpless.Learn how to tell the difference between what you can and cannot control to help you move forward with your life.


Remember that you cannot control what other people do, but you have complete control over how you react to everything around you. Your emotions are solely your responsibility.
Reflect on things that contributed to your current position. What could you have done differently then? Can you use this experience to apply such lessons to your future behaviors and actions to make sure you don’t repeat yourself?

, Since you have been able to fully assess and accept your current situation and what you don’t like about it, as well as how your actions contributed to creating it, you can now decide how you want your life to be different in the future. Think of a general goal and then come up with a definite smaller goal that will help you get there.


Do you want to find a new job, lose a healthy amount of weight, learn to better handle your finances, or develop stronger and healthier relationship skills?
If you want a new job, do you need more training or education? Do you need to start practicing for interviews and hiring a resume consultant? Will you start spending an hour every morning looking through want-ads?
If your goal is to lose weight, start with a specific goal, like fitting into those pants you love and haven’t been able to wear in two years. How much lost weight will it take to get into those pants again?
Avoid non-specific goals like, “I want to be thin” or long-term ones like “I need to lose 100 lbs.” Focus on specific goals you can obtain in the near future, such as “I will walk for 30 minutes every day this week.”, Include steps you will take to get there, how you plan to recognize and change negative thought patterns as they come up, and what you will do if you hit a stumbling block. Break your goal into small steps that you can accomplish one at a time to build your confidence and self-worth as you go.


For example, if your goal is to stick to your budget for the next 30 days, then identify ways that you can do that. You might plan to make a grocery list and stick to it. Or, to cut out spending on extras such as entertainment.
You might also plan for potential obstacles, such as an unexpected bill. Perhaps there is a way you can make $50 quickly if an emergency arises. Do you have anything valuable to sell on eBay? Can you work a few extra hours at your job or pick up a shift from someone? Can you set aside an emergency fund for unexpected expenses?

Try a change of scenery.,
Take more breaks.,
Exercise more.,
Change your appearance.,
Cancel your social networking accounts for a while.,
Sleep it off.,
Consider more drastic changes.,
Try to be realistic about your situation.",How to Start Fresh1," After a while, seeing the same old sights and same old faces can start to drag you down. Sometimes, we need a little bit more stimulation, and making a move, long or short, can fit the bill. Psychologist Susan Clayton says that where you live, and how you define your home, is part of your self-definition.Meaning that, if you're tired of where you are, you're tired of how you're living.


It can be financially difficult or impractical to uproot yourself and move to a different state, or a different country, but you an try making a jump to a new neighborhood, to get a different angle on your city. Switch roommates.
Alternatively, try doing a thorough re-arrangement or cleaning job in your house as it is. If it looks new, it'll feel new.;
, Learning to unpack the psychological burden you carry throughout the day is absolutely essential to living a happy, healthy existence. It's important to take frequent breaks throughout the day, whether you're doing physical work or mental work, to give yourself the change to come back to that work with fresh eyes. Breaks help you stay on task and maintain schedules.


Try taking a break every 50-90 minutes to stay on schedule, for about 10-20 minutes. Studies show that this length of break is the most effective at keeping you on task, more so than trying to work through without taking any breaks at all., Getting exercise has mood-enhancing and anxiety-preventing qualities, and recent studies reveal that people who exercise more are more readily equipped to deal with the stresses and anxieties of everyday life.It's also a great way to hit the reset after a particularly stressful day or week. Sweat it out instead of stressing over it.

, Making subtle or significant changes in your appearance can have a big effect on the way you perceive yourself and the way you carry yourself, and the way you're perceived by others, especially in the workplace.Dress the way you want to be perceived by others.


While it's easy to suggest that dressing up more will give you a more trustworthy and reliable affectit's just as important to look how you want to be perceived, to get a fresh outlook on your life.
Maybe you don't want to look reliable. Get a tattoo, or hook yourself up with a raggedy leather jacket to surprise your friends. Start fresh by embracing the look you admire.

, These days, much of the way we think about other people and ourselves has to do with our presence online. Hitting reset on your social networking accounts might require deleting or suspending them temporarily, to give yourself a break, and recalibrate your online presence.


Delete everything you don't want online and change your passwords. Make everything slightly different, so it'll feel new if and when you decide to restart.
Start things up again when you're ready, using a new user name, or a slightly different one, to pick new friends. Start a new e-mail address to start a new account, if necessary.
Stay off, if you find yourself able to cope without checking your Facebook feed all the time.

, Don't neglect the psychological benefit of a good night of sleep on your ability to recalibrate and get a fresh start on things. Sleep deprivation affects your cognitive function significantly, which can have adverse affects on your mood, your ability to perform simple tasks effectively, and your overall physical health and well-being.If you want to feel better about each new day, make sure you get enough rest between those days.

, Want to disappear completely? If you're really desperate for a reset, more significant life changes may be in order. Check out the following wikiHows to learn how to switch things around in drastic ways:

, In a famous study performed on Californians and Nebraskans, both groups concluded that Californians must have a higher happiness index, because the weather was better. The catch was, both groups recorded identical happiness scores.The grass may always seem greener, but we tend to overemphasize the effect of superficial things like weather and geography on our happiness. The biggest thing to change if you want a fresh start is yourself.

Get rid of mementos.,
Think it over, but don't obsess.,
Keep your distance.,
Lean on your friends.,
Change something that has nothing to do with your partner.,
Wait a while before dating again.",How to Start Fresh2," If you want a fresh start after a breakup, get rid of all the things that will remind you of your ex. There's little sense in keeping mementos of the good times, because they'll be more likely to remind you of the loss in the long run. If you have old photographs, mementos and trinkets from your relationship, you'll be able to get over that relationship and start fresh a whole lot faster the sooner you get rid of that stuff.


Make it a ritual. Take all those photos and delete them, one by one. Burn the letters in the backyard, saying, ""Be gone, jerk"" with every one.

, It's good to take some time to reflect after a break-up, to allow yourself to figure out what went wrong, and figure out what you could do better next time. It's good to do this, but not to let it go so far that it becomes an obsession. If you find yourself unable to think about anything but your ex, it's important to get moving on and looking forward.


If you find yourself obsessing, or rethinking the break-up, or even wanting to rekindle that flame, train yourself to remember something negative. Think of all the things you dislike about your partner. You won't be obsessing over them for long, if you do that.

, Don't give yourself the opportunity to rethink the decision to break up. A fresh start means you need to avoid your old partner's hangouts and do everything it takes to not see this person, think about this person, or do things you did with this person. Make significant changes, emotionally and physically, to recalibrate your life, post-breakup.


Don't regress. No reconsidering the decision. Relationships that end once fail more often than they succeed., Spend time with the people you still care about, and who care about you. Don't be afraid to talk about it, or to get together and rip on your ex. Laugh it off together and support each other.


If you and your partner had many of the same friends, don't be afraid to stake your claim and stand up for yourself. You don't need to cower in your room and avoid the situation because you're afraid of seeing your ex, or because you're worried about negotiating that tangled web.
At the same time, it's important to recognize when friendships might be over as well. If a friendship was situational, and that situation had to do with your relationship that's now over, don't be afraid of moving on and making new friends.

, Do something by yourself, something that your ex may have disapproved of, or something that your ex wouldn't have gone in for. Take a flamenco class, or start doing Cross-Fit, or play your favorite music super-loud, first thing in the morning. Get a crazy haircut. Celebrate your singleness with a new activity.


Think of something that your partner held back in you. If you never had the time to work on your creative projects, because your partner was always criticizing, or distracting you, let yourself be creative again. Throw yourself into some kind of project that would have been impossible with your partner.

, While jumping into a new relationship might seem like a fast-track to a fresh start, it's loaded with the potential for sour emotions and trouble. Don't bring the baggage of that relationship into someone else's life. Depending on how long your relationship was, you may need a couple weeks, or even a couple months, to really get over things.


If you find something you think you're genuinely compatible with, and you think you may be able to be with them, without staying focused on comparing it to your old relationship, that's how you know you're ready to start again.

Make a to-do list every day. Make the most out of your day by focusing on how much you can accomplish each and every day.;
, If your weekly schedule is monotonous, mix it up a bit. You might find excitement by changing something as simple as the route you take to work.Try a new dish at your favorite restaurant, or even try a new restaurant! Look for free introductory classes in your community, such as a Zumba exercise class, or participate in a flash mob.

, Paint your walls. Move your furniture. Switching things up around your home can be a fun project that keeps you busy. Creating a change in your environment can help bring about a change in yourself, too.

, Even if you have great fashion sense already, it's all about changing things up to keep life exciting. This may seem a bit unnecessary, but a new look can lead to meeting new people, and maybe even a new job. You do not have to transform from small town farm girl into a late night clubber. Getting a new look can be as simple as trying a different haircut or color.


Wear what you like and don't worry so much about what other people think. When you stop caring if others are judging you for being you, life will seem more fun.Go to a clothing store you like and ask an assistant to help you pick out clothes that are right for you. Try on some clothes that another person pictures you wearing and see how you like them.
If you don't know what kind of hairstyle you want, ask your stylist. Let her try what she think would look best on you. Put a little trust into her. As a stylist, making people look good is her job.

, Make an extra effort to get out of the house, even if you have no idea where you are going. Whenever you walk out that door, the possibilities are endless. Make every outing a new adventure by finding ways to occupy your time out in the world instead of at home.


Go out with different friends than usual, or visit a nearby place you've never been before. It may seem a bit simple, but a changing your scenery can do wonders.

, Make the most of your weekends and time away from work. Don't let it slip away while you watch television. Go for a hike, learn to rock climb, take a road trip, rent a kayak and explore a nearby river use your free time to create incredible memories and great stories.

Smile at those around you.,
Help others.,
Abandon the idea that life is fair.,
Treat others with honesty, respect and kindness.,
Value your friendships with others.",How to Make Your Life Good1," It's often been said that a smile is contagious, and research suggests that's true. Studies suggest that friendly engagement with others boosts happiness levels, at least in part because people are more likely to treat a smiling person better than a non-smiling person.


A smiling person is more likely to be regarded as viewed as attractive, reliable, relaxed and sincere.Cheering yourself up by cheering others is a hallmark of how to have a good life.;
, Studies have shown that helping others has a direct correlation to individual well-being. Taking time to care for others has been a staple of understanding ""the good life"" throughout time. Volunteering to help others has been connected to better quality of life, including increased happiness, self-esteem, health and even longevity.

Taking time to listen to another person's problems is a great way to help others. Many times, people who are struggling simply need to be able to share their situation with a friend. By taking the time to listen, you are helping whether you can solve their situation or not.
The Dalai Lama has said, “If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion.”Putting your attention on another person, rather than yourself, is a common practice of living well with others.

, Most of us are taught this as children, but the idea that there are guaranteed outcomes for particular efforts or personal qualities is a sure-fire way to live in disappointment and resentment. Let it go.


Taking responsibility for your own actions is an important discipline to develop. There may be many circumstances beyond your control, but focusing on these won't help you develop the ability to make changes in your own life that may benefit you. Accept the things you can't change; change what you can.
Letting go of resentments towards others is an essential part of the good life. It has been well-said that a resentment is ""like taking poison, expecting the other person to die.""Resentments erode the quality of your own life, damaging relationships with those around you.
Others may not always agree with you. This doesn't mean that you are wrong, or that the other person is wrong. It simply means that you have two different ideas on the same topic - and that's okay.

, This is not contingent upon how others treat you. Financial journalist Panos Mourdoukoutas said, ""Harming others claims two victims—the receiver of the harm, and the victimizer, the one who does harm.

""Taking revenge or ""getting even"" with another person opens an endless cycle of hurt and frustration that can easily be avoided simply by sticking to a few simple principles.

Telling the truth, judiciously, is a habit of people who have good lives. Many times, people try to pretend they're telling the truth about others when instead they're engaging in gossip. The attention you receive when you share gossip may feel good, for a short time. However, in the long run, gossip erodes healthy relationships between you and those around you.Before you act, consider, ""Is this something that I would want another person saying about me, or doing to me?"" If not, reconsider your actions.

, The quality of a person's friendship has a direct impact upon their well-being. Friends can increase a sense of your sense of belonging and purpose. People who have your best interest at heart, will also help prevent you from developing bad habits that work against your overall quality of life.

Let friends and family know that you care about them by spending time with them, calling them regularly, and doing things together. Friendship doesn't rely upon proximity, however. Even friends cultivated online have a positive effect on one's quality of life.People with stronger social networks have stronger immune systems, get fewer colds, report less stress, and have overall higher quality of life for reasons that aren't yet known."

Take a little time to ""let it all out."",
Avoid your crush when you can.,
Keep your confidence when you do have to interact.,
Keep yourself busy.,
Resist the urge to get revenge.",How to Show Someone You Don't Care1," Right after you get rejected, it can be tough to get a handle on your emotions. If your crush teases you during this time, you may not be able to control your reaction well. Do whatever you need to do (in private) to get over the fact that you were rejected. Cry, kick, scream — get it all out of your system.


If your crush has really gotten to you, don't be afraid to talk to your friends or family about how you feel. Your must trusted relations can comfort you and offer helpful advice during this time.;
, When your former crush wants to get a flustered reaction out of you, staying away will deny him or her the satisfaction. Don't go where this person likes to hang out. Don't talk to this person unless you are forced to. You should even avoid your crush's friends — it's impossible to tell whose side they have actually taken.


This advice extends to technology. Don't answer your crush's calls or texts. Delete your crush from your social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.).

, Eventually, you may be forced to talk to this person (especially if you share a class or are paired together at work). Ignore him or her until you are spoken to first. When you do have to talk, try to act polite but disinterested. Speak in short, proper sentences (e.g., ""Yes, that's good. No, it doesn't matter. OK. Sure."")


If your crush teases you, shut him or her down immediately with silence and an icy-cold stare. S/he is trying to get a reaction out of you, so don't allow yourself to become upset or angry.

, Don't let yourself wallow in thoughts of what could have been if your crush hadn't ended up being a jerk. Instead, show that you don't care about this person by moving on with your life! Devote yourself to your work or school work. Start a new exercise routine. Take up a new hobby. Try to master an old one. Anything you can do to stay busy will help keep your mind off of your former crush's negativity.


Remember: dwelling in the past will only hold you back. If you let yourself do this, you may eventually end up picking up your phone, checking out old pictures, and even getting the urge to text this person. Stay strong — don't go back to a person who's been hurting you.

, When someone's been mean to you, it's only natural to want to get even. Unfortunately, if you're trying to prove that you don't care about someone, this is one of the worst things you can do. Lashing out with an angry outburst or plotting an ice-cold revenge scheme may make you feel good in the short term, but they won't help you get over this person in the long term. For this, happily ignoring the person who hurt you is almost always the best revenge.


Also, it's wise to remember the old saying, ""Don't argue with idiots. From a distance, people can't tell who's who."" Trying to get back at an old flame can make you look petty or childish to others. The best course of action? Don't even run this risk.

, You don't have to do this alone. If you have any friends with unexciting lives, get them to do exciting things with you. It is much more fun, and it will make these memories last twice as long.

Practice honesty within yourself.,
Examine your desires.,
List your fears.,
Cultivate self-acceptance.,
Practice mindfulness.",How to Make Your Life Good2," Self-knowledge is an important key towards making your life good, and the only way to acquire self-knowledge is to practice honesty. It may be easier for you to acknowledge your character strengths, or it may be easier for you to admit your character defects. Either way, it will be essential for you to understand both if you are to live well within yourself.


When something is going wrong, look to your part. Avoid shifting the blame to others. Other people won't like it, and you won't learn anything.
Talk to people you trust about your situation. Many times, a good friend will have insights into your motives that you yourself cannot discern.

, What do you want from your life? What are you doing to achieve what you want?


Make a list of qualities you would like to emulate in your life. Then, make a list of ways you can practice using these qualities in your daily life. Aristotle wrote, ""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not a virtue, but a habit.""If you want to be a kind person, do kind things.
Learning to be honest about what you want is a difficult practice. Many people prevent themselves from having a good life by overemphasizing the things that they want but don't feel they can have because of other life circumstances - such as finances, family obligations, economic pressures, etc. This only perpetuates the myth that the person is a victim, a belief that is corrosive to happiness at all levels.
If you don't know the big things of what you want out of life, start with smaller choices. Developing a sense of control and power over what you have in your life is essential to having a good life., Knowing the situations that you're afraid of will allow you to better see how these fears are constraining your life in ways that may not be immediately apparent. For instance, a fear of being called stupid may mean that you're not speaking up for yourself in your workplace, thus not being considered for a promotion.


Seeing your fears in writing will sometimes help you realize how useless it is to worry about things that aren't within your control.
Sometimes a fear will be based in circumstances that are no longer present. Many people develop fears in childhood, when much was beyond their conscious control. But as an adult, the person has more autonomy and more power over their choices. By becoming more aware of the fears that drive your behavior, you can make more conscious decisions about the actions you take.

, No one is perfect. We all have short-comings, we all make mistakes and do things we'd rather not do. Mark Twain said, ""A man cannot be comfortable without his own approval.""

A good life isn't a result of making perfect choices, but of accepting the reality of who we are, including our limitations.

Self-acceptance is a discipline of honesty. It means that the person isn't denying their actions or inactions, or their consequences.Self-acceptance is a practice of self-care. Much like any other expression of self-care, accepting yourself is a practice that must be consciously learned, and relearned as your characteristics change over time.

, To focus on the present, a practice sometimes called mindfulness, is a discipline that research studies have proven directly increase one's quality of life.

Notice when you are worried about the future, or regretting the past. Turn your attention to your breath. Count 10 breaths. Even as simple an exercise in mindfulness as this one can start to show positive effects in your life, when practiced over time.
Cultivate daily habits, rather than setting distant goals. For instance, include exercise every day, rather than deciding to complete a triathlon in a month's time. Rather than deciding to lose 20 pounds, make a decision to eat healthily today. If you do decide to set a goal, break it down into manageable daily decisions.

Make a gratitude list.,
Send a thank-you note.,
Set reminders to be thankful.",How to Make Your Life Good3," Research in the field of positive psychology indicates a direct correlation between being thankful appreciation, or gratitude, and happiness.

Increasingly, gratitude is shown to have a beneficial impact on physical health as well. People who practice gratitude have lower blood pressure, stronger immune systems, and feel more connected to others.Making a list of things that you are grateful for, no matter how large or small, is one way that people actively cultivate gratitude in their daily lives. Some people keep a gratitude journal, following the old adage to ""count your blessings."" Others include a list of things that they're thankful for in daily prayers or meditations.
Posting photos, images, or written reminders of gratitude around your home is another way to remind yourself to be thankful.

, Positive psychology studies demonstrate that the act of expressing gratitude for other people's efforts has been directly linked to living a better life.

Thank you notes can be written for any occasion, large or small. A thank you note can be no larger than a emoji, or can be a written letter detailing a major event in one's life.
Sometimes people are no longer present in your life. A suggested practice of gratitude is to write a letter thanking them for their positive influence on your life. While you may never be able to mail this letter, the act of writing it will directly benefit you.

, Gratitude is a discipline, and must be practiced to be effective. Simply relying upon gratitude to arise spontaneously when events are pleasing is easy. To develop a practice of gratitude, one must develop the ability to find thankfulness in everyday affairs.


You might set an alarm to call you to be grateful at random intervals throughout your day. When the alarm goes off, simply ask yourself: what am I grateful for, right now, this moment?If you notice that you're having a thought that is resentful or complaining, try replacing that thought with one of gratefulness.For example, when caught in a traffic jam, replace the anxiety about being late to your next engagement with an observation about the seasonal beauty. After all, you might have missed that beautiful fall tree color if you'd been driving at the normal speed!

Focus on your own value.,
Let go of shame.,
Realize that your crush's ""games"" are immature.,
Don't let your crush back into your life.,
Start to view your crush as unimportant.",How to Show Someone You Don't Care2," Once you start to get over the initial pain of rejection, it's time to start moving on. However, you can't do this if you don't believe you're worth it! Start to reaffirm yourself mentally. You can use whatever positive thoughts you want, but the following three work well: You are beautiful/handsome (whichever you prefer). You are intelligent. Your crush is foolish for not accepting you.


Never feel like you're weak or helpless without this person. Admire your independence. Putting your former crush on a pedestal diminishes yourself.

, Asking someone out and getting a ""no"" is bad enough, but when your crush is actually rude back to you, the embarrassment can be almost unbearable. The shame you may feel will gradually start to fade — this will go faster for some people than for others. Don't continue to focus on your negative feelings from the past, replaying them over and over again in your head. Instead, let them go and pursue new, positive emotions instead.


Remember that you can never change the past. This means that it's illogical to worry about it. Why worry about what you can't change?

, Healthy, mature people don't make fun of the people who have crushes on them after they confess the way they feel. They don't tease them afterward. If your crush did this to you, there is one silver lining: you now know that your crush is an immature, insecure person. It should feel good to know that the person you've been worrying about is definitely at fault.

, Over time, you should start to feel better. You should gradually start letting go of the shame and embarrassment from your experience and start focusing more on your own value. However, if your old crush works his or her way back into your life, this person can throw you off the path to recovery. If you can help it, you don't want to talk to him or her before you're 100% better. If s/he tries to get back into your good graces, don't be afraid to ask for some space.


If your former crush won't get the message, be direct. It's OK to say, ""I don't want to talk to you for a while. Leave me alone.""

, Your end goal is for the person who once caused you so much embarrassment and anxiety to become basically unimportant to you. This will take lots of time and patience, but if you follow the instructions above, you should gradually show signs of improvement. Eventually, you will probably find it funny that you once cared so much about this person.


When you're ready to leave your former crush behind for good, start looking for someone who respects you and cares for you, rather than someone who will belittle you for the way you feel. Remember: happiness is the best revenge.

Always have a reason to live for.,
Those who fear change won't.,
Teamwork!,
Join a religion.,
Find yourself!,
You Don't Have to Change the World.,
Many people have done selfless deeds, and didn't even notice.,
Understand the impact you've made on the world.,
Know what you are capable of.",How to Understand Your Importance in Life," Think about all the life on Earth. How in the great wide galaxy did something like this come to happen? No matter if you believe in the Big Man in White, Jesus, or even Extraterrestrial Pancakes there is something special here. Maybe you should see it all, or maybe you should help someone else see what you do. It's all in your perspective!;
, So Don't! If you don't feel important or you feel inadequate, then you must make a change to live differently. Maybe you should just try something new, call up some old acquaintances, make some friends, or even start a garage band. Branch out and try something that isn't just based on your own efforts. Friends can always have an impact on each other.

, You're not alone. You have something that you can give that can change someones life. Sometimes our time is the most valuable thing we can give to each other.

, Many people find purpose by believing in a higher power. Religion is a great way to change your perspective and even if you don't believe you can always meet some new people.

, Certainly if you had a map you could circle where you're standing, but maybe you should look for something that drives you.

, We don't live in a fly or die society. There is plenty of room to sight see and blaze a different trail. The most important person to be important to is yourself.

, But little do they know, the receiver of your kind actions is probably very thankful. Like if you offered your unfinished bagel to someone in a restaurant, and paid no mind to it. They could have been having financial difficulties, and weren't able to afford food the day of their job application. Your kindness could have put them in a good mood, and allowed them to get the job. But if you weren't alive, they probably would've failed to get the job, and would still be in difficult times now. You perform countless kind actions everyday without even knowing, and your actions greatly impact others.

, In your mind, you may be just another face in the crowd. Another pair of hands, another imperfect human. But this is wrong. Your attitude defines everything about you, and all attitudes are contagious. Consider changing attitudes if yours isn't where it should be.


Have a good attitude. If you simply smile to everyone you see, they are much more likely to have a good day, and so are you. The simple act of smiling makes you happy, and your mood will spread to others.
Don't spread your bad attitudes. When you're having a bad day, and just can't seem to snap out of your funk, don't let others know. Try your hardest to show others a smile throughout your day. This will make them happier, and after smiling to so many people, you'll probably be happy too. If you frown at everyone you see, your vibe will rub off on them, and they'll all have bad days too.

, Understand that if you really try, you can accomplish anything you'd like to do. If you truly believe in something enough, and continually make an effort to stand up for your beliefs, you will make a difference in the world. Almost all famous people you've heard of have made huge differences in the world, most for the better. And many people you haven't heard of have made differences that affect your life to this day. Such as Rosalind Franklin. If it weren't for this unknown woman, we wouldn't know what DNA looks like. If she decided that she didn't make a difference in the world, we still probably wouldn't know.

Try keeping a record of how you spend your time.",How to Wake up from the American Dream," If you are completely satisfied with your life right now, you need not make changes. If not, determine how happy or unhappy you are with your life. Waking up may be as simple as realizing you don't want to ""move up"" from where you are because you like how you live and don't want the responsibilities and expenses of what ""society"" expects you to want after ""moving up."" An example would be relocating from a job and area you love to a higher paid job in a place you don't like because the opportunity opened up. Turn it down if that doesn't fit you! It won't be worth it.;
, People do not become dissatisfied with their lives randomly or for no reason. Your dissatisfaction is not random; there are causes. You can come to understand the causes underlying your unhappiness. Take careful stock of what it is about other people's lives that makes you jealous, and what it is in other people's lives you're glad not to have.

, Find out what works for you, and make it a part of your life. With careful change, you can eliminate the sources of your unhappiness from your life and live your dream, rather than someone else's.

, Look at several possibilities and compare.

, What climate would make you happiest and healthiest? Do you have asthma and breathe easier in the desert? Or does an arid climate give you asthma with a dust allergy, and you breathe easiest living next to the ocean? Would you be miserable if you never had a white Christmas and miss the snow, or are you happiest in a place that never has winter as you remember where you grew up? Do hot summers ruin your life or give you delight? If you could choose, what would your immediate physical environment be like year round? Becoming aware of how much the climate affects your health and happiness - it is different for every person - can vastly improve the quality of your life if you change nothing else.

, Think about the people and community. Do you long for a city with reliable mass transportation and bike lanes where you don't need a car? Or do you want to move farther out into the country where you could own a horse? Suburban living is similar across the USA, but regions vary immensely in that cities have character. Consider the places where you wish you could live but seem impossible to do so. They may be more possible than you think because the people who have lived there have already found solutions to problems that make living there seem impossible - such as high rents in San Francisco or New York. Local customs, attitudes, habits and social patterns are as big a part of how you choose to live as the physical environment is. There is no cookie cutter American Dream no matter how it looks on television.

, You probably spend the lion's share of your waking time doing it. When that fits who you are and what you enjoy doing, life becomes a lot more harmonious and less stressful. One important factor left out in the American Dream is whether your work means something to you. When you do a good job, does it feel as if you've accomplished something that needed doing and was important to others? Or does your job involve ethical and moral choices that turn your stomach every time you have to make them? It makes a world of difference to care about your work and do something that matters rather than do something you hate because you need the money for basic survival. It's the difference between having a life and being trapped.


If the job you love doesn't pay as much money as the job you hate, consider scaling back your material expectations. Eliminate expenses that you don't need nor enjoy. If you don't need it and it doesn't give you pleasure, why are you bothering to buy it? Just by doing so can trim an enormous chunk of 'fat' off your budget. It can also let you cut your hours even if your job's satisfying because you like having time for family and other activities, such as social involvement.

, You're the individual you are. Some things other people love are going to be boring, unpleasant or pointless to you. Take these things for what they are, choose according to your own feelings. Living an authentic life makes it easier to discover your personal Dream instead of chasing the generic American Dream. Others may even follow your discoveries because your happiness in them is genuine.

, Your home isn't lousy or great in comparison with your neighbor's or someone you know from work. Your home is great if it's comfortable for you, things are the way you like them and you enjoy it every time you walk in. Everyone's goals are different. Most people become very good at the things they enjoy most. You'll never be better than everybody at everything. Stuffing money into the gap by paying professionals to have similar results leads to jealousy and covert disrespect, not real admiration. Spending your energy on your own passions and freely helping beginners get started leads to real admiration and respect, something all human beings thrive on.

, It's more fair to kids if you finish sorting out your priorities first, and it enables you to experiment. Consider making a satisfying contribution to your community or world, which you might not have time for if you were raising a family.

, Ask them what they want. Talk to them as members of the family when they're old enough to talk. Look honestly at how your choices affect them. The answers may not always fall on the side of The American Dream. If your children are threatened or bullied, they may be more than willing to pull up stakes and try a new lifestyle. Don't underestimate the levels of pain and terror a bullied child faces. You may be making changes on their behalf that can materially improve their lives. Choices that give you more time to bond with them and deepen your relationship may be healthier for them. Growing your own food is something they can participate in and enjoy, it's one of the biggest motivators for children to eat vegetables. If they're not bullied, relocating breaks all their social ties outside the family and that is traumatic, it's real harm. Part of the so called American Dream is ""moving up"" every few years - the break from it might be to stay where you are and let the kids grow up with their friends instead of losing everyone they know outside the family periodically. Be aware of how your choices impact them. Discuss with them how your choices impact them and get their opinion. Life will be a lot smoother and more harmonious if they're part of the change and actively working on making your new life good.


It shouldn't have to be said, but it does. Consider your spouse or domestic partner in major life changes. Discuss reasonably and be willing to compromise. Listen to your partner's reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with respect and accept these reasons as valid. Divorce and breaking up are bitter, painful processes, often expensive as well. Look for alternatives that will satisfy both of you. If a break up is necessary because you grew apart, don't get vicious and try to separate with as little harm as possible.
If you're single, the first point about putting off the decision to have kids applies to the decision to settle down. It's much better to decide how you want to live and build a good life that fits who you are first than to suddenly change direction when a partner's expecting things to go on exactly as they have been while you were getting together. Trying a new lifestyle because you met someone wonderful who's invited you to share it is something else - if you do, be aware the relationship may not last but the new life may have some benefits of its own.
Make these personal decisions consciously for yourself. Don't just follow the 'script' of other people's expectations. That's how you wound up in the job you hated or the neighborhood you can't stand or the lifestyle that just doesn't fit.

, Except for the tools with which you make a living, you may find selling some unused items to pay off your debts frees your time and space.

, Brainstorm responsible ways to take short breaks where you try that life on for size. 'Brainstorm' ways to more quickly meet your basic responsibilities so as to make these breaks longer and longer.

, After a month or so, look at each item on your list and give it a quick ""thumbs-up"" mark if it was worth it according to your personal values, or a quick ""thumbs-down mark"" if it cost too much according to your personal values.

, After two weeks or so, give a quick ""thumbs-up"" mark to each worthy item according to your personal values, or a quick ""thumbs-down mark"" if it cost too much time according to your personal values. Make a small reminder card of the notable thumbs-ups and thumbs-downs, clip and paste it to your calendar or schedule, and glance at it when you make your schedule, or agree to do something, or plan, and once a day at a random time.

Avoid thinking that the same criteria applies to all people.,
Consider firstly Human needs.,
Think about group dynamics.,
Consider government politics.,
Consider local politics.,
Consider Assets.,
Consider the deadliest thing of all - culture.,
Consider that changes of circumstances may put people to living in shanty towns or similar makeshift homes on the streets.,
Consider education.Those who have never had much education more than survival skills, simply would not value education when it does not improve their lives.,
Consider that people can be more considerate of ""street thinking"" if they work there, be it running a shop or business of some kind, or working as a social worker, council worker etc Or those that live there - it may be living on the street or in a house on the street or in the local area.,
Remind yourself that everyone is different and that why they think as ""street people"" or ""non street people"" varies on an enormous range of factors unique to every individual.

",How to Understand Why Street People Do Not Think Like Non Street People," It becomes easy to stereotype which is not doing anyone any justice and merely reinforces poor thinking and prejudice.;
, These are pretty easy - food to eat, a place to sleep, protection from the elements and so on. These still apply to anyone from Kings and Presidents to street beggars. These human needs - survival essentially - is a very strong ""trump card"" or apex consideration.

, In order to survive, it often requires people to find company. There is safety in numbers not just in dangerous situations, but also for knowledge and skills sharing, food and other needs.


People who are ""wealthy"" or live in their own homes far away from ""street"" lifestyles tend to be far more insular and less communal as they are able to aspire after more material & status focused wants. Ultimately of course, these wants still leave people lonely (as they say, it is actually very lonely at the top) and this insular thinking is a different level to those who live more precariously on the streets.

, People who have little tend to be more socialist in thinking because they have little power of their own (which as history shows is not actually the case) and any benefits available to them will improve the quality of their lives or their family lives.

The opposite always occurs, it is just as likely that a person may hold the dangerous ""entitlement"" view that because they are here they are entitled to be wealthy and have their desires met and so destroy and rebel when things don't go their way, caring little about the consequences. Paranoia can be a common co-dependent symptom. (Vandalism is a very obvious indicator).

, If a group protects you, it comes at a price. A society is merely a group of individuals but each one has to contribute. This almost always develops group rivalries over territory.


For people who live in suburbs rivalries still exist but tend to be more broader. It requires a lot to be able to motivate a lot of strangers together in a single cause rather than a group who know each other well.

, People who have them, often maintain them - home & possessions, car, garden (perhaps), finances etc. Why people maintain them can be a status or pride thing, but also an occupation for those who don't need a day job. ""Non street people"" tend to be more attached to things that they have invested more time in taking care of. For those who don't know where their next meal comes from, any asset is fair game if it gives you that meal, regardless how much you may be attached to it.

, A persons culture will shape them as will lead them to go with their peers (peer pressure etc). Culture and religion can cause the biggest problems when local groups of different races/religions/cultures etc cross territory. This includes prejudices, vendettas & alliances and similar things.

,

People may originally have been living in a house of their own until a change, be it the global financial crisis, civil unrest, political or civil persecution and so on. Its different for everyone - some people may have have always lived in that area for several generations.

, For example - knowing about a country on the other side of the world, or the worlds largest mountains etc is not going to make a substantial change to their life in comparison to knowing about the local conditions such as where it is safe, how to use money, how to find a meal, where the hospital is, where a place to stay is etc. Education, or at least trivial knowledge is useless in comparison to specialised expert knowledge of the local area and how to live there.


For ""non street people"" safer conditions can lead to specialised knowledge in more trivial areas, such as music, arts, history, botany, philosophy or religion etc - the things often called the ""cultural sciences"". The need to survive is already met, so it comes down to how to spend the time and what contribution education can give. Abraham Maslow's ""Hierarchy of Needs"" theory has much to say about this topic.

,


Basically exposure to the environment is what differs between the two main groups.

Do your homework.,
Look at objects.,
Now that's the mereological nihilism bit over, time for the solipsistic belief system!,
Lapse into meditative, pensive silence and ponder the notion that everything is just a figment of your thoughts and without your brain, it is possible that nothing would be.",How to Wallow in Solipsistic Uncertainty Whilst Catastrophising About Mereological Nihilism," Type 'solipsism' and 'mereological nihilism' into Google. Pore in an obstinate, absorbed and relentless manner for days, months, or even years over relevant Wikipedia articles. Frantically scribble important notes in a specially disguised notebook that you hide under some other books under some dirty clothes under an old and decrepit lamp under a some bits of old tin that once was a part of the fence under some rusting bathroom pipes you found by the side of the road on a lonely trip north under a generous plate of tuna bake topped with bacon bits that you didn't eat for dinner one night three months ago and have left there decomposing under your bed ever since. Under a secret platform made of 3 centimeter (1.2 in) thick reinforced iron linked to state of the art voice recognition software. Ponder in a concentrated state of intense, dogged, passionately meditative silence for extended periods of time. Learn.;
, Scrutinize their separate parts in a highly suspicious manner befitting of a superpower's top level secret spy. Think- how can it be certain that individual parts of an object unify to create a whole if our very senses are defective due to our biologically imperfect state as flawed human beings which can at best provide us with a nebulous idea of them? Consequently, how can we be sure that any aspect of reality is comprised of any whole items with perfectly contiguous parts? Therefore, how is anything a properly fused part of anything? The fact is, nothing is. Just think along those lines for while and you should be fine.

, Relocate to a long, pitch black and isolated cave away from all possible lifeforms, including small marsupials and plant matter. This will allow you to get into the head space of believing nothing, not even your arms, eyebrows or toenails exist.

, This works well with the mereological nihilism thing because you've already concluded that the existence of whole objects is a complete and utter lie. Think - how can we trust our defective senses to shape and guide our thoughts into an honest construction of reality if they are naturally imperfect (a fact that has been proven through humans' inability to perceive the smallest parts of a whole)? How can we have complete confidence in thought if our senses are imperfect which give boundaries to and shape thought, which must lead to the fact that although our thoughts are sure to exist they lead an existence that is inextricably intertwined in the inadvertent fabrication of truths? How can our thoughts be whole if nothing is (the answer to which is supported by humans' inability to perceive them at all), and if they are not whole does this have further implications for our skepticism regarding the reliability of thought? Need a specific topic to tear apart? Here is an example- 'how can I consume food and liquid materials to provide nutrition, energy and strength for my body if food and liquid materials are not certain in their existence in reality? Are nutrition, energy and strength mere social constructions that have psychosomatic effects on my body (which in fact is uncertain in it's own existence) and further, is reality a social construction that I need to painfully extricate myself from to reach true freedom? What is true freedom and how can it exist if nothing else exists to free itself from and are my thoughts a mere construction of quarks and leptons which are not certain to exist and therefore my thoughts do not exist I only think they do? Is everything I've ever seen, touched, felt and experienced mere psychosomatic effects of the plethora of social constructions that effectively create the world as we know it and therefore even my thoughts are based on nothing but the polluted notions my mind harbours due to what it has seen prior to my incredible epiphany and ensuing isolation? Am I really isolated if there is nothing to isolate myself from? How am I thinking in English if the language English is not sure to exist?

Learn about our common evolutionary origins.,
Notice social hierarchies.,
Learn the importance of human communication.,
Get along with others.,
Try to fit in.",How to Understand the Human Condition1," Most scientists and many people accept Darwin’s theory of evolution. This theory holds that humans evolved from other species, and we are considered Great Apes, a type of primate.Regardless of race, culture, or religion, we are all biologically the same species with common ancestors.;
, All primates are hierarchical; they establish a system whereby there are leaders and subordinates. This system limits the number of conflicts among members of a group and keeps us generally cooperative.Note that hierarchical disputes can be common when individual members feel that the hierarchy or division of power or goods is unfair. Such disputes are common in both human and non-human primates such as capuchins.Humans have hierarchies that are nested. In your household, there is a dominant individual, but this person may be subordinate to someone at work or in the community., Vocalization (speech) and written languageis particularly important to humans, who share training in word use and the emotions associated with specific word choices.


Human “training” in language use happens both formally, in school, and informally, in everyday life.
The unfortunate human tendency to use language to bully others emphasizes the power of aggressive words.\

, Part of the human condition is that each of the approximately 7 billion people on the planet has to get along with the other humans as well. Humans’ tendency to be averse toward unusual behavior or appearance, combined with a high likelihood of encountering people different from us leads to high conflict.


Being mean or at least not accepting of someone who is different is a way to discourage them, and encourage them to try to be more like you.Religion, television and radio help people have shared interests so when they get together, they can get along.

, One way to minimize conflict among humans is to attempt to act like those around you. This tends to make everyone more similar and reduce conflict among individuals.


When a trait that doesn’t match the majority is unchangeable, like ethnicity or sexual preference, people can campaign to increase acceptance. For example, some areas have a non-discriminatory culture, which discourages people who are aggressive toward ethnic minorities, lesbians, gays, bisexuals or transgendered (LGBT) people, women, or people who are disabled."

Countries on this planet are as unnecessary, as dividing a city into parts with borders, making them watch each other, and only allow authorized passage from each part to the other. Many people didn't like the way Berlin got divided after World War II.;
, No matter what position they're in, they can and will find a way to take advantage of you for their own good. Not everyone of course, but keep your eyes open. Take your time and read the contract you are signing. Check the money you are given. It might be counterfeit. Political campaigns can be very deceiving. Your best choice probably is to utilize a search engine and make background checks for the party and the candidates. Look for signs they are not keeping their promises. Only trust someone you have a good reason to. People can be very convincing, but can still harm you. Let me give you a few topics you should pay more attention to: pharmaceutics, politics, advertisements, legal documents, health care, education, religions (including materialism, which is one of the biggest businesses on earth). Keep in mind that some industries or some interests only care about profit, and nothing about people. There are small scale cons done every day, don't think it is not happening big time. Selfish people act the same way on every level of power.

, For most people press is the main source for news. But news bulletins are not always factual. They can be speculations, manipulative, misleading, incomplete, or false. Press is not an extension of your senses. Believe only what you see for yourself.

, We need the environment to live, thus we must protect the environment. Things on Earth don't go as well as you are lead to believe. Leading the planet to ecological destruction is good business unfortunately. Keeping people feeling safe is just a way to avoid panic. You know what you know about the environment, because that is what you should know to keep your mouth shut. Just take care of your surroundings, environment is saved or ruined by individual persons. If you don't care about all this, take my advice and don't make plans for a long future, because we'll be extinct before you know it.

, You don't have to be special to achieve big things. Everything that has been done on Earth was done by individual persons. The only thing you need to keep in mind is your goal. And the only thing you have to do is reach it and don't give up. There is no such thing as impossible. There is only unknown. (Having an answer for a question does not mean you have the right answer.)

, Understand, that you might know something for a fact that is not true. Be open minded. Try not to be arrogant. Accept if you are proved wrong. If you did not take the time to verify some theory, or a statement to be true, don't try to right yourself out of defiance. Understand, that others may still do this, so don't let yourself be convinced of something that the other party cannot prove or support with rational reasoning.

, Keep them in mind, and make use of them.

, And to keep relationships intact, and working for long years.

, Very important! Don't judge someone from a particular country or by how their government acts. You may know from first hand, in some countries citizens have no voice in anything they're government does except to elect them. Countries are not people. They are just legal entities. What they do is solemnly up to their government. Citizens on the other hand have their own life, their own goals, they have feelings and families. Most likely they never think of harming anyone, they are not looking for conflicts.

, Each and every one of them. The difference, is the scale and what good means to them. Examples: A selfish man serves himself. He does good to himself while harming others. He doesn't care about that though. A dictator is convinced his actions serve a good purpose, for some. About the others, he doesn't care. When you act, place yourself in the position of people affected by your actions. Try to evaluate the pros and cons of an action. The value of an action is measured in the magnitude of its positive effect compared to the negative.

, Project it on a bigger group or a society. If in large scale your lifestyle would lead to negative or destructive consequences it is probably a bad thing in small scale too. Like smoking. It smells bad, it creates an addiction, it shortens your life, and makes you sick possibly. In large scale, people throw away the cigarette stub on the street, they make non smokers feel uncomfortable, smoke is pollution, and big business too. Refrain from helping those financially who take advantage of your bad habits or addictions. It's like paying an assassin to poison you slowly.If you collect garbage selectively, it is time for me to give a big Thank You to you! May others do such good things to you too! It might seem like a small contribution, but like before, looking at it on a bigger scale would mean less garbage and more recycling, and thus a cleaner environment.

, You might not be aware of it, but good things constantly happen. People invent great things, an unexpected rain saves an entire crop from drying out, someone writes a great book about something you love to do. Hopes and dreams come true. Long lost family members find each other. A retired couple give all their life savings to a hospital, to help. So many noble and good hearted people live on this planet. Don't be fooled by the news you are watching. The world is not all about politics, catastrophes, accidents, violence, conflicts and war. This is only one side of the coin.

, They might be in a very stressed state of their life. If they cannot restrain themselves from being impolite or rude, try to keep your cool, and remind yourself how you would have liked to be treated, try to be helpful and kind. Treat others the way you want to be treated. This helps most of the time!

Understand what determinism really is.,
Determinists may say that a belief in free will implies the acknowledgment of the supernatural.,
Understand how belief in determinism comes about.,
Realize what determinism means in the ""real world."",
Note: Some determinists, in fact, most (compatibilists and most incompatibilists), believe that punishing people for their actions is not logically inconsistent.,
Finally, you can decide whether you believe in determinism, free will or both.",How to Understand Philosophical Determinism," Very simply, determinism is the belief that all events have causes, and that if there are identical causes, the same effects must occur. This is very easy to recognize in the natural world, and much of science is based on deterministic principles. However, it can be difficult to recognize how this applies to human behavior (which most people consider to be separate from the natural world). Further, determinism means that everything is predictable, including the process of making decisions, and that a decision does not occur as a first cause but rather as a result of the predetermined criteria for a specific decision to be made having been met.;
, Logic dictates that if the human being is part of the natural world, human behavior must be deterministic. In order to escape determinism, a supernatural element is required. In Western culture, this generally takes the form of a ""soul,"" ""spirit,"" or ""higher self."" For the believer in free will, this ""magical person"" (as determinists may call it) is able to make conscious decisions and choices which take precedence over the natural causes which govern the rest of the universe. Of course creating a higher entity, or soul, is itself beautifully deterministic.

, Generally, when one accepts naturalism (which is the idea that everything is part of a single unified natural world), determinism is a logical consequence. Most determinists reject free will because they have first rejected the supernatural. For the supernaturalist, free will remains a logical idea, but for the naturalist, it is not. Of course, without free will (or ""free thought"" if you will) there would be no determinism, so determinism can also be seen as a revolutionary ideal, a rebellion against the existing supernatural order, advocating a return to ""natural"" laws of existence.

, Many philosophers think that if people are naturally caused to behave the way they do (instead of ""magically choosing"" to do so), we should consider the idea that many punitive (punishment-based) actions may be irrational. For the determinist, punishing people (psychologically, economically or judicially) for actions or circumstances which are entirely caused is logically inconsistent. Accordingly, there is a reduced emphasis on blame and punishment, and an increased desire to discover the hidden causes of human behavior.

, Whilst, some realize that people can not be blamed or held responsible for their actions, none of them deny the effectiveness of a system where certain behaviour is rewarded and other behaviour is punished. For nothing can be more logically consistent with determinism (a concept that states that every effect is followed by some like cause). This view holds that it is possible to manipulate the world around us, including behaviour. So, through punishment/rewards evil and good can be prevented and promoted respectively.

, If you believe that people have souls or spirits which survive death, determinism probably isn't for you. Similarly, if you believe in any form of the supernatural (anything outside or above the natural world), you will probably have a hard time accepting determinism. Remember, if you choose determinism, you must believe that it is because you were caused to do so (either by this article or a variety of other possible determinants). If you choose free will, you must believe that it is entirely your choice, and you could have chosen otherwise.

Step outside of yourself.,
Question your comfort zone.,
Volunteer for charitable organizations.,
Live in someone else’s environment for a time.,
Talk to people whose situations make you feel uncomfortable.",How to Understand the Human Condition2," To do this, turn your focus outward. Instead of thinking primarily about what you need or want, look around you and think about the needs and wants of others. The first step to doing this may be simply to become more social; joining clubs or groups and cultivating relationships can keep you from feeling isolated, which can hinder empathy., If you feel as though you lack empathy, think about your childhood environment.Many times, a lack of empathy or the presence of prejudice begins at home.Becoming aware of the limitations or biases that you grew up with can lead you to break the cycle and become empathetic of others yourself. This will help you understand the humanity of others.


For example, you may have grown up hearing your mother and father making racial slurs. Acknowledge that your parents’ views were prejudiced, then think about what you can do to minimize or eliminate any lingering feelings about people of a different race in your own mind. You may also want to resolve that your own children will not have similar memories of their parents.

, Donating your time and money for an organization that helps other people can give you a broader view of the human condition. Find an organization that places volunteers “in the field,” talking to people who need help.

, Volunteering or spending time around people with different cultures or circumstances can give you a window into the living situations of others. To develop more empathy, try living the way that someone else lives for a while.


For example, if you wish to develop empathy for people who are living in poverty, find out what an individual’s weekly budget is. Then put away all of your comfort items (such as your cell phone, your tablet computer, your television, and your fancy crystal stemware). Try to live for 2 weeks the way someone in poverty would live.
Even if you don’t give up the roof over your head, sacrificing your luxuries and trying to feed yourself on an extremely limited budget can give you a good impression of the way other people have to live every day.

, If a particular type of person makes you feel somewhat uncomfortable, try talking to him. Finding the common humanity of people who we see as “others” can help us feel empathy towards them.For example, if dirty homeless people make you feel uncomfortable, try talking to someone who is homeless. Ask him what his name is and whether he has any family. Ask him his favorite food and what his favorite weather is. Then ask him about how he became homeless, where he sleeps at night, and how he gets regular meals.

Recognize your discomfort with cultural differences.,
Travel to new places.,
Look at a globe or a map of the Earth.,
Use technology to learn about other cultures.,
Develop friendships with people from other cultures.,
Read literature written in and about other cultures.,
Define humanity.",How to Understand the Human Condition3," Humans tend to be more accepting of what is similar to ourselves than what is different.We often feel afraid and uncertain when we interact with someone who is very different from ourselves, making us less likely to cooperate.You can acknowledge this reluctance and push past it in order to become more comfortable with cultural differences. The best way to do this is to experience other cultures.

, The best way to experience other cultures is to travel. If you are able to travel to new places to experience culture, try doing what the natives do instead of visiting tourist attractions. Eat at restaurants where the locals eat and participate in activities that the locals attend.As you experience more and more cultures, you will develop a greater picture in your mind of what it means to be human. While you celebrate the differences among cultures, you can also see the similarities among them.

, Understanding the human condition means knowing that humans live almost everywhere on our world. The fact that humans have been able to migrate and inhabit everywhere on Earth that has at least a moderate climate means that humans are an adaptable species. It also means that the survival skills we have developed vary greatly from place to place.


From the Midwestern U.S. to Western Europe, central Africa, northern Alaska, China and Indonesia, people have different challenges from the environment in terms of getting food and shelter. What they have in common is living with other people in a social network.

, If you are unable to travel yourself, you can still learn about other cultures. You can watch television programming that introduces the customs and people of distant places. You can use the internet to find details about countries you may never have heard of before.


Be aware that if you are experiencing culture through media such as television, you are necessarily experiencing it through someone else’s “lens.” Some organizations or sources of information may have a particular agenda when presenting alternate cultures, and a savvy viewer should be aware of potential biases.

, Becoming friends with someone from a different culture can be a great way to broaden your view of humanity.Spend time with your friend and her family. Ask your friend to be a sort of “tour guide” for her culture.You’ll likely find that there are similarities between your families that you would never have guessed.

, Literature can be like a window into another world. Reading literature can help you develop a sense of empathyand expose you to cultures other than your own.


Select literature that was written by a member of a cultural or ethnic group rather than an outsider.

, Once you have experienced a variety of cultures, ask yourself what it is to be human. Gather your own experiences to find a common thread that crosses the lines between seemingly different cultures.

Understand the social context in which existentialism emerged.,
Understand the proposition 'Existence precedes essence'.,
Understand absurdism, or at least the principles behind it.,
Understand that Existentialism can be liberating as well as frightening or depressing.,
Relate the themes of existentialist literature to your own life.,
Read existentialist literature from an existentialist's point of view and try to relate.",How to Understand Existentialist Philosophy," It became popular shortly after the Second World War- people had thought WWI would end all wars, and instead they had just been through the most brutal war yet seen in history. Having seen the worst of war, and the violence that humans could and would inflict on other humans, it is understandable that people started to think that life was meaningless, and question the veracity of ideas like God and former philosophies that posited a just universe.;
, Earlier philosophies, and many religions, posit that there is an ideal human form or some inherent human nature that exists above or before the individual, to which the individual should strive. Existentialism posits the opposite- there is no higher purpose or 'essence' to existence, except what we make of it. In other words, we make our own purpose. Existence preceding essence assumes that there is no God or higher being that brings some form of Just Order to the cosmos- it is generally an atheistic statement.

, Realize that existentialism posits that there is no sort of 'karmic' reward system, and so everything that happens is chance and bad things can easily happen to good people. Again, this probably stems from the social context of post-WWII. This inherent meaninglessness is sometimes exaggerated in Absurdist theatre such that nothing makes any sense- the characters don't understand one another and the environment doesn't follow the usual laws of space and time. This can be comedic to watch, but also depressing as it is supposed to reflect the inherent lack of justice or karma in the real world.

, With no higher power or philosophical Truth governing the world, we have the ability to make our own meaning for ourselves. Existentialism posits that we are defined by how we act, not by how we are supposed to act, so to a great extent you choose who you want to be.

, The feeling of waiting at a bus stop with nothing to do might help you relate to Waiting for Godot, while remembering a time when you were punished for a good deed or rewarded for a bad one will help you understand how people can believe the universe is amoral.

, Even if you are religious or believe in a higher order, try to put yourself in the shoes of someone who doesn't believe, and see how existentialism helps them to continue living in a world that is inherently amoral.

Get an idea beforehand on what you think philosophy is.,
Know how to read philosophy.,
Study the history of philosophy.,
Begin with Plato and Aristotle.,
Do not limit your studies to works of philosophy.,
Know which philosophers to read.,
Use secondary sources to understand a complicated work.,
Work on expressing your meanings clearly.",How to Understand the Philosophical Tradition," Figure out what you think it does, what it should accomplish, and why you would like to set about practicing philosophy. If you later find out that philosophy is not what you thought it was, you might know better whether you would like to stick with it, or find a different practice that suits your goals better.;
, Many philosophical texts are dense works, more akin to prose mathematics than traditional essays and literature. When reading a work of dense philosophy, do not read, as you would a novel, ""page by page"". You should read sentence by sentence, taking the time to understand each idea before moving onto the next. The ideas and terminology presented in one sentence are often of key importance for understanding those to follow in the next sentence. Sometimes you have to read the next couple of sentences to understand the one before, and sometimes you have to go back and reread a prior sentence to understand one later. But take your time and try to understand as much as possible before moving forward in the work.

, Philosophy is not necessarily always exciting (depending on your mentality), but if you plan to study philosophy seriously you should begin with a cursory grasp of the entire trajectory of the history of philosophy. The reason for this is that many philosophical works and ideas are developments of or reactions to prior works and ideas. It's often very difficult to understand or appreciate one work without having read what came before it. For this reason it is particularly helpful to begin at the beginning and work your way forward through at least reading the major works of history.

, Many of the key issues in philosophy are found in the works of these thinkers. It is not necessary that you agree with the conclusions of these thinkers, or even with their methods - many of their successors don't. Still, dealing with their arguments and their ideas with logic and reason will put you in the right direction for continuing your philosophical studies.

, To a degree it is possible to get lost in abstraction. Much of modern philosophy takes cues from empirical data (physical data, and data available to the senses), as well as the methods and findings of modern science (including physics, psychology, etc.), history, current events and social/political development, so it is more than worthwhile to keep your head above water on these subjects.


If you want to write/discuss political philosophy, it is important to know about current political events as well as the structure of governments and methods of government actions. If you want to study philosophy of the mind, you should stay abreast of recent developments in artificial intelligence and cognitive science.

, Which philosophers are considered most important is often the result of prejudices, but it is undeniable that there are a few philosophers who have objectively contributed to paradigm shifts in philosophical thinking. In chronological order, some of the most important of these are: Plato, Aristotle, Rene Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Georg Hegel, Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, etc. This list is not by any means exhaustive, and it doesn't include many of the important figures who contributed to specific areas of philosophy. Pick the area or areas of philosophy that most interest you and read about their history in order to understand who the most influential philosophers are.


For example, the list of influential political philosophers would look very different, with emphasis on Machiavelli, John Locke, and Karl Marx rather than Descartes, Spinoza, and Hegel.

, When you are having serious trouble understanding a philosophical work even reading the work slowly and closely sentence by sentence, you should try looking up terminology either in a regular dictionary or a philosophical dictionary, or else reading a secondary work (ie. a scholarly work about the philosopher's philosophy) on the philosopher. Make sure the secondary work is an introduction or overview, or else knowledge of the philosophers terminology might be presupposed and you may find the secondary work as difficult as the primary one.


Secondary sources can be very helpful in teaching you about philosophers and how to understand them, but they should never be substituted for reading the philosopher's work itself.

, Yes it seems that a lot of philosophers do not practice this, as their writing can be stilted and obscure. Recognize that this is not a hallmark of good writing. Writing about your own ideas is the best way to develop them and make them concrete, but when you do this, make sure to write in a grammatically clear and coherent fashion. Write as if you're talking to a friend or teacher, not as if you're trying to impress someone. This will help make sure both you and your readers understand exactly what you're trying to say.

Call the light in thought or words.,
Send the light, in thought, to any negative feeling in yourself such as disappointment, embarrassment, betrayal etc.,
Review the steps: Ask for the Light, be open to the light and send the light to a feeling within yourself, to an event or to another person with the intention of creating a harmonious result.,
Make short notes if you like.,
Learn from a qualified meditation teacher.",How to Transform Negativity With Spiritual Light," For example, say or think, ""I invite the light"" or be more specific as relates to your beliefs. ""I invite the light of the Holy Spirit"" or the ""Divine Mother"". Allowing this begins the transformation/forgiveness.;
, Do this as often as that feeling occurs throughout the day. Notice any small changes. Go about your usual activities. Eventually these darker feelings will be reformed into feelings of joy, happiness, compassion and exhilaration. Just be easy and allow the change. Most importantly, recognize your hand in this change. This recognition grows confidence and a faith in this practice based on your actual, personal experience. It is experiential faith. You may call the light and send the light to others, to future events, and even to the memory of past events. Past/Present/Future is a continuum. Sending light to past events may transform your feelings and relationships in present time. Sending light to future events may create a more harmonious time. When sending light to a past or future event, be somewhat specific and name the date or event.

, We may send light daily to those we love, by name, and even our pets. Reminder: spiritual light is available 24/7.

, When in a relaxed moment or at bedtime make some notes on a small disposable notepad (not a journal). Write down anything that concerns the mind or needs to be eased, transformed or enhanced. This may be seemingly little or silly stuff as well as your dreams and visions. Remember, if it is important to you...it is important! Keep each one short and have the intention of sending light to each idea or concern. The next day review these jottings and note any progress (even the slightest progress...is progress.) Then discard the note or at least file it away and express thanks. This process helps you to see changes that you initiated without continually going over the problems as you might with a journal. It keeps you more in the present. It is powerful and practical.

, Meditation is a vehicle for light. Otherwise, when simply enjoying some silence, send light throughout your physical being. Sit back or lie down and imagine the light flowing through every limb of your body, one by one clearing away all negative feelings and blockages, and replacing it with a spiritual intensity. This not only aids with removing negative sensations, but also can aid in healing and health promotion.

Begin by asking yourself these questions: What is behind my current feelings?,
Try some of these suggestions and then go on with your own creative ideas.

,
Gaze downward or tilt your head a bit towards your lap, and feel your chest and gut; breathe while doing this for a moment or two.,
Think about how you feel in this moment.,
Pay attention to any impulses that come up, like a desire to go outside.

,
Go outside.,
Play with a kid as if you were still that young.,
Spend five or fifteen minutes writing in a journal.,
Listen to Cat Stevens Boy With A Moon And Star On His Head, and Led Zeppelin's Tangerine, and then plan a drive (any time of year) into the country.,
Relax about the pressures you perceive in the world for a moment.,
Consider having fun every day, real fun that touches your deepest self.

",How to Tune Into Your Inner Self," How do I want to feel? What do I want to experience?;
,, Just be yourself for a few seconds.

, Whatever it is, accept the feeling by either hugging yourself while feeling it or mentally wrapping your arms around the emotion, as if it were a ball of light.

,, Look at the tree tops. Notice how the breeze or wind moves them and if they have any birds in them. See the clouds and note the direction and speed of the wind. Touch something in the natural world, like a smooth stone or a plant. Notice its texture and temperature.

, Keep a sense of responsible awareness, but go ahead and feel the wonder of everything; try fun things like moving your body to mimic the poses the kid is striking, and let her or him in on it by pointing out stuff to laugh about together.

, Write about anything. Save what you wrote and read it later. You'll enjoy it and gain insights into yourself.

, Plan a picnic if possible. Invite all ages of your friends and families!

, Consider the differences and similarities between what is assumed and demanded by the post-modern world around you and what is necessary and desirable to you.

Look at the world through other people’s eyes.,
Get to know people.,
Listen attentively to others.,
Focus on common ground.,
Forgive someone if they've hurt you.",How to Stop Feeling Self‐Righteous1," When you find yourself looking down on someone, think about what their life is like. Ask yourself how they might be feeling or what they might need right now. Try to imagine how their circumstances have shaped their philosophy about life.For instance, someone who’s always lived in a big city may not see the world the same way someone from a small town does.;
, Instead of judging strangers or assuming you won’t like them, reach out and say hello. Introduce yourself to neighbors, coworkers, or classmates from different backgrounds. Be friendly and curious, and you’ll have an easier time understanding why people act and think the way they do., When you’re having a conversation, focus on understanding the other person. Pay attention to their body language, tone of voice, and emotions, as well as their words. Don't judge while you are listening. Do your best to see where they are coming from, even if you don’t agree.Show the other person you’re paying attention to them by nodding at appropriate times and saying things like “Then what happened?” or “Mm-hmm.”

, If you dwell on all the ways someone is different from you, you might end up feeling like you’re better than them. Instead, try to find ways you’re alike. When you feel like someone is “on your team,” even in a small way, you’re less likely to feel self-righteous towards them.For instance, maybe you and a new acquaintance can connect over your mutual love of mystery novels, or maybe you both came from large families.

, If someone has hurt you, make the choice to forgive them instead of carrying around a self-righteous grudge. Bitterness and resentment only hurt you, not the person who wronged you. Try to see the situation from their point-of-view and think about how you might have handled it.Consider whether the person really meant to hurt you, or whether they were just acting in an inconsiderate or shortsighted way.

Read some stories about people who have behaved in courageous ways in extremely difficult circumstances to help inspire you.,
Read 'Apology' and 'Crito' by Ancient Greek Philosopher Plato.,
Read the Bible.,
Realize that trials of all kinds, whether they be emotional, relational, physical, circumstantial or the result of natural disasters, accidents, etc., are a part of life and can be confronted with strength and purpose.

,
The key to standing strong in times of trial is to not let self-pity, fear, or a focus on yourself cloud your ability to think and help others.

,
Make small daily choices in your life to build strength, whether it's confronting a fear, having that unpleasant conversation with someone, or overcoming inertia to go out and exercise!,
Practice living selflessly.,
Spend some time volunteering.,
Realize that gaining this kind of strength takes time and is the result of many small acts practiced and performed again and again over a lifetime.",How to Stand Strong in Times of Trial," For example, ""The Band That Played On"" by Steve Turner (Thomas Nelson 2011) tells about the lives of 8 musicians on board the Titanic who gave their lives to play music to keep people calm while the ship was sinking.;
, These are short dialogues. These works describes the speech and conduct of Socrates, ancient Greek philosopher and teacher of Plato, during and after his judicial trial for some charges. Socrates denies these charges and gives a reasoned argument for his all his actions. These works shows the courage of man in face of heavy punishment, which was death for Socrates, on the grounds of his reasoned principle alone, It contains tons of stories of people confronting difficult situations and standing strong. If you believe in the Christian account of Jesus, this book can be a source of strength and comfort as well.

,,, Usually it will be the thing in the back of your mind that you are avoiding!

, Begin small. Perform those random acts of kindness. You'll feel better about yourself and you'll be making a difference in the lives of others. Pay attention to the needs of others. Even simple acts of kindness like lending an ear to someone who needs it can make a difference.

, Most communities have dozens of causes for which you can volunteer. You can be a hero to less privileged people, even in small ways, and these activities help you to get outside yourself, which is always the attitude of heroes and those who stand strong.

, But the more you follow these steps, the more strength and courage you will build and the faster these responses will become automatic in your life.

Set realistic goals.",How to Stop Expecting Too Much from People," Sometimes you will set expectations for a spouse, partner, or child. If you are in management, however, you likely will set expectations for myriad diverse people. When setting goals in those instances, work to appreciate each individual’s personality, work patterns, hobbies, and passions.By having a sense of the person, you will be better able to set realistic expectations. Ask the person:


What work tasks makes you concerned?
Which work activities give you energy?
What are your work goals?
How do your work and personal goals jive with our expectations here?How can I help you work towards your various goals in a strategic, effective manner?;
, Make sure contracts explain duties thoroughly and the employee's specific role in your organization. Convey job responsibilities to employees. Outline the person’s responsibilities, duties, and purposes.When making a new request, check whether your request is realistic. Ask yourself whether you can visualize your employee doing what you desire. If the person has done the task previously, your request is likely realistic. When the assignment is something new, consider whether your employee could complete the task with the available time and resources.If possible, help make the task easier. For example, if you need your employee to write a very important report, give her a quiet office where she can work on the report., Be concrete in your expectations but be flexible in your timeline.Craft a timeline that works for both of you. Offer your assistance when it is possible as well.


Meet with your employees to set regular goals. Split projects into smaller sections with each section having its own goals.

, Set regular meetings at which you can review progress.If people are not meeting your expectations, have an open dialogue with them. People cannot read your mind. In some cases, your expectations might be too high. In other scenarios, it is possible you did not transmit your expectations clearly. Either way, it is best to check in with people regularly about expectations.

, For example, you might set high expectations for yourself. Maybe you work long hours or are super mom and get everything imaginable done but barely sleep. Just because you have set these sorts of expectations for yourself does not mean you can expect other people to act the same way. Work to distinguish between the expectation you have for someone and the way the person completes the task., If you tend to be a perfectionist, it is very possible you expect perfection from others. This can be seriously damaging to your work and personal relationships. Aim to practice acceptance. When someone (including you) makes a mistake, realize that making mistakes is human. No one is perfect and accepting the flaws of others and yourself will help you be more realistic in setting expectations. Your employees also will appreciate that you are a more understanding boss.


There are limits to acceptance. If an employee consistently does not fulfill his work obligations, it is fully appropriate to have a serious talk with him.

, If you need or want a partner or loved one to do something, convey this kindly and directly. If you are vague or unclear, you are setting yourself up for disappointment and are likely to cause the other person to be frustrated. When you have a particularly important request, ask for a one-on-one meeting. This will help avoid confusion that can come when making requests in passing.


For example, if you want your partner to do something (e.g. drive the kids to school), state that clearly. Do not hint by saying, “Wow, it’s really stressful for me to take the kids to school before work. You work at home…” Instead say, “Mike, could you take the kids to school? It would help my commute considerably.”
Remember that unless you are a manager, you likely cannot dictate to a person (especially your partner) what he must do. Instead say, “I’d love for you to clean the garage before Thanksgiving. How can we make that happen? Let’s look at our available weekends.”

, When setting expectations for children, it is often necessary to establish a routine. Having certain chores on the weekly schedule for particular days will help your child remember to do them. Consider making a checklist that people can mark when they have completed a task.


For example, rather than telling your son to take the trash out generally, try saying, “Hey, Logan. Please take out the trash every Friday morning before school.”

, For children, offering small incentives and systems for accountability can help them fulfill expectations. After a child has completed a certain number of tasks or weeks, offer a small reward. You also can periodically reward your partner for fulfilling her or his commitments.


You might reward a child's successful completion of monthly duties with a movie night.

, Although you might be used to expecting things from others, what do other people expect from you? Having conversations with your partner, children, or friends about their expectations will help you be a better person. Knowing the level of expectations people set for you also might help you gauge what normal expectations are. If, however, other people set unreasonably high expectations for you, like babysitting your grandchildren every weekend for example, be honest about your own limitations.

, Make a list of the good things your spouse, employee, or child are doing.


It could be that a positive quality your partner possesses is related to a negative quality. For example, your partner could be very generous with his time but then not always get things done punctually. Try to think about someone’s behaviors as a reflection of their unique self.

, When thinking about what goals you want to achieve, whether short or long term, aim to understand the root of these goals. People who set realistic goals and expectations have higher self esteems. You can ask yourself the following questions:


What is the root of my goal? When did it develop?
Why do I want to achieve this goal?
Is it based on my desires or someone else’s (e.g. partner, parent, teacher)?
Can I realistically achieve this goal based on my personality and history?
What is the purpose of achieving this goal?

, What is most important to you? Perhaps your job or your relationship. Focus on the top three things that matter in your life and make sure that you are giving your time and energy to those activities. If you have time and energy to do more activities, add them in gradually. Aim for a good balance.


For example, you might say that your top three priorities are your family, job, and choir. Schedule weekly quality family time. Make sure you sleep enough to do well at your job. Plan to have a babysitter on choir nights.
Other priorities for a university student might be gaining entrance to medical school, being a good student government leader, and staying fit. In this case, plan out your study times for the MCAT. Also, put your student government meetings in your calendar in advance. Map out your work out times. It is possible that at some times, like the week before your MCAT exam, you must focus even more on just one priority.

, When you set goals or want to change things about yourself, keep in mind that change does not happen overnight.Strive instead to set mini goals as you work towards a larger goal. Also realize that achieving your goal likely has a few consequences but will not necessarily impact your entire life. For instance, if you want to lose weight, focus on the health benefits of weight loss first. Do not automatically assume it will improve your personal relationships or overall happiness.For example, instead of saying, “I’m going to lose forty pounds this year,” try instead to lose one pound per week for one month. After this time, reassess your situation and make another mini goal.
If your goal is gaining entrance into medical school, set mini goals and tasks, like enrolling in organic chemistry, anatomy, molecular biology, and other courses. Then, focus on doing well in your courses. Eventually, add the goal of acing the MCAT. After this, you can add tasks like writing your essays, receiving recommendation letters, gathering transcripts, etc.

Ask yourself why you judge other people.,
Learn to see the middle ground of situations.,
Avoid stereotyping people.,
Ask yourself if your judgments are based on fact or emotion.,
Stop thinking in terms of what you “should” do.",How to Stop Feeling Self‐Righteous2," Think about which circumstances and emotions trigger feelings of self-righteousness in you. This can be a tough question to answer, so be honest with yourself. Often, people are judgmental when they’re feeling insecure or inferior about themselves.For instance, you might judge others for having a negative trait that you possess and dislike in yourself, even if you’re not consciously aware of it.
You might also judge others when you’re feeling envious of them for some reason.

, It’s all too easy to feel self-righteous when you see the world in black-and-white terms, but very few things in the world are all good or all bad. Get comfortable with the idea that your own way of thinking probably has some flaws, and different ways of thinking probably have some good points.Talking to lots of different people is one good way to adopt a more flexible mindset.
You can also practice debating with yourself. Think of an idea you support, like “Cats make better pets than dogs.” Then come up with some reasons people might disagree with you, like “Dogs are better pets for people who spend a lot of time outdoors.”

, Don’t overgeneralize about other people, or you might end up writing them off for no good reason. Get to know them as individuals instead. You might be surprised at how much variation there is between people, even within the same groups.For instance, if your workplace has just hired a new boss, don’t think, “She’s a manager – she must be uptight.” Wait and see what she’s like in person.

, When you feel strongly about something, take a second to fact-check it. Emotion is important, but if you don’t temper your feelings with facts, you might have some distorted thinking patterns. Knee-jerk judgments and thinking the worst are a couple examples of overly-emotional thinking.For instance, if your friend forgets your birthday and you think, “She doesn’t care about me. This is the end of our friendship,” you’re thinking the worst.

, Do you have clear-cut ideas about how you and other people should behave? “Should” is a subjective word, and having a long list of “shoulds” and “shouldn’ts” can make you feel self-righteous when other people don’t live the way you think they ought to. Replace “should” in your vocabulary with other words, like “could” or “want to.”For instance, instead of telling yourself “I should eat vegetables tonight,” tell yourself, “I could eat vegetables tonight.”
Or, instead of thinking, “Other people should do it this way,” adjust your thinking to, “Other people don’t do it this way. I wonder if I can find out why.”

"
"
Assert yourself without putting others down.,
Accept that people do things differently.,
Realize you’re probably not as superior as you think you are.,
Stop trying to change other people.",How to Stop Feeling Self‐Righteous3," When you get into a discussion or argument, stand up for yourself, but don’t try to tear other ideas down in the process. You don’t have to “win” every time you disagree with someone. Hear the other person out, and then politely explain why you disagree with them.Say something like, “I see where you’re coming from, but I still see it this way because…”
A lot of minor disagreements aren’t worth getting worked up about. Save your energy by agreeing to disagree.

, There’s no right way to accomplish most things in life, so don’t expect people to do things exactly like you. If your method works for you, and their method works for them, neither of you is wrong or better than the other.

For instance, it doesn’t really matter if you and your spouse clean the kitchen differently, as long as the end result is a clean kitchen.

, Most people overestimate their own abilities and talents. This can lead to feeling like you’re better than other people, even though it’s just an illusion much of the time. Be aware of your biases, and be honest with yourself about your bad qualities as well as your good ones., Self-righteous people often try to bring others around to their way of thinking, but this won’t work. No one should feel pressured to give up their own ideas and quirks for the sake of fitting somebody else’s preferences. Live out your ideals proudly yourself, and accept other people the way they are.For instance, if you’re passionate about the environment and your family isn’t, don’t nag them to become more like you. Instead, focus on what you can do yourself, such as volunteering for community clean-ups.

Consider how you think.,
Practice self-reflection and self-awareness.,

Be skeptical.,
Improvise.,
Be positive.,
Think ahead about the questions you might be asked.,
Listen.,
Stall for time.,

Stay calm.,

Keep an open mind.",How to Think on Your Feet," Introverts and extroverts think differently.Extroverts are more likely to “Do, Think, Do” pattern, while their introverted counterparts take more time to think before taking an action. No way is better than the other, but knowing how you personally think will help you streamline your own thinking patterns.;
, Self-awareness has been tied to leadership, and leadership often reflects a person’s ability to think on one’s feet.You can become more self-aware by practicing self-reflection techniques. Being more self-aware will help you better understand the environment around you, and make it easier to think of solutions or answer more quickly. Use a journal to write down your thoughts, feelings and reactions to mental stimuli throughout your day.
Understand how you solve problems by considering each step you take
Think about what emotions you feel during day to day tasks (I.e. Do you feel frustration while performing a specific task at work?) Think about why you might be feeling that emotion.

, To more effectively think on your feet, you need to gather as much information as possible about the situation you are in. One simple way of doing this is by asking questions about the task at hand. This will help you compile more information and help to educate you on a particular situation. Ask things like:


“I hear that you want a report written about this client. What are you concerned about, specifically?”
”You seem to be asking me about a project we finished last week. What was it that you wanted to know about it?”
”What do you mean by what you said?” (This can help you get not only a clearer understanding of what was said, but also give the speaker to think about what s/he wants from you).

, By being critical of presented information, you are more likely to pick up on weak points of a situation. This may help you to see solutions quicker.


Don’t take everything at face value. If you are asked to do a specific task or answer a specific question, try to gather as much facts about the situation before you make a decision. While the goal is to think quickly and on your feet, you still want to be accurate and understanding.
If you are asked to think on your feet by giving an answer to something that seems to be good to be true (for example, a sale) be skeptical! It may very well be too good to be true!

, Conversation is not scripted. While you should be mindful with what you say, you should also improvise to continue conversation. You can try a few technique that actors use onstage to keep a scene going.


Yes...and technique. If you are worried about continuing a conversation, try not to answer questions with a “yes” or a “no.” An example of this might be -- Question: “Did you enjoy your vacation to Italy?” Answer: “Yes...and we got to eat some really great food in Rome!” This takes a simple yes/no question and turns it into more an active conversation.Go with your gut. While second-guessing may come in handy in some situations, partaking in a conversation may not be the best area. Sometimes, it is best to go with your gut and say what is on your mind. This may not be the best solution for more loquacious speakers, but may work if you find yourself thinking too much before speaking.

, If you start a conversation with a compliment, or by saying something nice, your audience will be more likely to listen to what you have to say. For example:


”Question: What did you think about the movie?” Answer: “I really liked the music. Man, I really enjoy watching movies with someone who understands my love for Sci-Fi soundtracks!”
”Question: Do you think this new implementation will work for our clients?” “Answer: “I don’t think it is quite ready for launch, but I think the development team did a good job with the login code.”

, A common acronym “FAQ,” or “frequently asked questions,” shows that there are a common set of questions for any situation. Prepare for these FAQs if you know you’re going into a situation where you may have to think quickly.


At work, you might consider what questions will be asked at a meeting on a current project or about employees.
During an interview, you may be asked common questions like: “Where do you see yourself in five year” or “What do you feel are your biggest challenges.”At family gathers, you may be asked about your job or home life.

, Thinking on your feet may not necessarily be giving an answer quickly. To come up with a comprehensive answer to really impress your audience, you should actively listen to what they have to say.


When someone is speaking, try and pay attention to not only what they are saying it but how they are saying it. This includes body language and intonation. This will give you clues on the best way you should respond. For example: Is the person with you very frustrated? How might you respond to not escalate a situation?
If you find yourself having trouble focusing on someone when they speak, try and keep eye-contact with them or look at their face. This will help you focus on what the person is saying and make you appear attentive.

, If you need to gather your thoughts before you give your answer, there are a few ways that you can articulate your thoughts.


Repeat the question out loud to help jog your memory and help you think of an answer.
Narrow the focus to a conversation or answer that you do know a lot about. This might helpful if you are unsure how to answer or react to the whole problem at hand.

, Life is not often a solitary journey. If you have to think on your feet about a project, include others to help think along with you. After all, there is an old adage of: “Two heads are better than one.”


Always be polite about asking others to help. You want them to come into a project with an open mind and a willingness to think of new solutions.
Try not to subject others to your conclusions or opinions. You want others to come in with a different and new perspective, so that you may see all the options before making a decision.

, Stress can make you forget to do things or not react appropriately to a situation. Try and stay calm in situations where you know you will need to be thinking on your feet.


Try stress relieving methods like yoga or meditations to help with lingering stress in your life.
Count to ten or twenty if you find yourself getting frustrated or stressed in a situation. This might help calm you down.
Try breathing exercises. Breathing exercises are not only designed to help you with your overall health, but they can help calm you down as well.Doing exercises like “pursed lip breathing” (breathing deeply through pursed lips and exhaling) or “belly breathing” (taking a deep breath from your stomach and exhaling) can calm you down in a stressful situation.

, Studies have shown that students working at standing desks are both quicker and more accurate in answering questions.Taking frequent breaks from work to stand up and move around may actually help you think quicker; and, you will be doing so while literally being on your feet!

, Try not to go into a situation with a prepared answer or decision. This will turn your mind off to new possibilities or avenues. Keep an open mind and be receptive to new ideas. Try to not let personal beliefs or answers cloud a objective judgement. For example, if you are at work and get asked a tough question on a project, try to answer with facts instead of feelings.

Review your present moment feeling and experience.,
Add the Power of Intention to the formula.,
Let it go and get back to your normal activity of work, or play, or multi-slacking.

,
If still feeling the same later, again direct your attention--the light--to this feeling with the intention of transforming it.,
Make some notes.,
Move on to relationships.,
Review your notes.,
Next evening, record any changes.,
Recognize your hand in these changes.",How to Think Small and Actually Make Big Changes," Are you feeling negative or fearful about something? Is this feeling located somewhere in the body, e.g. in the stomach or your head? If so, direct your attention to this feeling and continue to keep your attention on the this feeling for a moment. Attention is Light; and Light is Alive. It is a powerful and elegant tool of transformation.;
, Intend that the negative feeling--whether it's fear, disappointment, embarrassment, confusion, etc, be transformed. You may hold your hand (or not) over your stomach or head wherever you are feeling the discomfort as you consider this.

,, Directing attention and sending light are identical and are done with a simple thought or words, such as, ""I send light to feeling disappointed or rejected"" or whatever the feeling demanding attention.

, In a relaxed moment, for instance just before going to sleep, make a note on a small pad about this feeling--as well as any other negative feelings you may be having. For instance, write ""I am feeling embarrassed about an incident at work today."" Then, have the intention of sending light to that feeling. You may do this with any feelings that presently concern you. Nothing is too small. Remember: ""If it is important to you, it is important."" It is all one. The small and the great; so let's start small.

, Now, review your present-time relationships, both professional and personal. This process can morph into fun and that is what life is about. It's about feeling happiness for yourself and everyone with whom you come in contact. Send light to any relationship that you wish to harmonize. Send light to your boss, employees, mother, father, friend, lover and even that stranger you met at Whole Foods. Then make a note on the pad and have a good nights' sleep. (Remember to have the intention of dreaming ever more beautiful dreams).

, The next morning--if you remember, review the notes; send light to them; and go about your business. Notice any changes during the day. Notice, for instance, if you are feeling more at ease and less embarrassment. Notice if there is more lively and friendly interaction with those relationships.

, Even the smallest change is progress. It is very important to recognize small changes.

, This is not to be denied. When you put your attention--your light--on feelings and relationships, you have the power to transform them. Now record these changes--however small--and express gratitude.

Take a quick look at your attitude toward this whole process.,
Understand your current metric for truth.,
See why you desire the truth -- or in fact, if you do.,
Gather how truth can be pretended to.,
Note that truth and illusion are not opposites.,
Embrace that lessons in truth, while seeming one-sided, usually are not.",How to Separate Truth from Illusion," Since you're still reading, it's fairly certain that an operation such as the title suggests interests you, but there are perfectly sane, grounded people who might run from such, dismissing it as philosophy, at least for them; you might correctly call their approach toward such unconscious, and their attitude dismissive (which doesn't preclude them from having a more highly developed sense of truth than you); the point is, it's a good idea to be honest with yourself in where you stand in this respect.


Basically begin examining, reducing, or removing some filters that constrain you here, as respects truth and illusion (which aren't exact opposites), and your individual interest in truth and illusion (or lack thereof).

Of course, your filters being who you are, in a real sense, makes this an ongoing exercise -- while many filters are conscious, many are not; and, while books have been written about finding the unconscious ones, an important distillation seems to be ""change your mind""...or a better way to print it might be ""alter your mind completely"", inevitably away from choices that support illusion, which, again distilling, seem to usually be selfish choices.
Understand why we have the cliche', ""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing"". People tend to accept the first piece of info on a new thing from a trusted source, and then exclude any new information, even contextually different information, that does not line up perfectly with their treasured ""knowledge"".
You should examine any new information you acquire about truth or illusion. Any new info will typically generate additional questions in your mind to fully grasp its potential. Beware answers that are too 'pat', even if you aren't able to immediately say why.
Pain is the best teacher; but seeking pain for the sake of truth can become gratuitous in itself, and becomes more illusion.
Hopefully, this step has gotten you to examine your premises a bit, and hopefully, you took some time with it, as this is where most people go wrong. The smallest mistake in premises is quickly magnified. For example, see how what may seem to be a perfectly acceptable (but inaccurate) premise, like ""I need money to survive"", can be fraught with illusion, from the beginning; you never had a chance to find any truth -- you were on a deceptive path the whole time.

;
, There really is only one measure, and that is the ""fruit"", or outcome of truth compared to illusion~at the end of the day, ""Will it go 'round in circles?"" is all that matters; and you can apply this metric to your next decision, and the one after that, as long as your premises are sound. Conversely, you may spend your whole life seeking to place truth under your finger, only to lift your finger, and find that truth is gone!


See that even Einstein, after his theories of relativity began to be proven and accepted, denied that any absolute truth had been reached; instead recognizing that even developing the model altered the perception of the truth in such a way that it merely became obscured differently.
The answer to, Is truth a rock, or a river? is yes.

, The truth could be a life changing perspective shift, or something that you don't know about, and just aren't interested enough to hear; see that it could be both, or anything in between.
The truth is rarely affected by your opinion of it. Although it can only be called a worthy endeavor to seek the truth, sometimes (or often), in your search, you will discover it in the least likely places.

, This is because truth is a reflection -- of Truth. You probably have so many versions of ""truth"" coming at you in a day, working this out has become unconscious for you, actually coloring your entire perspective -- it is one of your most fundamental filters, and it is in shades of grey.
This next part is tough to even put into words {the words want to double~back on themselves}, and requires a certain...letting go? detachment? of emotion, from things that can make people emotional; but, to the extent that you are able...


Examine how truth is manipulated (without dwelling on it), in a clinical kind of way, even your own manipulations of truth, to allow you to become more conscious of a (previously unconscious?) ""grey"" filter that you can now hopefully remove or replace more completely on demand; now it can be a kind of polarizer lens, that you may not need inside, or surrounded by safety. Then, the only limitation on how far out you can expand this circle is your willingness to change your mind.

This can cause quite a perspective shift. Unfortunately, ""polarizing"" (which is just what it is; a tension is introduced) is possibly as close as one can get to clarity here, in words, except to say that if you happen to know the right person, or people (sometimes it's a lifelong friend; Mid-easterners tend to have fewer pretensions than people in the ""developed"" world), the magnification that can occur when this is understood, even between only two people, causes a perspective shift that you can point to (even though you may never have thought about it in words).
You can suddenly become more centered for the knowing, and exude the possibility of anything more strongly -- and people are either going to be more or less attracted to that. you have just confronted them with the possibility of now. Comfortableness with your new perspective will end up being paramount over any contact, or relationship.



, Illusion is a reflection of truth; and they are ever, only determined by their fruit; which can be seen before the fact, as potential. Yup -- you saw it coming a mile away, hello? Where were you? This might be a central question implied by the title; so, finally, lets look at that.


Feeling qualified to read the potential in a situation, and not be fooled, can become a focus for people, and is just...more illusion! There are jobs that pay people to...propagate? this illusion; you may know some. There are tests to ""detect"" untruth in people -- you may have taken some. There are questions that, should you be so inclined, you could ask people; you have probably asked them, all your life.
Understand that these questions, while often useful in a practical way, are, at their core, illusion, and necessarily ignore a person's free will; they are an attempt to approach a reflection of truth -- the ""verbal"" truth. Just as it is true that the most vetted person can commit atrocities, the least dependable can reform, or even show a different side, based on their feelings or understanding in a particular situation -- a thief may not steal from you, seeing more to be gained by refraining (that vision can be transplanted from you). Otherwise your free will would have to be considered just an illusion generator; which an immature, unbridled free will pretty much is. ""Free will"" is why children have babysitters.
There is a saving flip side here; free will is always going to have a voice in you, that you are free to ignore completely. You are not your ideas. Free will is that weird idea that makes you ashamed (but is perfectly normal -- it's possibility).
You make a choice when you act, not when you think; although you also make choices about what to think about, or dwell on. Thinking can quite get in the way, sometimes, however:
The genius Minkowski, a professor of Einstein's, ""demonstrated that a limitless number of different descriptions of the same phenomenon could be provided by a single equation, through the introduction, in a certain way, of time as a fourth variable...the result was an equation which dealt with the ""real"" world, of which the differing descriptions as seen from differently moving bodies were but partial and incomplete expressions...much as to the wolf and the dog of George Lewes, 'the external world seems a continuum of scents.'"" RW Clark EINSTEIN The Life and Times
This from a scientist, in a freaky echo of the Hebrew Dabhar.

, Thus, two-edged sword. The only difference in someone who feels duped in a matter, possibly after the fact, and the one who recognized the possibility of manipulations by another's free will, and still acquiesced to a request (for instance), is perspective. Free will exists in ""doo doo occurs"", and is it's own lesson -- and it can be harnessed, or given free reign; apocalypse.

Allow yourself to grieve.,
Do what you want to do.,
Cut off communication with your ex.,
Freewrite.,
Don’t distract yourself.,
Set goals.,
Embrace good relationships and distance yourself from bad ones.,
Embrace your present.",How to Rediscover Yourself1," In order to find yourself again after a breakup, you have to first let go both of the person you were during the relationship and of the relationship itself.


Give yourself the time you need to grieve. There’s no actual way to circumvent the grieving process. You can try to shove your feelings aside and avoid them, but they always get out eventually.
Bottling up your feelings and refusing to deal with them not only prevents you from moving on but makes those feelings more devastating when they make their way to the surface (and they always will).;
, Part of rediscovering yourself after the end of a relationship is remembering the things you--just you--like to do.Reconnect with yourself by doing what you enjoy, whether it’s going for a run, taking a long bath, watching terrible TV, etc.
But don’t let “doing what you want” turn into wallowing. Don’t use it to avoid dealing with feelings or to hide from the world--that will just keep you stuck where you are rather than help you get where you want to go.
Instead, give yourself the time you need to recover--it may be a few days or a few weeks--but be honest with yourself about when it’s time to start moving forward again. Don’t get stuck.

, If you and your ex-partner are on good terms, you don’t have to cut them out of your life permanently, but you will need to cut them off temporarily (at least a few months) while you work on yourself.If the relationship ended badly and having contact with your ex only dredges up painful memories, cutting off communication will allow you to start to heal.
Even if the relationship didn’t end badly, you need to spend time with yourself, completely apart from an ex-partner. Otherwise you won’t really be spending time with who you are; instead, you’ll be constantly reminded of who you used to be.

, If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed with thoughts and emotions, try freewriting as a way to get yourself back on track.Freewriting involves sitting down and writing out whatever comes to mind, stream-of-consciousness style. Don’t try to censor what comes out or make it sound nice--or even grammatical.
Decide a specific amount of time to spend freewriting--maybe 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 15 minutes--and write without stopping.
Freewriting gives you a chance to vent your thoughts and feelings without trying to make sense of them first, which is what can lead to feeling overwhelmed. Freewriting also lets you get perspective on thoughts and feelings that may otherwise feel all-consuming.

, We often lose touch with ourselves when we allow other people and things to distract us. Spend some time being quiet with yourself, free of other distractions.It may sound simple, but if you want to get back in touch with who you are, you’re going to first have to stop avoiding yourself.


Start spending time with yourself by keeping your attention on what you’re doing in the moment. If you’re cleaning the bathroom, clean the bathroom. Don’t play music or leave the TV on or do anything else that will take you outside of yourself.
It may initially be uncomfortable, particularly if you’re a person who’s in the habit of distracting themselves whenever possible. Usually, those distractions are meant to keep you from being inside your own head, feeling lonely, feeling vulnerable, feeling sad, etc.
Rather than trying to distract yourself from whatever you’re feeling, just acknowledge the feeling and let it be. When you stop fighting it, the feeling usually resolves itself in time.

, At a time when you feel lost and without direction, it’s particularly important to set goals that will give you a sense of direction and purpose.


Set both large, long-term goals, and smaller, achievable short-term goals.
For your larger goals, think about where you want to be in a year and in five years. Set up goals accordingly and write them down--writing them down puts them into a tangible form you can come back to and remind yourself of each day.
For example, if you want to be living in Paris in five years or to have won a marathon, write it down. Make it part of your daily check-in with yourself and actively pursue opportunities that can help you advance towards that goal.
For your shorter goals, choose things that are achievable as well as important. You might, for example, set a short-term goal of going to the gym 3 times a week for a month or meditating twice a week for six weeks. Meeting short-term goals will give you the sense of progress and accomplishment you’ll need to continue improving and moving forward.

, When trying to rediscover yourself, it helps to have positive, loving, and supportive people around you.Distance yourself from any negative relationships, whether it be a friend or partner who needs to be convinced in order to love and support you or a family member who continually criticizes you. Those relationships will only set you back.
If there’s a negative person in your life whom you can’t avoid, like a boss, co-worker, or close family member, work on distancing yourself mentally and emotionally rather than physically. Resolve not to engage them and to recognize any negativity they direct at you as a reflection of their own shortcomings rather than of yours.
Seek out people who love and accept you as you are and are willing to support you. Spend time with the people who make you feel energized and who help you feel more in touch with who you really are.

, As you learn to focus on the current moment rather than dwell on painful memories or distract yourself from your own feelings, you’ll become realize that past moments don’t have to define you.


What’s in the past only defines what you want it to, so allow yourself to keep what’s past in the past and value yourself for who you are and who you’re becoming in the present moment.

Reflect on the changes you want to make.,
Create a game plan for making those changes.,
Stay motivated.,
Share your plans to reinvent yourself with others.",How to Reinvent Yourself1," Before you jump into reinventing yourself, you need to slow down, reflect, and spend some time writing down your thoughts. Ask yourself why you want to reinvent yourself and what you want your future to look like. Make a list of all the things you want to change, and all the ways that you can begin to do so.Write down the big changes you want to make. Maybe you want to lose a considerable amount of weight; maybe you want to learn to be generous; maybe you want to go from working on Wall Street to being a scuba diving instructor. Whatever big changes you want to make, write them down, and make a list of how you can go about accomplishing those goals.
Write down the small changes, too. Though reinventing yourself takes big leaps, Rome wasn't built in a day, and the new you won't be, either. Make a list of small things that can slowly help you build up to your new life. This could be learning to meditate in the morning, volunteering in your community for just an hour a week, or eating more fruits and vegetables every day.;
, Once you've written down the changes that will give you a new future, write down a reasonable goal for a time when you can say, ""Yeah, I accomplished this thing."" It could be months, or even a year or more away. But once you pick a date, you'll be closer to your goal. You can make goal dates for the small stuff; for example, you could say, ""I will read three new books by the end of the month."" Making a plan is a part of the commitment.


Write your goal dates into your calendar, just like you would with any other commitment.

, If you want to get closer to reinventing yourself, then you need to stay positive and motivated throughout this journey, even if you're not feeling energetic or hopeful on a particular day. Staying mentally strong means winning half the battle to becoming a better person. Here are some ways to motivate yourself:Surround yourself with images that remind you of your vision for your future. If your plan is to devote yourself to gardening full-time and to expand your property, then surround yourself with potted plans and images of beautiful gardens.
Write about your goals in a journal. Take at least 10 minutes out of your day to write about how close you are to achieving your goals, and chronicling your process as you make the big changes. You'll feel more confident about your goals once you reflect.
Write down at least three reasons why you want to reinvent yourself on an index card. Carry it around with you at all times so that you can pull it out and stay pumped in a moment of weakness.

, Reinventing yourself will be much easier if your loved ones, coworkers, or any other people in your life know about your decision. Sit down with all of the important people in your life and tell them about the change you want to make, and ask for their support during this period of adjustment. They should understand that you're serious about changing and should help motivate and encourage you as you go through this process.


If you're active on social media, share with your online community as well. The more people who know about your plans, the more indebted you'll feel to making this serious commitment.
Make sure your loved ones take you seriously. They shouldn't try to draw you in to the ""old you"" that you want to shed.

Take stock of what feels to be missing.,
Look closely at the people and events that may have contributed to losing part of yourself.,
Begin a mindfulness routine.,
Embrace good relationships and distance yourself from bad ones.,
Spend time with yourself.,
Set goals.,
Be patient.",How to Rediscover Yourself2," Take time to reflect on what part of you seems to be missing and on what might have contributed towards your losing it. Helpful questions to think about--or, even better, write about--include:Who am I currently? Do I like who I am?
What part of myself seems to be missing? When did it go missing? Why did it go missing?
What am I longing for?
What were my dreams when I was younger? What were my passions?
What do I wish my life looked like right now? In a year? In five years?
What are my values?
What do I cherish most?
What makes me feel happy and satisfied?
Use your answers to these questions to help you figure out where things aren’t working well for you in your life. For example, if your values are courage, honesty, and kindness but you find yourself in a job or surrounded by people who value money and success at any cost, the conflict between what you value and what you’re surrounded by may be part of what’s making you feel alienated from your true self.

, Sit down and go carefully through your memories, looking for what may have led you to abandon a part of yourself.


For example, were you forced to abandon the imaginative part of yourself when, as a child, your parents insisted your fantasies and daydreams were useless?
Think about anything that had a strong physical, mental, or emotional impact on you. Begin with the major ones that come most easily to mind, then move on to smaller, less expected ones. Factors to consider include:
Particular events (both positive and negative)
Personal relationships (friends, family, partners)
Jobs you’ve held
Life transitions
Accidents
Medical issues
Childhood memories (both positive and negative)
Loss
Being forced into an uncomfortable role
Being forced to lie to or about yourself
Remember that the point of this reflection isn’t so you can blame past people or events; rather, it’s to allow you to understand how and why you lost a part of yourself so you can start working to get it back.

, When it feels like part of you is missing, mindfulness practices help you reconnect with your center.


Practices like meditation, yoga, and tai chi are all good options for practicing mindfulness and connecting with who you are at a deeper level.

, When trying to rediscover yourself, it helps to have positive, loving, and supportive people around you.Distance yourself from any negative relationships, whether it be a friend or partner who needs to be convinced in order to love and support you or a family member who continually criticizes you. Those relationships will only set you back.
If there’s a negative person in your life whom you can’t avoid, like a boss, co-worker, or close family member, work on distancing yourself mentally and emotionally rather than physically. Resolve not to engage them and to recognize any negativity they direct at you as a reflection of their own shortcomings rather than of yours.
Seek out people who love and accept you as you are and are willing to support you. Spend time with the people who make you feel energized and who help you feel more in touch with who you really are.

, It can be easy to lose track of yourself when you avoid spending time in your own head. It’s tempting to drown out potentially troubling thoughts or emotions by never setting aside time to simply be quiet, without music playing, without other people around, without a book, without the internet, etc.


If you want to reconnect with yourself, you’re going to need to stop avoiding your own mind and feelings. Granted, it will probably be uncomfortable at first to sit down quietly and just be with yourself for a while. It might bring up thoughts or feelings you’ve been trying to avoid, but once you acknowledge them and stop trying to run away from them, they suddenly become much more manageable and less intimidating.Take 5-10 minutes each day to just sit quietly. It might be on your living room couch, on a rocking chair on your front porch, or underneath your favorite tree. Wherever it is, start to reconnect with yourself and to enjoy your own company.

, When you set goals for yourself that you truly want to accomplish--rather than having goals set for you by others--you feel more connected to yourself and more fulfilled in your life.Set both long- and short-term goals. For long-term goals, think about how you want to be in a year from now or in five years from now. Do you want to be more forgiving of yourself and others? Make that a long-term goal. Do you want to feel satisfied with your life and work? Make that a long-term goal.
Use short-term goals to help you work towards your longer-term goals and to help you feel a sense of accomplishment and progress. Set achievable goals that will help you get closer to meeting your long-term goals. If, for example, your long-term goal is to feel calm and at peace, set achievable short-term goals that will help get you there, like meditating four times a week for a month or writing in a journal three times a week for two months.
Write down your goals and place them somewhere you’ll see them every day so you’ll be reminded of what it is you’re working toward.

, The work of reflecting on and rediscovering lost parts of yourself can be challenging and time-consuming.


Don’t be discouraged if you don’t have an immediate revelation.
Be patient with yourself and allow yourself to be curious without feeling like you to have to find a particular answer.
Understand that rediscovering and reclaiming a lost part of yourself is an ongoing process that you work on each day--it doesn’t happen all at once.

Think back to a time when you felt happy and like “yourself.” Remember key moments when you felt happy and thriving--what were those moments like and what aspects do they share?Pursue things and activities that connect you back to those times when you felt vibrant and fulfilled.

,
Pay attention to what sparks your interest.,
Notice the things that upset you.,
Notice when you’re feeling inauthentic.,
Keep a journal.,
Begin a mindfulness routine.,
Embrace good relationships and distance yourself from bad ones.,
Have an emergency go-to.",How to Rediscover Yourself3,", As you go through your day, pay close attention to the things that make you perk up or spark your interest. When you pursue things that you truly enjoy--rather than things you have to do--you feel more connected to yourself and more fulfilled in your activities.You may find yourself particularly drawn to and inspired by the times you get to use your creativity when writing emails or thoughts in a journal. Or you might find that your interest always piques when hearing someone talk about quantum physics on the TV or radio.
Whatever it is that draws your interest, note it down and make a point of pursuing it later. Check out books on the topic, research it online, watch a documentary, etc.

, Try to look beyond minor irritations or pet peeves like traffic or people who talk during movies--pay attention to the things that consistently evoke more than passing irritation. You’ll likely notice a common thread between the things that tend to elicit such negative emotions, and you can use that knowledge to narrow down what’s at the root of your discontent.


If, for example, you find that you get upset when people are hurtful to others, you might take from that that you need kind and caring people around you to thrive and/or that helping people might be a fulfilling activity for you.
Or if you find that you become irritable if you’ve gone some time without having a creative outlet (singing, dancing, writing, drawing, etc.), you might conclude that you need to have a consistent creative outlet in your life to feel satisfied.
Also bear in mind that we often judge others most harshly based on the things we ourselves are insecure about. If you tend to judge people who drive luxury cars as being superficial and wasteful, think about your own insecurities and vulnerabilities around being proud, showy, or extravagant. What issues do those things raise for you and why?

, Pay attention to the times when you get the uncomfortable feeling of being inauthentic, whether it’s in what you’re saying, doing, or thinking.Make a mental, or even better, a physical, note of what you’re doing that feels inauthentic.
Then think carefully about what fears and anxieties are motivating that behavior. What’s driving the inauthentic behavior? Is it fear of rejection? Boredom with the people around you? Feeling unappreciated?
Think about ways you can circumvent the beliefs or anxieties driving you to be inauthentic. If it’s a fear of rejection, for example, work on really accepting and appreciating yourself for who you are. When you truly accept yourself, you won’t be driven by a fear of others’ rejection and can start to be more authentic around others.

, Writing in a journal gives you an opportunity to reflect inwardly and to keep a record of those reflections so that you can notice important recurring themes.


Write anything you like in your journal. Be sure to give a bit of space each time to thinking about what it is you wish you had more of in your life, whether that be time with family or more opportunities to paint.
Try to write in the journal on a regular basis. The more regularly you write in the journal, the easier it will be to eventually find common themes and insights.
Once you’ve built up a number of entries, look back over them and consider whether there are any commonalities in the things you wish you could do more often, in the things that bother you, etc.
Work on trying to find solutions to the things that upset you and to find ways to incorporate more of the things that revitalize you into your life.

, When you start to feel inauthentic to yourself, mindfulness practices help you reconnect with your center.


Practices like meditation, yoga, and tai chi are all good options for practicing mindfulness and connecting with who you are at a deeper level.

, When trying to rediscover yourself, it helps to have positive, loving, and supportive people around you.Distance yourself from any negative relationships, whether it be a friend of partner who needs to be convinced in order to love and support you or a family member who continually criticizes you. Those relationships will only set you back.

Resolve not to engage them and to recognize any negativity they direct at you as a reflection of their own shortcomings rather than of yours.
Seek out people who love and accept you as you are and are willing to support you. Spend time with the people who make you feel energized and who help you feel more in touch with who you really are.

, On the days when you feel frazzled and just can’t seem to hang on to your real self, have a few emergency strategies ready to go. Some emergency measures you can take when you feel lost include:Listening to a playlist of songs that bring you back to your sense of “you.” It doesn’t have to be an extravagantly long playlist; in fact, it’s better if you choose just the handful of songs that are most meaningful to you. Then, when you find yourself feeling spun out, listen to those songs to re-ground yourself.
Having a go-to person. Having a close and trusted friend or family member as a go-to can help you re-center yourself when you’re feeling lost. Let that person in on what you’re trying to do and ask them to be a resource for you when you need it--and offer to return the favor.
Being honest. If you find yourself feeling like you’re being fake, know that there’s always one sure-fire way to defeat fakeness: honesty. When you catch yourself being inauthentic, take a breath, take a step back, and ask yourself “what do I really want right now?” and/or “what am I really feeling right now?” Answer that question for yourself and then bring that feeling to the forefront and let it guide you.

",How to Recognize Fundamentalist Thinking1," The use of the word ""fundamentalist"" is often intended to denote a certain point of view, but ""fundamentalist"" may be used in a negative connotation, being pejorative (derisive) of particular scientific, political or religious concepts.

, This is not to indicate that fundamentalism is ""on-/off-beat"", centered versus eccentric (different) or ""good"" versus ""bad"".

, As, some of the unflattering literature on fundamentalism was written by people who consider themselves quite religious but who have differing doctrines and understandings. Confusing or mixing the two concepts will lead to misconceptions in identifying fundamentalist expression and activity (behavior). Judging the fundamentalist harshly could lead to social stigma, discrimination, prejudice, bias and possibly hatred.

Improve the way you think.,
Improve the way you interact with others.,
Improve your health.",How to Reinvent Yourself2," Reinvention starts at the mind. You won't be able to reinvent yourself if you're stuck in the same old thinking patterns. While you may have many healthy thinking patterns, you could always improve some of the aspects of your thinking as you move forward in your journey. Here are some great places to start:



Think more positively. If you find yourself often picturing the worst thing that could happen in any scenario, thinking that everyone is mad at you because you've made a mistake, or convinced that nothing you do can improve your life, then it's time to make a concerted effort to be a more positive thinker every single day. Start by pinning down your negative thoughts and practicing positive responses to assure you that you're going down the right path.
Improve your thinking about the future. Many people are filled with anxiety and dread when they think of the future -- but not you! At least, not anymore. Make sure that any thoughts of the future, however uncertain, put you in a happy and excited place.
Improve the way you think about yourself. Gain confidence and learn to love the person you really are, how you look, and what you do. Without confidence, you won't have the ability to change.
Improve the way you view your situation in life. Learn to be more grateful for the things you do have instead of focusing on the things you want.

, Though you may think you're a model mother, significant other, or friend, there is always room for improvement. If you want to reinvent yourself, it's time to change the way that you interact with others -- whether it's the mailman or your husband of thirty years. Here are some things you can do:


Be a better friend. Take the time to listen to your friends more, to help them with their problems, and to do little favors that will light up your friends' days. Work on being less selfish and more caring toward your friends.
Be a better significant other. Take the time to be more romantic and more adventurous, and to tell your loved one how you really feel every single day.
Be a better employee. Whether you're the boss, or working on the ground floor, take the time to get to know your coworkers and to be kind and helpful.
Be a better citizen. Take the time to be generous and to volunteer in your community, whether it's to teach children how to read at your local library, or to clean up your community park every Saturday.

, Unless you're a complete health guru, it's likely that you can take some steps to improve your overall health. Improving your body will lead to major improvements in your mind, and you will be better equipped to deal with daily problems and will feel more positive and energetic along the way. Here are some great ways to improve your health:


Find a new exercise routine. Take a yoga, salsa dancing, or karate class, and fall in love with the new activity as well as its health benefits.
Take time for a few 20-minute walks a few times a week. Taking walks will not only improve your health, but it will give you time to reflect on your new vision for your future.
Be a healthy eater. Learn to eat three balanced meals a day, filled with healthy carbs, lean proteins, and plenty of fruits and vegetables.
Do whatever you can to reduce stress in your life -- this will have numerous health benefits. Take the time to unwind for half an hour before you go to bed, minimize your extra commitments, reduce caffeine intake, and try to eliminate as many stress-causing factors in your life as you can.

"
Improve your education.,
Read more.,
Learn from others.,
Learn to focus like a laser.",How to Reinvent Yourself3," If you really want to reinvent yourself, then you need to understand that reinvention is a never-ending process. Though you may reach your set goals, if you want to be an improved, well-rounded person, you should recognize that there is always more to learn. This will keep you from being complacent and will continue to drive your hunger for knowledge. Here are some traditional and non-traditional ways to get an education:


If you've been thinking about going back to school for the last few years, it's time to put down your reservations and apply, no matter how old you are or how insecure you feel. You should enroll in courses at your local community college or a university to improve yourself, especially if you need a more formal education to reach your career goals.
Read works by experts on subjects you want to know about. You can learn a lot about almost any given topic by getting the information straight from the horse's mouth. You can make a goal of learning about one completely new subject each week.
Travel. Seeing the world in all its glory can help you change your perspective and will help you become more open-minded and learn about how other parts of the world function on a daily basis.
Learn a new language. Taking a language class in person, online, or through a textbook can help you expand your brain and learn to think in more than one set way.

, Reading is the key to expanding your learning. If you don't read, you won't be able to gain knowledge and work to become your best self. You can read a variety of materials, from newspapers, fiction, historical nonfiction, memoirs, or science journals. Anything you read, as long as it comes from a credible source, will help you build knowledge and become a more well-rounded person. Here are some great things to read:


Read philosophy. Philosophy will expand your worldview and will show that the world is more complicated than it seems. It will also open up more ways of viewing your daily life, and will help you improve the vision you have of the future you.
Read international fiction. Reading works by authors from different countries will help you gain an understanding of how people live on the others side of the world. Reading about other countries is also a great way to travel without moving from your couch.
Read the newspaper. Make a goal of reading the newspaper for just 10-15 minutes a day, so that you feel more complete as you follow current events and have a stronger sense of how the world works.
Read the classics. Indulge in Tolstoy, Dickens, or Poe, and you'll feel like you have a more well-informed knowledge of the history of literature. And after all, literature can teach you a lot about how to live, and many classics are about a central character who is trying to reinvent himself.

, The people around you can be just as useful of a resource as a college class or a classic novel. Take the time to talk to the people around you to see what valuable knowledge they can impart, and how they can give you the skills you need to fully tackle your reinvention goals. Here are a few ways to learn from others:


Ask a close friend to teach you a skill. If you have a friend who cooks like a world-class chef, dances like a professional, or just really loves watercolor painting, ask if the friend can spend an afternoon with you to teach you the ropes.
Ask your colleagues for work-related help. Talk to people who have been working at your company longer than you and ask a few questions that can help improve your productivity or the way you approach your work. And if you're looking for a career change, talk to some people who are experts in your new career of choice, and see what advice they can give you.
Talk to your older relatives. Take the time to talk to your older relatives, not only for life advice, but to learn more about your family history. You don't want to be left with tons of questions about your family's past when it's too late.

, Almost every person has trouble focusing at one point or another, and the better you are at focusing, the more equipped you'll feel to gain knowledge and to work towards achieving your goals. No matter what you may think, any person can improve his focus if he just puts in the hard work. Here are a few ways to do it:


Be more organized. Keep a clear work space, a logical filing system, and a decluttered home. If you know where everything is all the time, it'll be easier for you to concentrate on any given tasks.
Learn to avoid distractions. Spend less time browsing the Internet, watching shows that don't matter, or texting your friends nonstop instead of just making one phone call. Push away all of the things that are keeping you from accomplishing your goals.
Let yourself take a break. Part of focusing means taking breaks after every hour of intense work. If you don't let your mind rest from time to time, it will be harder from you to accomplish your goals, whether it's to finish writing a paper or to change your entire outlook.

"
"
Change the way you look.,
Change the way you talk.,
Change what you do.,
Change your environment.",How to Reinvent Yourself4," If you want to reinvent yourself, then changing your physical appearance can help you feel more like a completely different person. You won't feel completely reinvented if you look in the mirror and see the same old thing you always see. Here are some ways to change the way you look:


Consider a dramatic change to your hair. If you have long hair, why not chop it just above your chin? Sick of the same brown hair you've had since the beginning of time? Go blonde.
Change the way you dress. Have you always gone grungy? Go for a sleek look. Have you always been preppy? Try the hipster trend.
Improve your body language. Your body language is a big part of your appearance, so you can work on standing taller, keeping your arms at your sides instead of crossed over your chest, and making eye contact when you talk.
Smile more. Smiling will give you a healthy glow and will make you look like a more positive person.

, The things you say and how you say them can say a lot about you, so you should reinvent the way you engage in everyday conversation to be your best self. If you speak differently, you'll begin to feel like a different person. Here are some ways to change the way you talk:Change the amount of talking that you do. If you're a big talker, take the time to listen more and talk less, and you'll find that you'll learn a lot more. If you're shy, try to talk more often in everyday conversation, and you'll find that you have more to contribute than you think.
Change how you talk. If you're a fast-talker, take the time to slow down and articulate every word. If you talk softly, work on talking louder and with more confidence.
Change the things you talk about. If you spend more time grousing or complaining than you'd like, work on talking about the positive things in your life, and the things that make you happy.
Gossip less. Though it's tough to stop gossiping completely, try to avoid saying bad things about people behind their backs, making fun of people, or just generally being not nice. You'll feel much better about yourself if you find yourself saying nice things about people when they aren't there.

, If you really want to reinvent yourself, then you have to change many of the things you do on a daily basis. This can be anything from your work to your eating routine. Here are some ways to change the things you do as a way of reinventing yourself:


Change your career. Part of reinventing yourself can mean to change your career path into something that makes you more fulfilled and happy.Change your hobbies. Pick up a completely new hobby or interest, such as bird watching, surfing, writing poetry, or training for marathons. Do what you have to do to make yourself feel new.
Change who you hang out with. Try making new friends, turning new acquaintances into friends, and getting to know complete strangers. This will make you feel even more like a new person.

, Changing your environment can help you feel like a completely new person, get in a new headspace, and just feel closer to achieving your goals for your future self. Here are some great ways to change your environment:


If you really want to reinvent yourself, consider moving to a completely new place where you don't know anybody. This may be scary, but this will make it easier for you to disconnect from your old self.
Move into a new home. If you're sick of your old apartment but have been too lazy to move to a new place, now's the time. Living in a place that makes you feel comfortable and different can help you transition more smoothly into your new skin.
Go on vacation. Though a vacation isn't a good permanent solution to any problem, taking a week or two to travel in a new place, whether it's a foreign country or a national park a few hours away from home, will help you clear your head and better complete your vision of your future.
Renovate your space. If you can't move and don't have time for a vacation, try painting your walls a new color, moving your furniture around, and throwing out or donating any furniture or clothes you don't need. You can change your space enough to make it feel like a new environment.
Consider working abroad. This is a dramatic move, but it will certainly help you reinvent yourself even faster.

",How to Recognize Fundamentalist Thinking2," Following is a list of some of the different uses of the term throughout history:Religious Fundamentalism:

Fundamentalist Christianity recognizes an adherence to a basic set of Biblical, fundamental principles to preserve unity and harmony among believers. These fundamentals include a literal interpretation of the Bible as the divinely inspired and infallible Word of God and the necessity of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ's atonement. Some consider Christian fundamentalism to be identical with evangelicalism. Jesus said -- ""...go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age. (Matthew 28:19,20 NIV). While Christian fundamentalists hold unswervingly to their basic tenets, they encourage open-minded study of the Bible, intellectual discussion of ""true"" (Biblical) versus ""false"" (non-Biblical) doctrines and whether some traditional practices are/are-not Biblical.
Islamic Fundamentalism:This includes advocating return to the ""fundamentals"" of Islam: The Quran and The Sunnah. Definitions vary as some insist that Islamic belief requires all Muslims be fundamentalists and is, also, a term used by outsiders to describe perceived trends within Islam; whereas, some figures of Islamic fundamentalism may be termed ""Islamists"". Some say that ""Radical Islam"" is the term for movements beginning in the 1920s -- and that, some say, is not a return to the more historic fundamentals.Jewish Fundamentalism.
Mormon Fundamentalism.
Hindu Fundamentalism.
Atheistic Fundamentalists. - Observe atheistic fundamentalism as whether there is a strong disdain toward those who espouse religion, and some would say, a dogmatic opposition to what appears to be religious tradition. Some atheist thinkers, such as Richard Dawkins, argue that no such fundamentalism exists, and that the term is meant to be disparaging of atheists' concepts.


Non-religious Fundamentalism:

Political Conservatism (Fundamentalism) including being ""strict constructionist"", being a ""constitutional originalist"" to follow the traditional meaning of the constitution and the basic law, not some modern, re-formed meaning.
Scientism (Fundamentalism). - Consider that beginning in the nineteenth century, some scientists stated scientism as the view that all aspects of the universe are knowable through the methods of the scientist and that advances in all forms of knowledge could be made through scientific progress; whereas, philosophy had historically relied on intuition and other modes of thought as the source of knowledge and as equal or preferred to empirical investigation.Market Fundamentalism. - check to verify whether there is a strong belief in laissez-faire, free-market systems of financial regulation. The recession was not due to regulation, but to schemes including an over-trusted kind of certificate called the ""Collateralized debt obligation""; this is a type of structured asset-backed security (ABS) whose value and payments are supposed to be derived from a portfolio of fixed-income underlying assets(but many were like bad mutual-fund shares). CDOs securities are split into different risk classes, but many bad ""CDOs"" were over-rated conglomerations of some good preferred stocks, bonds and too much of over-valued bad mortgages as some trillions of dollars of poor ""investments"" sold around the world -- and the related, bad-mortgages were a major cause of the banking crisis, also devastating to the economy. Some left-economists declared that the global financial crisis, so caused, of 2008 destroyed market fundamentalist's ideas of free markets. This expression, ""market fundamentalism,"" was promulgated by George Soros in his 1998 book, The Crisis of Global Capitalism. As is ""atheistic fundamentalism"", ""market fundamentalism"" is often used as a pejorative to designate perceived, ideological dogma with which one may disagree.

;
, Do not go looking for ""signs"" in persons to prove they are indeed fundamentalists after you question their being so. Instead, only use this as a reference. In other words -- if, by chance, unintentionally, you encounter some of the indicators in a person's expressed views, look for the other indications very closely, trying to prove that they are not there! If you fail to eliminate them, you can relatively well identify the person as fundamentalist.

"
Understand that ""strict adherence to, or absolute belief in"" any set of basic ideas or principles is fundamentalism, in essence for any given conceptual system as delineated in detail below:]

Watch for ""absolute beliefs in certain ideas"", and ""not desiring to discuss questioningly with doubts"" about concepts.",How to Recognize Fundamentalist Thinking3," Beware though, that this can be easily misinterpreted; for instance, if the discussion is allowing for each other to be right, do not try to prove the other wrong.
Expect defensive positions (to show that one is ""not"" wrong) when a discussion propagates towards opposing or criticizing one of the followers or tenants of their beliefs.
Understand their scripted/set views (on concepts) that they consider true (holy, true scripturally, historically and current in religious concepts -- or considered essential, empirical and observable in the case of scientific or political fundamentalism).
Understand voluminous and defined behavior are often indicators because the concepts must be firmly advocated, and the advocate ready to give an account.
See how the importance of fundamental concepts is magnified and focused because of the desire to be sure to adhere to them. So, then taking the scriptures as literally true is ""it"", e.g.: ""the Way, the Truth and the Life"" leaves little doubt of this being a straight and narrow way. But trusting God for grace by faith is fundamental (in Christianity), not perfectionism!
See quoting and following authority such as of the Bible or of leaders as indicative, of a system of fundamentalism which is definitive in nature; following this pattern:


You must believe in A, and if you do not believe in A, then you are not a B (allowing no exceptions). An example of this without letter symbolism could be: ""You must believe in baptism by water, and if you do not believe in it, then you are not a Christian.""

Read the Prolegomena first, or at the same time.,
Consider reading Kant's lecture notes on logic.,
Don't expect a profound spiritual or aesthetic experience.,
Choose your text with care.,
Don't skip the Introduction.,
Read every word of whatever parts you do read.,
Read for context and emphasis: does Kant mean ""synthetic unity of the manifold"", ""synthetic unity of the manifold"", or ""synthetic unity of the manifold""?,
Read aloud!,
Question everything you read.,
Take notes.",How to Read Kant's Critique of Pure Reason," That book, which is both clear and short, is Kant's own account of what the Critique was meant to accomplish and what prompted him to write it. If you read the Prolegomena and think he's barking up the wrong tree, put off the Critique... until you change your mind. (The last bit doesn't apply to people taking a class, of course.);
, They can be surprisingly useful because they show how he believed philosophical thought should be organized and expressed. Regardless of whether you take his ""logical method"" seriously, no one denies that Kant took it very seriously, and once you can recognize it in the Critique, many passages become much easier to follow.

, Contrary to his reputation, Kant is an excellent writer, but he's not trying to take you to a higher level here, or even to entertain you. At all.

, Abridgments are tempting, but every sentence of the original is there for a reason. Make sure you have the full texts of both the first and second editions.

, Key claims are made there, and key terms defined. Starting with the first chapter of the main text (""Transcendental Aesthetic"") can feel like running headfirst into a brick wall. (It is all right to ignore the Prefaces on a first reading.)

, It's possible to skim through one of Kant's arguments and get an accurate feeling for the meaning, but the details of the argument do matter, because he very often appeals to them later on -- and also because he is trying to prove his theses, not to make them appealing or lull you into adopting them unawares.

, It's not that the concepts are different, but the author is pointing out something different about the concept depending on where and how he uses the phrase. Take the phrases, sentences, paragraphs out of context and they all sound like the same kind of hollow, pretentious, narrow-minded nonsense, but in fact there's a thread of logical connections by which they all hang together as more than the sum of their parts.

, Believe it or not, this can help you trace out that thread of argument, chiefly by locating the place where the emphasis falls.

, You'll usually find that the statement was justified earlier (or, in some cases, will be explained in the next paragraph). Not only is this the safest way to read a book of Western philosophy, but it is the best way to restore the logical connections of the text once you have lost track of them, which will often happen.

, This probably goes without saying.

Look for the Power of Gradual in your everyday activities.,
Understand why the Power of Gradual works.,
Be ready for the surprise.,
Be mindful of this tendency to be surprised.,
Remember the Power of Gradual.",How to Respect the Power of Gradual," Make a tap leak ever so slightly—maybe a drop every half minute or so. Put an empty bucket below it. Now, go on with your day. Forget about the tap. Actually, you don’t need to be told to forget the tap. You just will. Sometime later, stroll by the bucket. Holy heck! There’s a lot of water in there. It might even be overflowing. That’s the Power of Gradual. It’s the effect of a small thing happening over and over (and over) again.;
, It turns out that there is a fairly easy way to accumulate a comparatively large amount of money. It’s slow, but it works. Put as much money as you can manage into a compound interest account. The earlier the better, so do it right now. Make regular deposits into the account. Don’t look at the account. Make the deposits automatic so you don’t have to think about it. Before you know it, it’s time to retire. Look at the account balance. Holy guacamole, you’re rich!

, Writing is a good example. If you write every working day for two hours or so, you will find it grows quickly. Sometimes, it might seem that two hours are wasted because you’ve been doing the literary equivalent of babbling. Yet, return to the piece the next day and rework it; perhaps you won't even know where it’s going for a few days. All of “sudden”, it comes together. Of course, there’s no “sudden” about it. It’s the Power of Gradual.

, The Power of Gradual works because, quite simply, little things add up to a big thing if you have enough little things. Given enough time, the steady drip-drop of water becomes an ocean. Given enough time, small regular deposits become a small fortune. Given enough time, steady work at my awful first drafts yields a passable final draft.

, Here’s the thing. We tend to be surprised by the Power of Gradual. We’re shocked at the amount of water in the bucket, at the size of our bank account, at the beauty of our writing. That’s because we pay a lot of attention to the immediate, the big, the splashy. Examples abound. We notice the person on television who apparently lost thirty pounds in three weeks. We pay less attention to our next-door neighbor. She’s been steadily losing three pounds per month for the last year and a half (54 pounds!). We weep at the death of our favorite actor or a recent airplane crash, but we are casually indifferent to the increasingly worrying news about the AIDS pandemic in Africa. We admire a beautiful sentence and forget the hours of slogging it took to get it just-so.

, If we allow ourselves to be distracted by the immediate, big, and splashy, we’ll forget about the Power of Gradual. We’ll cram for the exam the night before instead of reading the text for an hour every day. We’ll go for a big run every week instead of three or four small runs throughout the week. We’ll forget about the effects of eating the same fatty breakfast sandwich every morning…

, Remember it in your dark moments when the weight isn’t coming off, when you’re poor, or when you can’t think of a way to write something down. Relax. Keep going. It will come.

Encourage growth by nurturing the desire to keep trying.,
Promote healthy attitudes about failure.,
Be objective.,
Draw on others' experiences.,
Use conflict as a lesson, not something to be afraid of.,
Collect stories, as a family, of people who achieved competency by accepting the need to keep trying in spite of failure.,
Collect quotes.,
Find out how your children plan to fix problems.,
Give feedback.",How to Promote Competency by Using Everyday Experience," Competency is built by learning new skills and becoming better at the skills one already has.;
, Failure can be an opportunity to show our metal—it requires courage, wisdom, persistence and transcendence—all shining virtues. Not only does failure provide information about what does not work, it is also promotes character development. There are many paths to encouraging competency. Life is a laboratory, and opportunities for teaching attitudes that promote competency occur without warning.

, Parents can prepare themselves to teach the skills by first by looking objectively at their own attitudes about failure and success.


Did you make a bad decision today? Talk about it, and what you learned from it.
Did you achieve something that took a lot of work? Talk to your children about how you did it.
Is there something going on in your life that hurts your ego? Show your children how you will deal with it in a healthy way. You might even listen to their ideas about how to deal with it effectively.

, In addition to using one’s own experiences, parents can draw from the lives of people they know. Dweck’s book on Mindset is replete with stories about people we all know through the media who became successful by persistence and dealing with failure in healthy ways.


For example—did you know Michael Jordan, the greatest basketball player of all time, was cut from the high school basketball team because he did not show adequate skill? His mother used it as an opportunity to teach the importance of “discipline”—developing mastery through focused practice.

, Family conflict provides great opportunities to teach attitudes that promote competency. Conflict quickly identifies the thinking style of its participants. After the conflict is over, debrief and give people an opportunity to understand each other’s points of view. Examine your own thinking out loud, and how maybe thinking differently about it might have led to a better outcome.

, Look for “success stories” on the internet.

, Cut out articles from the newspaper about people who persisted until they had a good outcome. Invite people over for dinner who have faced and overcome challenges in their lives.

, Rather than give your children advice on how to solve their problems, ask them about their plan. Also ask them why they have chosen that particular plan. Then just wait to see what happens—it may provide a good opportunity to discuss what can be learned from failure and success., Finally, there are many times when children are brilliant. These are times to give feedback not about being brilliant, but about what they did to render such an amazing performance.


“You practiced that piano piece over and over until you could play it with your eyes closed. I’m so proud of your good work.”
“Your brother was making a lot of noise and you didn’t even get angry. You just kept focused on your homework.”
“I like how you cheered for your teammates, even when they were so frustrated that they had difficulty playing well. They must be glad you are on their team, just as I am glad you are on my team.”

Try to negotiate with the airlines to see if you can get the next flight out on a booked flight so another person can take your seat.
Families with babies and small children tend to be booked in the back of the plane. Airlines try their best in placing them together, but it doesn't hurt in swapping plane seats so both parents can be with their children.

, If you see someone on the side of the road, pull over and check to see if they are okay. It takes a minute to give people on social media a heads up; tag your local news station or a city's hub connection in your message.

,


Allow someone to turn into the road from a parking lot.
Give up that parking space you have been eyeing on from the next aisle.
Give pedestrians more time to cross the street. On a sunny day, intersections are always a dangerous place for people, including marked crosswalks. Leave extra time for them to walk through the snow and ice.

But your life is your life, and if you want better things, then you have to work to reach for them, instead of assuming the attitude that you’re not getting treated fairly. To practice humility, work to accept the life you have while striving for more without complaining.


If you adopt the attitude that you’re too cool for school, people will become allergic to you. Instead, work to be grateful for what you have and work to earn more, if that’s what you want.;
, People who practice humility are naturally optimistic because they don’t waste their time complaining about all of the bad things that have happened to them or dreading the future. Instead, they’re grateful what they have and they expect good things to happen in the future. Humble people don’t expect to be given good things on a silver platter, but they do believe that good things will happen to them if they work hard enough.


Work on being excited about all of the things the future holds instead of expecting catastrophe to strike at any moment.
Though it’s a good idea to be prepared for the worst, you should work on finding the silver lining in almost every situation.

, To get in a more humble mindset, you have to accept the fact that you’re not the best at everything—or even anything. No matter how great you are at surfing, singing, or writing fiction, there will always be someone who is more knowledgeable than you are, and that’s okay. Instead of acting like you have the final say on something, be open to the fact that you’re constantly evolving and improving, and know that other people can help you get there.


If you act like you’re the best at something, you’ll come off as arrogant. Instead, show people that, while you’re proud of what you know or what you can achieve, you’re always wanting to do more.

, It’s one thing to be humble and another thing to be falsely modest. If you spent all weekend working on a project for work and your boss tells you you did a great job on Monday, don’t say, “It was nothing.” Tell him that you’re glad he liked it and that you’re happy to have put a lot of work into it. You may think that shrugging off your achievements will make you look more modest, but in reality, it will actually make you come off as more arrogant.Sure, it can be kind of awkward when people are praising you. However, you should accept credit where credit is due instead of acting like it was no big deal.

, If you want to practice humility, then you have to be aware of the fact that you’re not perfect. If you think that you’re a flawless human being, then you’re not going to learn anything new in this world or grow as a person. Instead, it’s important to be self-aware and to know what you need to work on, so you can be humbled before others. A truly humble person knows that he has things to work on and makes an effort to get there.


Sure, it can be humbling to admit that you need to work on your social skills or that you’re not the world’s neatest person. But this can also lead you to work toward self-improvement.
Along with recognizing your flaws, it’s important to be able to accept the things you cannot change about yourself.

, To truly practice humility, you should avoid bragging or showing off as much as you can. While you may want to talk about your accomplishments, you should avoid sounding like you’re showing off as much as possible. If you worked hard to do something, then you can talk about it, but avoid talking about how rich, attractive, or successful you are, or people are likely to get the wrong impression about you. Instead, you should trust the fact that if you’re a really impressive person, other people will get a sense of it without you having to tell them.


People who truly practice humility focus much more on praising other people than on focusing on their own accomplishments.
The next time you catch yourself talking about something you’ve achieved, ask yourself whether you’re bragging or showing off, or just sharing something you’re truly proud of.

, If you really want to practice humility, then you have to work on being grateful for everything the world has given you, from your health to your pet kitty. Don’t take anything for granted and know that it’s a privilege to even be reading an article online. You should also be grateful for the hardships and challenges you’ve faced, because they’ve made you into the person you are today.Of course, some people are a lot better off than others when it comes to the luck game. Just know that it’s what you do with your luck that matters, and that you should be grateful for what you have been given instead of complaining about what you don’t have.
Gratitude is essential for true humility. Work on making a list of everything you’re grateful for and add to it whenever you think of something else.

, One way to practice humility is to spend more time listening than you do talking. If you spend all of your time talking about yourself or sharing your ideas, then you’ll be less likely to learn from others or to appreciate what they have to offer. Listening to other people will also make them feel important and cared for, and it can be very humbling to give others a listening ear and a bit of your time.


It can be very humbling to realize that other people have a perspective that is just as valid as yours, and that everyone around is also filled with worries, doubts, and hopes.
Become an expert at listening to people without interrupting them or giving them advice unless they ask for it.

, If you want to practice humility, then the best thing you can do is to is to learn to give credit where it is due. If you’re praised for doing a report at work, make sure you mention that you couldn’t have done it without two of your coworkers. If you’re praised for scoring a goal at the soccer game, mention that you couldn’t have done it without your teammates. You are rarely responsible for 100% of your success, and it’s important to take the time to acknowledge all of the other people who made your success possible.


It will actually make you feel better to acknowledge that other people have worked hard, too. If you take all the credit without deserving it, then you’ll be practicing selfishness instead of gratitude.

, One characteristic of a truly humble person is the ability to admit you’re wrong. If you’ve made a mistake, it can be very humbling to let people know that you’re aware of your missteps and that you’re apologetic about them. Don’t just be in denial or brush it under the rug. If you want to practice humility, then you have to accept that you’re not perfect and come to terms with admitting your mistakes and apologizing for them.When you apologize to people, look them in the eyes, make your words genuine, and show them that the behavior won’t happen again. Let them see that you’re taking the time to truly apologize, and that you’re not just doing it out of obligation.
Of course, actions speak louder than words. To truly be forgiven, you have to work to not make the same mistake again.

, Whether you’re ordering at a family dinner, in line at the movies, or waiting to catch the bus, make an effort to let other people go before you once in a while. People who practice humility are aware that they’re not the most important people in the world, and they let other people go before them because they know that their time isn’t more important than anyone else’s. While you shouldn’t be a pushover, you should look for opportunities to let people go ahead of you if you want to practice humility.There’s a real humility in saying, “After you.” Work on seeing that your time isn’t worth more than anyone else’s and letting other people have a chance before you do.
It goes without saying that cutting a line is the opposite of being humble.

, It can be very humbling to admit that you don’t have all the answers and to defer to someone else. When something is troubling or puzzling to you, take the time to turn to a friend for advice or to ask a coworker to share his expertise. Be comfortable with admitting that other people have something that is useful to you and that you’re always open to learning more and improving as a person. Truly humble people know that knowledge is infinite, and they’re always asking others to share what they know.


Don’t be afraid to admit that you don’t know something. In fact, most people love sharing their knowledge with others and will be eager to help you.
You can even offer a bit of praise when you ask for advice. Just saying something like, “Hey, I know you’re a whiz at math, and I just can’t understand this problem,” will make a person feel great, as long as it doesn’t sound like you’re sucking up.

, Another way to practice humility is to recognize other people for their achievements. Praise other people as much as you can, for being in awe of how hard your co-worker worked on a presentation to praising your sister for keeping her head up in a difficult situation. Praising others publicly, as long as you don’t embarrass them, can also be a great way to show your appreciation of others and to humble yourself before the strengths of other people.


Get in the habit of telling other people when they’re doing great at something. This can make both you and the person feel great.
Of course, make sure the praise is deserved. You don’t want the person to think that you just want something from him.

, If you want to practice humility, then you should always be open to complimenting other people, from telling them how great they look to complimenting aspects of their personality. As long as your compliments are genuine, you’ll be making other people feel better about themselves while practicing humility in the process. Truly humble people recognize that other people have endless qualities that are worth praising.


Even something simple like, “I love your earrings. They make your eyes stand out,” can really brighten a person’s day, and it takes very little effort.

, If you make volunteering a part of your routine, then you will be able to have a more humility-filled life. Whether you’re helping children and adults learn to read at your local library or working a soup kitchen in your community, volunteering can help you get in touch with your sense of gratitude and help people who really need you. It can be incredibly humbling to spend time with people who are grateful for your help, and it can make you be more gracious and less likely to feel entitled.Volunteer for the sake of it, not for the bragging rights. You don’t need to tell your fifty closest friends that you’re volunteering just to show off. Of course, if you’re genuinely proud and want to talk about it, that’s another thing.
Giving your time to help others can make you realize that you don’t always need to put yourself first. This can make you live a life filled with humility.

, To practice gratitude on a regular basis, you should avoid comparing yourself to others, whether you’re jealous of your neighbors, your best friend, or even Taylor Swift. Focus on being grateful for what you have and enjoying your life on its own terms instead of thinking you need to have what your best friend or co-worker has to truly be happy. If you spend your life comparing yourself to others, then you will never feel like what you have is enough, and you won’t be humbled before all that you have been given.


You can admire other people and feel inspired to be better because of them. But if you covet what they have, you are likely to fall into feelings of bitterness that will keep you from enjoying your life.
Don’t gossip about people or put them down because you’re secretly jealous of them, either. Humble people only say nice things about people behind their backs.

, People who practice humility are the first to admit that they don’t know everything. Whether you’re getting tips from a co-worker or a friend, it’s important to be open to new possibilities and new knowledge. Let people see that you think they have a lot to offer you, and avoid acting stubborn or like you know everything. Even if you may feel like an expert on a topic, remember that you can always learn more; it’s humbling to admit that you’re a student of life.Don’t get defensive when someone is trying to teach you something. If that person has pure intentions, then you should make an effort to hear him out.
You don’t want people to feel like you think you have all the answers, or they won’t be eager to share their experiences with you.

, If you want to practice humility, then not all of your kind deeds have to go noticed. Donate money to charity without telling a soul about it, or donate your old clothes without saying a thing. If you notice that a person’s parking meter is expired, throw in a few quarters. Help crowdfund a worthy project. Anonymously post a kind comment on a person’s blog. Take the time to do something nice without wanting anything in return, and you will be on your way to practicing humility every day.


If you’re the only person who is aware of the good you’ve done in the world, there is something especially humbling about the experience.
You can even write about the experience in a journal if you feel like telling someone.

, People who practice humility aren’t often seen complaining because they realize that life is precious and that they have so much to be grateful for. Sure, we’ve all had bad days, and it’s okay to vent once in a while, but you shouldn’t make a habit of it if you want to practice humility. Remember that so many people have it so much worse than you, and that complaining about every little thing that happened to you instead of focusing on the positive will keep you from practicing humility.


People are drawn to appreciative, positive people. If you complain all the time or form relationships based on complaining all the time, then you’ll be less likely to live a humility-filled life.
Whenever you catch yourself complaining about something, try to counter that comment with two positive comments.

, There’s something very humbling about being in nature, whether you take a long hike through the woods or you spend a day just lying on the beach. Nature can remind you that there are things bigger than ourselves and our problems out there, and that we should be in awe of the world instead of obsessing over all of our little problems or thwarted ambitions. Making a habit of being in nature more often can lead you to practice humility more.


Your problems won’t seem as severe when you’re standing at the base of a mountain. As corny as it sounds, being around nature will make you see that you’re just a grain of sand on the beach that is the universe, and that you should be thankful for what you have instead of bemoaning what you wish you had.

, Children have a natural sense of wonder and almost never cease to be in awe of the universe. If you want to practice humility more often, then you should make a habit of spending more time with children. They’ll help you see the world through new, youthful eyes, and you’ll be able to rediscover some of the magic you may feel that you lost because of the daily grind. Making a habit of spending more time with kids, whether you spend more time with your own, volunteer with children, or help a friend out by babysitting, can help you practice humility regularly.


You may think that you have a lot to teach children and will feel humbled when you see that they have a lot to teach you, too. Listen to their perspective about the world and see how it can help you become a more humble, grateful person.
Being around children will help you rejuvenate your sense of wonder. This can help you be more appreciative of the world around you and it will keep you from taking anything for granted.

, Yoga is a practice devoted to being grateful for the body you have been given and your time on this earth. Though some yoga practices can be a great workout, too, the most important thing with yoga is being in touch with your mind and body and not taking a single one of your breaths for granted. If you want to work on practicing humility more, then you should make yoga a regular part of your life.Taking just 2-3 classes a week can transform the way you look at the world. If you feel like you just can’t make the time to go to a yoga class, you can practice at home.

Some studies show that writing lists help to feel an immediate sense of accomplishment, just from organizing your thoughts into list form.This is often the first step in helping to accomplish tasks and make decisions.


Even if you've only got two decisions, write them down. This will allow you to start filling in details about each decision, creating a little flow chart that will help you decide.
As you write, try to come up with alternative possibilities as well. If it seems like you've only got two choices, try to come up with out-of-the-box alternatives as well.;
, Underneath or beside each possibility on your list, write out the benefits or the ""pros"" of each choice. What will making that particular decision gain you? How will you stand to benefit from that decision? What's the upside? List out all the ways in which that choice would be a good one.


Consider the benefits in and of themselves, as well as side benefits. If you're trying to decide what college you want to attend, it's good to consider benefits about one college offering internships to all students, as well as the reputation for fun. Both things are important considerations.

, After you consider the pros, consider the cons. What do you stand to lose by making this decision? What will be difficult, or challenging about completing this task? What might end up going poorly, if you choose to pursue this avenue? try to consider all the ways you might fail.


Consider a variety of cons, like time commitments, difficulty, and other aspects of the choice.
try to be realistic. If you're trying to pick a career path, it's true that being a novelist could make you a millionaire, but it's rare to crack through to that millionaire success level.

, In some cases, the challenge of a particular task might be a pro or a con. Depending on the kind of choice you're making, it's good to organize your options in terms of the difficulty involved in each choice, so you can pick the best possible outcome that you'll be able to pull off. After you go through and list out each of your options, arrange them from most to least difficult, or vice versa.

, If all of the options seem unattractive to you, try to do a little innovating. Think of a non-traditional way of solving your problem to make yourself happy. try to look beyond one or two options and find other creative and elegant solutions to the problem that you're trying to solve.If you're trying to decide what you want to make for dinner, and all you've got in the cabinet is canned tuna and Ramen noodles, think about all the other options you've got. You could go out to eat. You could run to the store really quickly. You could call a friend and see what they're having. Don't limit yourself.

, If you're trying to make a big decision about finances, school, or a romantic relationship, it's always a good idea to talk to someone older than yourself. Talk to someone who has been there before and ask for guidance. They'll usually be able to point you in the direction of things you might not have thought of before.


Friends and relatives typically enjoy being consulted as experts. People are almost always willing to help you come to a decision, or weigh your options.
Don't expect an answer, but just try to talk it out together. Instead of saying, ""What should I do?"" say something like, ""What's the best way tot think about this?"" or ""How would you think about this?"" It's ultimately your decision to make.

, If you're trying to make a difficult choice, think about how one of the pros would do it. Consult teachers for school decisions, colleagues for workplace decisions, and people with strong relationships for relationship advice.


If you're trying to decide where you want to go to college, or what you want to do for a particular school project, talk to one of your teachers. They'll help you think about the options from an informed perspective.
Experts don't have to be experts at the thing you're talking about. Look at some role models, or experts at life. How would Slash handle your relationship problem? What would Lady Gaga say to the bully who's messing with you?

, It's important to go past what your impression of a particular choice and learn what it is actually like. If you're trying to decide what to eat for dinner to help you lose weight, make sure you research how many calories are in a particular dish before you cook it. Just because chicken quesadillas might sound healthy doesn't make them so.It's important to avoid what's called ""groupthink."" Sometimes, you can only see the popular or the common solutions to problems, and it keeps you from coming up with creative alternatives. It's important to look into your solutions yourself and keep other people's opinions at a slight distance., Think about what would happen in the future if you choose a specific option. If your boss told you that you have to relocate somewhere far away for your job, think about your family, friends, and other close relatives, and how it would affect them. Look into what the city would be like to live in. Consider how the move might benefit you. try to imagine what it would really be like.


Even things as small as deciding what to wear benefit from a little visualizing. Try on each dress. Take pictures and send them off to a particular friend to help make the choice.

, Sometimes, there's a point at which you can think too much about a particular choice. Sometimes, two colleges will both be excellent and you can imagine yourself being happy at each. Continuing to dig and dig for some little thing that will turn you on or off of one of the choices can be more aggravating than helpful. Instead, put it aside and go about your life for a while. One option may grow on you with some time.

, It's much easier to make a decision when you've got fewer choices. When it's time to make your decision, try to limit yourself to choosing between no more than two or three. Cross out the options that are too difficult or unattractive to actually go with, and then weigh the remaining options to make your decision.


Eliminate any impossible choices. If the difficulty of a particular task is so great its risks outweigh its rewards, cross it out. It might be awesome to be a movie star, but it might be too difficult to take seriously as an option.
Cross out any unattractive options from the list. If you just can't stomach the idea of attending a particular school, or of moving to a particular place, then cross it off the list. Don't consider something just because it has an upside. If you don't like it, don't do it.

, Sometimes, it's important to consider how long something will take to accomplish, and how much time you can afford to devote to it. Consider what's most pressing and how you can use your time most wisely.What needs to happen first? try to prioritize the most important decisions and choices to put them up front.
Think about how best to use your time wisely. If you're trying to decide how to fill the afternoon, something like ""start rebuilding the engine"" might be a little ambitious for the next three hours, or it might be a great way to spend the time.

, Ultimately, you're just going to have to go with your gut at some point. If you feel yourself drawn to one option over another, that's a fine reason to pick it. Don't overthink it. Sometimes, you've just got to decide.


Try this exercise: Describe the decision you've got to make, as if you were someone else looking at the situation objectively. What would you have to say to the person trying to make the choice?

, If you've made your choice, make it tentatively. Don't make your decision final until you can live with it for at least 12 hours or so. Wait until you are ready for bed to go over all the pros and cons a final time, then sleep on the decision.


The next day, write down which seems the best fit. If it still sounds good in the morning, go with it. Sometimes your subconscious works out the details while sleeping!

, Once you've decided, stop considering the other options. It can drive you crazy to start second-guessing yourself after you've made the choice and it's too late. Go for it and don't look back.

Do not to blurt out ""I am not a dualist"" when speaking to your friends, especially when you have not been asked whether or not you are a dualist.,
Recognize that you are a dualist.,
Recognize that other philosophical positions are powerful alternatives to Cartesian dualism.

,
Use your ""mind"" (as you might still think of it) to decide that Cartesian dualism is no longer the right philosophical position for you.

,
Make a searching and fearless philosophical inventory of yourself.

,
Admit to yourself, others, and God, that Cartesian dualism is wrong.,
Admit that you are ready to remove these defects of philosophical argumentation from the views you hold to be true.

,
Remove aforementioned arguments from the views you hold to be true.,
Make a list of the persons you annoyed with your dualist positions.,
Continue to take personal inventory and admit when you have accidentally slipped back into a Cartesian position.,
Seek through reading and education to improve your awareness and contact with philosophically tenable positions that are not Cartesian dualism.

,
Having had a philosophical awakening as the result of these steps, seek to carry your new message to fellow Cartesian dualists in order that they too might be shown the error of Cartesian dualism and be shown the light of defensible philosophies of mind.

",How to Not Be a Cartesian Dualist," Emphatically denying your Cartesian dualism will likely make them taunt you about being a closet Cartesian dualist for months to come. Given that you probably are a Cartesian dualist, and in need of recovery from this tenuous philosophical position, it is important to be calm and collected in the face of everyday discussions with friends.;
, You must admit that you are powerless over your Cartesian dualism, and that your life as a dualist has become unmanageable.

,,,, The easiest method for accomplishing this is to come to a full understanding of the problem of interactionism. Interactionism is the view that the mind and the body causally influence one another, a common-sense opinion that you believe as a recovering Cartesian dualist. Interactionism violates the doctrine of physical closure—the basic idea that physicists are right about the world and that it operates as a causally closed system. If physical closure were not true, the conservation of energy would not hold, and the universe would be a pretty messed up place for all of us (not that we would likely exist if it weren't a closed system, but that is not the point). The following argument from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy shows why interactionism is so problematic: ""For X to be a cause of Y, X must contribute something to Y. The only way a purely mental event could contribute to a purely physical one would be to contribute some feature not already determined by a purely physical event. But if physical closure is true, there is no feature of the purely physical effect that is not contributed by the purely physical cause. Hence interactionism violates physical closure"".

,, Replace them with epiphenomenalism or some other form of argumentation that does not violate the basic tenets of a physical universe. You COULD go for parallelism, but that whole ""God set it all up from the beginning"" argument violates free will pretty strongly. Besides, you probably don't want to go from being a Cartesian to being a Liebnizian. That is really no better, so just go with the epiphenomenalism for now.

, This is probably a lot of people, so it might be best to use Excel so that you can alphabetize the list in the future.

, It'll likely happen a lot at first, so be humble about this.

Pray.",How to Deal With Uncertainty," Part of what makes uncertainty so scary is that we feel that we don’t have any control over the situation. This will depend on the specific uncertainty that is bothering you, but if you can find something small that you can predict or plan, then do so.For example, if it is uncertain whether or not you will be moving to a new country, or whether you will be accepting a new job in your current country, make plans for how you will enjoy either outcome. If you end up staying, you might join a new gym, or find a new flat. If you move to a new country, look into the opportunities that expatriates have in that country to get together.;
, If your uncertainty is related to a decision you have to make, then try to find ways to reduce the number of choices you have.


Use things such as your values, beliefs, and ultimate life goals to help you reduce the choices, if that is relevant for your decision.
For example, if you are feeling uncertain about a few job offers you have received, think about how each job will help you accomplish your career goals, but also about how they will influence your quality of life. If you have a very involved family life, it may not be a good idea to choose a job that can call you away at any time of the day or night. This can help you eliminate one or two of your choices based on consideration of what is important to you.

, Setting goals can be a great way to help prevent uncertainties in our life, and when uncertainty does arise, have goals can keep us from getting distracted by this uncertainty. If you have something you want to achieve, then set a goal to do so.


For example, if you have a dream of attending a good college and becoming a doctor, then make that your goal.
Whatever your goal is, write it down. This helps make it more concrete. Some goals may be more difficult to achieve, and may require more commitment, but with enough time and discipline, you can achieve almost anything.
On the other hand, make sure you are realistic about your goal. Setting a goal to run a marathon in one month even though you’ve never run in your life is not a realistic goal.

, If you have a very large goal you want to achieve, it is best if you can break that big goal into smaller, more manageable “sub-goals”. For example, if your goal is to run a marathon, and you haven’t ever run before, make a few smaller goals that you are certain you can achieve. Your first goal could be to run one mile without stopping, then you could move up to running a 5k race. Once you’ve accomplished that, shoot for a 10k, and so on.

, No matter how much we might want to achieve a particular goal, there can be hindrances to achieving our goal. Therefore, it is important to remain flexible when it comes to achieving a goal.


For example, if you want to get into the best university in the country, but realize that you won’t be able to afford the costs of doing so, try looking into some other options. There are many, many good universities that are more affordable than some of the ivy leagues.
On the other hand, if you simply must go to that expensive ivy league, consider attending part-time. This will give you enough time to also have a part-time job. Obviously this won’t cover everything, but it will help put some money in your pocket, and has the added bonus that you will have a bit of experience to put on your resume.

, In some cases, no matter how committed we are to reaching a goal, life or circumstances will get in the way. Therefore, it is always good to have a back up plan. This will also help to prevent uncertainty when thinking about your goal because you know how you will deal with an outcome that is not the one you are aiming for.


For example, if you have been training for your marathon, and you’re at the starting line on race day, but feel worried and uncertain that you won’t be able to finish, then let your backup plan be that when you get to the half marathon mark, you can stop if you feel that it is too much.
Although this may be a slightly disappointing outcome, you can then take stock of your training, and have a better idea about what to expect next time. Then, you’ll definitely be able to finish.

, Fortunately or unfortunately, no matter what you do, there will always be uncertainties in life. The best thing you can do is remember that life would be really boring if we always knew what was going to happen.


For example, if we knew when we were born who we would marry, how many kids we have, what kind of job we would do, we would lose our sense of adventure and curiosity.

, When a level of uncertainty appears in your life, we tend to let it take over our thoughts. This includes questions about different outcomes, and finding information about different outcomes could be helpful in allowing you to deal with the uncertainty. Therefore, it is not a bad idea to give yourself some time to dive into whatever information you can get your hands on.For example, if you or someone you love, has found out they may be suffering from a serious disease, search the internet for all the information you can find. Talk to other people who have the disease. This may result in some scary truths, but it may also help calm your anxiety that is related to the uncertainty of the diagnosis.

, If you are convinced that things will always work out how you want them, or that things must be a certain way, then you are bound to be disappointed. Instead, remind yourself that no matter how things work out, you will learn how to be happy if you can be open to the possibilities that lie in front of you.For example, if you are worried because you feel uncertain about whether or not you will get to go on a date with the person you like, remember that there are many other people on the planet, and just because you like someone doesn’t mean they should like you back. If it turns out they don’t feel the same, you will eventually meet other people you find interesting, and they might feel the same.

, Remind yourself that you can deal with whatever comes your way both mentally and emotionally. If you aren’t feeling confident, remind yourself of a time when you overcame a really tough situation.You could also do something to reassure yourself of your emotional strength. You could, for example, do something that scares you, like going to a social gathering where you don’t know anyone and making a new friend.

, If nothing else works, try giving yourself to an engaging activity. If you have a job, put in a few extra hours, which will force you to focus on something else for awhile.


Another good way to use your time is through volunteering. You could try volunteering at an animal shelter, which will give you a good way to focus on something else, and will help a homeless animal as well.
You could also use a different activity to distract yourself for a few hours, adult coloring books have become very popular recently, and many claim that they are a good way to relax and get your mind off of the day’s stress and worries.

, Think of a time where you previously experienced anxiety related to uncertainty. How did you cope with the issue then? Did it work out in your favor, or not? Reminding yourself that you’ve been here before, and made it through can be a comfort that uncertainty is not the worst thing in the world.


If your past experience did not work out how you wanted, then it is more proof that no matter what happens, you will find a way through it.
For example, maybe you had to make a tough decision about which university to attend. How did it work out for you? Were you sorry that you chose the university that you did? Most likely not! If you felt that you had chosen the wrong one, how did you deal with it?

, Stress related to uncertainty activates structures in the brain that can make it difficult to calm yourself. If you are having trouble getting your mind settled, try practicing yoga or try meditation.You could attend a yoga class, or simply find a relaxing yoga video on the internet.
Meditating will not only help your brain focus on something different, it will also improve your ability to deal with stressful and uncertain events in the future.

, If you find that you are experiencing anxiety regarding uncertainties in your life, it may be useful to seek help from a mental health professional. This will give you an outlet to an outside person who can help you manage your anxieties and fears objectively.If you have a trusted friend, you can also talk to them about your worries, but if your anxiety over uncertainty is affecting you so greatly that you have trouble getting through daily life, it is probably best to seek professional help.

, If you are feeling anxious about some uncertainty about your life, then it is perhaps because one outcome is less desirable than another. If this is the case, try working through the worst case scenario. Plan how you will deal with the worst case scenario.For example, if you feel uncertain about your performance on a recent exam, try to work through the different scenarios. If you did very poorly on your exam, how will it affect your grade? Will you be able to make up for the poor grade through extra credit, or through the remaining assignments and tests you have left? Can you discuss the issue with your teach to see if there are other ways of improving?
This will help your brain to think more pro-actively and positively.

, When we are worried about an uncertainty, our mind tends to go in circles. If you aren’t comfortable talking about what is going on in your head, then try writing it down, either in a journal or just in a document on your computer.


This will help give your mind an outlet. You don’t have to do anything with this writing when you are done with it, just simply give yourself a way to get everything you are thinking out of your brain.

, If you believe in a higher entity, pray to them for guidance and comfort. Remember that they will help guide you to the right path, and all you have to do is listen for this guidance.


If you are religious, praying can give you some comfort as it allows a way for your brain to “talk through” the issue with an entity that you trust in. While it may not fix the problem entirely, it can provide you with some comfort, which may help you see other ways of dealing with your uncertainty.

Be very careful about who you trust.,
Learn to work within the bureaucracy.,
Obey the laws and especially ""special orders"".,
Look for ways to escape.,
Be safe!,
Never protest against the dictator all alone.",How to Cope with Living Under a Dictatorship," This bears repeating: do NOT stand out from the crowd. Dictatorships, by their very nature, insist upon submission to their absolute authority. This usually extends to attendance at functions or rallies, obedience to social attitudes and mores, incorporation of slogans into the daily vernacular, and above all, a lack of setting one's self apart in action, appearance, or voice from one's peers. This generally extends especially to religion and ethnicity: dictatorships do not appreciate deviation from ANY social norms, and history is full of tragic examples of persecution of groups of people based solely on these factors.;
, Complaints are usually treated as signs of discontent, and are often used as a reason to eliminate those few freedoms you might be allowed to enjoy.

, Dictatorships often reward the exposure of people whose traits run counter to the established norms. In a repressed society, these rewards, however insubstantial, may provide enough incentive for otherwise decent and trustworthy individuals to either betray trust or invent charges against you in order to obtain them. Historically, this sort of betrayal has even turned parents against children, children against parents, and even spouses against one another.

, Dictatorships usually have substantial bureaucracies that manage the day-to-day function of government; notably, these bureaucracies tend to provide the greatest perks and most lucrative positions inside the economy. As a result, you can expect a significant amount of under-the-table dealings including bribes and nepotism to obtain these jobs. This is not always the case, however. Before assuming a given official is prone to corruption, try to quietly learn the euphemistic language that surrounds bribery (e.g. ""administrative fee"", especially if paid in cash, often means someone is getting a bribe).

, Conforming to legal norms also is a requirement for living under a dictatorship. Authority is usually absolute, and is therefore not subject to question. Avoid especially counter-government demonstrations, maintaining as neutral a posture and attitude in your day-to-day life as possible.

, Conformance and reputation for support often lead to a relaxed attitude toward an individual. Be prepared to methodically work your way toward a relatively unguarded border area or embassy of a country whose policies are moderately counter to those of the dictatorship under which you find yourself living. Attempt to quietly make contact and gain asylum or cross the border safely. Alternatively, find ways to escape within your inner being--whether that's through meditation, individual worship, or simply determining to set aside space inside yourself to resist the restrictions placed upon you. Never give up hope, even when all hope seems lost: the human spirit needs to believe that there is good in the world and that conditions can improve.

, Calculate the risk associated with any ""gray area"" possessions, songs, literature, clothing, symbols, or even relationships. Your goal is to stay alive under a dictatorship, which often means external compromise.

, In a dictatorship, the dictator is the supreme authority.No law is greater than him. If you try to protest against him all alone or with a few people, there is no one who can stop him from punishing few people protesting against him."

~ Recognize the most hated things in your life: not loved but still hated (all mixed-up), because the things you really hate are the things that hold you back from keeping an open-mind. For instance:


Let's say one is an Atheist. Then one cannot understand why so many people believe in a particular God, or any gods for that matter. Why would they? It may seem ridiculous to think that there is any afterlife, any selfless forgiveness -- or to think that a God could love you no matter what you have done and would be providing for and waiting for you to accept His gift of grace... or is that so ridiculous -- that belief serves people well?

~ Examine single-mindedness in a situation like this to try to recognize the opposite side of the argument/equation/what-have-you. Clearly there is no hard evidence to completely support either side of this kind of belief except how it affects your life by considering what lies inside you. Still, to be fair, you may admit that: While you have an interesting point, the other side does also. This may be called ""Seeing the bigger picture"". Having an open mind doesn't necessarily mean accepting opposite viewpoints as true, just fully recognizing how other people may arrive at their conclusions.;
, You must make this your best friend. Asking yourself ""why"" is the most key question in your arsenal. Why am I here? What is my purpose, and am I fulfilling it? The chain of questions actually never ends. Think of it as a rope you are climbing but you will never reach the top -- yet the farther you go upward, the better the view to see the boulders on the ground below becomes. Making deductions is an inexact science -- so you may come to unhelpful conclusions, or you may come to no conclusions. (Now, while some people might be saying: ""Some people cannot be logical -- and just because of who they are, their logic will be flawed"", that is questionable; this isn't necessarily the case. We all are subject to some of the same decisions based on a legal and moral codes as well as various pressures of peer groups in a given social group (America, Ohio, New York City or Texas). People choose their own path in life, and in doing so they must identify what they like and dislike as beliefs. So discards are made to their internal moral structure, and new additions are put in place at times of trial and error in accepting other views. The logic may be accurate or inconsistent and based on well reasoned or faulty premises or not... but it is still valid for/by the person who accepts it...)

, When you start thinking about a situation or a problem you may be having and you come to a conclusion that you think is rational and true, then you may have also recognized some conclusions or answers that are ""untrue"" or incorrect. These are valuable because often times the answers aren't in simple black and white, they may be among shades and hues of gray and other colors. You should compare an untrue conclusion, and a true conclusion on a line of thought and then try to see whether you can make sense out of any answer to be found between them. It may be a better way or not. Regardless, it will help to make you a more accepting and understanding individual. (Think of this like dyeing eggs. You like the color blue. So you dye the egg blue. Now you can dye all of your eggs blue, but perhaps you could instead dye them all red. You've never tried that color -- and although you believe red to be sub-par to blue, it's worth a shot. So you dye them red. You find out that you don't like it, but that's not where it ends. You might find all the possible colors in-between of blue and red. So you dye the red egg with blue dye. You come up with an amazing purple. You never knew you liked this shade of purple. It's completely amazing -- and It's now your favorite color!. Now you can see new merits in red and blue.)

, So, for an Atheist, this may include accepting the ideas of Christianity as useful and worthy of serious consideration. For a Republican, this may include accepting some ideas of the Democrat views. You must feel that it was indeed you that came up with the new idea, and therefore (with a sense of power and self-importance), you know that you are not wrong. People who are effective at this aren't necessarily unmovable and iron-clad in their mindset; they are just very comfortable with what they believe because they believe that they've thought it through thoroughly. It would take really good ideas and arguments to persuade them otherwise, but they aren't opposed to other considerations.

, That is the most simple contradiction that you may find in the universe. You are wrong, but you don't even know it. It doesn't matter who you are. If you accept and understand this -- then everything you think and believe will become all the more important to you without being a crutch to just ""get by on."" When you begin to realize that we are all wrong in some area, and no one knows enough -- or much at all -- then you may become more appreciative of how the knowledge inside your head allows you to enjoy living and struggling amid a world full of chaos.

Consider what matters to you.,
Evaluate your commitments.,
Review how you spend your time.,
Make a list of 4 to 5 things that are important to you.",How to Live Simply1," The first step to living simply is figuring out what truly matters. In a highly consumerist society, you may find yourself losing track of what is important. Spend some time figuring out what matters.


To start, write about your values. This is a simple, free write activity in which you write down what you feel your values should be in terms that make sense to you. Do you believe, for example, experience is more important that material goods? Do you want to do work that feels personally meaningful to you? Do you think it's important to get out in the world more and try new things? Focus on what you value and how you could potentially live up to these values through your actions.Also, consider what values you wish you had. Do you want to be more generous? Less materialistic? Do you want to work on controlling your temper or sense of jealousy? Stating where your values are lacking can help you see where you need to cut back or change to live a more simple lifestyle.;
, Many people equate business with happiness or success. However, being busy does not necessarily mean you're fulfilled. Spend some time evaluating your commitments and figure out how and where you can downsize.


Think about all the activities you have from one day to another. Think about work, family activities, social activities, any clubs you're part of, and other hobbies or side projects. What aspects of your life are most fulfilling? When are you happiest? What seems like a hassle to you? It can help to track your schedule for a single day. Where exactly do the hours go? Are you happy with how you're passing these hours?Learning to say ""No"" is an important step to living simply. You can only do so many things in a day and people often confuse want with need. Do you need to work extra hours each week to make a little extra money? Could you just get by with the basics now and again? Many people feel competitive with others and the constant influx of media only fuels a sense of inadequacy. Try to disengage with the ""Keeping up with the Jones's"" mentality as this is allowing others to control your happiness. Instead, focus spending your free time engaging in activities you genuinely enjoy and feel personally fulfilling over activities you feel obligated to engage in., If you want to live simply, ask yourself how you spend your day. Many people often find themselves thinking, ""Where on earth did the time go?"" If you're looking to live a more simple life, it can help to track your time for a single day. Make a log of how you spent your day, writing down rough time frames for all your activities. See what activities take the longest, which cause the most stress, and which chores and obligations you could reasonably eliminate from your routine., If you want to downsize, you need to take a look at your core values. Making a list of 4 or 5 things that are truly important to you can help you identify how to best spend your time and resources.


What do you value most? Success, art, family, fun? Make a list of four vague concepts that are important to you as a human being.As you consider where to downsize, look back to your core values. Say you've been a volunteer for the Democratic Party in your hometown for years. Your parents were involved, so you got involved as a teenager. Your list of core values contains the following: friends, family, my husband, pets, and reading. Politics really isn't on that list. Is being politically involved really that important to you? Could you stand to scale your political involvement back a bit? You can still vote and stay up-to-date on current events but you don't necessarily have to be a core member of the latest volunteer campaign team every election cycle."

A 2012 Public Agenda poll found that almost 90% of respondents agreed that a strong work ethic is an ""absolutely essential"" part of the Dream.Whether you're aiming to climb from humble beginnings to a comfortable middle class life, ascend from the middle class to the upper class, or even climb from the very bottom to the highest echelons of society, you'll need a powerful personal drive to succeed.


Getting ahead in life means what it sounds like — working hard so that you ""pull ahead"" of others who would rather put in only an ordinary level of effort. For starters, you may want to try working harder and longer than other people at your job. If most employees usually leave as soon they get the chance, offer to stay late. If others slack during their down time, find extra tasks to do. Working harder than other people around you is an excellent way to get noticed at work and eventual reap the rewards of promotion and raises.;
, While hard work is a must for achieving the American Dream, working hard without working effectively will get you nowhere. In America, it's much better to be recognized for being exceptionally efficient and productive, rather than being content to spend lots of effort at tasks that can be accomplished more easily other ways. Always be striving to improve your personal efficiency, especially at work — ask yourself, ""How can I do my job quicker?"", ""How can I do it more simply?"", ""How can I do it with less effort?"", and so on. Below are just a few productivity-boosting tips to get you started:


If you work a job at a computer, write a script (or have an experienced friend do so for you) to accomplish your most frequent, menial tasks.
If you're swamped with work, try to delegate some to others.
If you own a business, hire a third-party agency to handle tasks that are becoming too time-consuming (like accounting, payroll, etc.).
Find creative workarounds to common problems. For example, if you're a waiter and you notice you're wasting lots of time walking back and forth to the ice machine, start carrying a pitcher of ice with you while you wait tables.
Invest in effective, high-quality equipment.
Ensure you get plenty of rest so that you can devote your entire attention to your work.

, While America is home to plenty of stories of people who became fabulously successful without a formal education, in general, getting an education is usually a big boost to your career and personal prospects. A basic education, like you might get from high school, gives you the baseline knowledge you need to be fluent and competitive in the modern world. A higher education, like you might get at college, gives you specialized knowledge and skills which make you a more attractive candidate and can qualify you for more selective jobs, while a post-graduate education usually is even more specialized. In general, it's in every Americans' best interest to get the highest level of education he can reasonably afford.


In addition, certain types of work require the proper educational background. For instance, you can't become a doctor without going to medical school, you can't become a lawyer without going to law school, and you can't become an architect without a degree in architecture.
Getting a higher education can seriously boost your earning potential. On average, someone who spends two years in college is estimated to earn about $250,000 more over her lifetime than someone who does not., Americans who want to get ahead should always be looking for extra ways to make money, both as part of their main job and outside of it. There are literally countless ways to do this — anywhere you see a need that you can fill, you have the potential to make money. Money-making opportunities can be remarkably simple — for instance, if you're a certified public accountant (CPA), you may want to sell your services to your friends around tax season for extra money in addition to your normal income. However, some of the most lucrative enterprises involve offering creative solutions to problems that aren't obvious. As a famous example, Mark Zuckerberg, an American, became the youngest billionaire on the planet by working with others to create a globe-spanning social media site, helping people stay in touch with each other in a way that wasn't previously imaginable.


You don't have to invent the next Facebook to be successful in America, but you should try to be enterprising in small, yet significant ways. Running your own part-time business out of your home, for instance, is a great way to make extra cash with few overhead costs.
Obviously, regardless of the money-making scheme you choose, you'll want to make sure you're complying with federal, state, and local laws. For instance, operating a ""freelance MDMA distribution service"" can land you with a serious prison stint, which will undoubtedly disrupt your long-term goals., Lots of people spend big chunks of their income on things they don't need. To build a comfortable life for yourself in the long-term, it can be very wise to eliminate these unnecessary expenses for yourself in the short-term. Doing away with luxuries like cable TV packages, trips to fancy restaurants, and unnecessary vacations can free up cash for expenses that give you a longer-lasting benefit, like debt payments, money-making projects, and retirement investments.


One great way to get your spending under control is to make a budget for your household. Outlining your monthly spending and comparing your estimates to your actual spending can be an enlightening experience that helps you identify areas where you're spending too much money.
Other great ways to save include finding cheaper housing, buying groceries in bulk, carpooling or using public transportation rather than driving your own car, and reducing the amount that you use your heating or air conditioning.
For more information, see How to Save Money.

, Though people seeking the American Dream are wise to work hard, no American has ever been happier for focusing his entire life on his work. Part of the American dream is having the freedom to do things besides work to make a fuller, happier life for yourself. Spend time doing the things you love — this can mean hobbies, like writing, playing sports, and working on your car, but it can also mean simple pleasures like simply spending time with your family.


If you love your job, great! Being able to make money from work that aligns with your personal passions is a luxury that not everyone has. If you don't love your job, that's OK. Stick with it and apply yourself to it, but always save some time for your passions (and for looking for other opportunities) to keep your morale high.

, Though owning a home isn't necessarily required to live a happy, full life in America, most Americans either own their own home or intend to eventually do so.Even in light of recent real estate crises, most Americans' primary source of wealth is still their home. Contributing to a mortgage allows you to build gradually build equity in your house throughout your working years, which can help you comfortably retire — selling your house for a good price when you're old can single-handedly finance your retirement.


Owning your own home doesn't just give you material benefits. Owning your own house also gives you a great deal of freedom to customize your living situation to the way you want it. For instance, if your kitchen is too cramped, if you own your house, you can expand it. If you rent, you can't usually do this. In addition, many Americans find that owning a house gives them a great sense of satisfaction and security.

, Americans are given a great deal of personal freedom by the US Constitution, the nation's definitive document of law. Every American should know the most fundamental rights offered to her by the Constitution. Taking advantage of these freedoms can allow you to create a happy, fulfilling, and successful life for yourself. On the other hand, ignorance of these freedoms can make it easy to miss opportunities or be taken advantage of. Below are a few of the most basic rights provided by the Constitution (note that these are all from the Bill of Rights — the original ten amendments to the Constitution):The right to free speech (including a free press, the ability to protest peacefully, and petition the government)
The right to practice your religion (or lack thereof)
The right to bear arms (usually refers to owning a gun)
Protection against unlawful search and seizure
Protection against testifying against yourself in legal matters
The right to a public trial by jury
Protection against ""cruel and unusual punishments""

, Perhaps the most-used, most-cited constitutional freedom is the freedom of speech. America is a free country — Americans are allowed to say essentially anything they want to and to express their opinions in any way as long as they do so in a way that isn't harmful to others. This means that it's legal to have virtually any personal and political beliefs and to share these beliefs with others, even if your beliefs run contrary to the established order, as long as you obey the law.


Note that certain types of speech which are specifically intended to cause harm are not necessarily constitutionally-protected. One widely-known example given by Supreme Court Justice Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. in 1919 is yelling ""fire!"" in a crowded theater — since doing this creates an immediate, real danger to the other people in the theater, you'll probably still be arrested if you do this.
It's also important to understand that the freedom to express yourself doesn't necessarily protect you from the consequences of your actions. For instance, if the president of a business makes racist comments that are made public, the board of directors can still fire him for this. Freedom from speech doesn't necessarily mean that nothing bad will happen to you because of what you say.

, The pilgrims who traveled on the Mayflower, some of the earliest visitors to America, were people seeking a place where they could practice their religion free from harassment and persecution. Today, America maintains this attitude of religious tolerance. Americans are free to practice whichever religion they please, or, if they prefer, to practice no religion at all. All forms of faith are allowed in the United States and officially-recognized churches are even granted tax-free status by the Internal Revenue Service.As with freedom of speech, Americans are free to practice the religion of their choice, but not to commit crimes or endanger others as part of that practice. For instance, if the members of a certain religion decided to drive their cars the wrong way on the freeway as a sign of devotion, they would still be arrested.

, All adult Americans are free to (and generally should) participate in government by voting. In most states, residents are allowed to register to vote at age 18, though a few states let 17 year-olds vote.Voting is one of the most powerful rights Americans have. Voting allows every citizen's voice to be heard in matters of government. All citizens have equal voting power — no matter how rich, powerful, or influential someone is, she still gets the same single vote that a minimum-wage worker does.


Note that American men must register for Selective Service (""the draft"") to be able to vote.Note also that some states prohibit felons from voting, even after serving their sentence., In the United States, people are free to live their lives as they see fit. People can have any habit, hobby, or interest that they wish as long as it doesn't break any laws or hurt anyone else. What people do in their free time is up to them — bankers can be amateur punk rockers, dishwashers can speculate on the stock market, and electricians can study archaeology. People are also encouraged to choose their life's own path — no American needs to feel like there is a single ""right"" way to live his life. Americans are free to associate with who they want to and to pursue almost any opportunity that they wish to.


Note that, while Americans are free to live their lives how they please as long they obey the law, some sorts of activities which can be seen as ""victimless"" in other parts of the world are illegal in the US. For instance, many drugs which are relatively unregulated in parts of Europe and elsewhere are illegal in part or all of the US., An important aspect of achieving the American Dream is being willing to be take a stand for your own individual principles. America has a long tradition of celebrating the type of rugged individual who's willing to ""go against the group"". Many famous Americans are celebrated for going against prevailing attitudes or social institutions that ran contrary to their personal beliefs. For instance, famous Americans like Abraham Lincoln, Rosa Parks, Cesar Chavez, and even modern icons like Steve Jobs became legendary by changing the world with their willingness to go against the grain and challenge the way the world worked.


Being an individual means standing for your own principals and having the courage to go against popular attitudes, but it doesn't mean never accepting help from someone else. Some tasks are difficult, if not impossible without the help of others — no individual should be so proud as to think that she can do everything in the world by herself. For example, many famous American companies were started with modest loans from friends and family or government-backed small business loans.

, Innovation has been one of America's most cherished national values for over a century and still is in the modern age. Innovation is often referred to (for instance, by elected officials)as being key to the continued growth and success of the nation. Being a successful innovator in America is a quick ticket to personal fulfillment, material success, and widespread recognition. For instance, some of America's most important innovators, like Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and others are now recognized as having changed the world with their groundbreaking work.


You don't have to be a modern-day Edison to have a shot at the American dream — even small, everyday innovations can substantially improve your life. For instance, finding a new, more lucrative way for the company you work for to do business can win you a promotion and the respect of your coworkers.

, It has been observed by those both inside and outside of the country that Americans have a penchant for self-education and self-improvement. No one is born knowing how to do everything he needs to know how to do to succeed. To achieve the sort of strong, rugged individualism that is central to the American Dream, it's essential to be willing to better yourself wherever and whenever you get the opportunity. Whether it's learning a new skill, practicing a second language, or studying strategies for business success, almost any avenue of self-improvement can help you become a stronger, more versatile, or more productive person. Below are just a few more ideas for self-improvement:


Physical conditioning (running, weightlifting, etc.)
Learning sales techniques
Studying modern history or current events
Learning a martial art
Mastering a hobby or activity
Creating art or music

, Proud, individualistic Americans shouldn't shy away from confronting the world's problems head-on. Doing this often means becoming a leader, taking charge of others while accepting the responsibility that comes with leadership. Having the courage to volunteer for tasks that involve leadership, whether they're big or small, can help you make a difference in the world while earning recognition for yourself.


One great way to become a leader is to run for public office. Doing this gives you a platform to make your views known and, if you win, to fight for the changes you want to see. Even if you don't win, if your campaign attracts enough attention, it can re-frame the public debate or persuade lawmakers to consider your views.
You don't have to be a member of government to be a leader in your community. Volunteering for certain types of charitable work or even simply doing community-oriented work on your own can give you an opportunity to become a leader for others.

, The United States if founded on the principals of representative democracy. The more people who participate in the process of government by voting, the more truly representative the nation's government is of its citizens. Because of this, all Americans who can vote should make sure to do so. However, this is far from the only way actively participate in the civic life of the country. For instance, citizens can join a political party whose beliefs are close to their own and work or volunteer to spread its message. Or, if they feel especially strongly about certain civic issues, they can even start their own political associations. Below are just few more ways you may want to consider becoming an active participant in American democracy:


Participating in a political round table or forum
Joining or organizing a protest
Volunteering to get signatures for a political candidate or cause
Donating to your favorite political cause

, Nothing is more quintessentially American than the rags-to-riches story of someone who's able to build a life of influence and importance from almost nothing. Whether you're a poor, unknown immigrant or an established citizen, everyone has the chance to make a name for himself in America as long as you're willing to work hard, be creative, and have the strength to stick to your personal values. While, for obvious reasons, it's impossible for everyone to become fabulously rich and famous, it is possible in America to retire in a higher position than you started your career in and to make a name for yourself as an important member of your local community in the process.


As you climb the social ladder, never feel intimidated by the prospect of having to deal with people from higher social strata than you. In America, more so than in certain other countries, a person's destiny is determined by her willpower and ability, rather than the privilege of her birth. While some people are born into wealth and privilege, if you're able to climb into a certain social class from a lower one, you have every right to view yourself as an equal to members.

, It's not easy pursuing the American dream. As described above, building a great life for yourself while living as a free, independent individual can require lots of work and personal responsibility. If you're having a hard time motivating yourself to keep chasing the dream, consider turning to one of the many iconic American success stories to fuel your drive. Many of these real-life individuals were able to build a life of importance from nothing or successfully fought against prevailing societal forces of the time to make a better country (or even a better world). Below are just a few all-American examples:


Andrew Carnegie: A poor Scottish immigrant, Carnegie began his career as a ""bobbin boy"" in a factory and ended it as one of the most powerful, important industrialists ever.
Susan B. Anthony: By spearheading the women's suffrage movement with her tireless efforts, which included being arrested, Anthony was instrumental in winning the right to vote for women.Jawed Karim: This immigrant, best known for co-founding YouTube, also helped design the commerce service PayPal.
Jay Z: Born Shawn Carter, this American music icon rose from a life of crime and poverty to become one of the wealthiest and most influential people in the music industry.

Don’t fall prey to emotional addiction.,
Make yourself useful.Doing something you love is important.",How to Become Content With What You Have," Being content is celebrating and reflecting on positive, happy memories.The memories and experiences which bring the most joy are often of a basic, everyday sort. For instance, you might find joy in eating a pie with your brother, playing baseball with your dad, or walking through the woods with your sons. Staying conscious of these simple things can help you become more content.;
, Cultivating mindfulness will help you stay in the moment instead of dreaming and scheming about how you can acquire more things and attracting more attention.


Pay close attention to the physical sensations you encounter and the condition of your body. Notice your posture, rate of breathing, and facial expression, especially when your emotions are running high. Scan your body from top to bottom. Start with your toes, then move to your legs, torso, arms, hands, and head. How does each limb or body part feel? Is it tensed? Loose? Aching or sore?
Become more aware of your senses. Feel the wind in your hair, the water from rain or the shower hitting your face, and the soft flutter of sheets on your skin. Try the raisin exercise, in which you utilize all your senses, one at a time, to describe a raisin in excessive detail.
Various forms of meditation are also useful for cultivating mindfulness. You could try walking meditation or loving-kindness meditation in order to identify better with all people of the world and refocus your thoughts and attitudes.
Remember that your emotions are not in control of you; you are in control of them. Your emotional reactions do not define you, only your actions do.

, Being selfish and narcissistic make us always want more. Many people get trapped in the cycle of “keeping up with the Joneses” and chasing after the newest styles, toys, cars, and technology. But doing so is directly at odds with the objective to be content with what you have. Generosity can help you overcome these selfish feelings.


Offer what you have to others, both in terms of time and material goods.Contact your local food bank, animal shelter, or soup kitchen and ask if they’re looking for volunteers. If they are, sign up for a few hours each week. You’ll not only provide a practical and important service to your community, but you’ll build your own sense of contentment as well.
If you do not have time to donate, purchase some canned goods and donate them to homeless shelters or food pantries. Dry goods like pasta are a good choice. Canned fruits and vegetables also make good donations. Perishable items like bread and fresh produce are typically discouraged.
Check your closet and basement for things which you no longer utilize or have use for. Toys, old books you’ll never read again, and clothes are some of the most common things which we accumulate over the course of our lives. If they do not excite you, pack them in a box or bag and donate them to second-hand stores.

, It is enough to recognize how lucky you are each day. It's easy to give thanks for all the small things in your life.


Express gratitude for your health. When you breathe in, for instance, stay conscious of your good health (if applicable). When you wake and open your eyes in the morning, recognize how lucky you are to have eyes to see (if applicable).
When you watch TV with your family or friends, you can recognize how lucky you are to have such great people to spend time with. You could also be thankful that you have time to watch and resources to own a TV.
If your dad is really helpful when you’re trying to work through some homework, say, “Thank you. I really appreciate all your assistance.”
Remember to be thankful for the basics. Food, shelter, family, friends, and a job are all that's truly needed.
Keep a gratitude diary. Write down all the things you are grateful for daily in your gratitude diary. It does not matter if there is repetition for some things you are thankful for on multiple days.
Read the news. Understanding how others live and what conflicts are going on in the world will help you better understand your own place in the world relative to others.

, When you’re feeling frustrated or bored with your material goods, think about each particular object’s history. Ask yourself, Who gave it to you? When? Why? Answer these questions in the form of a story in order to decide whether it is worth keeping. For instance, when you see your TV, you might think, “This TV was a birthday gift from my wife. She bought it because she knew I was tired of the old, poor-quality TV I had before. We have spent many happy hours watching films and shows on this TV.”


If the item has a special resonance for you, as the TV in the foregoing example does, you should retain it.
If nobody gave you the object in question, but you bought it yourself, ask yourself if it brings you joy. Do you still associate it with certain happy memories? Can you imagine life without it? If not, you should discard it.
Hold onto only those things which bring real joy. When you pick up, think about, or look at a certain personal object, if it does not make you feel like it belongs in your life, or if it doesn’t bring a smile to your face, you should discard it.Don’t let your objects and possessions rule or define you. Don’t hold onto things just because you might someday have a use for them.

, See the best in people and don’t be quick to assume people are possessed of ulterior motives.


For instance, if you meet someone who you like and who seems to really like you, instead of thinking “We’ll just break up in a few months anyway, dating would be pointless,” be optimistic by taking a chance and going out with her.
Being optimistic doesn’t mean being naïve. Bad things happen, yes. But it is important to expect good things and keep a positive mental attitude when faced with challenges.
When bad things do happen, ask yourself: is this situation really that bad? Is there anything good that might come of it? Is there a way for me to learn from this that I can apply to future experiences?

, Recognize that you don’t know everything. Be honest about your faults and weaknesses. Don’t obsess over your reputation, or take serious offense over what people who do not know you well think of you. While you shouldn’t allow people to walk all over you or verbally abuse you to your face, you should understand that people often say things which are stupid and untrue. Recognizing that the people who say hurtful things about you or those you care for have problems which you did not cause can bring an inner peace and contentment.


If you’ve hurt someone, or lashed out in anger, apologize. Say, “I am sorry for hurting you, can you please forgive me?”

, These things can bring happiness, but being truly content requires that your contentment is not linked exclusively or primarily to them.


If you lose the job or partner that you love, find something new to bring contentment. Remember that there are many jobs and many people who can make you happy.

, Instead of worrying about what you deserve, or what others should do for you, learn to be thankful for what you have. If your parents give your brother a big vacation for his birthday and they give you only a night out at the movies, don’t hold a grudge against either your brother or your parents. Instead, be thankful you had the night out. Don’t obsess over what you did or didn’t get. Doing so will reduce your overall contentment.


Explore why you feel entitled to more than you’re receiving.Do you feel snubbed? Do you think you’re better than the person who received more than you did?
Look for the upside to your jealousy. For instance, imagine you are jealous of a friend who was asked to donate to a good cause when you weren’t. You might be jealous of the person who was asked. But upon reflection you might realize you were jealous because you wanted to donate to a good cause as well. This means your heart’s in the right place.

, Find time for family and friends who care about and support you emotionally. Talk with them about your hopes, dreams, and desires.


For instance, if you get a raise at the office, you should share it with your family or close friends. Host a small get-together to mark the occasion at your home or at a restaurant.
Be generous with your praise and complements. If you see a friend wearing a handsome shirt, say “Wow, that shirt looks great on you.”
Being happy and content is a positive feedback loop. When you’re with people who are content, you’ll feel more content. Your contentment will make them feel more content as well.

, Familiarity might, over the long term, make it seem as though you know everything about them, but there is always more to discover. Ask what they think about current goings-on in their work life or their view of current events.


Watch the news with your partner regularly and discuss topics of importance.
When your partner returns from work or school, ask how their day went. Don’t just take “Fine” or “Okay” for an answer. Press them about who they talked or what they learned.
Dig deep into your partner’s life and you’ll stay content with them.

, For instance, when thinking of your partner, do not make the fact that he or she snores or has poor grammar their defining feature. Instead, take a slightly idealized view of your partner. In other words, focus mostly on their good qualities.


When your partner is complex and has a many-layered personality, you will be more interested over the long term. People in long-term, satisfying, and content relationships see their partner’s flaw and foibles, but perceive them overall in an idealized way. For instance, recognize that your partner might be constantly late, but concentrate first and foremost on their great sense of humor, sharp mind, and incisive analytical acumen.

,

Emotional addiction is the state of constantly chasing after someone who makes you feel good. If you are emotionally addicted to someone who does not love you back, or to the same degree that you love them, you will end up bitter, confused, and hurt. In order to avoid emotional addiction, build healthy relationships in which you and the other individual mutually value and care for each other.

To break the love addiction pattern, step back from your current or recent love relationships and evaluate them objectively. Make a list of all the negative behaviors you’ve engaged in with past romantic partners and compare them with behaviors in your current relationship. Negative emotional behaviors in a relationship context include dependency; short to nonexistent intervals of time between romantic partners or relationships; an inability to gain full closure on past relationships; and a belief in or pursuit of a perfect “soul mate.”
If your current relationship evinces signs that it, too, is a product of emotional addiction, break it off and take some time to assess how you can be happy outside of a relationship. Take at least six months of alone time during which you do not date, flirt, or engage in sexual liaisons with anyone.
Compare your relationships as an adult to the relationships you had with parents and other authority figures in your life as a child. For instance, perhaps you had a father who never paid attention to you unless you did something to irritate him. As an adult, maybe you go out of your way to irritate many of your partners because you feel they do not pay enough attention to you.
Accept yourself as you are, and learn to accept others who you decide to date in the future. Spend time with people who accept you in that way as well.
Judge people by their actions, not their words. If someone says that they don’t respect you, don’t rationalize their comments by interpreting it as a joke. Find someone who appreciates you for who you are.
Avoid engaging in a sexual relationship before an emotional relationship has developed., But doing something others love, remember, and are thankful for is equally important, and can yield an equal or greater amount of contentment. Find a way to make your current line of employment more beneficial more more people.


For instance, if you work as a janitor, you might feel your work is unrewarding or monotonous. However, you might explore your work as a janitor in order to find out how to reduce waste in your building. By reducing waste -- for instance through recycling or composting garbage -- you will be offering a valuable service to your whole community and, indeed, the whole world!

You can start by writing down your ideas about why you want to invent a new religion. Understanding the basic reason for your religion’s existence will be critical if you want it to be successful. You may want to start a religion:Because you are dissatisfied with ones that currently exist.
Because you are deeply inspired and/or have glimpsed secret knowledge that you would like to share.
To perform weddings and other ceremonies in your own way.
As a joke.
To be critical of other religions.;
, If your religion intends to explain broad questions about the origin of the universe, the nature of reality, and the future, you will want to develop a cosmology, which explains all of these things. Your religion’s cosmology might describe things like a creation story and projections about the eventual end of things. Be as creative or inspired as your religion calls for., The name of your religion should reflect its purpose and foundation, so do not choose it carelessly. Think about the central beliefs or messages of your religion, and try to reflect these in the word or phrase that will serve as its name. Names for religions invented in the past include:Discordianism
The Church of All Worlds
The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster
Scientology
Eckankar

, These might explain things like how it views relationships between people (Should you be charitable toward others? Act on your own interests?). These principles might also contain philosophical arguments, which can explain how your religion views the world differently than others. For instance, your religion’s principles might contain arguments proving the existence of its god(s), if any., Once your religion’s core ideas are worked out, you can start inviting other people to join you. Many experts suggest working slowly at first. You might talk to some of your own acquaintances, then build from there by word of mouth. When you have a trusted and fairly stable group, you can work with them to develop bylaws that explain how your religion will be organized and managed., Followers of your religion might start out by meeting at your home (or someone else’s). As it grows, you might look for a place that is more public, such as a café, a park, or somewhere else that is convenient. As your religion grows, you may look into more permanent meeting place, such as a rented or purchased building., If you are looking for inspiration while planning your religion, you can look into histories of other religions. Studying the world’s major religions can give you ideas, but you can also read about more recent examples of invented religions, such as:L. Ron Hubbard’s Scientology.
The Church of All Worlds, inspired by Robert Heinlein’s science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land.
Discordianism, and its foundational text Principia Discorda.

, Churches that are recognized as nonprofit according to Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 501(c)(3) are automatically considered tax-exempt. You do not have to apply for this protection if you meet the code’s guidelines. This tax exemption can provide financial and legal protection to your religion, allowing it to practice freely according to its principles.Though tax exemption if automatic for recognized churches, you can still apply formally for it. This might be a good idea if you just want to be sure your religion qualifies for this protection, or if you think that officially applying will give it some legitimacy.
If you want to apply for tax-exempt status for your religion, use IRS Form 1023-EZ., The IRS uses the term “church” broadly, taking it to mean any recognized religious group. The primary guidelines for recognition stipulate that any revenue the church earns may not be used to financially benefit an individual or shareholders, or to influence political decision-making (lobbying). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will consider whether or not a religious group officially qualifies as a church if it meets some combination of features, including:It has a creed and worship practices
It has formal leadership
It has a clear history
Its membership is distinct from other religious groups
There is a recognized course of study to ordain leaders in the religion
The religion has some form of foundational texts or literary tradition
There are recognized or regular places to worship
The religion has a regular congregation and services

, A certificate of formation (sometimes called articles of formation) is a document used in many locations to formally incorporate a religion as a legally-recognized entity. If describes what a nonprofit organization will do, how it will be managed, etc. Check your local laws to see if it is necessary to file this document., Even if you qualify for tax-exempt status, you will want to apply for an EIN number from the IRS. This number will be necessary if your religion ever has any employees.Even if your religion is tax-exempt, you must withhold income tax on its employees.

, Tax-exempt status allows religious organizations to have special audit protection. Nevertheless, it is very important to keep excellent records of all your finances. These may include salaries, expenditures, money collected from members of your religion, etc., Studies have shown that the most successful religions have congregations that meet often. If your religion has services or worship procedures, consider holding them several times a week. You will be more likely to increase your religion's numbers if members and potential members have the flexibility to choose when to attend services., It is more important than ever to get the word out about your religion if you want to increase its members. Make sure that your religion has active representation on all social media, make flyers to distribute in your community, give away T-shirts, etc.

, People are more likely become regular members of your religion if you offer them a welcoming place to visit. Whatever your religious services entail, consider having them in a comfortable environment that is easily accessible. For instance, people that are intimidated by or turned off of traditional religious services might be more likely to attend an informal, coffee-house style service., Worshiping and increasing understanding of your religion’s core tenets might be the most important aspects of your services. However, offering additional programs can increase the sense of community among your religion’s members, while still keeping people close to the religion itself. Consider incorporating activities like:Music for services and entertainment
Game nights
Potlucks
Sports
Reading groups
Social gatherings (youth groups, retiree meetings, etc.)
Community service (beautification projects, prison outreach, food drives, etc.)

Find ways to grow your group.",How to Start a Cult," There are lots of things that it would be possible to form cults around, but they need to be generally positive activities, concepts, or ideas that you think are worth devoting time to, and getting other people to see the good in. You need to pick something with the potential to change lives for the better.


It's possible to form a cult around French cheese, Star Wars, or string theory, if you really believe that the subject or idea has the potential for positive good in the world. It doesn't need to be weird, or especially complicated, and in fact it's probably better if it's relatively normal.
Cults, while often religious in nature, do not need to be. Cult behavior involves a fervent devotion to a particular person, object, or idea. Groups can form around almost anything. You could form a canasta cult, or a World of Warcraft cult, if you want. Just make sure it's positive, good, and harmless.;
, You might say that you love Chef Boyardee Ravioli, but is it really worth worshipping in a cult-like way? Cults can only form around things about which it's possible to become very passionate, things that are possible to devote yourself to deeply, and find connections to in different parts of your life.


When we talk about cult movies, they're often very specific, quirky, and present a unique worldview that speaks very deeply to a small group of people, but confuse a great many other people.
Star Wars, Star Trek, and many kinds of sci-fi have immersive mythologies and deep universes that are possible to stay really engaged in, which is why we often say they have ""cult-like"" followings and longer Wikipedia pages than some presidents. The Kardashians? Not so much.

, Your first question if you're forming a cult should be: would the world be a better or worse place if everyone was as enthusiastic about this thing, as we are, or as I am? If the answer is that the world would be better, objectively, that people would indeed lead better lives if they also worshipped Tom Brady's throwing glove from the Super Bowl, then you're on a positive and harmless track.


Often, cults are manipulative psychological enterprises organized by a single charismatic individual. They're organized to seem as if the good of the group is the goal of the cult, when in actuality all activities are designed to benefit the leader of that cult. Jonestown, the Heaven's Gate, and the Manson Family are perhaps all tragic examples of this., If you're going to throw the word ""cult"" around, you better make sure you're informed about the subject you're going to hype to a group, so you don't come off as a make-believe guru, or some kind of snake-oil seller.


If you're going to form the Cult of Star Trek, you need to know a lot more than what color Spock bleeds. You need to know which episode he first bleeds in, what the significance of that color is in the greater context of the color-schema in the series, and how that affects your interpretation of Star Trek's utopian worldview. Get reading those fan blogs.

, Most cults have single leaders, or they're typically called collectives. If you're the one forming the cult, it's likely that you're the leader, but you need to make sure that your cult is organized for good purposes, not for your own material gain, or purposes of power grabbing.


Cult leaders are typically charismatic and manipulative, but if you're going to form yours collectively, it's a good idea to pick someone who has the good of the group at heart. The person who wants to be the leader is the last person you should pick.

, By what rules, concepts, and moral code will your cult organize itself? What is the ultimate goal of the cult? How will you use Star Trek to change all your lives, and perhaps the lives of many others, for the better? What's your big message for the world?


Focus especially on the issue of how you'll use this to transform your lives for the better. The difference between a Star Trek Cult and a Star Trek Fan Club isn't necessarily the fervency of your adoration for Star Trek, but how you use that fervency to change your life.
It's helpful to write up these documents, but probably leave the world ""cult"" off of things. You don't want to give people the wrong idea.

, All cults have governing texts which have the virtue of being both mysteriously vague, pseudo-profound, and easy to read by a wide variety of people.If you want your cult to grow and attain a sense of legitimacy, it's a good idea to self-publish your guidelines for life, or your teachings as a group.

, Fair warning: people will probably find the idea of a cult about anything pretty strange, and you may face a lot of hostility and backlash if you're really public with your cult. It's good to have a quiet, private place where you can do the things you want to do, the way you want to do them.


If you've got a Star Trek Cult forming, it's likely you won't be doing anything much more significant at first than watching episodes, having in-depth conversations, and maybe re-enacting a scene or two, which it's perfectly possible to do from someone's living room.
If you're brave, you could try meeting in in public parks, or other places where you might attract some attention, but it might not be the kind of attention you want.

, All clubs, organizations, and groups need good slogans, cults included. It's an easy way to sum up what you do, organize around a singular idea, and keep everyone focused around the topic. Slogans should be memorable, simple, and multipartite, so they've be mysterious and vague in equal measure.


""All Things Fly In Space"" might work for your Star Trek cult. Or maybe quotes from the show: ""I was born in Iowa, I only work in outer space."" Make it memorable, and organic.

, When you meet people in public, start gradually bringing in the concepts and the obsession that you've decided to shape your life around, to start growing the group. Become an evangelist for whatever it is you've decided to adulate.


Again, you may experience hostility and a lot of resistance at first, so you should try to market the less extreme aspects of your ideas. The utopian fun of Star Trek? Good selling point. Your plans of building a galaxy class star-cruiser in a warehouse in Queens? Maybe save that for later.

, Cults are singular. If you're going to be a full-fledged member, or even a leader, in a cult of Star Trek, you can't be messing around watching other sci-fi, or doing things that aren't in line with the noble tenants of Trek. Make sure that you and everyone else in the group realigns your priorities to fall in line with the singular-minded concepts of the cult.


Often, cults live together, communally. Consider moving into a place and giving it a name, something like, ""The Enterprise."" This will allow everyone to grow and develop the common idea together.

, One way to really get people to fall into your cult head-first is to make your idea seem like the only way of answering the problems of the world. You're not requiring simple excitement about Star Trek here, you're talking about total devotion to the transcendent power of James Kirk and Co. That means you've got to present it as the one true way.


Often, this is where cults get a little manipulative. Try to have healthy discussions and debates, just be good at presenting your ideas to the group. If other people think Star Wars has equally good merits, you need to be well-versed on the anarchy associated with a Star Wars influenced worldview. Preach it and believe it., Keep doing what you do. How you choose to let your idea change your life and the lives of others for the better will largely depend on your concept. At what point does the cult become more serious than watching re-runs of Trek and eating Cheetos? When does positive change start to occur?


Maybe you start writing all you congressmen to take the tenants of Star Trek more seriously, devoting resources and time to science and exploration, taking the equality of gender, race, species, and class more seriously, and even abandoning the ancient Earth concept of ""greed.""

, Let your group form obvious, local, and immediate changes for the good in your community. Hold weekly free breakfasts with accompanying Star Trek viewing parties, or consider holding equality workshops and giving talks in full Federation Starfleet regalia. Let people know what you're about., What will be your criteria and your process for taking in new members? How will your group expand and grow, without losing it's core identity and values? What will new members add? What will added publicity take away? What are your ultimate goals for the group? It's important to come to a consensus and take this ideas seriously.


Keep a strong foot-hold rooted in the real world, and in your core beliefs, both. You need to make sure that groups like this don't transform into something more ominous and more destructive. Are all your behaviors lined up with the original tenants of the organization? How can you reclaim those core ideas?

If you still live at home, and your parents are strict or very religious, it may be a good idea to wait. Try to consider how your parents may react, and whether or not the conversation needs to happen now.Honesty is generally good for most relationships. It can create less tension and promote an open dialogue between you and your parents. If you and your parents have a generally open relationship, it may not be a problem to tell them you're becoming a Satanist.
However, in the case of religious differences, being honest may create unnecessary strife. Consider how strict your parents are regarding religion specifically. If you're still living at home, and your parents are very stringent in their beliefs, coming out as a Satanist can create a tense home environment. In some cases, your parents may even kick you out if they find out you're a Satanist. You may want to wait until you've moved out to talk to your parents and practice in private until then.;
, It is very normal to experience feelings of anxiety and apprehension when having any difficult conversation. You will probably go into the conversation with a sense of unease. Instead of pushing such feelings away, allow yourself to experience them. If you accept anxiety ahead of time, you will be better emotionally prepared for the conversation itself.Try to engage in relaxing exercises. Practice deep breathing or do some yoga stretches. Go for a long walk to clear your mind.
Reframe how you're thinking about the conversation. Instead of focusing on the potential fall out, try to see things from a more positive perspective. Think of this as you being open with your parents. Consider the benefits of having an open dialogue in your home. Try to look at the conversation as an exciting challenge rather than a burden.

, Telling your parents about becoming a Satanist can be difficult. There are many misconceptions about what Satanism is, and many people assume Satanists worship the devil or engage in witchcraft. In order to help you stay on track during the conversation, plan ahead. Think about what you want to say before beginning the talk.Prepare a few phrases explaining Satanism, as well as the factors that inspired you to convert. You may want to jot your thoughts down and then look through these notes. Try to find the best way to phrase your feelings.
Avoid over planning, however. Allow for some flexibility. If you plan a speech too specifically, you risk going into the conversation with stringent expectations of how it will unfold. You need to be prepared to let the conversation happen naturally.

, Where and when you talk can be as important as the conversation itself. You want to find a time where both you and your parents are free. Plan to talk in a space without outside distractions.As difficult conversations occasionally run over, choose a time where both you and your parents are free. Choose an early weekday evening, for example, where neither you nor your parents have plans or obligations.
Choose the right place to talk. As the conversation may be heated, a neutral setting may be a good idea. You can go to a quiet coffee shop, for example. Avoid outside distractions. Leave your phone powered off or on silent during the conversation.

, Going into the conversation, think about your family's belief system. This can help you gauge and prepare for the potential reaction. If your parents are very Christian or otherwise religious, they may have preconceived notions about Satanism. However, if your parents are generally non-judgmental about their beliefs, the conversation may run smoothly.


Do not assume parents who are irreligious, atheist, or agnostic will not be wary of Satanism. Due to the many misconceptions about the belief system, they may have reservations as well. This is why it's a good idea to prepare ahead of time to make sure you know how to explain Satanism effectively.
Even if your parents are not angry, some parents may not take Satanism seriously. Nonreligious parents especially may be more inclined to think of Satanism as a trend or fad than a legitimate belief system. With calm conversation, you may eventually get them to better understand your beliefs. It's a good idea to be prepared for laughter or mockery on behalf of your parents. If you see this coming, you'll be able to better handle your emotional reaction when it occurs.

, When your parents hear the word ""Satanist,"" they may immediately assume Satanism is on par with devil worship. Calmly explain to your parents that most Satanists do not believe in supernatural deities, and the concept of Satan is mostly metaphorical. This may ease a lot of your parents' concerns.Explain that Satanists believe fantasies are important to experiencing and making sense of the human condition. Symbolism and metaphor allow people to build meaning. To Satanists, Satan represents embracing worldly pleasures over supernatural deities and abstract beliefs. It also signifies an acceptance that there is little inherent meaning in the universe.
It can be helpful to tell your parents many Satanists feel they are essentially atheists in many respects. The meaning of the term atheism is more readily understood, and may be helpful to use when explaining Satanism to your parents. Explain Satanists do not literally attempt to raise the devil, and any connection felt with Satan is an extension of the self. Satan is more of an alter-ego for Satanists than a literal entity that is worshipped.

, Many people are surprised to find Satanists do not, by nature, believe in evil or cruelty. Satanism is more of a call for rationality and personal accountability than a tendency towards negativity. Tell your parents about some of the belief systems behind Satanism to help them see its positive aspects.Explain that satanists believe in personal accountability over adherence to strict religious doctrine. Tell your parents the identification with Satan is metaphorical and marks a rejection of traditional beliefs. Satanists believe in questioning all teachings and taking responsibility for their own decisions.
Reassure your parents satanists generally believe in doing good in the world and towards others. However, Satanists believe goodness is a choice. They believe the universe is neither good nor bad, but indifferent. They also reject the idea of a soul or a spiritual side. Satanists identify as completely carnal in nature.
Due to the emphasis on independent thought, Satanists believe many different things and choose the path of Satanism for different reasons. Tell your parents about your personal beliefs regarding Satanism, and the reason you're becoming a Satanist.

, The conversation may get heated, especially if your parents are opposed to you becoming a Satanist. While it can be frustrated to feel your beliefs are being attacked, try to listen. Make a conscious effort to listen at least as much as you talk during your conversation. Allow your parents to vent their frustrations or concerns. While you may not agree, remember the point is to understand. The more your understand your parents' perspective, the better chance you have of addressing their concerns and explaining your side., ""I""-statements are statements phrased in a way that allow you to take accountability for your feelings. Instead of forcing objective judgment on a situation, you're expressing how another person's actions made you feel. Using ""I""-statements can be helpful as they reduce feelings of hostility and blame.An ""I""-statement has three parts. It begins with ""I feel..."", after which you immediately state your emotion. From there, you would state the behavior that caused that emotion. Lastly, you explain why you feel the way you do.
For example, say you become frustrated during the conversation at one point. You may be tempted to say, ""You guys are really judging me and pushing your belief systems on me without listening to my side."" This statement comes off as both hostile and judgmental and will likely do very little to help resolve the situation.
You can easily rephrase the above sentiment using an ""I""-statement. Say something like, ""I feel judged when you keep bringing up your own religion without letting me talk because this makes me feel like you're not listening to my side.""

, You will likely get some resistance during the conversation. Your parents may disagree with your beliefs or fail to understand them fully. Try to stay patient and meet resistance respectfully.Reassure your parents you do respect their beliefs. If they raised you in a certain religious background, they may feel rejected by you choosing Satanism. Tell your parents you appreciate them exposing you to their faith, even if you no longer follow it.
If you have any reading materials on Satanism, recommend them to your parents. Allow them to explore the belief system on their own time. They may come around eventually.

, You should make it clear, at some point in the conversation, what you hope to gain. Consider what you really want from the conversation, and think of concrete ways to move forward.Tell your parents what you want. Maybe you just want them to respect your wishes. However, you may want active support and investment. You may want your parents to learn about Satanism, and encourage your interests.
Be clear about how you want to move forward. You can say something like, ""I hope you better understand me from this conversation. Moving forward, I hope you can accept my beliefs and not try to change me.""
You may have to compromise. Your parents may, for example, agree to avoid trying to change your mind. However, they may be wary to openly support or encourage your beliefs. While this can be disheartening, remember feelings change with time. If you did not get the perfect response this time around, you may get a better response in the future.

, After you've had the talk, you'll need think about what boundaries you want between you and your parents. Think about how and when religion will be a topic for you and your parents.


When it comes to religion, should the topic be strictly off the table at family events? Would you rather be able to share your religious experiences with one another openly? Are you okay with your parents asking you questions about your beliefs, as long as they do so in a respectful manner?
Set clear boundaries regarding how faith with be discussed and approached between you and your parents.

, Mutual respect is very important when it comes to religion and personal belief. It may take awhile to figure out how to navigate your differences. Find concrete ways you and your parents can respect one another. For example, you could agree to attend church on special occasions, like religious holidays, as it's important to your parents to go as a family. In turn, your parents could agree to not push you to attend church each Sunday., You may face some resistance becoming a Satanist. If the belief system is important to you, do not compromise. You are entitled to have your own beliefs and opinions, regardless of your parents wishes. If your parents try to change your mind, respectfully tell them you've made your decision.

, When it comes to navigating religious differences, finding common ground can be very helpful. Have your parents make a list of their religion's belief systems. Make a list of your beliefs as a Satanist. Compare notes. You may be surprised what you find in common.After examining the list, approach your parents and tell them you want to find common ground. You could say something like, ""As Catholics, you and dad believe in the Golden Rule. Satanists also believe in that rule. The only difference is, we believe in doing it for ourselves rather than a higher power. However, it's fundamentally the same thing.""
Your parents may be comforted to find how much Satanism has in common with other religious beliefs. This may help smooth over misconceptions and allow your parents to accept you for who you are.

Throw away unneeded clutter.,
Downsize your wardrobe.,
Be more conscious when shopping.,
Look at your electronic clutter.",How to Live Simply2," Many people feel as if they're drowning in unnecessary clutter. If this sounds like you, making an effort to downsize can be helpful.


Go through one section of your house at a time. You can make a schedule if it helps. For example, you can do half the living room Monday, the other half Tuesday, the kitchen Wednesday, the bedroom Thursday, and so on.Go through closets, drawers, and other storage spaces. Clean everything out and sort it.
Remove anything that's obviously junk or garbage and toss it immediately. From there, consider what you could stand to get rid of. Do you really need that book you read freshmen year of college and haven't touched since? Are you ever actually going to repair that broken vase from two years ago? If you don't play that video game anymore, do you need to keep it around? Be honest with yourself about what items you've been holding onto needlessly.See if there's anything you could sell or recycle. Make piles of old odds and ends to take to a local thrift store. See if any of the junk you're tossing is recyclable.Put whatever you're keeping back in a drawer in a neat fashion. Take this as an opportunity to reorganize your surroundings in a simpler way. For example, make a designated underwear drawer, sock drawer, jewelry drawer, and so on., Many people end up wasting closet space on clothing they no longer use. Every few months, review your wardrobe. If you haven't worn an item in many weeks or if an item simply no longer fits, consider tossing it or donating it to charity as long as it's in good condition. Don't donate personal items like underwear or severely damaged or worn-out items. Throw these away.

, When you go to the store, try to be more aware of what you're buying. How much food do you end up throwing away each week because you don't need it? How many items do you buy on impulse and never use? Be more aware when shopping. Make a list before going to the grocery store and do not deviate. Avoid impulse purchases. Think over an expensive purchase for a few days before making it. Try your best to only buy what you need., Electronic clutter is also a problem. If your computer or phone's storage is getting low, review what you need and do not need.


Periodically clean out your e-mail inbox. Delete old or unread e-mails so you can more easily find e-mails when you need them.Delete old photographs off your phone. Back them up on a computer or external hard drive so you have more space.
Create a better organization system on your laptop or computer. For example, create folders for pictures, word documents, music, and other electronic items rather than simply saving everything to the desktop.

Cut back on expenses.,
Limit communication.,
Consider a basic cell phone.",How to Live Simply3," Stop buying things you don't absolutely need and stick to the basics only. Review how you spend your money and see where you could get by with less.


Consider getting rid of your credit cards. Credit cards make it easy to spend money you don't have and buy things you could otherwise not afford. If you're looking to live simply, you can remove this temptation by canceling your credit card.Do you have cable? If so, think about canceling your subscription. Not only will this cut down on money, it will motivate you to engage in more fulfilling activities than simply watching TV.
Look at your monthly expenses and see if there's anything you don't really use or need. Are you actually getting your money's worth on your monthly gym membership? Do you subscribe to a magazine you never actually read? Look for expenses that can be easily cut., In modern society, people are in constant communication with one another via cell phone, e-mail, and social media. However, sometimes less is more. Consider limiting your communication a bit and sticking to meaningful conversations with people who really matter rather than scattering communication across many different outlets.


Take the occasional social media break. Consider going a week each month without social media. Deactivate your Facebook for a few days. Sign off of Twitter. Avoid e-mail unless you're sending essential messages for work or school.Try to reach out in other ways. Ask a friend out to coffee and agree to put away your phones and talk. Send a longer, more thoughtful e-mail to a family member in which you express a variety of thoughts and feelings. Communicate less but do so in a way that fosters greater understanding and depth.

, While smart phones can be convenient, you may benefit from a more basic cell phone. If you don't need a smart phone for work, consider a phone that makes and receives calls alone. This can reduce the stress and temptation that comes from the constant influx of information and media related to a smart phone."

Absorb media wisely.,
Eat slowly.,
Be more environmentally conscious.,
Spend time alone.",How to Live Simply4," Living in the information age means we have access to a nearly unlimited source of information. While in some ways this is exciting, people often end up inadvertently consuming unnecessary facts and tidbits. Try to absorb media in a more conscientious way. Stick to reading and learning about things that truly matter to you.


Choose to read about what's important. For example, spend a few hours each night catching up on the news. Try to install ad-blocking software so you don't get distracted by target ads and click bait type sponsored content.Read and learn about what's really important to you. The internet can be an overwhelming resource but also a valuable one. For example, if you're interested in French history, there's an unending supply of articles about the subject online. However, don't feel the need to click on a link your friend posts on Facebook about a movie you've never seen or a news story that feels unimportant to you.Work on filtering your social media. How many friends do you really care to keep track of? Try to cater your Facebook newsfeed to focus on posts from people you're close to and talk to on a regular basis., Oftentimes, we end up eating in excess due to fast eating. Slow down when chewing your food and allow yourself to savor the flavor. This will lead to you eating less and learning to appreciate your food more. Slow, conscientious eating is a great way to simplify.


You should also seek to change overall eating habits. Choose one place to eat in your home and avoid eating in front of the television set or on the couch. Even if you're eating by yourself, set the table. This will help you value the experience of eating and food.Put your fork down between every bite. Pay attention to the texture and flavor. Drink water in between bites. Try to appreciate the moment and the meal.Don't do anything else when you eat. Avoid your phone. Do not read a book. Simply enjoy one-on-one time with your meal. Enjoy the experience of eating in and of itself., Many people feel frustrated with rampant consumerism. You can work on being more environmentally conscious to live a simpler life.


Try growing some of your own fruits and vegetables if you have a backyard and live in an area where it's feasible to grow. If you're short on space, you could try growing herbs and small fruits and veggies out of pots on your porch or in windowsills.
Watch your trash output. Try to use goods that can be reused and rewashed, such as cloth handkerchiefs over tissues. Make an effort to recycle biodegradable items.

, Many people feel the need to fill their time with needless activities. This can lead to stress as you'll have an excess of commitments and obligations that do not necessarily leave yourself feeling fulfilled. Try to schedule a little alone time each week to teach yourself to appreciate your own company. Go for a walk alone. Read a book by yourself. Take a warm bath. Allow yourself tome time to be alone with your own thoughts.

Break down barriers in the right order.",How to Witness," The power to witness—and do so effectively—comes directly from the Holy Spirit. This might seem like an easy truth to remember as a Christian, but even the most devout Christians can occasionally struggle to rely on God's strength instead of their own.


Think of it this way: if you start to tire out and wonder how you can keep making an effort to witness, you don't need to worry about drawing strength from your own worn-out spirit. The strength you need will flow in through the Holy Spirit, as long as the efforts you are pursuing are efforts that God wants you to continue with.;
, The power to witness comes from God, and the glory must also be given to God. Witnessing to others is an action that should be done to spread the gospel—God's good news—so your focus should remain on that cause. It can be easy, however, to slip up and start focusing on how your actions reflect on you.


In 1 Corinthians 15:1-4, the Apostle Paul essentially defines the gospel, or ""God's good news,"" as the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.Meditate this message and make it the center of the message you share with others.
When you catch yourself worrying about how others might look at you or feeling prideful about your efforts and accomplishments, pause, and refocus on the central theme of witnessing described above.

, It allows you to communicate with God on a personal level. Praying for the ability to be an effective witness can bring you a sense of comfort, strength, and guidance.


Pray for guidance at the start of each witnessing experience and throughout each experience.
Pray for those who you are in the process of witnessing to.
Pray for guidance and courage even when you do not expect to witness to anyone. You never know when an unexpected opportunity to share the gospel might come up.

, Witnessing to others in today's world can be more than a little intimidating. More likely than not, you'll eventually end up speaking with someone who not only disagrees with what you're trying to say, but does so aggressively. Throughout your efforts, though, it's important to keep in mind the source of strength backing you. Doing so may not make a difficult situation any easier or less frightening, but it can give you the boost of courage you'll need to make it through.

, Your personal faith experience will probably make up a large portion of your argument, but someone you witness to may have a question that cannot be answered with insight from your own experience. As such, it's important that you have a decent understanding of Scripture.


You don't need to be a theologian to witness to people, of course, but having a good layman's amount of knowledge about Scripture certainly helps.
If you don't know the answer to a question or challenge posed, offer to do a little reading and research about it. Follow through and return with your insights after consulting the Bible or biblical sources.

, In other words, don't be a hypocrite. In spite of what the world might tell you, there is nothing wrong with sticking to Biblical principles regarding the right way to live and behave. Explaining the benefit of a “clean” life to nonbelievers who disagree with those principles will be far less meaningful if you are known for breaking those rules in your own life, though.


Philippians 2:15 encourages the Christian to be ""blameless and harmless without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world."" Living a godly life is about more than just making yourself look good or trying to prevent yourself from looking bad. In living out the virtues you've gained through your acceptance of Christ as Savior, you can demonstrate to the secular world that something about you is good, different, and desirable.

, Forgiveness can be a difficult thing, but it is essential nonetheless. Just as you have been forgiven by God, so must you forgive others. Only in your willingness to do so can you hope to convey the message of God's forgiveness to others.

, When you wrong someone, be honest about it and apologize. Even if he or she does not grant you forgiveness, you have done your part. Admitting that you are imperfect does not weaken your position as a Christian witness. On the contrary, doing so makes it easier to demonstrate the need for divine mercy since you can use your own life as an example.

, You can witness to strangers, but as a general rule, try to form personal relationships with the people you intend to witness to. Take an interest in their lives and be genuine about it. If all you do is preach to people without treating them with love and as individuals, your message may end up being tuned out.

, God's mercy and grace can get you through the tough times in your life, but those who are without God do not have the same source of encouragement to lead them through life's difficulties. They may have their own ways of coping, but even if someone seems “fine” without your help, you should still demonstrate a genuine willingness to offer support.


Treat nonbelievers around you with the same care and love you would treat your church friends with, as well as the same care and love you would hope to be treated with by others.
Do not force your goodwill onto others, though. Make the offer, but if the other party seems uncomfortable or suspicious, let it rest.

, When your church holds a community event or when you have an extra ticket to a good Christian concert, invite one or more of your non-Christian friends along. Present the invitation as a way for them to learn more about your life and the things that are important to you, rather than trying to guilt or pressure them into attending.


The events and activities you invite nonbelievers to do not need to be heavily steeped in a Christian message, though. Invite them along to a festival at your church, but also invite them to things like secular concerts, ball games, and picnics. Let them see you as a Christian among Christians, as well as a Christian living within a secular world.

, You can witness to people in a group, but having a meaningful discussion with someone is often easier when done one-on-one. Even when you do witness to people in a group, you must treat each person as an individual with separate interests, ideas, and concerns.

, You don't need to schedule or set aside a specific time to witness to the people in your life. Instead, try bringing up faith-related matters naturally as a part of standard conversation. For instance, you could talk about God over lunch or on the commute home.


Try to bring the topic up as naturally as possible. For instance, if a friend or acquaintance asks you how your weekend was, you could talk about what happened at church. On the other hand, if he or she is trying to hold a conversation with you about the previous night's ball game, don't abruptly change the topic to something of a religious nature. Forcing the topic will only seem rude and unpleasant.

, People are generally more willing to participate in a conversation about Christianity when you connect to them on pre-existing points of interest. For instance, you could speak to an artist about Christian art in the present and past. On the other hand, someone with an interest in archaeology might be more captivated by a conversation about various Christian artifacts.


Consider the story of Jesus speaking with the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4:1-42). As she drew water from the well, Christ told her about the ""living water"" he could offer her. He captured her attention by communicating with her about a basic interest—water—and, after connecting to her on a point of interest, he introduced the topic of salvation., If the person you're witnessing to already has a firm understanding of theological terms and Christian culture, you can probably get away with speaking in a theological manner. For most people, though, you'll need to explain things in the vernacular. Try not to throw around doctrinal terms like “consubstantiation,” as well as Christian slogans like “born again,” unless you plan on explaining the meaning of each., Your deepest, most intense understanding of God's gospel message likely comes from your personal experience with it. Share that experience when you witness to others. Be brief, yet precise, and make sure that those listening understand that your salvation came from Christ.


Essentially, your testimony should describe your condition before you accepted Christ, how you realized you needed a Savior, how you came to accept Christ as that Savior, and how your life has changed as a result.
Preferably, your testimony should only take up a few minutes worth of time. Any longer might cause the person listening to you to tune out.

, You need to be present for a dialogue with people and transparent about your faith. Be firm about your beliefs, but try not to appear “pushy.” Let the people around you know that you are very interested in speaking with them about Christ on an ongoing basis, but also engage them in unrelated conversation from time to time to avoid pressuring them and straining the bond between you.

, When you intend to speak with someone about Christianity, there are a few natural barriers you can expect to face when pushing through the conversation. Only in pushing past the first can you get into the second, and only by moving on through the second can you get to the third.Confront the first barrier by mentioning the name of Jesus. When you're in the middle of a conversation about sports, fashion, entertainment, or something similar, turning the conversation away from its current topic and onto Jesus Christ is as simple as mentioning the name of Christ. For something so seemingly simple, though, the introduction of the topic can be the most intimidating part of the experience.
Attack the second barrier by introducing the gospel. As the conversation continues, you'll need to share God's good news—the gospel—with those to whom your speaking. The idea is to concisely summarize who Christ is, what He has done for them, and why they should want Him in their lives.
Break down the final barrier by asking the individual to receive Christ. Understand that this part may or may not come up in your first conversation with someone. Eventually, though, you'll need to directly encourage the individual to turn to Jesus. You can share the gospel until you're blue in the face, but your duty as a witness is not over until you directly encourage the individual in question to accept Christ as his or her own personal Savior.

Find out what you want in life.This is the hardest question.,
Set your goals.,
Don't let obstructions stand in your way.,
Always believe in yourself.,
Accomplish greatness you need.",How to Choose Your Fate," We always have a choice; follow our parents' footsteps, or decide what we want for ourselves, it is hard and simple all at the same time, how? When we are young we say ""I want to be a fireman, policeman, doctor"" but as we grow older, the fate is changing already, paths are colliding, our minds are thinking to much on what is important, these days ""happiness, money, commitments"" but we never have time to plan our own paths, finding that one thing that will make us all eternally happy, sit down, read a paper, search the internet, find something that screams out to your personality, something that will make you cry happy tears and plan that path, that fate, your new life.;
, Every life has a plan, but our schedules are always so booked, even if you want to do a certain task of volunteering it messes up plans with friends or family. When you want to schedule the goals and set them out, you need to find a calming place to relax your own mind, in the park, in your bedroom, even with music that relaxes you will be beneficial for you to find a way to focus on what you want, then just write, type and plan, remember to add dates where you can find a set target to be able to knock down the goal and move forward down your path.

, We have many distractions in life. They could be time consuming work, homework, people literally standing in your way, family or friends dragging you down or not believing in you. All you need to do is improvise. How can you handle being put down and still move forward? How can you keep up with your work and still plan your path? Firstly, don't let anyone drag you down, those who aren't there for you do not deserve to be in your life. You need people who stand beside you, not behind or in front, but by your side, ready to help you take on any more distractions, true friends, family will believe in your because you are a loved one, a son/daughter, no matter what, unless you are brought up in the torn family where love is not available, but you can easily find people to take there place, a teacher or group of believing friends. Second, work is easy, the planning is hard, easily find the time to do both, multi-task, hard to learn but if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish a lot, ask for help, friends, family, let them do a bit of work, gives you a break and time to relax the mind and open to new ideas.

, These days people drag you down, but life is about enduring, do not let the negative take over your mind, you can be strong without them, you can stand in a circle alone and still know that there is someone believing in you, YOU, so longs as you believe in yourself, you can go through any obstacle in your path just to gain what you need in life, our path is not a want it is a need due to finding your internal and eternal happiness, imagine finally, your goal was to graduate as a biophysicist, and when you get given the document, you feel your heart and mind fulfilled, and then you plan some more known you can go further, the sky isn't the limit, you can go further, the galaxy is vast. You will find supporters and believers during your travels.

, All steps can lead you to the path you choose, it isn't all straight through, it is narrow, curved, thick and heavy with a lot of obstacles in the way, emotional and physical, but as humans we have the capacity to push and break through anything that is thrown at us, make our mind, body and soul complete with the happiness we all rightfully deserve, and nobody can take it away, nobody can tell us what we are meant to be, we are our own person, our heart beats in our own chest, not those who do not believe, we are the only one who believes in us when others don't. Go forward, break through the barriers and good luck!

Track down the Meditations by Descartes.,
Purchase a copy of Bertrand Russell's, ""A History of Western Philosophy"" and Will Durant's, The Story of Philosophy and read them cover-to-cover.,
Read Plato.,
After reading the above (without skipping ahead) Next, find a copy of 17th Century Philosopher John Locke's A Letter Concerning Toleration, A Second Letter Concerning Toleration, A Third Letter for Toleration, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Two Treaties of Government.,
After you've swallowed that pill you'll need to move onto 18th Century Philosopher David Hume's An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, An Enquiry Concerning The Principles of Morals, and Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.,
So much reading, let's add another.,
is your next philosopher to read on.,
Next you will venture into the complex world of the German Philosopher Kant who virtually owned the 19th century and is considered more influential than even Friedrich Nietzsche.,
Now you're ready to get into 20th century philosophy which can be of either the Continental or Analytical variety.",How to Become a Western Philosophy Guru," Descartes was considered the father of Modern Philosophy. He rationalized and defined the precepts of what can be considered true.;
, The specific purpose of these books is to give you a spectrum / timeline and introduction to significant philosophers and how each of them fit in with one another, what was going on in the events and thoughts of their time and of course the basic premise of each of their philosophies and major works on the human mind, politics, economics, morals and ethics.
, It is arguable which of Plato's dialogs are most important, and after you have read Russell or Durant you'll have an idea which ones you want to read. Yet any such list must include Euthyphro, Apology of Socrates and Crito. It is hard to find an idea in philosophy that is not traceable back to Plato. As such, you do yourself a disservice to not start your readings with the father of philosophy. Similarly, you should not neglect his greatest pupil, Aristotle, whose Nicomachean Ethics stands at the head of all Ethics, and whose Metaphysics stand at the head of all Metaphysics.

, The first and the second to last of these works are considered to be the most important works by John Locke by most. You will gain an insight into understanding and interpretation theories by sensations and a ""perfect knowledge"" or instinct. note: Thomas Jefferson was heavily influenced by John Locke's ideas and works.
, There are other great works by David Hume but the three above are typically considered his most significant. David Hume and John Locke go hand-in-hand with one another.

, It's said when reading about the philosophy of the 17th Century excommunicated Jew, Spinoza you do not read his works, but instead you read about his life. Though there may be a great degree of accuracy in that statement you will need to read the significant work The Ethics. This read should be done slowly and carefully, allowing you to take in the full concepts of his work. You will gain a greater basis on religious views and begin to understand the concept of the natural God that can only work within it's nature. You will also see how philosophy and mathematics are so intertwined. You will learn how to read Spinoza correctly after completing this step.

, It is said he had written 99 volumes in his 84-years, not counting his plays, letters and other works. Luckily you don't have to read them all! Start by reading up on Voltaire. There are hundreds of books you will find on him, his exile, his return to France, his followers and the belief that the ""devil was in him.""

, What do you mean Kant mathematically proved that a higher entity must exist? Using both David Hume and John Locke's works in the highest degree against them to prove his theories, this 5'0"" tall little man upset and mangled the mathematical and philosophic followers of his era.

, This split represents a polarization of philosophy in the wake of Skepticism and Kant's Transcendentalism. Continental Philosophers: Friedrich Nietzsche, ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" and ""Beyond Good and Evil"". Søren Kierkegaard, ""Either/Or"" and ""The Sickness Unto Death"". Edmund Husserl, father of phenomenology, especially ""Philosophical Investigations"" or ""The Idea of Phenomenology"". Martin Heidegger, specifically his magnum opus Being and Time which asks What is being, or what does it mean to be? Jean-Paul Sartre, the father of existentialism, a philosophical system expounded in his Being and Nothingness. Jacques Derrida, especially Of Grammatology. Analytic Philosophers: Bertrand Russell is one of the big players here. Ludwig Wittgenstein's ""Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus"". W.V.O Quine ""Two Dogmas of Empiricism"" and ""Word and Object"".

Understand what the terms theist, atheist, and agnostic mean.,
Understand the difference between monotheism, polytheism, pantheism and omnism.,
Notice that proponents of each ideology hold their beliefs strongly.,
Find a common ground.,
Study your ""opponent"".",How to Understand the Difference Between Theism and Atheism," The theist believes in a god or gods while the atheist denies this belief and all others like it. An agnostic is one who believes that there is currently insufficient evidence to determine the existence of any deity. An agnostic will still always fall into the category of a theist or an atheist, also being an agnostic simply means they are admitting they don't know for sure that their viewpoint is true. In a strict philosophical sense, some scholars would argue that we are all agnostics about everything (epistemology) because we can never truly know anything, including our own existence.;
, Monotheists believe in only one god or divinity and reject any other form of deity. Polytheists believe in a set of many gods. Pantheists believe that everything in the universe is divine. Omnists (omnitheists) accept all gods and religions as equal. Of course, these statements may over-simplify for the sake of being concise.

, Theists may view atheists as immoral because they do not believe in a god/gods, while atheists may view theists as deluded for believing in a god/gods. Both parties hold their beliefs strongly and necessarily make sacrifices by subscribing to one over the other. Understanding this intensity will lead to more productive and personable debate that will further human understanding and community.

, Most ethical elements of many religions are agreeable to theists and atheists alike, e.g. the golden rule of Jesus: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,"" or as Rabbi Hillel put it, “Don’t do to others what you wouldn’t want done to you."" Most people agree with such a statement, and recognizing this common ground provides a buffer for the emotional issues surrounding belief vs. disbelief.

, Most atheists were once theists (or were raised in a theist tradition), but those who were not should consider the ideas of various forms of theism before discounting such ideas, and those who were raised as theists should study theist ideas with which they are unfamiliar. Many theists have been theists for their entire lives. Before satisfying debate can occur, both parties must understand their opponent by critically examining their ideas.

Choose the right house for your church.,
Examine your motivations for starting a home church.,
Seek guidance from local spiritual leaders.,
Choose three or four main leaders.,
Start off with studying religious doctrine at home.,
Seek sponsorship from an existing church.,
Think about the people you want to reach.,
Start with a small group.,
Keep the size manageable.,
Meet at least once a week.,
Read and discuss doctrine.,
Pray for one another.,
Consider traditional and creative worship elements.",How to Start a Home Church," While you may assume your home will be the place for your home church, this is not always the best idea. A home church should ideally be based in an area without any established churches nearby or where nearby churches are bigger and less intimate. Many people prefer smaller services, which is why they may seek out home churches. You should also pick an area that would be easy for potential members to reach, such as a home found in a central location in a city or town.Networking with other people with similar religious beliefs is important when starting a home church. This way, if your home is not appropriate for a home church, you can try finding someone else to volunteer.;
, You want to make sure you're starting a home church for the right reasons. A home church should be a collaborative environment where likeminded people come together to worship. Home churches are usually started if there are few established churches in an area or if existing churches are not meeting the needs of many people. The following reasons are valid reasons to start a home church:If existing churches have turned many people away, it may be necessary to start a home church.
If churches in your area are very large, many people prefer the intimacy provided by a home church.
If there are many people in your existing church who dislike the way doctrine is taught, you may find a home church can help.

, No one can start a home church without guidance. Existing spiritual leaders in your community are there to help. Reach out to spiritual leaders in your area whose beliefs are roughly in line with yours. Let them know you're planning on starting a home church and ask for support and suggestions.Look for established believers in your area that are known for their religious services. For example, if you're starting a Christian home church, talk to someone who runs a Christian-based charity and ask them for guidance.
If you do seek guidance within an existing church, make it clear you're not trying to challenge or upend that church. Explain that your motivations are simply to create a smaller, more intimate setting that is unlikely to replace an existing church.

, Home churches usually benefit from having a backbone of leaders. Just like elders or vestry in an established church, gather a group of three to four individuals to serve as leaders. Leaders can be family members, members of your existing church, or spiritual leaders in your community.Depending on the precise plan for your church, leaders can have different roles. For example, if you intend to have sermons, choose someone who is articulate and well-versed in your religion's doctrine to give sermons.

, Many home churches begin by studying religious doctrine with likeminded church goers. Studying doctrine can be a good way to gauge whether your congregation works well together. Study doctrine from your religion when you first start meeting with potential members of your home church to establish spiritual beliefs as an organization.Most religious doctrine is subject to a variety of interpretations. Studying doctrine together can help you get a feel for your church's spiritual beliefs and values. Find common beliefs to draw from as you form a church.
Schedule a regular meeting time for low-key readings and discussions. Do not appoint a lot of leaders or establish a budget. Let everyone get comfortable with one another first.

, Existing churches may want to help out a home church. Home churches are not necessarily seen as a threat or a challenge to existing religious institutions. Established churches will be understanding if a home church exists because certain people have trouble attending regular church services for a variety of reasons. Consider approaching a church for sponsorship.Choose a church that you respect and whose beliefs align with your own. Part of the benefit of a sponsoring church is that you have a higher authority to draw judgment from. In a home church, strong personalities can take over and guide your church in unwanted directions. A sponsoring church can help your congregation stay grounded.
Schedule a time to visit with the leader of the church you choose. Have a sit down meeting and explain your reasons for wanting to start a home church. Tell them you want a sponsoring church to guide you in your early days of leadership.

, As you start to gather members, think about why you started a home church to begin with. Draw in people with similar beliefs from your religious community. At first, many people may come and go from your home church out of curiosity. Learn to figure out which people fit in with your church's goals and values and reach out to them specifically to grow your congregation.For example, say you started a home church because the existing church in your area is difficult for many to reach. Look for people who frequently miss services due to difficulties with their commute. These people's needs would be met through your home church.
Choose sincere believers who have a genuine need for a home church. Many people like the idea of a home church because it seems fun and trendy. Make sure your members want to be part of a home church because you're providing them a specific spiritual experience.

, A home church does not need to start off with a huge congregation. In fact, most home churches start with only a few loyal members. Try starting out with a casual gathering of friends and family members who share your basic religious beliefs. From there, let the church grow organically as word spreads., Many home churches are designed to provide the intimacy larger churches lack. It's important to keep the size of your home church manageable, especially if you're using a smaller home for your church. Honestly assess how many people can fit into your home church considering the space you have and the needs of your members. For example, maybe you and your congregation are only comfortable with groups of around 10 to 20 people. Once you have roughly 10 to 20 regular churchgoers, it's okay to taper off seeking new members. Most home churches have small congregations.If you have a lot of members, more than one home church may crop up in the area. Do not think of this as a challenge or threat to your church. Remind yourself people prefer home churches due to the intimacy, and if you're at capacity there may be a need for more home churches in your area.

, Regular meetings are key to keep a home church going strong. Find a weekly meeting time that works for everyone. The advantage of a home church is that you do not have to meet on traditional worship days, especially if some members are unavailable on those days. If the time works for everyone, there is no reason a home church cannot meet on, say, a Tuesday night.In the early days of your church, you may have to play around with time a little before finding the right time for services.

, Try reading a section of religious doctrine each week. Afterwards, have a brief discussion about what the piece means and how to incorporate its lessons into your life.Part of the appeal of a home church is the increased intimacy. Therefore, allow everyone to participate equally in the discussion.
It can be helpful to have someone particularly knowledgable of your religion's doctrine lead the lecture. For example, say someone who majored in religious studies in college is part of your church. Have them lead the discussion.

, To foster a sense of community, reserve part of your services for praying for one another. The method you choose to do this is up to you and your congregation. Some people prefer silent prayer while others would prefer to have someone lead them in a general prayer for one another. Talk it over with your congregation to find a method of praying for each other that works.You can also say a general prayer for those around you that are in need. You can, for example, close with an invitation for people to pray silently for those in need in their lives.

, A home church provides a lot of flexibility for members. You do not have to stick to traditional forms of worship. Talk to members of your church and think about any traditional and non-traditional elements you want to include.


Things like confession, the recitation of certain prayers, or singing particular songs may be part of your religious traditions. Talk to your members about what traditional worship elements work for your home church.
You do not have to stick strictly to the traditional, however. Ask your members what creative forms of worship interest them. Some people may want to experiment with things like meditation, religious dance, or other less conventional forms of worship.

Figure out why you don't want to go to church.,
Think about your past record.,
Be prepared for resistance.,
Explain to your parents how important another activity is to you if there's something specific you want to do instead.,
Try to find some other religious activities you could do, such as a youth group, if you don't want to go to church at all.,
Seek their compassion.,
Confront your parents if your own beliefs vary with their church's beliefs.,
This may not work, but if you are desperate enough, then say to your parents something like this ""Do you want your children to be happy?""",How to Skive off Church," ""I don't feel like it"" may be enough of a reason for you, but it might not be enough for your family.;
, If you normally like to go to church but you don't care for it any more, consider talking to your family about the reason why. If you never liked church and you want to stop going, go on to the next steps.

, If your family goes to church on a regular basis and expects you to go along, you will have to either explain your situation or bargain with them.

, Tell them you will still keep going to church, but you want to skip just this once.

, Offer to go to one of those activities instead of attending church with your parents.

, If you're mature enough to make your own decisions and have your own beliefs, explain your own spiritual situation to your parents and family. Maybe you've simply lost interest in their church, but you still share the same faith. Or maybe your spiritual beliefs no longer align with theirs. Either way, try to spark a serious talk with your family about your faith and explain to them why you don't want to attend church.

, If you don't want to go because you feel your family's religion is not right for you, think it over carefully and articulate the reasons. Write down exactly how you feel, in as clear and detailed a manner as possible. Think like you're presenting an argument for the debate team, so don't be impassioned and irrational about it. Explain how you feel to your family and be prepared for some resistance since this is a big declaration to make.

, Chances are they will say yes. Then say ""Well, how do you think it makes ME feel to be dragged to church without any say?"" Try to protest about it so much that it gets on their nerves and then you eventually won't have to go to church.

This is their opinion; they are entitled to it, but if you want to research Satanism (not just an offshoot of it) you should seek the source/founding of the religion. At The Church of Satan's website you can find all the information you need or methods in which to obtain further information such as The Satanic Bible.;
, There is a difference between Satanism and Devil-Worship. Satanism, being referred to here in this Wiki-how, is the religion formed by Anton Szandor LaVey based on The Satanic Bible. Devil worship refers to the practice of believing in the reverse of Christianity. There are also theistic or traditional Satanists who believe in a real Satan, which members of the Church of Satan do not.

Learn the organization's foundations.,
Think about how common this is.,
Avoid becoming paranoid.,
Decide if there is an element of exploitation either financial or personal.,
Look for the key danger signals for medium level risks: It may be OK to have some association with them, but stay on guard.,
Investigate further.,
Look for high risk signs: These are usually signs that it has crossed the line into a dangerous or potentially dangerous organization.,
If you see these signs, it is best to do one or all of the following.",How to Recognise a Cult," Cults tend to have very simple and similar foundations and common factors having all or some of the following:


A charismatic founder, leader or leadership.
Have a structured central bureaucracy.
Simplified goal or aim structure, such as to save something or introduce something to everyone.
A society history, most new initiates are invariably required to learn and respect the founding figures.
There is a degree of intellectual limitation, so outside ideas or interaction with non members are not encouraged
There is also a system of repercussions, such as shunning, ""time out"" or isolating or demotion.
There is a system of development, so a person may be groomed or encouraged to go towards certain roles, or assist in various ways.
There is a tithe, membership dues or other system of getting money from members, rather than earning it externally.;
, You might notice that most political parties, social clubs, sporting & health clubs, credit and banking systems, most religions and nationalities actually have these features and these are not what would be classified as dangerous.


Most political parties have founding members, political history, ideology and identity and discourages interaction with ""non members"" or those with a different ways of looking at things. In effect there is an entrenched discouragement to change ideas, while having a trained loyalty system. There is also a degree of reverence for political leaders in the past, only if they were of that particular party, but members who cross the floor are deemed traitors.

, Because the system used is so mainstream, you probably will be seeing it everywhere but that does not make every society or group dangerous. It just gives them the potential to be one.

, This ultimately is where groups cross the line into a dangerous organization.

,


Members are encouraged to do certain practices, methods & techniques and only those. There is no exploration, modification or comparison with other similar or different systems.
The screening of new potential members is quite large as they filter looking for suitable like minded, or easily mold-able people. The society can accept and wear the money costs involved in having a very high grassroots turnover to get a few potentially ultra-loyal members, like-minded or easily manipulated members.
There is a noticeable degree of repetition, so key figures such as the founder and their stories are often repeated to train people to think the same way.
There is a medium degree of personal image inflation to make certain figures appear greater than they really were and that association with them is a great or noble thing.
Members are all very similar and have minimal contact with the outside world, or the real world.
There is a substantial amount of time, money, thought and encouragement invested in promotion, lobbying and marketing.
Tax free status a major aspiration, or have already attained that.
Funds or proceeds do not stay in the country or state they were earned in.

, Such groups may still not be a danger to society, either in design or effect, but could one day be run by someone who will take it that direction very easily.

,


Manipulation of initiates is obvious to outsiders.
It is very difficult, if not impossible to leave their society. The aim is to make the new person addicted to or so familiar with the cult that the person loses the ability to be independent, or their fears of repercussions are too high.
That members are required to part with large amount of funds or assets.
There is a high degree of mental stagnation, so that there is a focusing on key principles or myths and general day to day knowledge is encouraged to be forgotten.
There is a degree of mentally stressful or intensive practices. These maybe long meditation retreats with little sleep or food, high intensive workouts or other things. They may be branded with an element of mystique and privilege.
That it is impossible for an ordinary member to have the same skills or status as the founder or leadership. So the founder may be a dubbed an avatar, master, guru, Bodhisattva, genius or other highly attained person, but the initiate will never be on the same level, especially if some ""powers"" are not possible to develop ordinarily or even exist. Members may or may not ever be aware of this. Leaders and next generation leaders are planned with no involvement or selection from the existing members.
All actions committed by members are justified or will be praised. Martyrdom may be encouraged.
There is a very effective propaganda system as well as intensive (but covert) political lobbying.
There is not always a vast leadership structure, but there can be. The more manipulative cult leadership prefers a wide gap between their status and others so may practice a more flat working hierarchy. This can create ""succession"" issues, but usually its known who the next in charge will be in advance.
There is a definite separation from society.

If you are not prepared to leave the town, stay calm and simply don't get involved or take risks. Keep a polite distance so you are not made into an ""enemy"" of their group, which can be potentially dangerous in tight knit communities or remote towns. They won't harm you until you are a threat to them.
Keep your thoughts and feelings to only those you trust.
Encourage dialogue and exchanges between other groups. This prevents minorities or dissenters being silenced and the cult taking over the town. This does have confrontation risks if that was the plan all along, however.
Move if it becomes intolerable or unsafe. No one is keeping you there but yourself.

Say a simple thanks for the meal to the people present.,
Consider the occasion.,
Use a quick personal anecdote.,
Keep it brief.",How to Say Grace1," If you're called upon to say grace at a family gathering or holiday meal, it can be an intimidating experience. But like a toast at a wedding or any public speech, there's no one ""right"" way to offer thanks, though there are several common denominational prayers for different faiths, discussed in the following method. The most important thing to remember in the moment is to speak from the heart, as sincerely and honestly as possible, and offer appreciation and thanks to whatever higher power you choose.Example: Bless this food and the people who prepared it. Many thanks for the meal and the company.;
, If you're saying grace for a holiday meal, a family gathering, or an informal dinner, you can temper your prayer to the occasion. Even saying thanks for the changing of seasons can be an appropriate call for grace.



Example: I'm blessed to be able to spend the holidays here with all of you. Let us appreciate this meal in fellowship and celebration.

Example: It's such a blessing to be able to come together and celebrate the life of Aunt Jan in this wonderful group of people. Many thanks for the meal and the fellowship.

Example: It's such a pleasure to spend a warm summer evening on the porch with all of you and this wonderful food. Let's all offer thanks for the bounty we've received.

, Depending on the group and the occasion, it can be appropriate to offer a brief moment of story to act as a blessing. When spend with close family or close friends, on a birthday or other personal holiday, this is a nice touch. It's also common to offer a quick personal blessing for each person present, if in a small group.



Example: I've always looked up to Aunt Jan as a personal inspiration and hero for her kind dedication to service and cheerful outlook on life. I'll always cherish the hours we spent together in her garden. I count myself blessed to have someone in my life as inspiring as her, and to be able to gather here today and celebrate her life with you all.

Example: What a blessing to come together today for this wonderful meal at the end of the week. Our thoughts are with Jason as his completes another tough week of school, and with Karen during the first days of a new job, and with all our family who can't be here tonight. May they be blessed and filled with happiness.

, Saying grace is a time for everyone at the table to take hands or sit quietly in contemplation, reflecting on their blessings and privileges before taking a meal. It should neither be a sermon nor a joke. A simple and quick blessing is best, regardless of the devotion and the hunger of the people present. Don't rush through it, but keep it to a few brief sincere sentences, and end it with ""amen"" or the closing of your choice. A call to grace might look something like this:


All present take hands, or bow their heads quietly.
A quick moment or two of silence before beginning, enough for a centering breath.
The blessing or prayer, a few sentences at most.
The closing. ""Amen,"" a Hebrew word meaning ""It is so"" is a common closing for Christian and personal or secular prayers alike.

"

Address and thank God for the food and fellowship at a Christian table.,
Pray before and after the meal at a Muslim table.,
Perform birkat hamazon after a meal at a Jewish table.,
Recite a personal mantra, a verse from the Vedas, or from the Mahabharata to sanctify a Hindu meal.,
Hold hands in silence.",How to Say Grace2," To say grace in a Christian setting, there are several short common prayers frequently used, though no one is universal or more appropriate than another. In general, European and Catholic denominations will address meal-time prayers to God or ""The Lord,"" while Evangelical Christians and other denominations that emphasize a personal relationship with Christ will address prayers to Jesus.There's no hard or fast rule about this, though, so speak from the heart.



Example: Bless this food to our bodies, Lord, and let us hold you in our hearts. In Jesus name we pray, Amen.

Example: Bless us, oh Lord, and these your gifts which we are about to receive from your bounty. Through Christ our Lord we pray, Amen.

, For practitioners of Islam, it's common practice to recite a brief prayer of grace before the meal and after the meal. It's especially important to be quiet and do nothing else during the prayer but address Allah.Before the meal: Bismillahi wa 'ala baraka-tillah. (In Allah's name and upon the blessings granted by Allah, we eat.)

After the meal: Alham do lillah hilla-thee At Amana wa saquana waja 'alana minal Muslimeen. (All praise to Allah who gave us food and drink and who made us Muslims.)

, There are many separate blessings for particular items of food such a fish, meat, and vegetables, though a Jewish meal is said to be incomplete if it does not include bread. Birkat hamazon, or the ""Grace after Meals,"" is typically recited to one's self after a meal including bread or matzoh is finished, and is printed in most Hebrew prayer books, to be sung aloud at formal gatherings. It's common to recite in either full or annotated form, if pressed for time. In a formal setting, the leader will start the prayer and the group will respond.It's a semi-complicated text, made up of four distinct blessings:



The meal: Baruch Eloheinu she-achalnu mishelo uv'tuvo chayinu. Baruch hu uvaruch sh'mo. (Praised be our God, of whose abundance we have eaten, and by whose goodness we live. Praised be the Eternal God.)

The land: Kakatuv, v'achalta v'savata, uveirachta et Adonai Elohecha al haaretz hatovah asher natan lach. Baruch atah Adonai, al haaretz v'al hamazon. (As it is written: When you have eaten and are satisfied, give praise to your God who has given you this good earth. We praise You, O God, for the earth and for its sustenance.)

Jerusalem: Uv'neih Y'rushalayim ir hakodesh bimheirah v'yameinu. Baruch atah Adonai, boneh v'rachamav Y'rushalayim. Amen. (Let Jerusalem, the holy city, be renewed in our time. We praise You, Adonai, in compassion You rebuild Jerusalem. Amen.)

God: HaRachaman, hu yimloch aleinu l'olam va-ed. HaRachaman, hu yitbarach bashamayim uvaaretz. HaRachaman, hu yishlach b'rachah m'rubah babayit hazeh, v'al shulchan zeh she-achalnu alav. HaRachaman, hu yishlach lanu et Eliyahu HaNavi, zachur latov, vivaser lanu b'sorot tovot, y'shuot v'nechamot. (Merciful One, be our God forever. Merciful One, heaven and earth alike are blessed by Your presence. Merciful One, bless this house, this table at which we have eaten. Merciful One, send us tidings of Elijah, glimpses of good to come, redemption and consolation.)

, Hindu traditions are largely regional and vary widely, and it would be impossible to distill into a single traditional prayer for mealtime. Personal mantras are common before-meal prayers, as well as recitations from the Bhagavad Gita (specifically the 4th chapter). A typical example might look something like this:


Brahmārpaṇam brahma havir (Brahman is the oblation)
Brahmāgnau brahmanāhutam (Brahman is what constitutes the offerings)
Brahmaiva tena gantavyam (by Brahman is the oblation poured into the fire of Brahman)
Brahma karma samādhinā. (Brahman verily shall be reached by him who always sees Brahman in all actions.)

, At many different tables, including Buddhist, Quaker, and secular humanist traditions, a brief period of silence before meals is used to center the self, quiet the mind, and let in the light. To pray quietly both as a group and as individuals, take hands and bow your heads in silence, and still your thoughts. After a few moments, squeeze hands as a group to signal the end of the prayer, and commence the meal.

"
Go with a cafeteria prayer.,
Offer a drunkard's toast.,
Quote Emerson.,
Learn the American Sign Language (ASL) blessing.,
Use aphorisms from around the world.",How to Say Grace3," Depending on the occasion, a more information or humorous prayer might be just as appropriate as a solemn one. If you're sitting down informally but still want to throw up a thanks, go with a classic rhyming prayer of school cafeterias and summer camps:



Example: Good food, good meat, good God, let's eat.

Example: Lord, we know without a doubt, you'll bless this food as we pig out.

Example: Bless this food before us set, which needs all the help that it can get., If you've just seated yourself at a table with a crew that likes to imbibe, celebrate the spirits with this classic:



Example: May your glass be ever full, may the roof over your head be always strong, and may you be in heaven half an hour before the devil knows you're dead.

Example: When I dream of Heaven, I dream of the past / Surrounded by good friends raising a glass.

, Eating at an English professor's house? Say grace by quoting everyone's favorite Transcendentalist. His poem ""Grace"" reads:



For each new morning with its light, / For rest and shelter of the night, / For health and food, for love and friends, / For everything Thy goodness sends, / We offer thanks. Amen., Thanks and meals are directly linked in ASL, whose sign for ""thanks"" involves moving the hand from the mouth forward, displaying a flat palm. This is traditionally used before a meal in place of a blessing, and as an invitation of both thanks and eating., Learning simple blessings from cultures not your own can be an interesting way of offering perspective and gravity to the meal. Some examples:



Japanese: itadakimasu (I am receiving)

Latin American: To those who have hunger, give bread. To those who have bread, give hunger for justice.

Ghanaian: Earth, when I am about to die I will lean on you. While I am alive, I will depend on you.

Southeast Asia: This food is the gift of the whole universe. May we be worthy to receive it. May the energy in this food give us the strength to transform our unwholesome qualities into wholesome qualities.

Make sure you understand what Pascal's Wager is all about.,
Explain that Pascal's Wager doesn't prove God exists, it proves that it is better to believe, whether there is a god or not.,
Disprove infinitely happy life.,
Disprove ""you lose nothing"".,
Distinguish between the knowable versus unknowable.",How to Refute Pascal's Wager," To that end lets take a look at Pascal's claims:


If there's a God, He's infinitely incomprehensible.
Reason can decide nothing here.
You must wager.
Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is.
There's an infinity of infinitely happy life to gain.
If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing.
Wager, then, without hesitation that He is.

You may have seen a simplified version of Pascal's Wager in the form of the diagram seen above. This visualizes the problem and makes it a lot more easier to understand.

;
, Pascal's wager merely proves it is better to believe in God, ""just in case"", but it explains nothing about God's existence.,


A major problem lies in the ""infinitely happy life"" part. Consider what's written in the bible; ""Thou shalt worship no other gods but me"". This behavioral pattern is prominent in most modern major religions, where gods demand that you're absolutely devoted to them. Thus if you choose the wrong religion you're eternally condemned.
Furthermore we must make room, when we decide to wager in the unknowable, for future religions. After all, no religion was available to the people born before it. What's more is that there's an infinity of unknown divine concepts, which we haven't imagined yet or can't imagine at all. None of these can be graded more or less likely than the next, since they're all supernatural phenomena, while we can observe only natural phenomena. Consequently there are infinite possible gods and religions and for every divine concept, there's an exact opposite divine concept, which punishes the former concept or concepts.
It becomes clear that the odds of a correct choice are too slim. There's an infinite number of possible deities and/or religions, all of which are just as likely to be correct, due to their non natural nature.They're also mutually exclusive or incompatible, because, even when they don't overlap, like similar denominations, ideas and thus divine concepts are still infinite. For every concept and infinite number of divine concepts which punishes it exist, due to the nature of infinity. This means that while there can be only one correct choice, which leads to eternally happy life, there's an infinity of religions which punishes it. Thus the odds of making a correct choice are 1/∞.

,

Religion requires you to sacrifice a lot of time, effort and money.

In fact, believing in a religion, comes with many responsibilities. Thus you spend time in sermons and preaching, time which could be invested elsewhere.
There's pressure on you, to adhere to the concepts of your religion. You must follow a moral code, which remains largely unchanged and most likely doesn't resonate to the conditions of the present society. Such ideas are handing out your whole fortune if you're a Christian, or killing the unbelievers should you happen to be a Muslim.
Your critical thinking is dulled. What religions advocate as facts in their passages are in fact supernatural phenomena. By their nature they're incomprehensible to the human being who has come across nothing which escapes the laws of physics. In order to accept the supernatural you need to accept them as they are, against your reason, blockading your reason eventually.
Subsequently believing in the unknowable comes with multiple drawbacks. So, in return for investing time in something which is possible, but by no means certain, you waste time, you dull your intellect and take up questionable morals, on the only place where your rewards are certain and tangible, Earth.

,


Eventually, placing your bets on the unknowable, grants extremely slim chances of an eternally happy life and infinitely large chances of an eternally miserable life.
Conversely, placing your bets on the knowable instead, grants certain and tangible rewards. You sleep in a comfortable bed, eat a delicious burger, admire a masterpiece, or watch a beautiful sunshine. You are entitled to those because you work hard to earn the ability to do so and because you were born on this very world. Everyday life can be boring or miserable, but it has definite great moments, all of which come from the knowable.
So, should you choose to bet in the knowable you'll have a happy life where it's sure that you have one, Earth.

In silence, sit comfortably and try clearing your mind; you can start by paying attention to your breathing while listening to calming music or nature sounds.,
After that period of 15 minutes, read something that reminds you of the feeling of love and joy that God Himself is.,
Avoid anything that does not feel good.,
Practice appreciation.,
Before going to bed, get into your vortex, which is nothing else than connecting with your soul, the essence of God in you where all is possible and all you want has already been given.,
Look for His presence on everything you do.,
Accept and enjoy your relationship with Him.

",How to Reignite Your Relationship With God," Do not try too hard. Become used to silence every day at least for 15 minutes, to slowly stop thoughts of resistance.;
, This way you will activate it and you will start vibrating like those feelings.

, All that does not feel like absolute love, does not belong to the vibration of Source/God.

, Make lists of things you appreciate. A very effective exercise used in many Meet up meetings, or groups that type, is to list from 3 to 10 things you appreciate with each of your five senses.

, Appreciating throws you directly to your vortex, and if you do so before sleeping, next day you will start your day in the same vibrational level.

, You will see Him, hear Him, taste Him, touch Him, and smell Him.

Live your faith.,
Be a good listener.,
Be a good example.,
Don't take rejection of your ideas or faith personally.",How to Promote One's Religion or Faith," The way you act should reflect the things you believe in your heart. ""Actions speak louder than words"" so they say.... When people notice a difference in your actions than everyone else's they will be drawn to ask how and why you are different. This is the perfect time to explain that you are different because you are a Christian. You believe in living differently than other people because of your religion.;
, It's usually considered rude and condescending to impose our own ideas or give advise to people, especially when they have not asked for it. This is one of the most common errors in trying to share faith, we share too early or inappropriately. When we nurture relationships and they turn into friendships, when we are willing to be still and listen, then we get to the part where we can be ready for those opportunities to have conversations about faith.

, There is a saying, ""If you can't be a good example, then you'll be a horrible warning."" People most often want to emulate those they see are living, happy well-balanced lives. While none of us can be perfect, if we are truly ""walking the walk"" of our own spirituality, those gifts of kindness, generosity, humility and honesty will be truly evident in our lives. People hunger for integrity and kindness, and when they see it, they will want to know how you got it.

, Everyone comes from a different background, and sometimes dogma or religion was a negative rather than a positive influence in their lives. Others may be perfectly content with their value system and see no need for yours, and yet still others may not be willing to listen to any point of view, except their own. Keep in mind, your goal should be to be available, helpful and non-judgmental when others seek YOU out for answers in their spiritual journey.

Purify your thoughts.,
Smudge your aura.,
Purify your body.,
Avoid certain places and people.,
Ask your angels.,
Call upon Archangel Michael.",How to Purify Yourself to Connect With Angels," It is no good appearing to be full of happiness and love on the outside whilst burying negative thoughts on the inside. You may be able to fool humans, but you will not deceive the angels! Your aura will be dark and dense if it is filled with negative thoughts. Try to fill your aura with thoughts of love, beauty, peace and joy. If you feel angry, frustrated, afraid or worried, write down these feelings on a piece of paper and then burn it. Fire is an incredibly powerful cleanser! If it is not convenient to burn your piece of paper, then cut or tear it into pieces and bury it. I believe, however, that fire is the most effective method.;
, If you intuitively feel that there is negativity around you, try using a sage smudge stick to cleanse your aura.

, Your body is the temple of your soul and it does not appreciate, or thrive upon, a diet of junk food. Your taste buds may crave it, but poor-quality food will lower your vibrations dramatically. You do not have to be perfect, but try to eliminate too much sugar, additives, salt, alcohol, tea, coffee, red meat and dairy foods from your diet. It is a natural process that, as your body begins to attune to the higher vibrational frequency of the angels, your desire and cravings for inappropriate foods will lessen. You will want to eat more natural foods and organic produce and will naturally crave large quantities of pure, natural, spring water.

, As you attune to the angelic realms, you may find that some of your friends and acquaintances will not appeal to you quite so much. If someone makes you feel drained of depressed, try spending less and less time with him or her for a while. What is happening is that you are absorbing their negative energies and are feeling bad. They, on the other hand, are absorbing your positive energies and are feeling wonderful! You may also find that certain environments (such as smoky bars and noisy clubs) begin to lose their appeal. As I have said, however, you will find that is a natural shift.

, If you still feel in need of cleansing, then, either in meditation or just before you go to sleep at night, ask the ""angels of purification"" to purify you as you sleep or meditate. Do this as often as necessary and you will emerge feeling wonderfully clean and refreshed.

, If you feel that there is a person who is still holding on to you, perhaps from a past relationship, then call upon Archangel Michael. Before you go to sleep, or in meditation, ask him to use his holy sword to cut the etheric cords that bind you and that are draining your energy.

First off, Kotonaru means different in Japanese.,
As the name might imply, Kotonarus love Japanese culture.,
We Kotonarus are very creative and talented.,
Now back to manga.,
Some of us enjoy video games, others don't.,
Now for clothes.,
You could walk the streets of both Japan and America and find the most horrifying thing in the world: overdone make-up.,
Now, onto music.,
Kotonarus are not really picky about what we eat.,
Carry around a tote bag.,
Kotonarus love books.,
Even if your other friends aren't Kotonaru, don't ditch them unless they ditch you.,
Lastly, Kotonarus are never alone.",How to Be Kotonaru (Different),";
, So, if you don't already, watch anime and read manga. And don't be afraid to watch Japanese dramas and movies, too. Even if it's rated ""M for mature audiences"", if you can handle it, watch/read it.

, Whether you draw, paint, write, whatever, show it off. If you don't find yourself artistic, then consider buying art that you like.

, We Kotonarus like light and fluffy, but we also like dark sides. Reading manga like Full Moon wo Sagashite, Clannad, and This Ugly Yet Beautiful World should get you off to a good start. Also check out Rumiko Takahashi's work.

, Whatever suits you.

, Kotonarus generally stay away from name brands(except Converse) and go for the cheap stuff. As I said, we like cute with a dark side. So a t-shirt with a skeleton bunny is perfect. Kotonarus are generally casual. We tend to wear colors like blues and purples, reds and pink, yellows and greens. If it is a bright color, Kotonarus usually wear a dark color with it, to mix things up. We sometimes wear skirts, as long as there not too short. Unless, of course, we find it totally cute and think it looks like the skirt from Clannad.

, Kotonarus like to keep things natural. Show off your cuteness as much as possible!

, Kotonarus can find at least one artist/band in almost every genre that we like. We usually listen to things that don't hit the radio much. The songs we listen to have a special meaning to us.

, Since most of us are still in school, we either eat the school's lunch, or pack whatever we want in a bag. We like Japanese sweets like Pocky and Yan Yan.

, Put the Japanese characters for Kotonaru on it. Fill it with things like plushies, sketchpads, your PC, anything or everything that you love.

, Keep one in that tote bag. Whatever you're into, read it. Even if the vampires sparkle.

, Friends are forever.

, Grab a friend and try it out with him/her, but if it's not them then don't force them. Let them be themselves.

Ask him/her intelligent questions on why Muslims believe what they do.,

,,,, (For example: many Muslims have difficulty understanding the use of the terms Son of God and Son of Man. Most will argue Jesus, who is considered a prophet in Islam, never said ""I am The Son of God"". This is said, because the term ""son of God"" was commonly used at that time to refer to the common men owing ones existence to Father God. Jesus often referred to himself as ""The Son of Man"" - a significant title identifying as the perfect man to take the special role of savior of the people He had come to save. Another example, Islam claims the Prophet Muhammad was foretold in the Torah and Bible: God had said to Moses: ""I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and I will put My words in his mouth; and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him"" Deuteronomy 18:18. Christians say this was completely fulfilled in Jesus in John 1:45, ""We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."" This verse clarified that no one such as Muhammad was spoken of, as it was already fulfilled and refers only to Jesus. Differences of understanding like the aforementioned may be similar to what you may encounter when witnessing to a Muslim.

, Eg: Why is it so important to honour Muhammad as both the last and greatest of all God (Allah)'s Prophets, etc?

, Jesus said, ""Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the Sons of God"" (Matthew 5:9). Point out that Jesus/Isa is the Prince of Peace in the Bible. He calls his followers to bring peace to conflict or peace will have little meaning. We may intervene or interfere in warlike situations. We are to bring love and peace, joy,... with us -- Why?: ""...brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you"" (2 Corinthians 13:11).

Meet basic physical needs.,

Learn how to love someone and (how to be loved.)",How to Be Human," Human beings cannot exist in a vacuum - without caring for certain physical needs, humans will soon die. Take care of your basic well being or you'll have a very hard time meaningfully pursuing the more advanced steps. At bare minimum, humans need to:



Breathe oxygen. Human beings' most pressing need is to breathe air containing oxygen almost constantly. At the absolute longest, humans can go only about 20 minutes without air;most can only last a fraction of that time.
Eat edible foods and drink water. Humans eat food for energy and to provide vital nutrients for essential body processes. At a minimum, humans should consume adequate amounts of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, as well as several essential vitamins and minerals. Humans also drink water, as it is crucial for many internal processes. The precise amounts of food and water you should consume as a human varies based on your size and your level of physical activity.

Sleep. Humans still aren't completely sure what the purpose of sleep is, though we do know that it's vital for physical and mental performance.The healthiest adult humans usually sleep 7-8 hours a night.Maintain homeostasis. Essentially, humans need to keep their external environment from interfering with their internal body. This can take many forms - for instance, wearing clothes to regulate body temperature and repairing wounds with sutures, wounds, etc.;
, A human's second responsibility, after meeting his or her innate requirements for life, is to eke out his or her safety. To thrive, humans can't be worried about whether they will starve or die - such thoughts will override any attempts to reach higher levels of human accomplishment. Here are just a few ways to ensure you're ""safe"" as a human:


Avoid danger. Don't stay near places or situations that can cause physical damage to your body. Injuries can affect your physical health and even cause you to die.

Get or build a home. Humans need a place to live that offers protection from the elements. At the bare minimum, this place should have four walls and a place to sleep.
Pursue a living. Most of the planet earth uses money. Money can be exchanged for goods and services, including food, clothing, and shelter. Most humans eventually get a job to receive a dependable stream of money.

, Famous human Aristotle is remembered as saying: ""Man is by nature a social animal; an individual who is unsocial naturally and not accidentally is either beneath our notice or more than human.""In your life as a human, you will meet people. Some will make you feel good - these are ""friends."" You will feel a sexual attraction to some: Such a person is a ""romantic interest"", who can develop into a spouse. A life lived alone is not a fulfilling one - spend time cultivating healthy friendships and pursuing romances for a richer, more emotional life.


To maintain friendships, you'll need to ""hang out"" with your friends. Invite them over for brunch. Talk about sports. Forge a bond with your friends - help them when they need it, and they'll be around to help you.
Most romantic relationships start when one person asks another out. See our list of articles on asking humans out for guidance.

, Humans feel better when they consider themselves valuable and they know that others consider them valuable. It's easiest to respect yourself and for others to respect you if you've achieved something. Try to strive for success, whether it's at your job or in other activities that you practice for fun (these are called ""hobbies."") Know and be confident in your own abilities. Respect humans who respect you.


Friendships and romantic relationships can help boost your self-esteem when you feel sad, but self-esteem begins within. Don't depend on other peoples' approval for your self-esteem.

, Once humans are physically secure, have a foundation of healthy relationships, and have a good self-image, they may begin to ponder questions such as ""Why are we here?"" Different humans ascribe a variety of purposes to human life. Many humans adopt a set of moral principals or develop their own. Others embark on creative endeavors, expressing their innermost thoughts through art. Others still try to make sense of the universe through science or philosophy. There's no right way to make the most of your existence, but here are just a few ideas:


Subscribe to an existing (or develop your own) philosophy and/or religion.

Write, draw, play music, or dance.
Become an innovator in your craft.
Experience (and care for) nature.
Whatever you choose to do, try to make your mark on the world. Improve the earth for those who come after you in some way, however small.

, Love is difficult to define; the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines it as a feeling of intense affection, attachment, and/or desire for another human.Many humans say that the best thing in life is to love (and be loved by) other human beings. Many humans even get married to commit to a life of loving someone else. Others still start families and have children so that they can love someone from the beginning of his or her life to the point that they die. There's no right way to live a love-filled life - all you can do is follow your heart and embrace love's mysterious, inexplicable humanity.

Listen before reacting.,
Learn to listen actively.,
Avoid shutting down while the other person is talking.,
Evaluate what is being said.,
Correct the other person if necessary.,
Ignore the comments, or even the person, if necessary.",How to Be Cool About What People Say," Many people are so overwhelmed with wanting to tell their own side of the story that they find it hard to listen properly. They may even be so rude as to interrupt before the other person has finished. This sort of impatience really annoys people, so learn to chill and simply listen.


Listening helps you to understand other people better.
Listening well can sometimes resolve an issue for you; by waiting patiently and hearing someone out, they may actually say the very thing you're wondering about. It just might take them a while to get to the point.;
, Listening actively is a skill that can be learned. It involves listening, concentrating and then summarizing back to the speaker what you have heard that person say. This takes practice but it's worth the effort.


Catch yourself when you feel like interrupting. Remind yourself that it is courteous to wait and that you will get your turn.

, You may feel overwhelmed, bothered or annoyed by the other person, simply because of what he or she stands for. You may have very strong opinions and consider anything outside of your opinions to be plain wrong (not a very healthy minded way to be). Whatever your usual reaction, try concentrating on what the person is saying, as well as what the other person is not saying. When you switch off your own biases and just focus on what is being said for a change, you may be surprised by the similarities within what is said, amid all of the supposed differences. Look for the things you do agree on by staying alert.


Say you have a definite political leaning. And say this person next to you says something that you construe as being the opposite of your political leaning. Instead of getting all fired up, listen closely and pay attention to what this person is actually saying, rather than thinking negative stereotypes over and over in your head. Listen to the other person's argument––they may have a valid point.

, Digest what you have heard through reflection before you react. Evaluate whether there are any possible good or positive outcomes of what you are going to say and how receptive the other person is likely to be to hearing your point of view.Try to end the conversation with what you want to say but remember that sometimes the best answer is to change subjects. This is about ""picking your battles"" rather than being confrontational as a matter of course.

, Stereotypes are everywhere. If someone says that all pizza has red sauce, correct them politely by saying, ""On the contrary, I have tried a type of pizza called white pizza at Luigi's, and it was quite delicious.""


Use your manners to remind you to respect the dignity of the other person. He or she may say or believe in things you really don't agree with but you can still have a constructive discussion without name-calling or nasty innuendo.
Never be afraid to make it clear that you won't tolerate something that is illegal, disrespects human dignity or smacks of gossip. In such cases, draw a line and make it clear that you feel the other person has crossed it. Politely ask them to cease or let them know that you won't continue to discuss the matter. Being a good listener and being cool about what other people think doesn't include degrading yourself (or others) or putting up with swearing, abuse or profanities.

, If you lack the ability to self edit-and there are times when most people find this hard to do-it is best if you can ignore the person making the comment.

Find the deeper meaning behind why you are feeling loss.,
Learn about attachment.,
Learn how to observe your own thoughts.,
Detach.,
Replace your thoughts with new and better ones.",How to Be Philosophical About Loss," What is loss? Why are you affected by it? To what degree are you suffering from the loss? Philosophy asks questions and finds the answers behind these.


The editor, Alexander George, of 'I Am, Therefore I Think' confirms that the essence of philosophy lies in questioning: "" Most people do not realise that many of the questions they have been mulling over...are at the very root of philosophy."". To be philosophical, you must ask several questions which will lead you, through rational thinking, in the right direction of understanding the nature of loss and how you relate to it.;
, In the book 'Call to Love', Anthony de Mello defines attachment as: ""a state of clinging that comes from the false belief that something or someone is necessary for your happiness.""Why would you cling to something? You hold on because you (the subject) become attached to the object (e.g. job) because it caters to you in different ways.
A. Parthasarathy describes the meanings of subject and object in the 'Vedanta Treatise: The Eternities', as follows: ""...word subject means the perceiver, knowing, experiencer. While object means that which is perceived, known, experienced.""So when the object, which you perceive as giving you enjoyment, is gone, you feel loss. How much you suffer depends on how much the object catered to you.

, You can become attached to your thinking. Certain thoughts about an object produces pleasure and you may want to continue indulging in these thoughts but when the object is no longer there, you will experience the pain of loss. The more you dwell on the object after it is gone, the more ingrained your beliefs are about losing it.


Thought itself is an object and when you are able to scan your thoughts, you will be able to make a selection as to what thoughts you would like to experience for yourself. A. Parthasarathy states: ""You can conceive your mind. Know it. Experience it.""In other words, you are able to witness your thinking and if you can see your thoughts, you can choose not to add further thoughts of pain to your present feelings of loss.

, When you deeply understand the pain and loss that attachment can bring you, you will no longer want to feel it and will prefer to detach. Anthony de Mello informs us about the four truths of attachment:


1) ""You must choose between your attachment and happiness."" The obvious decision for you to make is happiness and joy.
2) ""sprang from a lie that your society and your culture have told you, or a lie that you have told yourself, namely, that...without this person or the other, you can't be happy.""Other people have lived without the object you are missing and can still be happy.
3) ""Life is infinitely greater than this trifle your heart is attached to and which you have given the power to so upset you.""By looking at the situation from a different perspective, you learn to detach and not suffer. You cannot control the object but you can control your inner self. When you lose a well paid job, for example, think about the extra time you can spend with your family. Think about finding a new and better job. Seeing the positives in the outcome will assist you in getting over the loss you are feeling. Ten or twenty years from now, you will look back and wonder why you spent so much time in pain over your loss when there are an infinite number of positive experiences you could have chosen from instead. You may not even remember what you lost as you are enjoying your new job.
4) ""...thing or person outside of you has the power to make you happy or unhappy.""Happiness or pain is not within the object but in you. The loss only exists in you because you choose it to be so. If you are predominantly an emotional person, you may resist de Mello's statements regarding attachment but if you are able to perceive something greater (a better life) that is beyond your pain of loss, his argument is sound.

, Think about something else that will contribute to your growth and development. If you have just lost your job, for example, you may want to take up a new and an enjoyable interest such as writing a book, learning to play a musical instrument or travel. It will consume your old thoughts of loss and direct these to higher states of consciousness.


Learn from the wisdom of James Allen's words in 'As a Man Thinketh': ""Man is buffeted by circumstances so long as he believes himself to be the creature of outside conditions, but when he realises that he is a creative power and that he may command the hidden soil and seeds of his being out of which circumstances grow he then becomes the rightful master of himself.""The beauty about thought is that we can steer it towards happiness, peace and an all encompassing love despite any circumstance. If you are able to master your thoughts, there is no such thing as loss.

Have a healthy hobby.,
Be inspired by yourself.,
Love your job.,
Love your family.,
Have friends.,
Learn something new everyday.",How to Stop Wasting Your Life," Having a hobby is good, unless it's something you spend so much time on, that you forget to do other things. A healthy hobby is something you do when you have the time, when you are not doing anything else.


There's many ways to express yourself with a hobby - painting, singing, playing music, knitting, creating games online, writing articles, baking. The options are infinite, you just need to find something you can enjoy doing.
This will keep you productive and happy, even when you are bored.;
, Love yourself, be happy with who you are - if you spend your time being unsatisfied with something you can't change about yourself, you will be wasting time that you could have spent happy. And it's spent on nothing!


Learn how to love every single detail on you - and if you are really unhappy about something, do what you can to improve it! Be inspired by your life, do thing that seem unachievable, be a great person, be the best at something, this will make you think that you are great and invincible!

, You spend almost every day on your job. It has to be someplace that you like, because the job is something that is most likely to pull you down. And if you don't like your job, you will be wasting time doing what you don't enjoy. Nothing makes that worth it.


Search your options on a new job, if it's impossible, do what you can to begin liking your job!
Take a talk with your boss, if he/she's your problem.






If the problem is colleagues, then do something to bring you closer together! You could bring donuts or cupcakes to work every week, or have a party, or celebrate someones birthday when that chance comes by.







, Learn to be grateful for your family - they are there for you, they are close to you, they love you and they want your best. If not, they wouldn't be there. You have to do something for those you love - you partner; give her/him new, exciting experiences, your kids; make them know you love them, by spending time with them, your parents; send them a mail, just letting them know you are okay and that you miss them.


Do what you can, to give everyone their attention and part of your heart, they will feel special and it will pay back in a good way for you. And you will feel good that you are doing something for the better in your life.

, Socializing is important, since human beings are social creatures. Call a long-time-no-see friend, ask them to come for dinner or for a cup of tea, a beer or a piece of cake. Re-create bonds that you have lost with time, introduce your friends to each other and to your family. You will be starting a network of friendly bonds, and this will take a great deal of your time that you maybe used to spend alone or doing something that you felt bored about.


Remember not to create conflict, make sure everyone is feeling good about each other, without hard feelings of jealousy, envy or any other bad feeling. If such thing occurs, talk to your friends, and do what you can to make it good again.

, Learning keeps our brain exercised, and healthy and more prone to think over thing in daily life. You don't have to spend a lot of time doing this, just rent/buy a book about something that you don't know much about, such as history, biology, or about something like cars, or horses, or how to dance or sing.


This will eventually give you many new skills that you can enjoy, and spend time with, when you are alone or bored.

Find opportunities to be nude outside.",How to Practice Nudism," There's a reason why some nudists prefer to be called naturists. Nudism is all about returning to your natural state and being in harmony with nature. Being nude while you're on a beach, in the woods, or in a natural setting can help you experience nature on a whole new level. One of the greatest and most freeing parts of nudism can be the feeling of waves or sun against your nude body.;
, Of course, it's natural for many people to think that something untoward should happen when a bunch of people get together without any clothes on. However, most people who follow the nudist movement don't think there's anything inherently sexual in taking off their clothes. They just think it helps them be free and to return to their natural states, and that's all that matters to them.


Being naked isn't inherently erotic for nudists. They get used to seeing a nude body without thinking sexual thoughts.
Also, you shouldn't think that you have to have a perfect body or to look super sexy to be a nudist. Nudists have bodies of all shapes and sizes.
Though it may take some convincing to show your friends and family members that getting naked doesn't have to mean getting frisky, this is the lifestyle that many people choose.
There are, however, some sects of nudism that are more sexual in nature. Make sure you do your research into the nudists in your particular community to see which lifestyle fits your needs.

, Being a nudist can help you return to your childhood self, to remember the person you were before you cared about putting your clothes on and ran around naked and happy. It's a very liberating feeling. Nudism can help you return to that pure and un-self-conscious version of yourself and can help you feel happy and free in a friendly environment.


Think of how complicated our lives have become. Having to choose clothes, jewelry, footwear, and so many other items only makes it harder to be our natural selves.

, You may have an idea of nudists as people who are naked at the grocery store, movie theatre, or who show up to family barbecues in the buff. However, many nudists actually hold regular jobs and are clothed during their time out in the general public, even if they are always looking for opportunities to shed their clothes in a safe environment.


Committing to being a nudist doesn't mean throwing out all of your clothes. It means embracing the opportunity to be nude when you can.

, Though you may want to frolic in the buff around your three siblings and parents or in front of all of your roommates and their guests, it's not considerate to practice nudism in front of people who are uncomfortable by it. If you live with people who say they are okay with you being in the buff, such as accepting roommates, then you can be nude any time you like. However, if people like your parents or siblings are really not into it, then you can practice nudism in the comforts of your own room or in other parts of the house when you know no one else will be home.


Have an honest and frank conversation with the people you live with to gauge their reactions. Of course, it's important for you to practice your beliefs, but you don't want to infringe on the freedoms of others, either.

, If you live with people who might be interested in the movement, too, then you can also have a frank conversation about inviting them to join your nudist lifestyle. If they don't know much about nudism, they may be a little alarmed, at first, but they may feel better once you educate them about the beliefs of the movement and set them straight on what nudism is really about.


If they don't want to join you, there's no sense in pushing it. Nudism is something that people should only do if they are really comfortable with it.

, Out of respect for your neighbors, you should try to keep the blinds or shutters down if you're practicing nudism in your own home. Going out in your yard in the nude is probably also a no-no, unless you live on a secluded farm or in another rural area. You may think that this puts a damper on the fun of being a nudist, but this will help you practice your beliefs in a respectful manner.


You should also keep a bathrobe handy just in case, if the doorbell rings unexpectedly. You don't want to give a delivery man or neighbor the wrong impression.
If you really want to practice nudism in your yard, you might be able to put a fence around the yard to keep neighbours and other passers-by from seeing you. However, this is probably a feasible option only if you live on a street with one-storey houses. You might be able to plant trees or tall bushes around your yard, as well as putting up a fence, if you live in a two-storey house.

, Now, the fun can begin! Once you know you're alone or that anyone else at home is comfortable with your nudism, and once you're out of view of the neighbors, you can go about your daily life — in the buff. You can make breakfast, watch television, study for exams, call friends, play with your cat, dance around, or just do whatever else you normally do without having any clothes on. That's the fun of nudism: doing what you normally do while feeling liberated!


Of course, you should still shower, wash your hands, and keep things hygienic, whether you're in the buff or not. It's important to stay clean and fresh, whether you're clothed or not.

, One of the greatest joys of being a nudist is sleeping naked, feeling the cool sheets and mattress against your body when you drift off. Heck, many people who aren't nudists love sleeping without any clothes on. If you're committed to practicing nudism, then this can really be your time to shine — especially if you sleep alone or don't have roommates. Set your home to a nice temperature or open a window, depending on the season, and enjoy feeling free as you drift off.


If you do live with roommates and don't want to startle any other people if you take a bathroom trip in the middle of the night, you should hang a bathrobe on your door so you can quickly throw it on if need be.

, If you've tried to be nudist at home but feel too restricted because of the other people in your home, the judgment of your neighbors, or the general lack of freedom that you feel, then you may be better off moving to a more secluded area either where there are less people to offend, or where you can live with people who share your views.


Of course, if you're too young to go out on your own just yet, you may have to wait until you feel responsible enough to go out on your own or just to relocate.

, You may want to practice nudism as a family because you want you, your spouse, and your children to feel free and at peace with your own bodies. This is a great motive, but before you embark on this journey, you should be aware that there are some dissenters out there who think that it may be unethical to raise your children as nudists — some even go as far as to call it sexual abuse. At the end of the day, you should decide what's right for your family while making sure that your children don't do anything that they aren't comfortable with.

, If you want your whole family to transition to being nudists, especially if you have young children, then you have to play your cards right. You can't just go from wearing ten layers of clothing to all of a sudden asking everyone to undress. Instead, you should encourage your family members to wear less clothes and even to be nude more, so you get comfortable with each other's bodies before taking the leap.


If your children are nude during bath time, don't make it a big deal that they're not wearing clothes.
You can even encourage your kids to spend more time in the nude, if they are comfortable doing so after play time.
Of course, once you start doing this, you have to make it clear that this is what your dynamics will be like, but not what the outside world expects. Let your kids see that being nude at home is acceptable while it may not be in the world at large.

, If you want to practice nudism as a family, then you have to make people feel confident in who they are and how they look. Make them feel beautiful, don't laugh at their bodies, and give them compliments to make them feel like they are wonderful people both inside and out. Though nudism is not sexual and it's not about telling your husband he looks great naked, you should encourage people to be who they are without apology.


Just maintaining a positive environment in your household can go a long way in encoring your family members to be in the buff. Though healthy criticism is a good thing, you should focus on being more positive than negative and to encourage your family members to grow spiritually and creatively.

, Another thing you can do is to make nudism feel like the norm when it comes to your home. If people aren't wearing clothes, don't make a comment about it or talk about how great it is to take some clothes off, but just treat it as a matter of fact. This will stop your family members from feeling self-conscious and it will make them feel like this is the most ""normal"" thing that they can do.


If you and your family members are all sitting around nude at the dinner table, treat it as a totally normal thing instead of saying how nice it is that you're all nude together. If something is natural, then there's no need to call attention to it.

, You can show your family that nudism is not only natural, but it's convenient. You don't have to struggle with something to wear around the house all the time. You don't have to go shopping for a million new sets of clothes and can make do with what you have to go outside. If it's a hot day, you don't have to turn the temperature down to zero degrees because you'll naturally feel cooler because you're in the buff.

, Strength in numbers can help you practice nudity as a family without worry or trouble. If all of you are comfortable with it and doing it together in your home, you will strengthen your bond because of your love for the freedom that nudity brings. Of course, you should make your children feel comfortable enough to say that they don't approve or that they don't want to adhere to this lifestyle; you should respect their needs and beliefs and avoid ever forcing your beliefs on them.

, If you're really interested in becoming a nudist, then you can join a community of people who are also interested in maintaining their rights to be nude and to practice nudism safely. If you're in the USA or Canada, you can join TNS (The Naturist Society), AANR (American Association for Nude Recreation), or FCN (Federation of Canadian Naturists) for example. Most countries have a national nudist or naturist organization. A Google search will find them for you. These organizations will help you find health clubs, private residences, beaches, or other locations where you can safely practice nudism.


Joining the community will also make you feel less isolated about your beliefs and will help you meet more like-minded people.
Though most nudists are focused on being free and communing with nature, there are some communities that do encourage nudism for sexual reasons. If this is not for you, be very careful in your research.

, You don't have to be a card-carrying member of a nudist colony to find a nudist beach or a nudist resort in your area. If you can just find a place that fits your ideas of accepting yourself and respecting your own individuality, then you'll be set in finding more places to practice nudism and to meet more like-minded people.


If you practice nudism with your family, make sure that family members of all ages are welcome in the nudist beach or resort area.

, In recent years, the “nakation” has become more popular than ever. A lot of people aren't necessarily comfortable with being naked in the place where they live, though they love the idea of going to an entirely new country or city to practice nudism. You can branch out of your comfort zone by finding resorts that are ""nude only"" and spending a week enjoying the nudist lifestyle.


You can check out ordinary vacation websites and search for ""nudist spa vacations"" to find a resort that is perfect for you, or you can use specialty websites that can help you find the perfect nudist destination.
Some people are opposed to practicing nudism in public in a place near their home because they're afraid of running into someone they know. If you're hundreds of miles from home, this worry will melt away!

, Though you should make sure that you don't offend an unsuspecting hiker or neighbor with your nudism, if you can find some quiet and secluded spots to be nude in public, this can help you practice your nudism. This can involve skinny-dipping in an isolated lake, camping in a remote location and practicing nudism there (if it's allowed), or practicing your nudism in a remote farmhouse or another secluded location.


Just make sure that you don't break any legal rules in your country or state. Though it's not illegal to be nude in a public place, practicing nudism is illegal in states such as Arkansas or countries like Iran.

Realize that your character is formed or revealed most during the tough times.,
Do not give away your agency.,
Control what you can but accept that there is much which cannot be controlled.,
Seek equanimity.,
Use humor to help you cope.,
Look for silver linings.,
Get support.,
Understand that fear of change can hold you back.",How to Tackle Difficult Situations," If you weren't tested, you'd never know the full strength of your abilities and coping skills and you'd never be aware if just how much inner strength you contain. Every person has the potential to unleash this strength provided he or she doesn't allow fear or worry take absolute control. Use this knowledge to keep you focused on what matters––getting through on your own terms.


Realize that part of what you're going through is about reshaping yourself; you will need to change what isn't working for you, which can ultimately lead to a stronger and more resilient self.
Did you choose this path? Sometimes the difficult situation comes about as a result of your ""calling"", be it faith, career, parenthood, research, or whatever. In such a case, remember why you chose this path and take strength from remembering why it matters to you.;
, It can be easy to give in or give up and let someone or something else make the decisions. Falling into deep depression is a form of losing your agency, as is letting someone else make all the decisions and allowing yourself to simply fall into line, even where it doesn't suit who you are or what you wish to do. Not making a decision is also a form of reneging your agency (and it is still making a decision––to do nothing) and can harm your ability to care for yourself during the difficult situation.

, You have control over how you react and how you choose to act. You have a lot less control over what others around you choose to do and even less control over the circumstances surrounding you. It can be easy to feel helpless if you feel you cannot control what others do or say that affects you. But you do have control over the way in which you respond. As hard as this may seem––you do have choices. The real question is whether you're willing to make choices that benefit you and increase your strength to cope with the difficulties you're facing.

, It is easy to give into the negative emotions of anger, frustration, anxiety and jealousy. In turn, it is often common to experience referred body pain and feel your toxic emotions through bodily pains that won't go away. It is important to acknowledge that you are experiencing these emotions, then find ways to remain composed and mentally calm while coping with difficult situations.


Practicing meditation can help you to remain calm in the face of many pressures in your life.
Take time out from the difficult situation. Whether it's a workout, a quick duck-out for a breather or a chat with a trusted pal, find ways to distract yourself temporarily and rejuvenate.

, Finding humor in a difficult situation relieves tension and actually helps you to clarify the issues in creative ways. Using humor does not dismiss the seriousness of the situation; rather, it gives you the ability to cope in a positive way.

, Bad situations often contain glimpses of solutions, beneficial changes and new pathways forward. If you look for the opportunities rather than staying focused on everything negative, then you give yourself a chance to grasp a way through and stay focused on the silver lining. Console yourself that there is a silver lining, if you look hard enough.


Hard times can be both creative and inspiring. This may seem an odd way to view what you're going through but it is certainly a more capable one, that allows you to actively seek solutions.

, The moment that you feel alone is the moment you need to reach out to others. Even if you feel that those close to you or associated with you have let you down or even distanced themselves from you, there are always people willing to help somewhere. Talk to your friends, family, doctor, therapist, or online social network (as yourself or anonymously). Talk to people who will listen and help you.


If you're having suicidal thoughts and need immediate help coping, please call 800-273-TALK, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. (See also How to cope with suicidal thoughts).

, Many difficult situations arise as a result of clinging to the past. Change can be a positive when it involves growth, improvement and betterment of your life and situation. It can be tough to go through but in retrospect, many people who undergo major changes look back and realize that without the change, they'd have remained stuck in a rut.


Again, return to the thought of looking for the silver lining and try to embrace change. Such a positive approach to change may lead to you coping better and turning what seems difficult around to feeling manageable. You don't have to love what you're going through, just make it bearable until it becomes your ""new normal"".

Accept that failure is normal.,

Do not compare yourself to others.,
Be realistic.,
Don't be judge and jury of yourself.,
Do not worry what others think of you so much.",How to Be Kinder to Yourself," The very first thing we need to address is that failure is acceptable. In fact, failure can be very positive. It is how we learned to walk, to talk, to ride a bike, to read and to write. Imagine a life where we never tried anything for fear of failure.;
, Beating yourself up over something that didn't go your way is unproductive. Simply learn from that experience and attempt it again, this time using your new found knowledge to guide you.

, These phrases can be become a habit, and become self fulfilling. Be aware of your own idiosyncrasies, and stop repeating them.

, You cannot change the past and you cannot change the future, all that you can change is right here and now. If you have any skeletons in the closet, or you've done things you're not proud of––welcome to rest of humanity. There isn't a soul out there who hasn't. However, all that is in the past, and as you cannot change it, there is no point in spending our precious ""now"" living out alternate endings that can never be. Let them go. Focus on how good you are now.

, You see, a smile from the heart is more beautiful on even the plainest of faces compared to the look of self pity on the most pretty. It doesn't matter if your smile is crooked, or your eyes look funny, it doesn't matter if you have a stunning smile or not. So long as you let it come from the heart, and it is genuine.

, See the comedy in being human. We are all fallible, every single one of us, from president to pauper. We are all peculiar in some way or other. We are all a little strange. And we can all take ourselves a little too seriously at times. Take a step back and have a good giggle at yourself once in while. See the funny side in buying the horrid lurid purple Lycra jumper that you thought looked outstanding in the shop.

, You will only pit your worst qualities against those who excel in that area. There are a lot of people in this world, you cannot beat everyone at everything. Don't even try. If you do admire someone's virtues, aim to be a little like them and not completely like them, unless of course you are prepared to take on their vices as well.

, Keep two feet on the ground with regards to your goals and aspirations. But don't let that stop you from climbing mountains. As even the highest peak is conquered one step at time. Keep the distance between steps manageable and maintainable, and keep at a steady pace and you will be delighted with the progress.

, You'll only find yourself guilty for things you are innocent of.

, Remember, they are often worrying what you may think of them.

Religion connects to language, history, and personal behavior. Becoming more familiar with your or your family's religion can help you understand all these other aspects.Sacred texts and ceremonies can seem confusing with no one there to guide you. Find an expert willing to explain their significance. Read a copy of the text with footnote discussions.;
, If you know someone who shares you culture but has a different native tongue than yourself, ask him to teach you. Many linguists and anthropologists argue that language shapes our whole perception of the world. Plus, if the language is rare in your area, nobody will be able to eavesdrop on your conversations!


Thousands of languages are at risk of extinction.If you know one of them, teach it to others. Share examples of the knowledge and perspective that would be lost if it goes away. Record the language spoken and written (if possible), and work on translations to less endangered languages.

, It's never too late to whip up some recipes from your grandmother's cookbook. Smell and taste have powerful connections to memory.As you knead dough or try to guess the right amount of spices, you might remember meals from you childhood or holidays. Just reading a recipe can teach you how much ingredients and kitchen tools have changed. And even if some of them are unfamiliar, others have most likely become your comfort food or a source of family pride.


If you don't have family recipes, look for old cookbooks online or at flea markets.You could even start your own by writing down recipes shared orally by your relatives.

, Each culture has its own clothing, music, visual art, storytelling traditions, an many more unique characteristics. Other members of your culture will be overjoyed to teach or talk about their hobbies, their jobs, their crafts, and what they do for fun. This includes traditional artwork you would find in a museum, but material culture goes far beyond that. Even a kitchen spoon or a piece of software is a cultural artifact.


People with less sophisticated technology are often considered ignorant or less intelligent. This is completely wrong. Culture passes on tools adapted to a particular environment, and every tool has generations of thinking behind it.Shaping a stone tool is one of the oldest cultural practices there is, and it still takes great skill and knowledge.

, The best way to preserve your culture is to keep it alive. Gather as a group not just for holidays, but for ordinary meals, events, or just conversation. Many aspects of culture are difficult to learn in books and museums, including etiquette, body language, and humor.


Think about the types of conversations you have within your culture, compared to the mainstream culture where you live. (Or compare two different cultures you participate in.) Does one feel more energetic or friendly than another? Would a normal statement in one context be considered rude in another? Why do you think that is? This kind of deep analysis can be tough to figure out, but it gets to the core of the cultural experience.

, Your country, tribe, religious denomination, or immigrant ethnic group almost certainly celebrate major holidays or cultural festivals. Travel to these to get a broader perspective on your culture. If you don't know of any groups in your area, organize your own event.

, You can record anything you've discovered through your research and life, no matter how small it seems. What you can't do is write down everything there is to know about a culture. There's just too much to say. Most people choose one of two directions instead:


A personal history of one's own experience, or a family's.
A detailed look at one aspect of the culture: cooking, jokes, or any other subtopic.

, You can use calligraphy, oral storytelling, or another traditional medium to make the recording a personal cultural experience as well. Or you can put your work on a website, DVD, or another digital form. This lets you share your cultural story with people from all around the world.

, Interview the people whose histories you're telling, or experts in the subject you're writing about. Come prepared with a list of questions, but let the interviewee to wander to other topics and stories.You may learn something you would never think to ask about.


Keep each interview within one or two hours. If the interviewee is willing, return to conduct additional interviews. This lets you prepare more questions, and lets the interviewee search for documents or objects she wants to share.
Use a video or audio recorder if the interviewee agrees to it. These are much more accurate than trying to write everything down or hold it in your head.

, Record your family tree with the help of family members, adding to it as you go along. There are probably whole branches of cousins and in-laws you've never met. Track these down through family connections or online searches, and they may offer whole new perspectives on your culture. Government websites and physical record collections may offer additional information dating back centuries.Ask family for scrapbooks, journals, and other records early on. You may discover that someone else has started the work for you., Minority cultures often struggle to pass on cultural traditions. Share your stories and records with young people in your culture, who may not know the riches of their cultural background. In the face of political struggles or social challenges, organize people to participate in discussions and cultural activities. Your research can help people understand the core values of their culture, and inspire them to keep it alive and thriving.

, The dialogue around passing on culture often sounds defeatist. Cultures are ""endangered"" or need ""preserving"" before they die out. Real challenges and threats do exist, but don't assume that all change is bad. Culture helps people adapt to the world around them. The world has always been changing, cultures have always been adapting, and it's up to you to choose a direction you can be proud of."
"
Realize you're already there.,
Don't think so hard.,
Be unselfconscious.,
Be a better listener.,
Take people at face value.,
Accept pain.",How to Be in the Moment1," Guess where you are right now? In the moment. You're not in yesterday's moments, and you're not in tomorrow's. You're in the moment that is happening as you read. Take comfort in the fact that it is physically impossible for you to be anywhere else. It's never to late to be in the moment; all you have to do is realize you're already there. The challenge is to turn your thoughts toward what is actually happening, to become more mindful.



Mindfulness happens when you notice and acknowledge the present. When you feel your thoughts swirling toward something that has already happened or something that may be yet to happen, try looking down at your hand. Become aware of how your hand feels right now. Are you a little chilly, or are you warm? Notice what's anchoring you to the here and now. It also helps to acknowledge something outside your own sphere. Look out the window and notice leaves blowing in the wind, or birds sitting on a wire. In another moment they make blow down from the tree or take flight to another telephone pole. When you notice the world around you, you become more mindful of the present.;
, You are not the thoughts in your head.Your worries, anxieties, guilt, and other negative thoughts are not you, and getting lost in them poses a huge impediment to being in the moment. Stopping yourself from thinking so hard is an important step toward mindfulness. As you probably know, it's also very difficult to do. Here are some ways you can stop letting your thoughts rule your existence:


Stop thinking too much about the future. A certain amount of planning is good, but there are many, many things that are out of your control. You cannot control what will happen in 5 or 10 years. When it comes down to it, you don't even know what might happen tomorrow. Make a conscious decision to stop worrying so much. When you find yourself obsessing, do something to bring about greater mindfulness, like stepping outside and breathing fresh air for a few moments.
Don't ruminate on the past. This is even less useful than worrying about the future, because it has already happened and there's nothing you can do to change it.

, When your inner critic comments on your behavior, you're creating a separation between your mind and body, making it more difficult to live in the present. As an example, let's say you're in the middle of talking to a friend, you start laughing at something funny he said, and then you immediately criticize yourself for laughing to loud, or you start worrying about what your face looks like when you laugh. Now your thoughts are ruling the experience, and you're no longer living in the moment with your friend - you're worried about the impression you're making.You're not present anymore. The next time something like this happens, banish the negative thoughts immediately.


If you experience self consciousness frequently, try doing something you're good at, something you can focus on without worrying about how you look or how well you're doing. Plant a row of flowers, paint your wall a new color, or practice your instrument. Give yourself a bit of a challenge, but not one that's insurmountable.
When you experience a moment of not being self-conscious, remember how it feels. Your mind and body are operating as one, instead of warring with one another. Practice getting back to that feeling as often as possible.

, Focus wholly on the person you're talking with instead of letting your thoughts wander to your own problems and worries.Look closely at the person's face and be grateful for the conversation. Look at each exchange as a gift of sorts, during which you get the opportunity to both teach and learn. Getting lost in thought or waiting for a lull in the conversation so you can end it are signs that you aren't fully in the moment.


Make eye contact and squarely face the person to whom you are talking. Notice details about the person's face. Think about your relationship to this person.
Even unpleasant conversations, or conversations with people you hardly know or with whom you don't have much in common, can have extraordinary value. Everyone has a history, a dream, desires. Being in the moment during conversations can help you experience greater empathy and feel more in tune with the world. As Buddha taught, we are all interconnected., Do you spend a lot of time worrying about other people's intentions, judgements and desires? This is yet another distraction from the present moment. You can't control anyone but yourself, so why spend so much time thinking about someone else's thoughts? The best way to stop this pattern is to start taking people at face value. Believe other people's words, then move on to the next experience instead of dwelling.


It's true that some people mean ""no"" when they say ""yes,"" and vice versa. Everyone says things they don't mean sometimes. However, it is not your job to attempt to read people's minds. If there's a miscommunication because you acted on a ""yes"" as a ""yes,"" that person will learn to be more direct next time.
Take compliments at face value. Do people the kindness of believing what they say instead of thinking they're saying it just to be nice.
This is not to say you should be naive and have complete trust in everyone. A person's body language, history, and personality should tell you whether or not a person can be trusted.

, When life brings tragedy, being in the moment means experiencing pain instead of trying to ignore it or make it go away as fast as possible. Allowing yourself to feel negative emotions - fear, guilt, anxiety, sadness, and anger - is an important part of living in the present.


Try not to let your emotions get wrapped up in past occurrences or worries about the future. If you're sad about a breakup, let the sadness be part of your current moment. Don't dwell on memories or think about what might have been; just bask in the feeling of sadness. Looking at a picture of the person's face, or writing down your thoughts, can help you connect your emotions to the present.Don't berate yourself for having negative feelings. Telling yourself you should get over something more quickly is a way of disconnecting yourself from the present, because the emotions are part of the present. Ride out your feelings and experience them to the fullest, the way you would experience joy or contentment. These, too, will pass.

Evoke Niyyah.",How to Perform Ablution (Shia)1," Internally state your intention as, ""I am performing Wudhu for the pleasure of Allah, and to seek closeness to Him”.

Perform the prostration.,
Rise to a sitting position, saying ""Allahu Akbar"" (الله أَكْبَر).,
Prostrate again, saying ""Allahu Akbar"" (الله أَكْبَر).,
Rise up to proceed to the next raka'at, saying ""Allahu Akbar"" (الله أَكْبَر).,
If you are performing more than two raka'ats, do not say the Durud or the Salaam, but rise after saying the Tasyahhud and Salawat and proceed to the next raka'at.",How to Perform Salah," Preparing for prayer includes cleaning yourself, wearing clean clothes, finding a clean and pure place to pray and clearing the mind of worldly thoughts.



Perform the Wudhu, or the Ghusl, depending on the circumstances. You must perform the Ghusl if you have had sexual intercourse, after ejaculation even through unlawful means, after a woman has completed her menstrual cycle or have had contact with anything considered Najis (impure). Wudhu is sufficient if only madhiy (urethral fluid) has been discharged.
Wear clean clothes. Men should cover at least the part of their body between the navel and the knees, but it is preferable to wear a (preferably long sleeved) shirt. The lower garment must extend to below the knees but must be above the ankles.
Pray in a clean place. The place where you pray must be clean and pure. If you are not sure whether the ground is clean or not, spread a clean cloth or prayer mat over it. Ensure the area is not wet because it may contain urine.;
, The Qibla is the direction towards the Kaaba. Some compasses modified for this purpose are now available. Many hotel rooms also have the Qibla direction marked somewhere on the roof. You must be looking towards the spot where your head will touch the ground during the Sajdah and your feet must be evenly spaced.

, You do not need to say it out loud, but you will need to know which prayer of the day you are performing, what will be the type of the rakaat, and the number of rakaats. An example would be to think, ""I will perform 2/4 rakaat/fard/sunnat/nafil of the Fajr/Zuhr/Asr/Maghrib/Isha/ prayer"". Remind yourself that you are praying to Allah alone and not show off or for the sake of another person (i.e parents).

, This starts the prayer. Raise your hands, palms facing forwards, up till your ear lobes (or to your shoulders if you are a woman). Say out loud ""Allahu Akbar"" (الله أَكْبَر), which means ""Allah is the greatest"".

, Qiyam is where you stand up, your hands folded across your chest. Begin reciting Surah Al Fatiha (the first chapter in the order of the Qur'an) and another portion (Surah) of the Qur'an.

, Your right hand should be over your left, and they should overlap till the wrists only. Men place their folded hands below their navel, and women at chest level. Three of the Sunni schools of Islamic law - the Hanafi, Shafi'i and Hanbali groups - pray with their hands folded. Malikis pray with their arms at their sides. If you are a Shia, stand with your arms at your sides., Your voice can be audible to yourself, but if it is not, thinking the prayer perhaps in your brain or mind is also a valid method. If you are a new Muslim and have not yet learned Surah Al-Fatihah, then praise Allah repeatedly. Until you memorize the Surah, you can start saying it.
, It is helpful to have memorized small surahs of the Qur'an by heart. The last of the 30 parts of the Qur'an contains many small surahs that are easy to memorize. Commonly recited surahs are Surah Al-Ikhlas, Surah Al-Falaq, Surah Al-Nas, and Surah Al-Kafirun. Again, if you are a new Muslim and have not yet learned Surah Al-Fatihah then praise Allah repeatedly., The ruku is basically a bow. You unfold your hands and bow, then placing your hands on your knees.Your back should become parallel to the ground, almost like carrying a glass of water on your back. It is essential to completely bow, not just tilt your body at 45o to the vertical. Say ""Allahu Akbar"" (الله أَكْبَر) as you perform this step. When you are in ruku, recite Subhana Rabbiyal al-Adheem (سبحان ربى العظيم), which means ""All praises to Allah, the great"". Say this three times.
, Rise up from the bow, while saying, ""Sam'i Allahu liman hamidah (سمع الله لمن حمده) which means Allah listens to those who praise Him. Then say ""Rabana walakel hummed"" (ربنا لك الحمد), which means ""Our lord, to you is due to all praise.""

, Say ""Allahu Akbar"" (الله أَكْبَر) once again and prostrate on the ground. Make sure you have placed your forehead, palms, and knees all on the floor, touching the ground. The bases of the toes on both feet also need to touch the ground. Have your forehead be bare - a covered forehead invalidates prayer. Recite ""Subhan rabbi alAla"" (سبحان ربى الأعلى) three times which means ""Glory be to my Lord, the Most high."" Everyone must keep their elbows raised above the ground.

, When you are in this position, you must keep your eyes staring at your lap. Men must turn up the heel, and bend the toes, of the right foot. Women must keep both their feet and soles up under their body.

, The second prostration is exactly identical to the first one.

, The second raka'at is identical to the first one up till the second prostration, but without the Takbiratul Ihram.


Perform the Tashahhud at the end of the second raka'at. After the second prostration, stay in a sitting position and recite the Tashahhud (also known as Tahiyat) and then the SalawatAtta-hiyyatu mubarakatu lillahi was-salawatu wat-tayyibatu As-salamu 'alaika ayyuhann-Nabiyyu wa rahmat-ullahi wa barakatuhu As-salamu 'alaina wa 'alaa 'ibaadillaahiss-saliheen. Ash-hadu-al-la-ilaha illAllahu wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa Rasuluh. meaning All worships - oral, physical and momentary - are for Allah. Allah's peace be upon you, O Prophet, and His mercy and blessings. Peace be on us and on all righteous servants of Allah. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His Servant and Messenger.
If you are performing only two raka'ats, then this is the last raka'at. After saying the Tasyahhud and the Salawat, say the Durud,
اللهم صلى على محمد وعلى آل محمد كما صليت على إبراهيم وعلى آل إبراهيم
و بارك على محمد وعلى آل محمد كما باركت على إبراهيم وعلى آل إبراهيم فى العلمين إنك انت الحميد المجيد
(Allahuma sali ala Muhammad wa ala Aali Muhammad kama saliet ala Ibrahim wa ala Aali Ibrahim ennak hameed majeed, wa barik ala Muhammad wa ala Aali Muhammad kama barakta ala Ibrahim wa ala Aali Ibrahim ennak hameed majeed) then recite ""allahumma inne zalamtu nafsi zulman kasira wala yagfiru junuba inna anta fagfirulu magfiratam min indika war hamni inna kala gafirur rahima"" or ""rabbi ja'alni muqeemus salaati wa min zurriyati rabbana wataqabbal du'a rabbanaghfirli waliwalidaiyya walil mu'mineena yauma yaqoom-ul-hisaab"". then complete the prayer by looking over your right shoulder (where the angel who records your good deeds is) and saying the Salaam
السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته
and then looking over your left shoulder (where the angel who records your wrongful deeds is) and saying the same.

, The third raka'at is performed just like the first one, and you rise directly after the second prostration without saying the Tasyahhud or Salaam, unless it is your last raka'at. After your last raka'at, complete the prayer after the second prostration by reciting the Tasyahhud, Salawat, Durud, and Salaam, as described in the step above."

Don't multitask.,
Go slowly.,
Think about chores differently.,
Spend time doing nothing.,
Notice the world around you.",How to Be in the Moment2," When you do two things (or three, or four) at once, you aren't fully focused on any one task. You can't be totally present, because your thoughts are jumping to the next project, or worrying about an email half-written, or planning the meeting that's happening tomorrow. Turning your focus to just one thing at a time is a way of being in the moment. As a bonus, you'll do a much better job at any given task if it's the only thing on your mind.


Try to finish every task you start. Give yourself enough time to do a thorough job, and do it from start to finish before moving on to the next item on your to do list.
Some projects can't be completed all at once. For bigger projects, set manageable goals that can be met in one sitting. For example, if you're writing a book, decide you're going to spend 3 hours focusing fully on the book. Write what you can during this time, then put your materials away before moving to the next item.

, Rushing through tasks is not much better than multitasking when it comes to being in the moment. If all you can think about is getting a chore done as fast as possible, you aren't giving yourself the chance to really experience what you're doing. All your mind and body to act as one, for as long as it takes to get the job done.

, Doing seemingly mundane chores like washing dishes, sweeping, painting, and so on is a good opportunity to practice mindfulness.Do your chores slowly and methodically, giving yourself time to complete them well. Focus on the movements of your body and the way you are changing the space around you for the better - making it cleaner, more inviting, and more positive.

, Packing your day with back to back activities doesn't allow you time to take it all in. Give yourself a break between tasks, and spend the time doing nothing. Don't look at your computer or read your emails on your phone. Just take time to sit, breathe, and appreciate the moment, no matter what it's offering., If you breeze through life without stopping to really see things, you're not being in the moment - instead, you're in the confines of your head. Look around you and observe.


When you walk into work in the morning, look into people's eyes. Notice their faces; what do you read there?
Pay attention to the news. How does do events happening in the
React to the world around you. If you see a can on the sidewalk in front of your house, pick it up. If you feel a burst of salty air blowing off the sea, stop, close your eyes, and let it swirl over your face. If you notice that the day is sunny and warm, open the blinds and the windows.

Fine-tune your senses.,
Learn to savor.,
Get moving.,
Create art.,
Breathe.",How to Be in the Moment3," Being more in touch with your senses is an important way to live in the moment. Your senses help you stay grounded and connected to physical reality. What you see, hear, taste, smell, and touch is the moment. Becoming more aware of your senses and taking measures to sharpen them will help you appreciate the present.


To sharpen your sense of smell, sniff your favorite essential oils every day. You'll awaken receptors and be able to pick up on subtler smells after awhile.
To heighten your hearing, listen to music with distinct sounds, like jazz music with several solos. Concentrate on learning the sounds of different instruments, and name them out loud when you hear them.
To start seeing more clearly, pay more attention to details you wouldn't normally notice, like the color of people's eyes.
To tempt your tastebuds, use spices and herbs you don't normally use. Try cuisines that are new to you.
To enhance your sense of touch, learn more about textures. Notice the differences between cotton and polyester, or satin and silk.

, When you're in a beautiful place, or experiencing a wonderful event, do you find yourself imagining it as a memory while it's still happening? How many wonderful moments have been spoiled by the knowledge that they'll soon come to an end? Use your senses to help you practice enjoying moments for what they are right now.Think of savoring moments in terms of gratitude. Let's say you're on a sailboat sharing a six pack of good beer with two of your best friends, and the sun is starting to go down. Be grateful for the water, the sun, your friends, the beer, and everything else about the moment. Being upset that it'll soon be time to return to shore is a way of rejecting the moment while it's happening.
Practice savoring food. Eat your favorite foods slowly, savoring every bite. Once you decide to eat a certain food, free yourself from guilt and anxiety and just enjoy the taste on your tongue.

, Almost every type of physical activity can lead to feelings of being in the moment. Running, swimming, biking, yoga, walking, team sports, and other forms of physical activity tend to require full attention and concentration. Your mind and your body act as one to propel you over land and through water. It might hurt or it might feel good, but either way you remain aware of the present moment the whole time you're moving.



Dancing is a wonderful way to practice being in the moment. Moving your body to a rhythm requires you to be one with the music. You have to block out your inner critic and shed worries about what other people think.
Having sex is another good way to be in the moment. Focus on your lover's body, the smell, the sounds, the way he or she feels. Dismiss your worries and just be present.
Getting a massage can help you become more aware of your body. After a massage, you might reenter the world with a renewed sense of awareness that you are physically connected to all that's around you.

, Whether your preferred medium is painting, sculpture, making music, writing, knitting, or photography, making art is a wonderful way to connect your thoughts to the present, becoming more mindful. Let yourself get lost in the strokes of your brush or the characters you're creating. Making art requires such intense focus that it's unlikely your worries and troubles will intrude on the moment.

, When all else fails, taking several deep breaths can help you return to the present moment. During those times when your thoughts are jumping from problem to problem and you can't seem to focus on the present, stop and breathe. Take five deep breaths, inhaling deeply through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Focus on your breath as it enters and leaves your body.

Remove anything from the face or hands that may prevent water from reaching the skin.,
Take a handful of water in the right hand and pour this water over the face from the top (just above the forehead).

,
Using the right hand, wipe the face from the tip of where your hair-line is to the bottom of your chin.,
Washing your face once as described above is obligatory.",How to Perform Ablution (Shia)2," This includes items such as a watch/ring or those such as paint or anything which would act as a barrier over the skin.;
,, The water should reach all parts from the hair­line to chin, and the entire horizontal plane of the face within the reach of the span of the hand from the middle finger to the thumb. To ensure that the complete surface of your face has been washed, include a bit of the inner parts of your nose, lips, and eyes in the washing. You do not, however, need to wash the complete inner portion of these parts.

, A second such washing is recommended while subsequent washings are prohibited.

Wipe the front most quarter of the head.",How to Perform Ablution (Shia)4," Use the moisture that remains in your right hand. Wipe from the upper part of the head downwards (from the back of the head towards the face). It is recommended to wipe the length of at least one finger. Wiping can be done with one finger only; however it is recommended to use three fingers together (the middle finger, index finger and ring finger). The moisture must reach the scalp. However, if the hair is so short that it can not be combed, it is sufficient to wipe your hair.


While wiping the head, your hand should not touch your forehead. Doing otherwise will cause the water of the forehead to mix with the wetness of your hands.

Prayers are performed at some point during each prayer time period. Prayer times are traditionally determined by the position of the sun in the sky. The dhuhr (noon) prayer begins after noon when the sun moves down from the middle of the sky and ends when the afternoon shadows lengthen.
The asr (mid-afternoon) prayer starts when the dhuhr prayer ends and lasts until sunset.
The maghrib (sunset) prayer begins when the sun sets below the horizon and lasts until the last bit of red disappears from the western horizon.
The isha' (nightfall) prayer starts when the maghrib prayer ends until dawn.
The subh or fajr (dawn) prayer begins with the appearance of light on the Eastern horizon and ends when the sun first appears.;
, Namaz must be performed in the Arabic language because this is the language that the Qur’an is written in. It also allows Muslims outside of Arabic-speaking countries to recite the prayers and understand what is being said. Speaking all prayers in the same language avoids the confusion of translating words into other languages.Use online sources to help you pronounce the obligatory prayer words, such as Rosetta Stone, Salaam Arabic, hosted by Pangaea Learning, Madinah Arabicor Youtubesources.
Take a course in Arabic at your local college.
Learn and practice the correct pronunciations with an Arabic speaker.

, Men and women must both cover themselves with material that conceals the color of the skin throughout the prayer. While women must cover everything but their faces and hands, men must keep the area between their navel and knees covered.The material must cover the body during prayer movements. So if, for example, bending causes a piece of material to slip and expose skin on a woman’s neck, she would need to ensure that her clothing is tucked in properly or put more clothing on before she can complete her prayer.

, The Qiblah is a sacred mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia which has been used as a place of worship for thousands of years. It is said that Muhammad was born in Mecca and rededicated the existing structure to Allah after conquering the city. No matter where they are in the world, Muslims face the respective direction of the Qiblah while performing Namaz.Look on a map and see which direction Mecca is from where you are located. Face that direction during prayer.
Ask a local Muslim which direction to face during prayer.

, According to Islam, substances such as urine, feces, blood, vomit, pus and other bodily fluids are filthy. These substances must be removed from your body, clothes and the location that you will be praying. Interestingly, semen and a woman’s orgasm fluids are not considered filthy and so do not have to be removed before practicing Namaz.Dry yourself of urine after using the toilet—usually with toilet paper. Then pour water over the areas where the urine was.
After defecating, use toilet paper to wipe and then pour water over the area.
You can also just use toilet paper or water to clean yourself as long as the urine didn’t dry outside of the urethra or the defecation did not get on one’s buttocks., The practice of wudu' involves washing certain body parts, such as the face, hands, arms, feet, ankles and head with water. While certain portions of the body must be washed for the wudu’ to be valid, some areas are not required to be washed but are recommended. When you start your wudu’, you must have the proper intention by saying to yourself, “I intend to perform wudu’.”You are obligated to wash your face from ear to ear and hairline to chin as well as your hands, forearms and elbows from right to left. It is recommended that you wash your hands, forearms and elbows 3 times. It is also recommended that you also say “Bismillah” along with “Allah” when washing your hands.You are obligated to wet wipe the top part of your head as well as wash your feet and ankles. It is recommended that you wash your feet and ankles three times from right to left.
It is recommended that you use your right hand to rinse your mouth and suck water into your nose and blow it out with your left hand—3 times. Also, it is recommended that you wet wipe both your ears 3 times as well.Things that will force you to stop wudu’ and start over include: passing urine, defecation or gas, touching the penis, vagina or anus with your palm, loss of consciousness, sleeping without being seated on your buttocks or any skin-to-skin contact with the opposite sex of marriageable age (except for immediate family members)., Certain circumstances will require that you perform ghusl instead of wudu’ to be cleansed after removing najas and before praying. If you wish to pray after having sexual intercourse, ending your menstruation period or postpartum bleeding, giving birth, or ejaculating. You are obligated to give your intention by saying to yourself, “I intend to perform ghusl.” To perform ghusl, you must wash your entire body and hair with water. It is recommended that you wash 3 times.
Note that when you perform either wudu’ or ghusl, anything that prevents water from touching the obligatory areas of the body must be removed, including things such as nail polish and waterproof mascara., If a Muslim is unable to use water, he or she may choose to perform tayammum instead of wudu’ or ghusl. However, tayammum can only be used for one obligatory prayer session. This rite involves using clean soil or dirt that has not been used before to perform tayammum, and starts with the intention, “I intend to perform tayammum to make performing the prayer permissible.”While it is recommended that you say “Bismillah,” you are obligated to hit the soil with your palms, then put the soil across your face.
Strike the soil again with your palms, then rub it across both hands and forearms up to the elbows. It is recommended to go from right to left, but you are obligated to ensure that the soil covers each arm and hand entirely.

, Being clear about the act of worship that you will perform is imperative to practicing Namaz. Each of the 5 obligatory prayers require a certain number of repetitions, so you will also need to be clear about the proper prayer time as well as the obligatory number you must say it. Your intention should go something like this: “I offer this (name of prayer type) prayer, of (number of repetitions) rakah’s in order to seek closeness to God.”


The dhuhr (noon) prayer- 4 repetitions
The asr (mid-afternoon) prayer- 4 repetitions
The maghrib (sunset) prayer- 3 repetitions
The isha' (nightfall) prayer- 4 repetitions
The subh or fajr (dawn) prayer- 2 repetitions

, Stand if you are able to. Raise your hand to the level of your ears and say, ""Allahu Akbar (God is great)” loud enough so you can hear yourself. You may also use your right hand to hold your left wrist and keep both hands above your navel., You must recite the 1st chapter of the Qur’an loud enough to hear yourself. It is very important that the Fatihah is recited properly. Each letter must be pronounced correctly, so it is always best to learn the Fatihah from a qualified instructor, if needed. Suratul-Fatihah goes: “Bismillahir-Rahmanir-Rahim, Al-Hamdu lillahi Rabbil- ^alamin, Ar-Rahmanir-Rahim, Maliki yawmid-Din, Iyyaka na^budu wa iyyaka nasta^in, Ihdinas-siratal-mustaqim, Siratal-ladhina an ^amta ^alayhim, Ghayril-maghdubi ^alayhim wa lad-dallin.”
If you cannot properly speak the entire Fatihah correctly, then you can recite the lines (qyahs) you are able to and repeat them as many times as is needed to equal the 156 words of the full Fatihah. If you don’t know any of the Fatihah, then you must recite another part of the Qur’an with 156 letters like the Fatihah.
If you don’t know any of the Qur’an, then you need to recite parts of the dhikr, such as: “subhanallah, al-hamdulillah, la ilaha illallah, and Allahu akbar (I declare that Allah is clear of all imperfections, praise and thanks to Allah, no one is God but Allah, and Allah is the Greatest) as many times as would render minimally the same number of letters in the Fatihah (Ibn Hibban an-Nawawiyy).”

, It is obligatory that you bow by bending at the waist so that your palms are able to reach your knees. Stay in the bowed position for the length of time it takes to recite, “subhanallah”. Then, straighten your back and stay there long enough to say, “subhanallah.” While bending or straightening your back, it is recommended that you put your hands next to your ears and say, “Allahu akbar” while bending or “Sami^ allahu liman hamidah (Allah hears who praises Him)” when straightening your back. It is recommended that you say, “subhana Rabbiyal- ^Adhim (Praise be to my Great Lord)” 3 times as you bow.
It is also recommended that you say, “Rabbana lakal-hamd (0 our Lord, to You the praise is due)” as you straighten your back.

, You are obligated to place your palms, knees and toes against the floor and press your forehead to the ground. While in this position, your heels should be off the ground with only the pads of your toes on the floor. The length of time that you should remain in this position equals how long it takes you to say, “subhanallah.” While you prostrate yourself, it is recommended that you raise your hands next to your ears and say, “Allahu akbar.”
If you are a man, it is recommended that you keep your elbows away from your sides as well as your abdomen lifted away from your thighs. If you are a woman, keep your elbows pulled in to your sides and trunk close to your thighs.

, Raise yourself from prostration and sit. You should sit for as long as it takes to speak, “subhanallah.” During this time, it is recommended that you say, “Allahu akbar” as well as, “Rabbighfir li warhamni wajburni warfa ^ ^ni warzuqni wahdini wa ^afini (0 my Lord, forgive me, have mercy on me, fulfill my needs, raise me, provide for me, guide me, and protect me from sickness).”It is also recommended that you tuck your left foot under your buttocks and keep the right foot vertical while sitting.

, You must perform another prostration and get back into the sitting position. Follow the steps for prostrating yourself as well as for getting into the sitting position again. This completes your first prayer repetition or rakah. , After completing the first prayer repetition (rakah), which includes the movements and statements in Part 3, the entire prayer must be repeated 2-4 times. The number of times you repeat the prayer will depend on the prayer time. Check Part 1: Preparing for Namaz to see details about how many prayer repetitions you must do for the dhuhr (noon) prayer, asr (mid-afternoon) prayer, maghrib (sunset) prayer, isha (nightfall) prayer and subh or fajr (dawn) prayer.

, When you have completed the 2nd prostration for your final prayer repetition, you must sit up and say the Tashahhud.The Tashahhud goes: “At-Tahiyyatul-mubarakat, as-salawatut-tayyibatu lillah. As­Salamu ^alayka ayyuhan-Nabiyyu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. As-Salamu ^alayna wa ^ala ^ibadillahis-salihin Ashhadu alla ‘ilaha illallah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa-Rasuluhu.”


You are obligated to say, “Allahumma salli ^ala Muhammad.” after this.

, Complete the prayer by looking at your right shoulder and telling the salaam, ""Assalamu Alai'kumWarah'matullah."" Next, look at your left shoulder and recite the same. This closes your prayer and you have finished one of the obligatory 5 daily prayers."

Perform Wudu It is a ritual ablution before you pray or handle the Holy Quran.,
Walk into a perfectly clean place.,
Erase all worldly worries from your heart.,
Perform the voluntary prayer.",How to Perform the Dhikr Prayer,";
, This step should be done because the names of God is pure. Thus we have to speak of His name in a clean place. Sit down on a prayer mat facing the Qiblah. It is the direction of the Holy Kabah.

, Make yourself calm. If you are having trouble over someone else, ignore it. Just think that nothing ever happened. Try to be in the state of awareness. Try to expel negative feeling or thought. Lightly close your eyes and bring your attention to the region of your heart.

, This is encouraged but not obligatory. It contains 4 cycles of prayer. This prayer will have you to extol Him 300 times in total. Make sure you have read the article on how to Perform Salah first before you try to understand the procedures given below. There is a slight difference in performing it in the day and in the night. This will be noted below.


Make niyyah or the intention to perform this Zikr prayer.
After reciting the Al-Fatihah and before the ruku', recite the phrase given below 15 times.
After ruku', recite it for another 10 times.
After qauma, recite it for another 10 times.
After the first sujood, recite it for another 10 times.
After qu'ud, recite it for another 10 times.
After the second sudjood, recite it for another 10 times. After that perform qu'ud again and recite it for another 10 times.
If you have counted, in total for one cycle of prayer, you would have recited it for 75 times. Thus for four cycles, it would be 300.
Note that for the second and forth cycle, there is a need to recite the tashahhud. So you will have to recite the phrase first before the tashahhud.
Also note that during the night, you will have to complete the prayer after two cycles. And then continue with another two cycles of prayer.

Remove the word “fat” from your vocabulary.,
Talk to yourself like you would a friend.,
Repeat body-positive affirmations.,
Treat negative media with caution.",How to Stop Fat Shaming Yourself1," No matter your size, referring to any part of your body as “fat” simply isn’t healthy. This term is often used in society with a negative connotation. Therefore, when you label yourself or a specific body part as “fat” you only reinforce a negative body image cycle.Catch yourself when you think of another person as ""fat"" as well. Start to redefine how you describe them, or better yet, don't think or talk about their size at all.
Drop this word from your vocabulary or replace it with medical or scientific terms for what you’re describing. For example, after enjoying an indulgent meal, don’t say “Oh, my stomach is so fat.” Say, “My stomach is bloated,” which is actually the proper description.;
, Self-compassion should be at the core of your relationship with your body. However, you probably talk negatively about your own body, while being encouraging to friends. Treat yourself with the same gentle support.You wouldn’t bash a friend for not having a thigh gap, so don’t demean yourself over it either.
In fact, you can build a healthier body image by acknowledging and appreciating your body for what it can do. For instance, you might say, “My thighs are strong and solid. I can do squats because of my thighs.”

, If you have been trained by society and the media to view your own and other bodies negatively, it will take some time to fully change your language. However, you can make a major impact by speaking more positively about yourself on a daily basis.Try writing down body-positive affirmations regularly, then reading them back to yourself or posting them somewhere you'll see them often.


Each morning as you brush your teeth or dress, repeat a positive mantra. Try ”I am my own version of sexy” or “Happiness isn’t size-specific.”, Magazines, reality TV shows, and social media are at the foundation of young women and men’s body image issues.These media sources often feature unrealistic, overly thin (in the case of women) and extra-muscular (for men) models and actors.


Frequently, these images have been altered, removing all flaws. As a result, you come to believe people actually look so perfect—and you beat yourself up for not meeting the standard.An important step towards changing your language about your body is learning that these media images aren’t real. They have been Photoshopped to spread ideals of attractiveness and to persuade you to buy their products or services.
Limit how much negative media you are exposed to. Instead follow media sources that emphasize being body-positive like Weightless, PsychCentral’s body image blog."

Work through each room of your home together.,
Adjust your schedules to be more minimalist.,

Keep your possessions to a minimum.,

Work together as a family to maintain your lifestyle.",How to Practice Minimalism As a Family," Before you and your family can practice minimalism together, you should sit down and discuss the importance of this possible lifestyle change together. Have a family meeting where you all discuss what it means to have a minimalist lifestyle and how it will benefit each member of the family. This will ensure everyone is on board with going minimalist and make it clear what you all expect to get out of adopting this lifestyle.For example, you may discuss the money you will save as a family by selling items you no longer use and by only buying items that are essential. You may also talk about how having less items in your home will give your children more space to run around and hang out.
You could also discuss how adopting a minimalist lifestyle will help to simplify your family’s daily routine, giving you all more time to relax, focus, and enjoy each other’s company.
Make sure to acknowledge anyone who is not on board with this philosophy, or who may need some extra support and encouragement to make the transition to minimalism. Give them a chance to voice their concerns about the lifestyle.;
, Start by going around your home together as a family and identifying areas that could use the minimalist treatment. You may write down certain items that you plan to get rid of in each room and start a list of items to throw out, sell, or give away.


You may also think about how you can reorganize the room so it looks less cluttered and more clean. You may write down notes for each room so you can address them as part of your plan once you put it into action.

, As a family, you should all think about the things you own and what you need and do not need. Go through your personal possessions and identify any items that you have not used in the last year to two years. You should also identify any items that are broken or worn out. Write down a list of personal possessions that you would be willing to give away, sell, or throw out.As a parent, you may instruct your children to do this on their own in their rooms. You may suggest that they try to create a list of at least 20 items they would be willing to let go of in their rooms.

, As a family, you should all consider how you can reduce the amount of time you spend on activities that are draining you of your energy or taking too much of your personal time. You may each sit down and write out certain activities that might feel draining or not all that enjoyable. You could also think about things in your schedules that cost a lot of money and feel complicated or stressful.For example, you may realize that as a family you all spend a lot of time and money eating out at fast food restaurants. You may think about how you can minimize the spending you do on dinner and eat in instead, allowing your family to spend more quality time at the dinner table.

, One simple way to embrace minimalism as a family is to start a decluttering bin and placing it in a central area in your home. You may then encourage your family members to put items they do not want or need in the bin. You could even have separate bins for items to donate, items to sell, and items to throw out. This could simplify the process further and make it clear where each item is going.To motivate your children to declutter their area, you may tell them they can get a half hour of extra play time with their favorite toy or media item if they do one hour of decluttering. This could encourage them to take the decluttering challenge seriously and put a dent in their stuff.
If you have teenagers in the house, you can try telling them that they can have extra time on the computer or on their phones if they participate in the decluttering of their room.

, As a family you should work together to declutter your home and be more minimalist with the things you own. Go through each room of your house together and throw out items you no longer use or no longer need. Be quick and efficient as you do this, as you do not want to get too attached or sentimental about certain items.You may try to embrace compromise as a family so you can still keep items that you value. For example, you may all make a deal that you can keep one or two sentimental items in your rooms and get rid of the rest.
If you cannot throw away too many items, you may try using storage bins to store the items so they are out of sight and the room is free of clutter.

, As a family you can all agree to practice minimalism through your actions as well as your possessions. You may all assess your schedules and make an agreement to be minimal about the activities you take on individually and as a family. Work together to see if you can take on activities that are really important or essential and drop activities that may not be benefiting you or taking up too much of your time.For example, you may ask your children if there is one activity they do now that feels too stressful or not as enjoyable as other activities. You may then tell them they can drop the activity to minimize their schedules.
You and your partner may also discuss ways that you can reduce the number of activities you do on a weekly basis. Perhaps you agree to take on less charity work or do less extracurricular activities so your time feels less cluttered.

, As part of adopting a minimalist lifestyle, you and your family will also need to shift your way of thinking about the traditions you do at home. Perhaps you all agree to create new traditions or to reduce the clutter in old traditions so you can all be more minimalist. This could mean hanging up half the decorations you usually do at Christmas or starting a new tradition where you volunteer at a homeless shelter for Christmas rather than give gifts to each other.You can start small and make small adjustments to your everyday routines. For example, you may designate Friday nights as stay in dinner night with your family where you eat a home cooked meal and play board games together. Or maybe you have a movie night in rather than spend money on going to the movies to reduce your spending and be more minimal.

, To maintain your minimalist lifestyle as a family, you should be aware of how many items you keep in your home. As a family, you should all agree to not buy new items unless they are essential and to think twice before accepting items from others. The idea is to keep your space uncluttered and free of extra stuff.You may all also agree to do a decluttering of your house once a month to get rid of any items that you no longer use or that you have no need for. Making this part of your routine can help you all maintain a more minimalist lifestyle.
You can encourage your family to do little things like keeping their rooms clean and free of clutter, as well as putting the dishes and other kitchen items away once they are done using them.

, You should all review your daily schedules and think about how you can further minimize your commitments and simplify your routines. Discuss how your attempts at minimizing your schedules have been working so far and think about ways you can minimize your schedules even further. You can also talk about what worked and what didn’t so you can improve your schedules.For example, you may talk with your partner about having more meals at home as this seems to be a good way minimizing your spending and have more quality time as a family. Or you may speak to your children about minimizing the time they spend on video games and using that time to do things together as a family instead.

, Practicing minimalism as a family can be a challenge, especially with the busyness of everyday life. You will all need to support and encourage each other to embrace the minimalist lifestyle to be successful. You can do little things like reminding each other why you are going minimal as a family. You can also support each other by getting rid of items you don’t need and by being willing to forgo new things.You may also have monthly family meetings where you talk about your minimalist lifestyle. Discuss what is working and what isn’t. Be honest and open with each other so you all feel supported.

Exercise because you love your body.,
Wear clothes that make you feel confident.,
Toss out the scale.,
Eat only when you’re hungry.",How to Stop Fat Shaming Yourself2," Fat-shaming and a negative body image are linked to higher instances of eating disorders.One common symptom of eating disorders can be excessive exercising. If you punish yourself for eating certain foods by working out for hours on end, quit. This habit reinforces the unhealthy ideas that food is a reward and fitness is punishment. Instead, decide on an exercise routine that keeps you healthy and happy. Do not change that schedule based on how much you have eaten or how bad you feel on a given day.


View exercise as a healthy part of your lifestyle. Engage in physical activity because you want to reduce stress or improve health indicators—not because you hate your body.Yoga can be a great practice to start because it helps you see how powerful your body can be. The associated meditations and breathing exercises also promote self-love., Many times you may fall prey to fat-shaming when you see your friends or even celebrities wearing tight-fitting or revealing clothes. You want to wear them, too. But, because you have a different body shape and size, it doesn’t look the same. The truth is everyone can look sexy and attractive when they dress with confidence.


Consider having your clothes tailored to fit your body. A few more expensive pieces you love can make you feel more confident than a large number of trendy clothes that don't fit well.
If you have the cash, consult with a stylist who can help you select pieces that play up your best assets. If not, check out fashion blogs for people with your body shape and pay attention to the cuts and materials these individuals wear.
Also, keep in mind that you can wear whatever you want. Don’t assume simply because you have a larger frame, you can’t wear clothes that thinner people wear. Have the confidence to love your body and flaunt it, if you want., Oftentimes, you may become obsessed with the number on the scale, not factoring in that there are many variables that contribute to health. If you get upset about the number you see, stop checking. Besides, weight is a very subjective indicator. Two people, one tall and one short, can weigh exactly the same but have incredibly different body shapes.If you want to track your fitness goals, use other indicators, such as the physical activities you are capable of, or your physical health.

, You can defeat fat-shaming when you change your relationship with food. If you have been overindulging in sugary, salty, or fattening foods, you may feel terrible afterwards. Then, you shame yourself for eating those foods. When you listen to your body and eat only when you're hungry, you won’t feel negative about your food choices. Eat slowly and check in every few minutes to see if you feel full yet. Don't be afraid to leave your food unfinished. If you dislike wasting it, you can put the leftovers in the fridge or compost them.


Learn what kinds of food improve your health and your mood, and opt for these instead of convenience foods. Passing on fast food in favor of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains, helps you support your health. Eating this way may also boost your self-confidence.
What’s more, eating healthy doesn’t have to mean you never enjoy a treat. Just practice moderation. Be mindful of triggers like boredom or sadness that may provoke you to eat when you’re not actually hungry. Start today actually listening to your body and feeding it what it needs."

Drop the comparisons.,
Figure out what’s in your control.,
Surround yourself with body-positive individuals.,
Perform daily self-care.",How to Stop Fat Shaming Yourself3," If you have gotten into the habit of comparing your body to those around you, you will stay on a rollercoaster of self-contempt. Comparisons set you up for failure because there will always be someone who is thinner than you.Remember that those people also have insecurities and things they wish they could change! They may even envy some of your features.


Stop comparing yourself to an idealized version of a male or female body. Instead focus on your individuality, your strengths. Do you have an eye for fashion? Start a blog or vlog. Are your eyes a dreamy shade of brown? Play up this feature with complementary eye shadows. Are you exceptionally compassionate? Offer your time as a volunteer.

, There’s a difference between wanting to realistically improve some aspect of your appearance versus wanting to become someone else. Face it: some people are just genetically thinner. In some cases, being overweight or simply larger than others is based on a person’s race, culture, and family background. These are things you can’t control.


If you must compare, look to body positive role models who come from the same background as you. Set reasonable goals that are based on what you can control, like your diet, your exercise habits, and stress-management. All of these factors affect your body weight, too.

, You may have developed a fat-shaming habit because you are always around people who judge their own or others’ bodies. This is especially common with women; many use fat-shaming as a form of bonding among the group. If you and your friends are in a contest to see who can hate their body the most, it’s time to forfeit.When you catch you and your friends fat-shaming, speak out. Say, “You know what guys? Let’s cut the ‘fat’ talk.”
In addition to raising awareness with existing friends, seek out new acquaintances who empower you to love your body just the way it is. Look for body-positive groups or organizations in your area or online.

, Sometimes, fat-shaming comes out because you feel bad about other things happening in your life. When you make self-care a regular part of your routine, you are less likely to use your body as a punching bag of criticism.Get some sunshine. Do things you enjoy like biking through a wooded trail, reading a science fiction novel, or painting your nails. Make a commitment to do at least one activity per day that nourishes your spirit, whether that’s a 5-minute meditation session in the morning or a relaxing cup of chamomile tea at night.

Learn and improve.",How to Preach," Start thinking of what to preach about as soon as possible. Give yourself at least one week, if not longer.When possible, it's actually wiser to start searching and planning a couple of weeks in advance. It can take a while before the right passage reveals itself, and even longer to prepare the right sermon around that passage. The words you preach need to be the result of thought and discernment, and not an emotional reaction.;
, Ask God for guidance. Since you'll be preaching God's truth, you should wait for God to reveal the truth He wants you to preach on.


Make a conscious effort to be in communion with God as you attempt to discern the right topic. Take a walk in the park as you pray. Meditate as you shower. Spend a few minutes thinking about it in the quiet morning hours.
Either a specific passage or a specific topic will come to mind. Both options can be useful as long as you keep the message centered around the Scriptures.

, If a topic comes to mind before an actual verse does, start looking for passages that directly talk about that topic. Comb through several different options until you find one that jumps out at you.


If a passage jumps out at you before a topic does, apply this step in reverse. Comb through the passage looking for its meaning. Once you latch onto the theme of the passage, consider looking up short supporting passages to note along with it.

, Don't be discouraged if you hit a dead end while pursuing one possible subject for your sermon. There are times when you may need to start the process over from scratch. Doing so might seem inconvenient, but it is a better option than forcing a message you can't wrap your thoughts around.

, Once you know what to talk about, pray for insight on what you should be saying about it. You should be in communication with God throughout the entire process of preaching, including each preparatory step.

, The message of your sermon should be centered around the Bible. Start from the passage or passages you've been led to and build the rest of your sermon up from there.


The message you preach should build upon biblical truth, not the other way around. In other words, you shouldn't plan out the message you want to deliver and twist scripture around in a way that fits your ideas. Your ideas need to work around the scriptural truth that already exists.

, Study the passage thoroughly to improve your own understanding. Consider its meaning within scriptural, historical, and cultural contexts.Look at the verses around the passage. Make sure you know and understand its immediate context so that you don't misinterpret the meaning.
Do a little external research, too, especially if the passage describes a custom or idea that is foreign to contemporary ways of thinking.

, All of God's Word is significant, but you should be asking yourself why this particular passage is so important and why God wants you to preach on it.


Figure out the theme of the passage. Ask yourself what it says about God and why people need to listen.
Note that some of this might be answered as you go through the process of selecting the passage, especially if you found the passage by searching the Bible for a specific topic.

, Don't assume that you already know everything there is to know about the passage you're working with. Let yourself be surprised by truths and perspectives hidden beneath the surface.


When dealing with a passage you're already familiar with, it can be easy to fixate on the safe, common meaning you already know. Don't settle for seeing only what you expect to see, though.
On the other hand, you also shouldn't look for hidden meaning that may not be there. Don't twist the text around for the sake of finding something shocking or new; simply accept any surprise insights that naturally arise.

, You can write out the entire sermon or simply settle for an outlined version, but either way, you should prepare a written plan that you can use when you're actually preaching.


Having a prepared text will usually keep you more centered when you actually start preaching. Unless you're remarkably fluent in the subject matter, impromptu preaching tends to be more disorganized and less insightful.
You can write the entire sermon word-for-word, use shortened notes, or use an outline. Outlines are generally preferred since they make it easier to look out into the congregation as you preach and limit the temptation to stare at your notes the entire time.

, Some passages may seem self-explanatory, but oftentimes, those passages make more sense within a broader context. Include any scriptural or historical information needed to really bring the text into focus.


Think back to the research you did while trying to understand the passage. Information that granted you new understanding should be included in your sermon.
Don't get too carried away, of course. You still need to focus your sermon on the Word itself. Supporting details should be used to increase the listener's understanding of the passage and should not steal the show.

, You need to illustrate how the text applies to real life in the contemporary world. Give your listeners information they feel can be useful to them as they navigate through the trials and temptations of the everyday.


Start with the end in mind. As you organize your sermon, think about what your listeners need to learn from it and structure the flow of the sermon so that it builds up to that.
Directly relate the message to some real-life scenario, and try to choose a fairly common scenario that will appeal to as many different people as possible. By illustrating one possible application of the message, you can help your listeners understand how to apply the message to their own lives.
In applying the message, you should also end up challenging the listener. Your sermon should give your listeners something to think on and prod them into doing some type of positive action that is consistent with biblical truth.

, Practice preaching the sermon aloud beforehand. During your practice, you should also time yourself and edit your sermon appropriately.


As a general rule, aim for a sermon roughly 25 to 30 minutes long. A sermon that's meaningful but a little on the short side is usually more effective than a long, rambling sermon.Practicing your sermon can also help you determine the most effective way to preach it. The more familiar you become with it, the easier it will be to add pauses and stresses in all the right places.

, Before standing up and preaching to the people, you should spend a few quiet minutes praying for guidance, clarity, and wisdom.


Even if the text you've written has been prayerfully crafted and practiced, you still need to pray for the ability to deliver it well. You should also pray for the hearts and minds of your listeners to remain open to the message.

, Avoid using academic jargon or other phrasing that some of the congregation won't understand. Speak in simple, conversational terms so that the message will be accessible to everyone who hears it.


This doesn't mean that you should water down or simplify the message. The truth you preach should be deep and meaningful, but the words you use to preach it must be understandable to the majority of your audience if you want them to make an impact.

, Your body language should be engaging. As a general rule, try to appear confident and friendly instead of looking stiff, nervous, or overly-stern.


Even if you don't feel confident, you should try to look it. Avoid nervous ticks, the frequent use of nonsense words like “uh” and “um,” and other signs of anxiety. If you don't look confident, the message of your sermon might lose credibility.
Your manner of speech, movements, and expressions should match with your words. Behave seriously when talking about something serious, but relax when talking about something lighthearted.

, There might be times when the Holy Spirit legitimately takes you in an unexpected direction, but for the most part, you should stick to the text and points you prepared beforehand. Losing focus in the middle of a sermon can cause it to drag on and seem aimless.


When a sermon drifts off course, you may end up losing a good portion of your listeners. At that point, it can be easy to start talking more in an effort to bring them, but additional rambling will usually hurt your cause more than help it. A better option would be to simply remain more concise from that point on.

, The use of humor and creative illustrations can help a sermon when applied in a supportive nature, but if you rely on these tactics too much, they can actually weaken the overall message.


Any humor you use should be relevant to the overall message. It might be used to grab the listener's attention or illustrate a point. It can even be used to relieve tension.You should not, on the other hand, use humor to win approval. It won't do anybody any good if the congregation remembers your joke but forgets the message.

, After you finish preaching, evaluate how effective you were. Ask for feedback from those who listened to you. Figure out what you did well and where you can improve, then adjust your technique accordingly the next time you preach.


Go to other members of your pastoral team or trusted members of the congregation for constructive critiques.
Consider asking someone to record you as you preach, then watch the tape shortly after church ends that same day. You'll probably be able to learn a lot just by watching yourself.
Accept the fact that you aren't perfect. There will always be room for improvement, especially when you don't have much prior preaching experience.

Love only One.,
Remembrance (Zikr).,
Muraqbah or Meditation.,
Read Sufi Poetry and literature.,
Sima or Sama.,
Be persistent.",How to Love God Through Sufism," Sufism is based on strict monotheism. Remember you want to attain the love of God. As in one of the verse of the Bible, God say, "".... I am a jealous God"", although it has been used figuratively. As one falls in love, his/her beloved doesn't tolerate that their lover even look at any other person.;
, Take out some time to remember God. Sufi's do this through chanting names of God loudly or silently. You can remember your beloved without any words. The key is to remember God as one thinks about beloved. Use Arabic names: Ya Allah (O' Allah) Ya Rahman (O' Merciful) etc or you may use words that are specifically for God.

, Different orders have different ways of meditation, but a very simple meditation is: to think about the blessings of God on you, think about how the nature works, how God dealt with people before or anything about God. Remember love's analogy; when you love someone you keep thinking about them e.g., how they speak, how they dress, how they talk to you etc. Sit in a quiet comfortable place for 5-10 minutes and relax, then leave every thing and begin to think about God's blessings. Initially focusing will be not be easy, but with time you would be able to concentrate instantly.

, Jalal-ud-din Rumi is 13th century Sufi saint and poet. His work is well known to western readers. Similarly, Razi, Hafiz, Ghazali are also worth reading.

, Listening to Sufi music and poetry. All of us must have seen whirling Dervishes of Turkey. They dance on the tunes of Sima or Sufi music. Remember, when one is in love they are more inclined to poetry and music, similarly, this practice brings you closer to God.

, As in love, you can't win the heart of your beloved instantly. Be persistent and patient, through consistent practice and devotion you may achieve that state when even God will begin to love you!

Don't expect to follow Namaz perfectly at first.",How to Pray Namaz," Prayer is a time to get closer to Allah and learn more about your religion. The duties of a believer are listed in something called the Five Pillars of Islam. Adhering to these Pillars of Islam is an important part of being a Muslim. Worship is the second Pillar of Islam, and Namaz is the name for the formal Muslim prayer, the most important ritual of Islamic worship.The rite of Namaz only takes a few minutes to perform, and involves the combination of postures and recitations;
, Search for mosques near you. Depending on where you live, this may prove difficult. At mosque, every Friday and on the two major Islamic holidays, the Namaz will be performed with the whole local Muslim community. Depending on the rules of the area this will include either all the male believers or all the male and female believers, Friday congregation Namaz takes place at noon and is followed by a sermon. Congregational Namaz takes place at mid-morning on the two major Islamic holidays

, Namaz is the recitation of passages from the Qur'an. Muslims believe the Qur'an should be read and recited in the original Arabic, however, many Imams have said translation and prayer can take place in the native language of the person praying as long as he or she is working to learn Arabic., The ritual traditionally includes a cleansing of the body, the use of a sajjada, or prayer mat, and facing the Kaaba, the central shrine in Mecca.Before beginning prayers ablution, or ritual cleansing, must be completed. This involves washing the hands, feet, and face, with water.
Adherents are to act as though in the presence of God. Therefore, fidgeting, glancing around the room, and talking are all forbidden while performing Namaz.
The direction that the Kaaba is in is called qibla. The simplest way to determine how to face the Kaaba while praying is to look at a map and draw a line between your location and Mecca.

, While standing, lift both hands facing forward to the shoulders or ears and proclaim, ""Allahu Akbar"", or God is great. Then place the left hand under the right hand over the naval or on the chests while standing. During this position, the first chapter of the Qur'an is typically recited or read., Bow with both hands placed just below the knee. During this position one recites the following three times: ""Glory be to God, the most Great."" Then say, ""God listens to the one who praises Him,"" while standing straight. Once standing, position hands loosely at your sides and say, ""To God belongs all praise"" 3 times.

, Kneel and touch your head to the floor with your palms, forehead, nose, knees, and toes only on the floor. Say, ""Glory be to God, the most high"" 3 times.

, Say, ""God is great"" while moving to the sitting position. A short prayer may be recited or a short silence may be observed. Then say, ""God is great"" while moving back to the kneeling position. Recite ""Glory be to God, the most high"".

, Return to the sitting position and recite prayers. To end the prayer turn to the right and say, ""Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of Allah."" Then turn to the left and repeat.


The complete set of postures may be repeated as necessary depending on the specific prayer being performed.

, Fajr is the morning prayer, and it occurs after the break of dawn but before sunrise.
Dhuhr is the noon prayer, and it occurs after noon but prior to afternoon.
Asr is the afternoon prayer, and it occurs between late afternoon but before sunset.
Maghreb is the sunset prayer, and it occurs after sunset but prior to darkness.
Isha is the night prayer, and is offered anytime at night but usually just before going to bed.

, Namaz is to be performed five times a day, with exemptions made for special situations. The strict following of this schedule is an important part of the Second Pillar of Islam. Nowadays, there are more ways than ever to remember when to pray.


Apps for your smartphone exist which are designed to remind you when to perform the next Namaz. Alternatively, you can use simple alarms on your phone. Be sure to adjust these regularly though, as sunrise and sunset changes throughout the year.

, The Muezzin of the mosque is the person appointed to call the congregation to prayer, lead the Namaz, and recite the prayer. In some Muslim communities, the Muezzin holds the important role of keeping the community on schedule for the Namaz.Some Muezzins also perform their duties over the radio, so that one can follow the Muezzin even at home.

, If you are just starting out in Islam than try your hardest. If you have been Muslim for a while try to do as much prayer as you can. Allah understands in situations that prayer can not be done but try to make up prayer. Some work places and schools however don't allow people to pray inside them but try to make it up later and read Qu'ran as well to be a great Muslim!

Ensure the area is clean and free of impurities.,
Face the Qibla.,
Pray at the proper time.",How to Pray in Islam1," This includes your body, your clothes, and the place of prayer itself.



Perform Ablution if necessary. You must be ritually pure before you go about praying. If you're not, it's required to perform Wudu before you do. If since your last prayer you have urinated, defecated, passed gas, bled excessively, fallen asleep lying down, leaned against something. In case you vomited, passed seminal fluid, ejaculated or fainted, then you have to bathe in the Islamic way. Make sure all of your necessary parts are covered. The nakedness of a man is considered to be between the navel and the knees; for a woman, her entire body except the face and palms.
If you are praying in a masjid (mosque), which is preferred, enter quietly--other fellow Muslims might still be praying and you don't want to disturb them. Stand in a free space away from the entrance/exit.

If you are unsure of the cleanliness of your area, spread a mat or cloth on the floor for good measure. This mat (or prayer rug) is very important to Islamic culture.

;
, This is the direction all Muslims face to turn in prayer toward Kabah.


The Holy Mosque in Mecca is the most revered place of worship for Muslims around the entire world. At the center of the mosque is the Ka'ba. All Muslims are required to face the Ka'ba five times every day when offering their prayers.

, The five prayers of each day take place at very specific times. For each one, there is a brief period of time it can be performed, determined by the rising and falling of the sun. Each salah takes about 5 to 10 minutes from start to finish, but should never be hurried.The five prayers are Fajr, Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Isha. They are at dawn, immediately after noon, in the mid-afternoon, at sunset, and at night, respectively. They are not at the same time each day as they are timed by the sun, which changes path throughout the seasons.
These are the amount of rakat (rounds, more or less) for each of the 5 salah:

Fajr - i) First two rakat Sunnah Mo'akadda, ii) Two rakat Fard
Zuhr - i) Four rakat Sunnah Mo'akadda, ii) Four rakat Fard, iii) Two rakat Sunnah Mo'akadda, iv) Two rakat Nafl (Optional but spiritually beneficial)
Asr - i) Four rakat sunnah ghair mo'akadda (Optional but spiritually beneficial), ii) Four rakat Fard
Maghrib - i) Three rakat Fard, ii) Two rakat Sunnat Mo'akadda, iii) Two rakat nafl (Optional but spiritually beneficial)
Isha - i) Four rakat sunhat e Ghair Mokadda (Optional but spiritually beneficial), ii) Four rakat Fard, iii) Two Rakat Sunnat Mokadda, iv) Two rakat Nafil (Optional but spiritually beneficial), v) Three rakat Wajib, vi) Two rakat Nafil (Optional but spiritually beneficial)

Return to sajda and, just as before, say ""Subhanna - Rabbeyal - Alla - wal - Bi - haamdee"" three times.

, Stand up and say, """"Allah - Akbar."" You have completed 1 Rakat. Depending on the time of day, you may need to complete up to three more.


In every second rakaat, after second sajda, sit on your knee again and recite ""Atta - hiyyatul - Muba - rakaatush - shola - waa - tuth thaa - yi - batu - lillaah, Assa - laamu - alaika - ayyuhan - nabiyyu warah - matullaahi - wabaa - rakaatuh, Assaa - laamu - alaina - wa alaa - ibaadil - laahish - sho - le - heen.

, Take a few moments of concentrated silence to think about what you are about to do. Think about why you are calling the adhan: consider what this moment means to you, to your faith, and to the people who you are calling.

, Muffle your ears with your index fingers, or clasp your hands over the opening from the outside. This step is optional, but traditional. Plugging your ears may help you set your intention and focus on the words you are about to say.

, Pronounce it ""ash-hadu awn-a Mu-ha-mud-awn rah-sool all-ah""., This means, ""Come to prayer."" Pronounce it ""high-ah-ala al-sal-ah"".

, It translates to ""Come to felicity."" Pronounce it ""high-ah-ala al-fa-lah"".

, There is some disagreement about what comes after ""Hayya'ala al-falah"" and before the final repetitions of ""Allahu Akbar"". The words that you use here will depend on which school of Islam you follow. Be aware of the implications, and be careful not to offend anyone. If you aren't sure what to do, consider skipping this line and moving on to the next phrase.


If you are a Sunni, say ""Assalatu khayru min an-naum"" here. This means ""Prayer is better than sleep.""Only use this line when calling Fajr, the dawn prayer.If you are a Shia, say ""Hayya- al Khair al amal."" This encourages worshipers to ""Hasten toward the best thing.""

,, Most muezzins only say this once, according to the four schools, although the Imamis say it twice. The Malikis and Shafi’is permit repetition of the last line, considering it sunnah: the adhan, according to them, is not invalid if it is recited only once, as the Imamis hold.

, You do not need to fill this space with a du'a, but it is mustahabb (preferred) to do so.A du'a is a personal prayer or meditation. Say, ""Allahumma Rabba Hathihi Al-Da'awati Al-Taamma Wal Salati Al-qaa’ima, Aati Sayyedana Muhammadan Al-Wasilata Wal-Fadilata Wal-Darajata Al-'aleyata Al Rafî‘a, Wa b‘ath-hu Allahumma Maqaman Mahmudan Allathi Wa‘adtahu, Innaka La Tokhlifu Al-Mee'ad."", This is the final call to prayer before the beginning of salah. The exact words and their repetitions will vary from school to school, so consider asking a respected member of your community about exactly what to say. Once you say the iqama, the prayer session can begin.Say the iqama with a lower voice than you called the adhan. People should still be able to hear you, but they should be closer now."

Pray an odd number of rak’ah for your Witr prayer.",How to Perform Witr Prayer," Witr prayer is the final prayer of the day and consists of an odd number of rak’ahs or prayer units. Alongside fasting and the salat al-duha prayer, Witr is one of the most important aspects of the Islamic faith.Figure out your options for praying Witr. The prophet gives options for praying Witr at night, such as deciding how many prayer units or rak’ah you will perform and when you will pray during the night.;
, Find a time that works for your schedule and fits within the allowed time window for the Witr prayer. The time window for praying Witr lasts between the final mandatory prayer of the day, which is called Isha, and the rise of dawn. If you think you can wake up before dawn, you could wake up and pray. If you are worried about sleeping through dawn, you should perform Witr before going to bed.Make time for Witr while travelling. When the Prophet travelled, he still performed Witr. So, when you travel, you should also perform Witr., The minimum number of rak’ah for witr is one, so you should perform at least one rak’ah. However, you may choose to perform an odd number of rak’ah greater than one, such as three, five, seven, or nine rak’ah., You will need a place to perform Witr prayer at night, so make sure you have a space for praying. This is especially important if you are travelling or visiting friends. You will also need enough time to perform Witr. Since there are options for how many Rak’ah you perform, you should be able to perform Witr even while travelling.If you are a university or college student, some schools now offer prayer rooms on campus. Inquire with the university student union or with administration to find out about prayer rooms.Make sure you have a clean place to pray., Men should wear pants that go all the way down to the ankles. Women should wear clothes that cover their entire bodies except for face and hands.For example, men could wear loose fitting cotton pants.For example, women might choose to wear long sleeved dresses., State how many rak’ah you plan to perform for your Witr prayer.It is important to have good intentions and to pray to please Allah., Start the rak’ah by standing up straight for prayer. Then, bow forward and prostrate. Finally, sit and prostrate. You have now performed one rak’ah of Witr.


Start by standing for prayer. Keep your hands over your chest and grasp your left hand with your right hand.To bow: bend at the waist and rest your hands on your knees. Keep your back straight, and then make a recitation silently to yourself (for example, Subhana Rabil Azeem or glory to my lord the mighty).To prostrate: Put your forehead to the floor and your hands to either side. Remember to keep your elbows off the floor. In this position, you can make a recitation (e.g., Subhana Rabil Azeem or glory to my lord the mighty)

, Place your hands on your thighs and close to your knees.Then, you hold your right hand closed with your thumb and middle finger touching to form a circle. You point your index finger towards Qiblah. You then recite the Tashahhud.Bear witness to God and to his servant Muhammad., Sit down and turn your head to the right shoulder, then say, “Assalaamu Alay kum wa Rahmatullah.” You then turn your head to the left and repeat the same phrase. You have now completed the peace offering or tasleem.

, You may choose to perform one, three, five, seven, nine, or eleven prayer units or rak’ah. For example, you can choose from the following options for praying Witr:


Pray a one rak'ah Witr prayer. You have now performed the Sunnah.Pray a three rak’ah Witr prayer. There are two options for performing the three rak’ah Witr prayer. In the first option, you can pray the three rak’ah in a row and then offer a final tashahhud.The tashahhud is the testification of faith. In the second option, you say the tasleem after performing two rak’ah and then pray one more rak’ah.
Pray a five or seven rak’ah of Witr. If you want to perform a five or seven rak’ah, you should perform the rak’ah continuously and then offer one tashahhud and say the tasleem at the end.Pray a nine rak’ah Witr. Perform the rak’ah continuously, one after another. In the eighth rak’ah, you should perform the tashahhud. In the ninth rak’ah, you should offer the final tashahhud. Finally, you should say the tasleem.
Pray an eleven rak’ah Witr. If you pray an eleven rak’ah Witr, you should say tasleem after every two rak’ah."

Measure the length of the shadow, and draw a circle around the stick using the shadow length as the radius.
As the day progresses, the shadow will shorten and move away from the circle. It will eventually start to lengthen as the day wears on, and then touch the circle again. At that point, make another mark, and draw a line between the two marks you made.
The line is west to east, with the first point being west, the second being east.

Understand that it does take time.",How to Be Regular with Your Prayers in Islam," The only way to stay regular with your prayers is to understand what it is and to learn the benefits of it. You could be standing in prayer and have no idea what you're doing, but you're doing it anyway because you have to. This is not the correct way to stay regular with your prayers and could cause you to feel discouraged and prevent you from praying. Learn the meaning of it and understand what it is by looking into the Qur'an and reading Hadiths.


In the Qu'ran it says, ""And I have chosen you, so listen to that which is inspired to you. Verily, I am Allah! There is none worthy of worship but I, so worship Me and offer prayer perfectly for My remembrance."" We pray only to worship Allah and to remember him. It's mentioned in a Hadith that states ""The first matter that the slave will be brought to account for on the Day of Judgment is the prayer. If it is sound, then the rest of his deeds will be sound. And if it is bad, then the rest of his deeds will be bad."" ;
, To be aware when it's almost time to pray, set alarms for each prayer that is five minutes before the actual prayer. This can help prepare yourself such as wearing proper clothing, finding an area to pray, making Wudu, and encouraging your Muslims friends or family members to get ready to pray, too.


You may want to set alarms on your phone, tablet, or computer so you can get a notification about prayer.
If you can't set an alarm, try sticking the times of prayer on a piece of paper and placing them all around areas in the house that you'll see such as on the fridge, on your calendar, etc.
If you find it hard to stick to an alarm, you might find it helpful for a Muslim friend or family member to remind you when prayer time is near. However, do remember you are responsible for your own prayers so avoid depending on them too much. , It can be hard to always pray at the masjid (mosque) everyday so if you are busy and have other tasks to do, it is acceptable to pray at home. If you're out and know you won't be coming home in awhile, you can pray at the place you're in as long as you pray in a quiet, clean area (i.e praying at school, work, store, etc.).

, Praying regularly is a great blessing and the rewards for it are great. Constantly remind yourself how important prayer is and the benefits of it. Prayer brings you closer to Allah and allows you to reflect on all His gifts He has given you. It also allows you to ask Allah for help when you are going through a difficult time. The prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “The most important of all matters is Islam, its spinal cord is prayer and the highest rank is Jihaad for the sake of Allah.” Prayer also wipes off any bad sins. The prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ""Tell me, if there's an overflowing river in front of the house and you bathe into it five times a day, will there remain any dirt on you? They said, ‘No dirt will remain on him’. He then said: “That is the example of the five daily obligatory prayers by which Allah erases sins.” , The only way to be regular with your prayers is to remember Allah daily. This will prevent you from forgetting Him and will allow you stay regular with your prayers. Do Islamic tasks often such as making Dhikr, giving charity or Zakat, attending Islamic gatherings or speeches, listening to Islamic lectures, reciting the Qur'an, fasting, and participating in other good deeds. , Keeping at your prayers regularly is not always easy and you will feel lazy or discouraged at times. Understand that this is normal and many Muslims know that feeling. However, it's important not to give in and to ask Allah to help you by making Du'a. You can find many good Du'as in the Qur'an or you can create one yourself by expressing yourself truthfully on how you need help to Allah. Some Du'as in the Qu'ran include:


""My Lord, make me an establisher of prayer, and from my descendants. Our Lord, and accept my supplication.""
""Our Lord! Perfect our light for us and forgive us our sins, for verily You have power over all things.""
""Our Lord! Pour out on us patience and constancy, and make us die as those who have surrendered themselves unto You.""
""Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate from the truth after You have guided us, and bestow upon us mercy from Your grace. Verily You are the Giver of bounties without measure.""

, If you're traveling, you are allowed to combine your prayers to help make it easy for you as you travel. If you're very weak or sick, you can pray sitting down, and if that's hard enough, you can also pray laying down. Point being: Praying should not be a hassle and Allah has made it very easy for you. It takes approximately 10-15 minutes to pray, and sometimes even less depending on how much you pray or what prayer it is.

, There are times where you won't exactly be on time for prayer (e.g if you are a surgeon you can't step out to pray during an operation, if you're a student you can't go pray during an exam, etc.) nor will you be absolutely perfect for each one. You might wake up late and miss your prayer or just simply forget about it at one point. Don't feel discouraged and keep striving to be on time and regular to your prayers.


Understand that Allah is the All-Forgiving (Al-Ghafoor). If you do end missing your prayer or delaying it for whatever reason, repent to Him and ask Him to make it easier for you. , Give yourself a small gift to reward yourself when you start to stay regular for your prayers daily. You could perhaps buy a small gift, eat out, or do something fun such as go out to the park. A small gift will encourage to keep up the habit and stay regular with your prayers.

, If you're new to praying or have recently converted, keeping regular at your prayers isn't always easy and will require a lot on your part to stay regular. Understand that Allah helps those who really try to worship Him, and with His will, you'll be able to pray regularly and keep at your prayers.

Consider saying the Tahajjud with your family.,
Emulate the practices of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).,
Make the Tahajjud part of your routine.",How to Perform the Tahajjud Prayer," After praying the Isha prayer and before going to sleep, make arrangements to wake up during the night before the Fajr prayer (for instance, you may want to set an alarm clock or have a family member agree to wake you). Though the Tahajjud can be prayed at any part of the night, if possible, it is best to pray it after midnight, especially during the last third of the night. The time two-thirds of the way between Maghrib and Fajr is a good time for Tahajjud. This is because Allah descends to the lowest heaven during the last third of the night, asking, ""Who is asking me, so I can give to him? Who is calling upon me, so I can answer him? Who is seeking my forgiveness, so I can forgive him?'"" If you make an honest effort to wake up and perform the Tahajjud but accidentally sleep through the night, don't feel guilty. According to the Hadiths, Allah records your genuine intention to perform the Tahajjud and grants you sleep as an act of mercy.;
, Wake up during the night at the time you've chosen. Once you wake, perform Wudu, the ritual ablution Muslims use to cleanse themselves before they pray or handle the Holy Quran. Traditionally, performing Wudu means using clean water to wash oneself in the following four ways:


Washing the face
Washing the arms and hands up to and including the elbows
Wiping the head (Masah)

Washing the feet up to the ankles
Note that many Muslims (including the Prophet Muhammad ) also choose to wash their mouth and teeth with a miswak before the Tahajjud.If you have discharged mani earlier in the night, whether during sexual intercourse or a wet dream, then the Ghusl full-body ritual cleansing must be performed.

, This is done because Allah's names are pure, so, whenever possible, Muslims are encouraged to speak of Him in clean, holy places as a form of reverence. Wearing your normal prayer clothes, sit down on a prayer mat and face the Holy Kabah in Mecca as you would for your obligatory prayers.


To be clear, you don't need to be anywhere special, like a mosque or a lavishly-decorated room in your house, to pray the Tahajjud. All that's needed is a spot that's clean which can even be in your room.

, At the time for prayer, calmly focus and reflect on the glory of your Lord. Do not worry about fleeting worldly problems that are ultimately meaningless in comparison to His infinite wisdom and mercy. Calm yourself and forget your worldly problems, hopes, and fears. Ignore any negative, distracting thoughts or feelings. Close your eyes and focus your attention on your heart as you begin to achieve a heightened state of spiritual awareness.

, As you start your prayer, make a definitive mental declaration to yourself that you are about to perform the Tahajjud. Decide that you are going to complete the Tahajjud in the specific way you have chosen, including how many rakats and which surahs you will recite. Also decide why you are saying the Tahajjud — for instance, to glorify Allah, thank Allah or ask for His forgiveness. You don't have to make this declaration out loud — Allah knows your thoughts, so your intentions will be clear to him as long as they are clear to you.


The Tahajjud is typically performed by repeating multiple rakats (cycles) of Salah, the ritual that Muslims use for their required daily prayer. For the Tahajjud, the rakats are usually performed in pairs, so you'll also want to decide exactly how many rakats you intend to perform at this time. See below for more information.

, To begin your Tahajjud, start by performing two rakats (cycles) of Salah. Salah begins by standing and reciting verses from the Holy Quran. Then, the person praying continues by bowing low with his hands on his knees, then prostrating on the ground with his forehead, nose, and palms on the floor and his elbows raised, sitting on his knees with his feet folded under him, and finally standing and reciting ""Allahu Akbar."" This description of Salah is a generalization — if you're not sure how to perform Salah properly, learn this fundamental Muslim skill before attempting the Tahajjud.


Emulate the practices of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) who used to recite the following surahs after each rakat in Tahajjud:After reciting the Al-Fatihah the first rakat, recite the surah ""Al-Kafirun"".
After reciting the Al-Fatihah for the second rakat, recite the surah ""Al-Ikhlas"".



, Generally, two rakats is seen as the minimum necessary for a proper Tahajjud. However, it's possible to repeat as many more as you wish. For instance, according to the Hadiths, the Prophet Muhammad frequently prayed up to thirteen rakats.For most Muslims, Tahajjud rakats are performed in pairs and eight rakats is seen as plenty. In other words, most Muslims will say two, four, six, or eight rakats, though more is not necessarily discouraged.


If you are able to, then reciting long surahs such as Al-Baqarah, An-Nisā’ or Al-‘Imran are highly commended, even if you can manage them only from time to time.
Following in the example of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), if you notice dawn approaching while you say your Tahajjud, you may end by performing one rakat as Witr (an optional pre-dawn prayer said before the required Fajr)., After you've completed the number of rakats you set out to pray, you may add your own prayers as long as they're sincere, respectful, and done in complete devotion to Allah. These may be offered in extended prostration in your own words and language. You may want to offer additional thanks and praise to Allah, pray for strength and guidance, or make a special request for help. For instance, you may ask for blessings for a friend who is suffering through difficult times or help with your own worship. Prayers should be offered with humbleness, fear, hope and patience. This is an ideal time to pray for forgiveness for your mistakes and sins. Acknowledge your wrongdoings, sincerely promise not to repeat them and ask Allah for forgiveness and leniency in any punishment that He may decide to prepare for you. Any prayer you offer will be heard, and, if Allah wills, your prayer will be answered in kind.

, Because the Tahajjud interrupts your normal sleep, it's not unlikely that you may be somewhat tired when you attempt the prayer. If, however, you're so tired that you find yourself forgetting what you're saying as you recite your prayers or you doze off in the middle of your Tahajjud, don't attempt to complete the prayer. In this case, according to the Hadiths, Allah notes your sincere willingness to complete the Tahajjud. You may go back to sleep without any need to be embarrassed or ashamed, but try to better prepare yourself next time, perhaps by going to bed earlier.

, To gain a greater understanding of the unique importance of the Tahajjud prayer, you may want to consult any of the numerous references to the prayer in Islamic scripture. Most notably, the Tahajjud is mentioned in the Quran and discussed at great length in the Hadiths. However, it is also discussed in the work of Islamic scholars throughout the history of the religion.


To start, try reading Book 21 (Prayer at Night) from Sahih Bukhari. 70 Hadiths in this book describe the habits the Prophet (pbuh) regarding the Tahajjud.Commentary on the Tahajjud is also offered at multiple points in the Quran, including Surat 17:79 and Surat 39:9., Muslim families are encouraged to pray the Tahajjud in communion with each other because both Muhammad (pbuh) and his wife Aisha recommended that husbands and wives should say the Tahajjud together.Performing the Tahajjud as a family allows you to come closer to each other in devotion to Allah and to show solidarity in your worship. If you're interested in trying this, ask your spouse and/or children to join you before the first night you plan to say the Tahajjud together, then, if they need your help to do so, wake them up and celebrate Allah's infinite greatness and mercy in quiet prayer together. Children over the age of ten should be encouraged gently to develop the habit of praying Tahajjud when they are ready, but if it is too difficult for them to wake in the night then no blame should be apportioned and they should not be admonished, as long as they are up for Fajr and complete their other obligatory prayers.


Generally, families that pray the Tahajjud together make exceptions for members that need their sleep, like small children, the sick, and the elderly.

, All Muslims are encouraged to live in emulation of the life of Muhammad (pbuh), Allah's Messenger and the Seal of the Prophets. If you're looking for guidance in performing the Tahajjud, you may want to study the ways Muhammad (pbuh) performed the Tahajjud and try to work these habits into your daily life. By striving to emulate the Prophet (pbuh)'s Tahajjud practices, Muslims can work towards the perfect ideal represented by him and, in doing so, become closer to Allah.


As noted above, Book 21 from Sahih Bukhari is a great place to start if you're looking for information on Muhammad (pbuh)'s Tahajjud habits.

, As an optional prayer, the Tahajjud certainly isn't something that any Muslim should feel compelled to do. However, many Muslims choose to practice the Tahajjud on a regular basis (if not every night) when they are able. Like all forms of prayer, saying the Tahajjud brings the person praying closer to Allah. In addition, the Tahajjud is often associated with Allah's gifts of forgiveness and redemption, making it a great way to seek correction for each day's minor failures, sins and imperfect actions. Remember that Allah appreciates regular acts of worship, so if you start praying Tahajjud, try not to give it up. If you're interested in making the Tahajjud a regular part of your life, you may want to try setting a recurring alarm to wake you up during the night or even having a predetermined area in your house for performing this prayer.

You'll learn what hijab types and products are available when you go looking, and learn what to do with hijabs that require tying, folding, wrapping or pinning.;
, Go to a store that sells Muslim clothing and look at their hijab selection. Some hijabs consist of a single piece of fabric that may be square, oblong, or triangular. These are often wrapped and pinned or tied to hold them in place. Others consist of tubes of fabric that slip over the head, and these come in one-piece and two-piece styles. The tube style is often easier for beginners, as they don't require pinning. Find a hijab that matches your outfit, or in a neutral color. Avoid wearing excessively bold colours and designs that stand out. Hijabs made of natural fibers like silk, or cotton are often more comfortable, as these fabrics ""breathe.""

, If you aren't quite ready to wear your hijab, you might confuse or offend other Muslims if you wear it inconsistently. So it is best if you begin wearing hijab when you feel ready for a commitment to wear it consistently, but above all wear it for the sake of Allah.

, Don't think that if you wear hijab, people will look down on you. Your friends will still be your friends. If anybody asks you on your decision on wearing a hijab, tell them that you want to become a good Muslim. They actually will start to respect you for what you have done. If they start to comment and criticize your decision to wear hijab, you may have to decide whether you think your relationship can tolerate the difference, or if you need to keep your distance to avoid further conflict. Moreover, you can become a good representative of all Muslims. Show that Muslims care for their image. Some Muslim women choose to take the additional step of covering their face as part of their hijab.

, Wear bold tunics, swirling skirts, wide-legged pants and structured long jackets. Many Muslim clothing companies offer beautiful long dresses for casual and formal wear, and chic suits for the office. Hijab isn't a uniform and there's no compulsion to be drab, but avoid being overly ostentatious too.

, Freedom rules! Show off your inner un-hijabi self. Just be absolutely certain that there are no men in the room; put a sign on the door if needed.

, If you play team sports, you may need to wear long shirts or pants underneath the team uniform. Get a hijab designed for athletic wear in a color that matches your uniform or a neutral color, as determined by your coach. If you aren't playing team sports, loose jogging pants, a long sleeved t-shirt, and a hijab designed for active wear should serve for most exercise. For swimming, full-coverage swimsuits are available at some Muslim clothing stores. If you follow the Sunnah of riding horses, try to wear a long coat that extends over your jodhpurs.

Understand that certain activities will be harder.,
Be sociable.",How to Wear Niqab in a Non Muslim Country2," Because people do not fully understand why you wear the niqab and completely cover your face, they will have questions about your motivations, and some might fear that you’re being forced to wear the niqab. By knowing your reasons to wear the niqab, you will be able to communicate your motivations clearly.


Remind those that question you that by taking away physical distractions, you force them to engage with your personality, intellect, and emotions directly., Many people will be curious about why you choose to the wear the niqab and wonder what it means. Tell them that you are not being forced to wear the niqab, but that you choose to honor God and display your devotion. Explain that you don’t have to wear the niqab all the time because it is meant to be worn only in front of unknown men. Say that when you’re at home or with other girlfriends, you dress how you want.

, Regardless of what you wear as a woman, people will be prone to judge you. For instance, if a woman is wearing clothes that are too revealing, many people will call her derogatory names. Counter this by asserting your beliefs, personality, and opinions when people talk to you.

, Many groups exist on social media and on various online forums. These groups plan events that educate non-Muslims on why the niqab is important to them., Show the community that many of your ideals are aligned. For instance, if you wish to promote better education in the community or other initiatives, take part in the processes, like voting or meetings that help show that you are just as interested in the welfare of the place you live as they are.

, Many people associate the niqab with extremists. You may also face accusations of political militancy. In order to dispel these prejudices, show your kindness and willingness to engage people in conversation. By doing so, you will help to change their minds and open them to Islam.

, Most people in non-Muslim countries are not used to interacting with someone in niqab. They also do not understand the reasons why women choose to cover themselves. The most common reaction when people do not understand something is to become fearful, judgmental, and contemptuous. , Find those in your community who also choose to wear the niqab. This will help motivate you when you encounter hostility. The support group will also encourage you when you feel disheartened.

, As people approach you to try to understand why you wear the niqab, try to learn the culture and norms of the country you live in. This does not mean you have to assimilate their culture. Rather, this provides empathy for both parties. You will be able to relate your beliefs easier by phrasing your reasons and motivations in terms they can understand.


For example, a comparison you might use would be the habits nuns wear in Catholicism. Nuns wear the habit as a symbol of poverty and devotion. Recently, many nuns have decided not to wear the habit, but some do to instantly communicate their beliefs. Explain the similarity that you wear your niqab much as the nuns wear habits and just like in Catholicism there are many Muslims who choose not to wear the niqab., Many situations require you to uncover your face based on laws and regulations. For instance, if you are passing through airport security, they will ask you to remove the niqab to confirm your identity. Another situation where you may have to uncover is at the doctor’s office.

, Depending on where you travel, there may be laws that prohibit wearing the niqab. In countries such as France and Italy, wearing the niqab is illegal. Other countries have various laws regarding when women can wear a niqab such as when they are presenting evidence in court or teaching at a school., If you enjoy doing outdoor activities, then wearing the niqab will be harder. Eating at a restaurant will be more difficult. By understanding the physical restraints of the niqab, you can prepare and plan ways around these difficulties. , While you are wearing the niqab, you are representing Islam. When people act suspicious or hostile, respond to with kindness. Smile as hard as you can under the niqab so that your eyes reflect your happiness and warmth."

, Although this has been a controversial question of whether wearing the hijab with makeup defeats the purpose of trying to promote modesty, It is up to you to decide what you believe is ""too much"" makeup. A little mascara and lip-gloss is subtle, yet highlights the natural beauty that Allah has blessed women with.

, Wash your face regularly, without scrubbing or using harsh soaps, which may irritate your skin. Try to avoid excessively touching your face, to avoid acne as much as you can.

And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful”. With regard to the Ahadeeth: It was narrated from Safiyyah bint Shaybah that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) used to say: When these words were revealed – “and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – they took their izaars (a kind of garment) and tore them from the edges and covered their faces with them.

Wear a hijab, or head covering.,
Wear loose fitting clothes.,
Apply natural-looking make-up.,
Limit the amount of jewelry you wear.",How to Dress Modestly As a Muslim Girl2," In the Qur’an, Allah commands that women should only expose that which must ordinarily appear. Many interpret this to mean that only a woman’s hands, face, (and sometimes feet) may be displayed. Women honor this rule of modesty by wearing a hijab, a veil that wraps around their head, leaving the face uncovered while completely concealing their hair, neck, and chest. You may choose from several types of hijabs, or head coverings. Pick the one that is right for you:


Shayla: Wrap this rectangular scarf around your head and use a pin to secure it at your shoulders.
Khimar: Wear this cape-like scarf wrapped tightly around your head. It will hang loosely at your mid-back.
Chador: If you prefer more coverage, choose this floor-length scarf. It is a longer version of the Khimar.
Niqab: The niqab is a cloth face covering chosen by many Muslim women to provide additional protection.
Burqa: The burqa will cover you from head-to-toe—a small mesh panel over your eyes is the only opening.Traditionally, hijabs come in plain, non-attention grabbing colors, like black, white, blue, and brown. If you feel comfortable wearing colors and patterns, a fashionable scarf from your local department store may be substituted for a solid colored hijab.

, Under your hijab, wear loose, non-revealing tops and bottoms. Sheer and or figure hugging clothing should be avoided.


Remember, the type of clothing you wear under your hijab is completely dependent upon your comfort level and understanding of modesty. Ask your parents for a second opinion if you are unsure about a certain piece of clothing.
If you prefer full coverage, shop for maxi skirts, wide leg pants, long dresses and abayas.
Want to wear skinny jeans or leggings? Pair them under a long flowing top or dress.
If you want to wear a tighter outfit, cover it up with an abaya or jilbab.

, Like bright colors and patterns, make-up should be worn sparingly. If you choose to wear make-up on a daily-basis, go for a natural look. Apply minimal amounts of foundation, blush, mascara, and lip-gloss to enhance your natural beauty and features.


During holidays, such as Eid, it is acceptable to wear more dramatic make-up.

, Avoid chunky necklaces and statement earrings. Instead, select small, dainty pieces of jewelry that can easily be tucked under your hijab.


If you are open to accessorizing your look, try to chose adornments that are understated.
Avoid any ostentatious branded or designer hijabs.

Wear non-revealing clothes.,
Layer your clothing.,
Wear tops with high necklines.,
Check your look in the mirror.,
Apply natural-looking make-up.,
Limit the amount of jewelry you wear.",How to Dress Modestly As a Muslim Girl3," You can still dress modestly if you choose not to wear a hijab. Instead of wearing tight, revealing tops and bottoms, put on wide-leg pants and a matching long-sleeve shirt.you should actually wear clothes such as kurtas and salwar because that does not reveal the body.


Base your outfits on your personal comfort level.
Maxi-skirts, long dresses, and flowy tops are essential staples of a modest wardrobe.
Seek a second opinion if you are unsure whether a certain top or bottom is too tight.
Full coverage does not have to look dowdy and matronly! Mix and match trendy items or vintage pieces with the staples of your modest wardrobe for a chic look. Pair black jeans with boots, a long wool trench coat, and a turtleneck sweater. You should keep in mind that the reason that you wear full clothes is so that you do not attract men so try to wear clothes that will not show your body shape and dont wear short shirts, wear long ones that hide your buttocks.

, Laying your clothing is key to achieving an on-trend modest look. Do you have an absolutely amazing low-cut shirt in your closet? Make it modest by wearing it over a blouse or long-sleeved t-shirt for coverage. Add a scarf for additional coverage and a pop of color. Cover up tight skinny jeans with a long sweater, coat, or flannel blouse tied around your waist.


Get creative! Experiment with layer different pieces until you find a look that you are comfortable wearing.

, Determine if a neckline is too low by measuring the distance from your collar bone to the top of your shirt using your fingers as a measuring tool--one to four finger-widths is ideal, while five finger widths may verge on too revealing. Cover your cleavage with turtlenecks, boatneck shirts, and blouses.


Tie a scarf around your neck to cover a lower neckline.
Wear a tank-top with a high neckline under a shirt that is too low in the front.

, Before going out, stand in front of a full length mirror. Bend forwards, backwards, and side-to-side. Try to sitting down and raising your arms. If your clothing shifts to reveal your midriff or your chest, consider changing or adding additional layers to your look before leaving the house.

, Opt for a care-free, natural look when applying your make-up. Use a small amounts of concealer, blush, mascara, and a dash of lip gloss for a fresh, simple look. Make-up should be used to enhance your beautiful, natural features, not overpower or mask them.


During holidays, such as Eid, go for a more dramatic, sparkly look. Try a smoky eye and a berry lip!
Ask your mom and friends for make-up tips. How do they achieve a natural look?

, Simple, understated pieces of jewelry can have a major impact on any outfit. Chose dainty necklaces and earrings.

Recite the Qur'an daily in your Salah what you have memorized.,
Learn systematically.,
Repeat as much as you need.",How to Memorize the Qur'an," The first matter you must pay attention to even before learning any part of the Qur'an is your intention,(remember- good intentions have good outcomes). Make sure that your intention is solely to obtain the pleasure of Allah SWT, and that with His glorious mercy you will be rewarded in the Hereafter, InshaAllah. If you are memorizing the Qur'an so that you can receive the title 'Hafiz' and be respected in society's eyes then this act of memorizing the Qur'an will harm you rather than do you any good. So correct your intention and during the course of memorizing the Qur'an continue to remind yourself that you are doing this to please Allah.;
, The more frequently you sit down to learn the Qur'an, the easier it will become, InshAllah. It is very essential to be consistent to the extent that you should try not to skip even a day. There should be no Weekend or break in worship if you find pleasure in learning. During the initial stages of memorizing the Qur'an one should memorize about 3 lines, 5 is ideal. If you continue like this and build up slowly then InshAllah you will be able to learn a page and thereafter two pages a day. It is also recommended that one join a class where other students to gather to memorize the Qur'an and where a teacher is present to listen to your memorized recitation. Being in this environment helps in many ways; it will keep you on track and motivate you when Shaitaan tries to lead you astray.

, Write down suitable times for you when you can sit down to memorize. It is preferable to sit at Fajr when you awake for Salah as at this time your mind is fresh making it easier to learn. Also, you are starting your day with the blessed deed of reciting the holy book of Allah so InshAllah, your actions too will be blessed for the day to come.

, Have a specific place where you go. Memorize in a quiet place so that you are not distracted. The best place is at a Mosque.

, Get a friend, a family member to listen to your recitation every day if you do not attend a class. Ideally, get someone who is also memorizing to create a peer pressure system.

, It is extremely necessary to know that while being a Hafiz has many benefits and rewards, it is a grave sin to memorize a portion of the Qur'an and then to forget it. To stop this from happening continue revising recent passages you have learned. Also revise from the beginning so that whilst you are learning ahead you do not forget the first parts.

, Do not jump from one surah to another. Learning the Qur'an in the order it is will give you the satisfaction of completing a para. This will push you forward and help you in overall completing the Qur'an memorization.

, Try practicing and repeating your ayahs for a few minutes rather before or after prayer times."

Understand that everybody in this world has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God Roman 3:23.,
Hopefully, you are now crushed under God's law and see it's impossible to obey and so it's safe to continue.,
Now that you know why you can't, the next thing that will help on this quest is to know why you should.,
Having established the above, God knows the above and when our first parents rebelled, He promised that there was a person to come in future to destroy the Serpent (read Genesis 3!),
If you understand the above, then you should know God loves you and is your Savior.,
Finally, repent of your sins and hopefully if God wills, if you believe, He would have changed your heart and you will ""bear good fruit"" naturally.",How to Obey God," No one is righteous before God Romans 3:10-18 and even our ""righteous deeds"" are like filthy rags before God Isaiah 64:6. Therefore, at this point, all hopes of YOU obeying God should now be crushed.;
, The question you will be wise to ask is why can't anyone obey God? The reason is Genesis 3. Read the whole thing. Then read Romans 5:12-21. Basically, our first parents, Adam and Eve rebelled against God and all creation was cursed as a result, and also as a consequence, we inherited a sinful nature which hates God, hates His commandments and weirdly tries to impress God by scantily obeying His commands.

, God is going to punish ALL sinners, which includes you and me. However, the definition of sinner is one who doesn't obey God's commandments. However you know you should because God will punish sinners... Please stay and read step 4

, This person is Jesus Christ, who is God (Isaiah 9:6-7). He is our Savior! He died for all sins, all the SINS of every single human who has ever lived and is living and will live! 1 John 2:1-2 And He did this willingly because God loves us (John 10:17-18 and Romans 5: 6-11)
, Being just, all sin has to be punished and punishment taken by the sinner or Jesus Christ who willingly chose to atone for ALL sins. Therefore, you receive this gift by believing in Jesus Christ as your Savior and submitting to Him as your Lord. This is a gift from God and even believing is a gift from God. All who believe in Jesus for the forgiveness of their sin will be saved (John 3:16) but all who disbelieve are condemned already (John 3:36)

, In the past, it was easier to do sinful things, conversely, when God changes your heart, it comes naturally to do good things.

Get involved right away.,

Say a UU prayer.,
Be charitable.,
Develop and continually challenge your own beliefs.,
Don't take sides.",How to Practice Unitarian Universalism," Attend your local congregation and get involved. Join an interest group, such as a movie group, bridge, or hiking group. Volunteer to help with something like coffee hour or ushering. There are committees that could use your expertise and energy, where you will meet people of similar interests.;
, If you don't have a congregation nearby, you can become a member of the Church of the Larger Fellowship, an online congregation for isolated UUs (see link below).

, Unitarian Universalists believe in the inherent worth and dignity of all people, including those of different beliefs, sexual orientations, and races, as well as children, the disabled, and people who used to belong to other religions. Accept people of goodwill for who they are. This will greatly help you to becoming a devoted Unitarian Universalist.

, Before meals, many say a prayer to give thanks for the food and the company. Many Unitarian Universalists have a chalice in their home.


Light the chalice, and say a prayer, for example:

We light this chalice,
For the light of truth,
The warmth of love,
And the fire of commitment.
We light this symbol of our faith,
As we gather together.


This prayer is used because it does not indicate any specific belief. It simply acknowledges what you've been blessed with. You don't need to feel any religious pressure while reciting this prayer. At the end of the meal or meeting, everyone can blow out the chalice together.

, UUs work for a better world and regularly devote time and money for charitable causes. Whether it's a Food Drive, tutoring a child, protesting injustice, or simply dropping money in a jar, it's always appreciated.

, Unitarian Universalism has no written creed to which you must adhere. It gives you the benefits of a bona-fide religion while still encouraging you to have your own theories. Don't be afraid to think. Many Unitarian Universalists don't believe in God, and many do. But because UU is such an accepting religion, they do not judge you on your sincere beliefs. Many Unitarian Universalists celebrate both Christmas and Hanukkah. Feel free to explore the religion of both sides of your family if they're different.

, Unitarian Universalists are often known as the ""peacemakers"" of arguments since they can see the validity of various religions. If people you know are fighting, try to solve the conflict. If you can't, it's best to stay out of it. Your kindness and good faith is wanted elsewhere.

Remember that your Spiritual Life is like a Roller-Coaster.,
Realise that a belief in God can be justified using reason and logic.

,
Realise how desperate atheists are to disprove God.,
Think about the Kalam cosmological argument.,
Read the bible.,
Understand that the Theory Of Evolution doesn't conflict with the Existence of God.,
Realise that issues such as the age of the earth aren't important in order to believe in God, the Bible, Jesus, or anything really.,
If you are having trouble with the issue of suffering.,
Understand that there is no evidence disproving the existence of God.

,
Realise that the greatest evidence of God is the existence of the Holy Spirit.,
Finally, know that you can always talk to someone.",How to Overcome Doubt in God," You are always going to have ups and downs in your Spiritual Life, but your Ultimate Goal is to achieve Salvation.;
,, They almost hate him. But you can't hate something that doesn't exist, right? Remember that many atheists (such as Richard Dawkins) are incredibly hate-filled and bitter at God. This is what Satan wants. He wants everyone to turn against God, and these militant atheists are fulfilling his will.

, Many philosophers use this argument to argue the existence of God, and can be explained in 4 steps: 1) Everything that has a beginning of existence has a cause to it's existence. 2) The universe had a beginning because in nature, it is impossible to have an infinite past; infinity doesn't exist, and is just a man-made concept. 3) Therefore the universe has a cause. 4) We call this cause 'God'.

, There is so much in the Holy Book that concerns troubled faith, for example: Psalms 14:1 'The fool says in his heart, ""There is no God."" They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.' Also, read John 20:29, 'Then Jesus told him, ""Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.""', and Hebrews 11, which talks about the importance of faith. http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11&version=NIV . There is so much more in the Bible - why not set aside a little time, each day to read the Bible?

, In fact, many might argue that it supports the evidence of a God. Read Dr William Lane Craig's response to the issue. ( source: http://www.reasonablefaith.org/disenchantment-with-atheism ) ""What about the evolution of life and biological complexity? In fact, no one knows whether the origin of life and the evolution of biological complexity did not involve miraculous interventions of God along the way. Indeed, as I have emphasized elsewhere, no complete or compelling naturalistic account of the origin of life or of the mechanisms driving biological evolution or of the evolutionary history of the Earth is available. One might well regard the origin of life and the evolution of biological complexity as positive evidence for the involvement of God in the affairs of the universe. What is the point of evolution? Well, presumably to create an environment for human beings on this planet, complete with the fossil fuels necessary for the advancement of human life and civilization, in which persons can respond rationally and freely to God’s offer of salvation and eternal life. At what point does a life form first acquire a soul? I suppose at that point in evolutionary history when its neurological capacities have evolved to such an extent that is capable of serving as the physical mechanism through which the soul can function in accord with its capacities. These are, indeed, interesting questions, but hardly objections to theistic belief.""

, You do not achieve salvation by getting the age of the earth right. Also, In the Bible, there is no mention of the age of the earth, let alone the importance of it in inheriting eternal life. What is a day for God, might be millions of years for us - It is not necessary for us to know.

, Remember that the suffering that occurs on this earth is irrelevant once you get into the Kingdom of Heaven. Martyn Lloyd-Jones once said: 'Let us not therefore be stumbled when we see surprising things happening in the world. Rather let us ask, ‘What is the relevance of this event to the kingdom of God?’ Or, if strange things are happening to you personally, don’t complain but say, ‘What is God teaching me through this?'

,, This is the part of God that we can see, hear, and experience for ourselves. It is present in every Christian in the world, and can be shown through simple actions such as prayer and by praising God as a community in a Church.

, There is always someone who can help - your Pastor, your Family, your Friends, even God can help if you Pray to him. The worst thing you can do is go through these struggles alone, and other Christian will always be willing to help.

Choose a tone.,

Check your camera settings.,

Keep your camera held high.,
Get shots of all parts of the baptism.,
Create a relaxed atmosphere.,
Take multiple shots in a row.,
Give a warning before snapping the photo.,
Invite the clergy to join in the photos.,
Get solo photos after the baptism.",How to Photograph a Baptism," What are you hoping to get out of your baptism photography--a memento of the event, or a demonstration of your family’s experience? The tone you want will determine how and when you take your photos.Tone can include whether your photos are serious or relaxed, playful or solemn. The personality of the people being photographed will also come into play.
Given that a baptism is a serious religious experience, you will likely need to have at least some serious photos. Keep this in mind when planning poses and shots.;
, Some churches might prohibit photography, which will require you to take photos before or after the baptism. Different churches will have different policies, and policies may even vary from clergy member to clergy member. Make sure you have permission before your begin snapping away.If photos are allowed, ask the church or clergy if there are any rules that should be followed. Some churches do not want artifacts photographed, for instance.

, Set a color scheme for your photos through decorations, food, and even the clothing worn by family and friends, if possible. This does not have to be extensive, but having complementary colors will make your photos appear cleaner and more professional.You can create a consistent color scheme by using all pastels in your decorating and your client’s clothing, or you can use two or three specific colors, such as gray, yellow, and navy.
If a specific color scheme is not possible, you can create some cohesion in your photos by photographing from a similar height, angle, etc.

, While you will undoubtedly make sure your battery is charged before heading to the baptism, always keep a backup battery on hand in case of an emergency or battery failure. Some older model digital and film cameras go through batteries quickly, so you may want to keep a pack of batteries with you if you have an older-model camera.Although most DSLRs come equipped with a replacement battery, make sure you have the correct size and style for your camera.

, Pay attention to the lighting. If the baptism is outside, you will need to adjust your camera’s settings accordingly. If the baptism is held in a dim church sanctuary, you might need to use your flash, which could disturb the baptism if it is not used carefully. Familiarize yourself with the venue to avoid lighting mistakes.The more natural light you have, the better your photos will turn out. If the room is extremely dark, ask if you can open a shade or curtain.

, Candid photos differ from staged photos in the amount of movement involved. Alter your camera’s settings to capture movement effectively. Most cameras have a specific setting for capturing movement, often indicated by a running figure. Camera presets are a great way to capture candids.If you do not have presets, increase your camera’s shutter speed slightly to account for movement.

, When taking candids, opt for multiple shots. In the age of digital cameras, taking multiple shots is not a waste; instead, it allows you to capture several small snapshots of time. For each moment you want to capture, take between two and four photos.This may be a bit more difficult to do if you have to use your camera’s flash. If a flash is necessary, aim for two-three shots.

, As you stand by with your camera, scan the event. While you should certainly take photos of the person being baptized, you should also capture the experience of proud parents, excited siblings, or touched friends. Scan the guests in attendance for snapshot-worthy moments.Be considerate to guests and churchgoers. Maintain a healthy distance, and work quickly to prevent your subjects from feeling awkward or uncomfortable.

, Candid photos require a quick hand. Have your camera in the photo-taking position as much as possible to capitalize on the time you have available. While hanging your camera around your neck is a great start, you should also keep one hand on the camera as much as possible as you move around.If you feel comfortable, you can even survey the room through your viewfinder instead of your naked eye to get a jump on taking a photo.

, A baptism is more than the moment of sprinkling or immersion. Take photos of people arriving for the ceremony, of family and the person being baptized getting ready, and of the aftermath. All of these candids will provide a window into the experience.Make sure you have permission to enter changing areas of the church or venue before you wander around to take photos.

, A baptism is a happy occasion, so don’t get hung up on taking the “perfect” photo. Instead, encourage your subjects to relax and enjoy themselves. Encourage smiles, hugs, and shows of affection.Although you are taking staged photos, your subjects do not all have to be looking at the camera. Encourage looking at the person being baptized, at grandparents, etc.

, Once you have your subjects arranged the way you want them, take at least three shots in a row. Taking 3 shots will lessen the likelihood of multiple subjects blinking, staring away from the camera, etc. You can give warning each time, or give warning once and take three shots. Experiment to find which approach works best for your subjects.Take now, delete later. While you may end up with a camera filled to the brim with photos, it is far better to have too many shots than too few, or one substandard photo per pose.

, Staged photos are not seeking to catch people off guard, so make sure your subjects have fair warning and plenty of time to smile, look up, or arrange themselves according to their preference.You do not have to make a large announcement each time. Instead, you can say a simple, “Ready, go!” or you can count to three. Make sure you build trust with your subjects by warning them of impending photos.

, Baptism doesn’t only involve family and friends, and the photos should reflect that. Invite the clergy involved in the baptism to join in photos, if they’d like.


In addition to clergy, make the church or venue themselves a part of the story. Photograph the person being baptized beside the river or baptismal font, for instance.

, Although your main focus might be capturing family and friends, try to get some photos of the person being baptized on their own. If you are at a christening, you can set the child up on a pew or something similar, and if you are photographing the baptism an older child or adult, you can have them smiling next to the baptismal. Whatever the preferred scenario, make sure you get some photos highlighting the person being baptized and their experience in the process.If your subject is old enough to communicate, you can ask them what type of photos they’d like to have and go from there.

Love him even though you can't see him.,
See God in the things he has created around you.,
Talk with God.,
Believe in Jesus Christ who demonstrates that God is Love.",How to Love God," If we feel compassion for others in the same way we feel compassion for our own dear ones and ourselves, we can know that we love God. God's most important command for us is to love him and to love his children. We need to especially love Jesus Christ, because anyone who does not love God's son cannot love him, the father.

, Know that the goal of life is to love God.

,, Accept what God likes and hates and what he does.

,, Know that others around the world are going through similar sufferings as you are, if not worse.

,,, Know that with only knowing God and proper food and clothing, one can be content. The Bible says, ""Godliness with contentment is great gain.""

, Ask him to help you with selfish motives for one's own pleasures. Don't serve riches. The Bible says, ""You cannot serve both God and money.""

,, Speak words of blessing over others only.

, Think of it this way, if you are apart from a friend or spouse you'll still love them, right? Even if you're miles apart and you can't see them, if you can only talk to them., The trees, bees, flowers, nature, the people you love. He created these things for yours and his pleasure.

See him in the miracles and phenomenons around you.

, It doesn't matter where, it doesn't matter if it's in your head or out loud, work or play. He promises to listen to your prayers., God first loved us by sending his son Jesus Christ as the greatest example of his love. Jesus died for all to come live in God's love from which we cannot escape. Jesus will save us from our sins and build in us a perfect eternal life by the strength of God and not our own efforts. When we believe and call on the name of Jesus and are willing to let go of our evil ways, God helps us with this so that we don't fail. When we commit to surrendering to his Lordship, He does this and the rest!;

Get a journal.,
Find a hiding spot.,
Write an entry.,
Go back and read.,
Consider listing the names of people you're thinking of for prayer, and why some especially need prayer, realizing that you know that you can write about interceding in prayer for the needs of and about people.",How to Make A Prayer Journal," Any journal will do, as long as it has paper and no writing in it. It could be a journal or a diary. It doesn't matter. It should have a decent amount of pages in it, at least 70 so it will last for a while.;
, You will be writing down your prayers in here, even the personal ones that you don't want anyone else knowing about. It's good if no one ever knows where your journal is. It is even better if they don't even know that it exists. It's harder to find something you're not looking for.

, It doesn't matter how you write it. Just write it. But make sure you include the date. You'll want to know what day you wrote it later on. When you're writing, don't leave out anything. Just say your prayer that is going through your mind. Write exactly what you would say if you were ""talking"" to Him. Just talk to God.

, Once you write an entry, don't read it again until you fill up the journal. Once you fill it up, read everything, and you'll be amazed at all of the prayers that got answered. It's a really neat thing to realize that prayer works. When God has answered your prayer sometimes you will know but sometimes you wouldn't know since it may be different from what you wanted or expect.

, Write about praising God including in advance for blessings on these persons -- as well as on yourself -- both those that have happened, are desired and expected.

Learn as much as you can about the Amish.,
Visit an Amish community.,
Decide if you still wish to join.,
Move into an Amish community.",How to Join the Amish1," Before deciding to join the Amish, it is imperative that you learn as much about their religion, history, and lifestyle as possible. The Amish communities of today are descendants of Swiss Anabaptists who came to the United States in the early 1700s. There are approximately 250,000 people living in Amish communities across North America.

The largest Amish community is in Holmes County in the state of Ohio, although there are other sizable Amish populations in Pennsylvania, Iowa and Indiana and smaller communities across the eastern and mid-western states, as well as in Canada.
Amish is a stricter branch of the Mennonite Anabaptist Church, with which it shares many beliefs and practices. The Amish, with other Anabaptists, reject infant baptism in favor of adult baptism, giving an adult the right to choose their religion and commit to joining the Amish community.The Amish refer to themselves as the ""plain people"" and to anyone outside of the Amish community, regardless of religion or race, as ""Englishers"" or ""high people"".
There are many informative websites and books available that cover every aspect of Amish life.;
, You should do your best to visit an Amish community as part of your research. This will give you some insight into what the day-to-day life of an Amish person is like. Despite popular belief, there are no restrictions on ""English"" people visiting Amish communities. You can visit Amish businesses and converse with the people, most of whom will be willing to answer any questions you might have.


It may even be possible to stay in a bed and breakfast run by a local Amish family. This will give you an even closer look at the Amish way of life, which places God and family above all else.
If possible, try to visit several communities on your trip, as different Amish communities will vary slightly in terms of their customs, traditions and level of strictness and you will need to find the one to which you are best suited.
If you cannot travel to an Amish community, you may be able to set up correspondence with an Amish person to gain an insight into their beliefs and way of life. The Amish do not allow computers or, in most cases, telephones, so communicating by post will be your only option.
Remember to respect their beliefs and do not take any identifiable photographs of them (the Second Commandment, Exodus 20:4 - ""Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image...""). They may allow you to take pictures of their buggy or farms if you ask politely, however.Be aware that some may not feel comfortable (especially women) with talking to outsiders extensively about their faith or lifestyle since they are taught to be modest in everything they do.

, After visiting one or several communities, you need to decide which community you would like to join. Once you have developed a short list of about 3 to 5 communities, you should begin contacting the leading bishop of each community to gauge whether you would be welcome to join their church. Finding the leading bishop should not be too difficult; if the community is on your short list, you have probably already visited it and hopefully developed some contacts there who can help you.


Although the Amish do not have any rules forbidding outsiders from joining, it is highly unusual and typically not encouraged, so contacting the bishop is a good way to judge what the community's reaction to a newcomer is likely to be.
If the bishop is open to the idea of you joining their community, he will invite you for an interview, where you can put forward your reasons for wanting to become a member of the Amish. You will need to demonstrate the strength of your faith, your willingness to renounce the ways of the modern world, and your commitment to the Amish way of life.
As long as your motives are pure and you are fully aware of what life in an Amish community entails, there should be no objection to you coming to live in the community.

, Once you have made your decision and you have received the bishop's permission, you may begin your new life as a member of the Amish. You will first be placed with an Amish family, where you can learn their ways and participate in the household duties. During this time you must prove yourself to the Amish by living according to their religious principles and becoming a productive and valuable member of the community. Once you have done this (there is no set time period), you may be voted into the church and become a true member of the Amish community.Unless you are coming from another branch of the Anabaptist Church with a very similar lifestyle, you are likely to find the transition to Amish living somewhat difficult. Living without electricity, cell phones and motor vehicles is a lot harder for someone who is used to having these luxuries, than it is for people who were brought up in the Amish community and don't know any differently.
Although some Amish may be very welcoming and helpful to you as you make your transition, others may be more distrustful of you and not expect you to last very long. Give them time. Once you prove your faith and commitment, they will grow to trust and accept you.

Differentiate deism from atheism.",How to Make a Case for Deism," The Bible says, ""Without the shedding of blood there can be no remission of sins."" To require the death of animals and people to remedy disobedience to God seems sick and twisted. How can we be sure of what God's laws really are? How can we be sure that disobedience to God's laws separates us from God? How can we be sure that the shedding of blood will reunite us with God? What are the characteristics of union with God? Why would a God of love require destructive and wasteful death to restore a broken relationship with mankind?;
, In the biological arena the vast majority of organisms naturally operate based on self-preservation mechanisms but human beings have the option of choosing to deviate from this norm. Self-love is ineffably beautiful and whilst many religions promote ethical philosophies of concern for others this latter noble aspiration does not warrant tarnishing the elementary virtue of concern for one's own well being. To survive any mistake is to have the opportunity to learn from it and organisms tend to grow stronger over time because of the challenges of life. The possibility of the absence of any benefit makes its presence more valuable and love is most notably measured in time allocated to beneficial suffering. Pride can help to prevent a fall and shame can help to motivate a person to climb higher. It may be argued that the ubiquitous characteristic of balance makes existence richer and the beauty of the night sky is evidence that light and darkness can sublimely coexist.

, Why do people think that God answers prayers if so many prayers are seemingly unanswered and for the ones that are seemingly answered there may be a natural explanation for the results obtained? There is a practical, down to earth method of attaining almost everything that can be conceivably requested from a potentially intervening God with enough time and effort. It is possible to conclude from personal observation and personal experience that maybe the various aspects of the Universe which have opportunely fallen into place have done so because of a divine plan as opposed to blind chance but this does not automatically suggest the existence of a prayer-answering divine being although it does suggest the possible existence of a deity and that a noble lifestyle is inherently possible for the majority of humanity based on the intelligent configuration of the Universe.

, Most religions believe that their deity has given them free will to choose paths and actions, but also ascribe omniscient knowledge to the same deity. If a deity knows everything, that implies they already know what will happen in the future. Regardless of how you choose to act, the deity will already know what your every single thought will be throughout your entire lifetime. Those two concepts are mutually exclusive. If they deity knows everything you will think and do, there is no free will. If it doesn't, then it is not omniscient and is not a ""god"". If there is no free will then this means that determinism is true and that all credit and blame for all aspects of existence should be ascribed to the laws of nature or their potential divine author. Some people are of the view that even if there is no free will that a determined response trumps a random response because there are standards.

, Why do people believe that the humanly impossible takes place? Why aren't there ever clear before and after depictions to verify the occurrence of such alleged miracles such as a perception of a person before and after the spontaneous regeneration of a limb? In the absence of such the evidence for miracles is weak at best.

, Our awareness vacillates between the realm of the brain and the realm of the body but what evidence is there for any other realm of existence? When a person dies the voice is silenced and the body is stilled and what about this suggests that something continues to exist subsequent to expiration as opposed to the awareness being extinguished in a manner akin to the outage of the flame of a candle. Out-of-body experiences may require an active brain to occur if they do in fact occur as opposed to being very vivid dreams so this is inconclusive.

, What about the Bible suggests that God may have personally influenced the contents of such. It contains potentially accurate and inaccurate accounts of history, poetry, advice, vague and questionable so-called prophecies all from the Judeo-Christian culture but nothing resembling a divine signature. Do people simply believe that the Bible contains information intended by God to be in it simply because it says so and why should it be believed? Any text with some amount of useful information is worth keeping around for generations so its longevity should not be construed as proof of its divinity.

, There exists mystery but there also exists a rich nature from which to extrapolate. Whether a person believes that God or the universe is the first cause it can be reasonably advanced that life emerged from a source of dignity, rationality and creativity. Sophistication of form and function is usually the result of conscious intention as opposed to blind accidents. However, the catch-22 is that the original intender is presumed to be sophisticated in form and function hence the cause and effect are mutually dependent with unexplained sophistication. If the universe is eternal then this obviates the possibility of a divine creator. Faith in a divine source is still not rendered so fragile though because important questions are unanswered.

, The only recourse for an atheist is to assert that we are lucky to be alive whereas a deist is at liberty to credit a god with the existence of life and the universe although some people may hold the view that a non-intervening deity is a useless deity. However, it is a matter of connecting dots and the universe and life overwhelmingly appear to be the product of a rational mind and will whom deists identify as the divine creator who wound up everything and left it all to majestically unfold.

Pack your things.,
Find a place to stay.,
Find an opportunity to get away.,
Stop attending services or meetings.",How to Leave a Cult1," If you are in a cult that lives in a compound, such as a subdivision or shared home, pack a bag for leaving. Bring a change of clothes, practical items like your cell phone and ID, and anything with sentimental value. Stow your bag away where no one will find it until you’re ready to go.


If you think you may have to leave at a moment’s notice, keep your cell phone, your ID, and any money or small valuables you have on you.
If you think someone might find your bag, don’t take the risk of packing. Plan to leave your possessions behind if you need to.;
, If you’re leaving a live-in cult arrangement, try to line up a safe place to stay in advance. Consider staying with family or friends who aren’t involved in the cult, or search for shelters in your area.If you think you’ll be in danger after you leave the cult, go to the police. They can help you find a place to stay.

, If you’re not allowed to come and go freely, you may be able to make a break for it when other people visit the cult or when you’re taken outside the compound. Otherwise, call a taxi to come and get you, or ask a friend or family member to pick you up., If you’re living on your own, break ties with the cult by not going to meetings anymore. Plan to do something else during that time. If you’re idle, you may end up talking yourself into going back to the group.


For instance, visit a friend or family member during the time you’d usually spend at a meeting.
Be prepared for questions from the other group members. Decide ahead of time how you’ll respond and how you’ll avoid getting pulled back in.

Ṇamō Siddhāṇaṁ- I bow to the Siddhas (Liberated souls)

Ṇamō Ayariyāṇaṁ- I bow to the Acharyas (""Preceptors"")

Ṇamō Uvajjhāyāṇaṁ- I bow to the Upadhyay (Preceptors of less advanced ascetics)

Ṇamō Lōē Savva Sāhūṇaṁ- I bow to all the monks

,
Study the way to get rid of one's karma.,
Follow certain rules of doing good somewhat similar to the ten commandments.,
Learn about the six essential duties prescribed for a śrāvaka (householder).",How to Learn About Jainism," India has been rich in religious diversity, and this is where Jainism traces its roots.


Jain texts point to 24 great teachers called Tirthankaras (those who build a ford across the ocean of transmigration). The last Tirthankara of present half cycle of time (Avasarpani) was Lord Mahāvīra who lived during 6th century B.C. After attaining omniscience, Tirthankara preach in a divine hall called samavasarana.
Digambar and Shvetamber- The monks belonging to the sky-clad (Digambara) sect practice nudity, while the monks belonging to the white-clad sect wear white clothes. There is hardly any major difference between the two sects. Shvetamber monks put a white cloth over their mouths to prevent them from accidentally inhaling insects.;
,


Reincarnation is central to Jainism teachings and beliefs. Souls, which are believed to be a unique substance in the universe, take different living forms in the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. This cycle has been going on forever, the universe has no beginning or end, it has always been and always will be. The ultimate goal is to get rid of one's karma on their soul so that they may end this cycle. Once this goal is reached their soul has attained all knowledge and it rests in the heavens forever (Nirvana). Recent studies on past life regression are but reiteration of this.
Karma theory is about actions and the results they bring to the soul's path. It is the simply the law of cause and effect with respect to the soul. E.g. One's life today is an outcome of past karma –good and bad. And ones actions today will affect what will happen to them in this or their future lives. In this life, as in the sailor , knowing that the winds are wayward, can bend the sails to minimize the harm that comes to his boat. No doubt the winds will exert their force. That is the seed of ancient actions; but equipped with the right knowledge and skill, she may just be able to steer clear without the possible damage by the winds.

,, Knowledge of Seven fundamentals or truths (tattva) that constitute reality is essential. These areJīva, the living or conscious substance, i.e., the soul;

ajīva, the non-living, i.e., the unconscious substance;

Āsrava, i.e., inflow of matter into the soul;

bandha, i.e., bondage;
stoppage- obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul (called samvara);

nirjarā, the removal of matter from the soul; and

moksha, i.e., freedom.

, This is not just getting rid of past karma, but also the proposed conduct of life of an individual. These include the principles of:


Ahiṃsā- Not to hurt any living being by actions and thoughts. Out of the five types of living beings, a householder is forbidden to kill, or destroy, intentionally, all except the lowest (the one sensed, such as vegetables, herbs, cereals, etc., which are endowed with only the sense of touch).

Satya- Don't lie or speak what is not commendable.

Asteya- Not to take anything if not given.

Brahmacharya- Refrain from indulgence in sex-passion. Monks practice celibacy, whereas a householder (one with small vows) practice chastity.

Aparigraha (Non-possession)- Non-attachment to the possessions.

Most Jains uphold these principles by practicing vegetarianism, non-violence in thought, deed, and action. It must be clear that these are preliminary outlines. The depth and significance of each of these needs careful study and practice.



, These help the laity in achieving the principle of ahimsa which is necessary for his/her spiritual upliftment. The six duties are:Worship of Pañca-Parameṣṭhi (five supreme beings)
Following the preachings of Jain saints.
Study of Jain scriptures

Samayik (Meditation)
Following discipline in their daily engagement
Charity (dāna) of four kinds:


Ahara-dāna- donation of food

Ausadha-dāna- donation of medicine

Jnana-dāna- donation of knowledge

Abhaya-dāna- saving the life of a living being or giving of protection to someone under threat.

Purchase a house and some farmland, if possible.,
Learn Pennsylvania Dutch.,
Learn to live without modern comforts.,
Get a horse and buggy.,
Learn to dress appropriately.,
Avoid being photographed.,
Participate in a barn raising.",How to Join the Amish2," Once you have been voted into the church and no longer need to live with a host family, you may look for a place of your own. Most Amish live in farmhouses surrounded by land that can be used for growing crops and raising animals, as the Amish try to be as self-sufficient as possible.


Unfortunately, available farmland is becoming harder to find, due to urban sprawl, high demand for land from an ever-growing Amish community (even though new people rarely join, the average Amish family has seven children) and prohibitively high costs.You will also need to keep in mind that your home will need to be close enough to the center of the community that it can be reached by horse and buggy, the major method of transportation. This will limit you to about a 10–15 mile (16–24 km) radius.

, Pennsylvania Dutch is a dialect of German, which is widely spoken by the Amish community. It is the main language spoken in the home and at Church, although Amish children do learn to speak English in school. Pennsylvania Dutch is primarily a spoken language, with no standardized form of writing or spelling, and must be learned to become fully immersed in the Amish community.


As a newcomer to the Amish community, learning to speak the new language will be difficult, but not impossible. You will pick it up just by listening to others, attending Church services and by making an effort to speak it whenever you get the opportunity. It may also be possible to hire a Pennsylvania Dutch tutor who can help you to improve at a faster pace.The term ""Pennsylvania Dutch"" is a misnomer, as the language has no association with the Netherlands. It is, in fact, a dialect of German that was spoken in parts of Switzerland, Tyrol, and the Rhineland. It is believed the term ""Dutch"" comes from an archaic form of English, which referred to any continental Germanic language., The Amish aim to live a life of simplicity, unfettered by the materialistic trappings of the modern world. However, learning to live without modern comforts can be quite a challenge for people who haven't been brought up in the Amish way. Learning to live without electricity, which the Amish consider to be ""worldly"" and unnecessary, will perhaps be the greatest challenge of all.


Depending on the strictness of the Amish community you have joined, your new home may or may not have running water. If it does not, you will need to use an old-fashioned hand-pump instead. Some homes will use natural gas to provide heat and light, whereas others will use wood or coal-fueled stoves.
Telephones are not allowed in most Amish households, though some communities will allow for a shared phone to be installed in a shack or outhouse, which can be used by several families whenever necessary.

, In addition to restrictions on electricity and modern plumbing systems, the Amish forbid ownership of motorcars. This is because Amish communities thrive on being close-knit and mutually dependent. A motorcar would make cities and other ""English"" communities much more accessible and may tempt the Amish to leave their faith and families behind. They also believe that having a motorcar might inspire feelings of pride in its owner, and pride is considered to be a serious sin.As a result, Amish communities use a horse and buggy for transport, which is sufficient for covering the distance required to get to Church, visit neighbors and make the trip to Amish supply stores. Consult with your neighbors on where you can get a horse and buggy of your very own.
While they can't own or drive a car, the Amish are willing to accept rides and even hire drivers if a necessary trip must be made - to visit far-flung relatives, receive medical treatment, or procure supplies unavailable in Amish stores., The Amish style of dress is very distinctive and must be strictly adhered to, by both men and women. Clothes must be plain and unadorned, in solid, dark colors, made from simple, durable fabrics. The simplicity of dress is meant to reflect the Amish way of life, which is practical and unmaterialistic. Vanity or the concept of taking pride in one's appearance are forbidden in Amish culture.


Men should wear straight-cut suits without pockets, collars or belts, which women should wear high-necked, long-sleeved, full-skirted dresses, covered by an apron. Any form of patterned fabric, ornamentation or jewelry is not permitted.Men should remain clean-shaven until after marriage, when they are required to let their beard grow. Mustaches are not permitted and haircuts can only be given by Amish barbers. Women must wear their hair in a braid or bun, which is then covered by a prayer covering which is a symbol of their subjection to God., Amish people will avoid having their picture taken whenever possible. This is because they believe that photographs are a form of ""graven image"" which is forbidden by the bible. They also believe that having photographs of themselves may inspire vanity, which is forbidden and considered a sin.There are, however, some exceptions to this rule. Some Amish will allow themselves to be photographed as long as their hands or hats cover their faces.
Other are okay with being filmed or photographed as long as they are shot in a natural setting, where it's clear that they are not posing for the camera.

, Barn raisings are an integral part of Amish tradition. They represent some of the most important Amish cultural values - acting selflessly and working together for the good of the community. They are a good example of what is referred to as a ""frolic"" - an Amish work event that combines socializing with a practical purpose. By participating in a barn raising, you get a chance to interact with your neighbors while making a meaningful contribution to the community.Men from the Amish community work together to build the barn from scratch, according to the plans drawn up by one or two master ""engineers"". They supply all the labor free of charge and may donate supplies and livestock. The project may take as long as a week to complete.Women participate in the barn raisings by cooking for the men, while children help with smaller tasks involved in the building and running errands.

Study the most important aspects of Amish religion.,
Attend and host church services.,
Get baptized.,
Get married.,
Become an elected member of the church (if you're a man).",How to Join the Amish3," The Amish believe the best way to express their religious beliefs is to practice the teachings of the Bible in their daily lives. They do not rely on ostentatious or elaborate religious ceremonies and rituals. They live by the biblical instruction ""be not conformed to this world"" (Romans 12:2) which informs their practice of living humbly, separate from the modern world. Two of their most important abiding principles are those of Demut which means humility, and Gelassenheit, which entails calmness, gentleness and surrendering yourself to God's will.The Amish place great importance on individual study of the Bible, which is considered to be the only source of religious authority. However, you should also get your hands on a copy of a book called ""Martyr's Mirror"", a highly respected publication which chronicles the history of the Amish people and honors those who dies for their faith.
It should also be noted that although the Amish place utmost importance on living according to the teachings of the Bible, they do not believe that this is a guaranteed path to salvation. They believe that any claim to be ""saved"" is an expression of pride and is therefore forbidden., Amish Church service are held every second Sunday, at the home of one of their community members. Each Amish family is expected to host their friends and neighbors for Church about once a year. Every Church district owns a collection of wooden benches, which is transported by wagon to the home of the church family and set up in their house and barn. Seating is arranged with men and boys on one side and women and girls on the other. The service lasts approximately three hours and is followed by a light lunch.


The service is said by 3 to 7 ministers and bishops, with the scriptures being read in High German. The main themes preached by the ministers include living a humble and virtuous life in the eyes of God and the idea of ""judge not lest ye be judged"". Personal prayer time is also included, with the congregation kneeling on the floor in silent worship.
Although musical instruments are not permitted by the Church, singing is an important part of every Amish service. The congregation sings from a special hymnal called the Ausband, a High German songbook which dates back to the 16th century. The singing is always done in unison, never in harmony.
The Amish receive Holy Communion twice a year.

, As mentioned before, the Amish are a branch of the Anabaptist church, which believes in adult baptism. The Amish are usually baptized between the ages of 17 and 22, and this ceremony marks their formal membership of the Church and a commitment to always live by the Ordnung, a set of unwritten rules which outlines the behavioral standards all Amish are expected to adhere to.The decision to be baptized must be completely personal and voluntary, you must willingly commit yourself to the Church for the rest of your life. Young people are free to leave the Amish community before they are baptized, and while some of them do, most will decide to commit themselves to the Church.
Once baptized, you will be committed to living your life according to the rules of the Ordnung. If you break this commitment and fail to repent for your sins, you may be ""shunned"" by the community, where people will avoid having any social contact with you and you will be forced to eat your meals separately from your family. If you repent you will be accepted back into the community in time, but if you continue to sin you may be excommunicated from the Church., Members of the Amish community can only marry once they have been baptized and are required to marry other Amish, though a couple may come from two different Amish communities. Most of a couple's courtship is done in secret, with the engagement only being ""published"" several weeks before the marriage. Most weddings occur in the fall, after the autumn harvest and are a joyous occasion, celebrating the union of two baptized adults, who promise to continue living according to Amish traditional values and to pass their faith on to their children.An Amish wedding ceremony is quite different to that of the ""English"". No rings are exchanged, there are no flowers or music, and the bride traditionally makes her own dress, which is blue or purple. In fact, the ceremony is very similar to a regular church service, except there is a greater emphasis on the ordinance of marriage, which is taken particularly seriously, as divorce is forbidden by the Amish church.After the ceremony, a huge feast is held at the home of the bride's parents, with as many as 200 to 300 guests. The guests are often served in separate sittings, followed by the singing of hymns. The couple's honeymoon period is spent visiting all of their relatives over the course of several weekends, at which point they will also collect their wedding gifts.Once an Amish man is married, he will begin to grow his beard - the symbol of a married man. The couple will usually be ready to move into a home of their own by the spring following their wedding., Amish bishops and deacons are chosen differently from church leaders in other faiths. Groups of men are first elected by the congregation, and then lots are drawn to decide who will become the new minister. Only baptized, married Amish men are eligible to become ministers, and they are obligated to accept the responsibility once they have been nominated. They will usually serve in this ministerial position for life.Amish bishops and ministers do not receive any formal, theological training; they are simply called upon by their community to uphold and enforce the teachings of the Bible and the rules of the Ordnung.
The system for drawing lots works by placing a sheet of paper with a Bible verse into the pages of a songbook. This songbook is then arranged in a row of other songbooks. Each nominated man must choose a songbook, and whoever picks the songbook with the Bible verse concealed inside is said to have been chosen by God to serve the Amish Church."

Keep your plans secret.,
Document your interactions with group members after you leave.,
Focus on yourself instead of trying to rescue other people in the cult.,
Decide whether to involve law enforcement.",How to Leave a Cult2," Don’t tell anyone in the cult that you’re planning to leave. They may try to talk you out of it. If you’re living in a compound, they may also start watching you more closely, so you’ll have fewer opportunities to escape. Participate in activities as usual to avoid arousing any suspicion.Be careful about trusting other people in the group. Even if someone seems to be on your side, they may have a change of heart and tell the other members about your plans later.

, Unless you completely cover your tracks, you can expect to hear from other members of the cult after you get away. Keep these interactions as brief as possible and write down the details of each one. If it is legal where you live, consider recording any conversations you have.Your log of interactions will help back you up if you need to contact law enforcement.
The cult will probably try to convince you to come back. Plan your responses ahead of time so you aren’t tempted to give in.
You can say something like, “I don’t want to be part of the group anymore. Please stop contacting me.”

, Don’t contact other people who are still in the group and try to talk them out of their beliefs. It won’t work, and you could get drawn back into the cult yourself.Instead, focus on rebuilding your own life, so you can be a good example for anyone else who leaves the cult in the future.
People who are experiencing doubts might approach you--that will be your opportunity to help them.

, If members of the cult are harassing, threatening, or stalking you, talk to the police. You should also get the authorities involved if anything illegal is happening in the cult, or if you think the cult may be endangering other people.For instance, if people in the cult are being physically or sexually abused, you should let the police know.

Work on your boundaries.,
Seek support from other people.,
Be prepared for the cult to shun you.,
Learn about other people’s experiences leaving cults.,
Continue to explore your ideas and beliefs.,
See a counselor.",How to Leave a Cult3," Stay strong in your decision to leave the cult. Remind yourself why you wanted to get away, and tell any current members of the group that you don’t want to talk to them. Practice making your own decisions, and work on rediscovering your personality.Cults are so effective at controlling people because they break down their boundaries. It will take time, practice, and perhaps counseling to rebuild your boundaries in a healthy way.

, Many people will be sympathetic to you, even if they don’t fully understand the challenges you’re facing. Readjust to life outside the cult by spending time with family, friends, and other people who care about you. You may also want to look for a support group for survivors of spiritual abuse.If you’re having a hard time adjusting, consider talking to a counselor or cult expert who can help you reframe your life.

, Once the group realizes you aren’t coming back, they will probably cut off contact with you. Being rejected by people you were once close to can hurt a lot, even if those people are part of a destructive ideology. To cope, lean on your new support network and fill your time with productive activities like work or school., Reach out to other people who have left your cult and ask them how they adjusted, or search the internet for personal stories from people who have left cults behind. Learning about how other people coped with the transition can give you strength and confidence to do the same.

, Relearn how to think critically and make your own decisions. Expose yourself to different ideas by reading books and newspapers, watching interesting programs on TV, and talking to lots of people. Practice recognizing your faulty thought patterns, like overgeneralization and self-blame, when they arise.For instance, the cult may have taught you that when bad things happen, it’s your fault for not behaving correctly. Remind yourself that these thoughts are not true.

, Exit counseling can help you readjust to life outside the cult. If you were in the cult for a long time, or if you’re having severe emotional withdrawals, a counselor will be able to help you change your thought patterns and live independently. Look for a counselor who has experience helping former cult members.

Express your feelings.",How to Win Hearts the Islamic Way," It is the first arrow and the fastest of them all. It is like the salt for food. It is also regarded as a kind of alms-giving as is mentioned in a hadith ""Smiling at your brother's face is as charity (Sadaqah)"" (Jami Tirmidhi). ""Abdullah ibn al Harith tells us about the Prophet (PBUH) saying that he had never seen someone smile at the other's face as the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) used to do"" (Jami Tirmidhi).;
, This arrow is the one that lets you to be in the innermost depths of the others hearts. This arrow needs a skillful shooter. The needed skills are the hearty smile, the warm shaking of hands and the friendly welcoming to the other. Being successfully achieved, such kinds of skills are going to be rewarded, referring to the hadith: ""Those who are nearest to Allah are they who are first to give a salutation "" (Jami Tirmidhi). According to a hadith of Anas when people of Yemen came the Prophet (PBUH) said , "" The people of Yemen are approaching and they have softer hearts than yours'. (Anas said) "" They are the first who came with hand shaking"". (Sunan Abu Dawud and Adb ul Mufarad)

, It has a strange charming affection that captivates all senses. Hence, exchanging presents and gifts in different occasions is a pleasant habit however gifts should be within one's tolerable expenses. Aa’ishah (RA) said: ""The Messenger of Allaah used to accept gifts and reward people for giving them."" (Sahih Bukhari)

, Loud voice and chattering are bad merits. You have to be sweet-worded, tender in expressing yourself. A good word has its own magic in winning the hearts of your enemies, how powerfully it would work then with your brothers' hearts!! ""Repel (Evil) with what is better: Then will he between whom and thee was hatred become as it were thy friend and intimate "" (Surah Fussilat 41:34) .The Prophet (PBUH) said, ""Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should speak good or be silent"" (Mawtta Imam Malik). Abu Abdullah Jadali reported that he asked Sayyidah Aisha (RA) about the manners of Allah’s Messenger She said, He was never indecent of speech or of manners. He never spoke loudly in the markets. And, he never returned evil with evil, but he forgave and overlooked.’ (Jami Tirmidhi)

, Listen patiently and never interrupt the speaker, as the Prophet (PBUH) never interrupted a speaker till he ended his speech. And he who fights for this merit gains others love and admiration, whilst on the contrary is the one who chatters and interrupts the other.

, You have to be careful with your appearance so as to be neat, well–dressed and sweet smelling as well. The Prophet (PBUH) says that ""Allaah is beautiful and he love beauty"" (Masnad Ahmed).

, Good treatment classifies you as an obedient, beloved slave of Allah. Allah says in the Qur'an: ""And spend of your substance in the cause of Allah, and make not your own hands contribute to (your own) destruction; but do good; for Allah loveth those who do good""(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:195). Sayyidina Abu Dharr (RA) reported that Allah’s Messenger (SAW) said, “Your smile your brother is a sadaqah for you, and your enjoining piety and forbidding evil is a sadaqah. Your guiding one who is lost on the land is a sadaqah for you. Your leading the blind is a sadaqah for you. Your removing from the thoroughfare a stone, a thorn or a bone is for you a sadaqah. And, your filling with your bucket the bucket of your brother is a sadaqah for you."" (Jami Tirmidhi)

, Offering money is the key for most of the closed doors that hinder you from reaching others hearts, especially in these days. Now I will tell you a story about the magic of the merit of generosity. In the conquest of Makkah, there was a man called ""Safwan Ibn Umia"". That man ran away after making all possible means in keeping the people of Islam and after making conspiracies to kill the Prophet (PBUH). Later on, the Prophet (PBUH) forgave him and he came back asking the Prophet (PBUH) to give him the time of two months to think about Islam and the Prophet (PBUH) said, ""You can take four months, not just two"". In spite of being an atheist, he accompanied the Prophet (PBUH) in the Hunain and Al Ta'if conquests. In Al Ta`if, while the Prophet (PBUH) was dividing the booties of the war, he noticed that man looking longingly to a vast land in which a large number of cattle were flocking. The Prophet (PBUH) asked him, ""Do you like it?"" The man eagerly answered ""Yes."" The Prophet (PBUH) said, ""It is for you then."" Safwan said, ""Only a prophet could behave as generously as you have. I believe that there is no god but Allaah and that Muhammad is His Prophet."" Notice how the Prophet (PBUH) found the missing key and succeeded in moving his heart. Some people behave stingily as if they see the ghost of poverty waiting to attack them once they think about being generous in offering money.

, Keeping an eye on others behavior is a bad merit that blocks your way to their hearts. On the contrary is to have a good opinion of them. So, try hard to give your brothers the excuse as much as you can. Concerning this merit, Ibn Al Mubarak says, ""The believer is he who gives his brothers the excuse, and the hypocrite is he who seeks their slips."" Quran says "" O ye who believe! Avoid suspicion as much (as possible): for suspicion in some cases is a sin: And spy not on each other behind their backs."" (Surah Hujraat 49:12)

, If you love someone, or have good feelings about him, don't wait, just tell him at once. Regarding this Allah’s Messenger (SAW) said, “If one of you loves his brother, let him inform him about it.” (Sahih Bukhari) Prophet (PBUH) also said "" A good dream is from Allah, so if anyone of you saw a dream which he liked, he should not tell it to anybody except to the one whom he loves."" (Sahih Bukhari)

Understand that the prophet Muhammad was not against Christ or Moses.",How to Stop Viewing Islam As a Bad Religion," Radical Muslims are manipulating the holy scripture for their own agenda, and are misusing the teachings of Islam to get more members. Of the total Muslim population, less than 1% identify as radicalized, and even fewer will use violence for their agenda. In fact, a verse in the Quran states the following (this is an English translation): ""And when you look at them, their bodies please you; and when they speak, you listen to their words. They are as blocks of wood propped up. They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemies, so beware of them. May Allah curse them! How are they denying (or deviating from) the Right Path."" The verse quoted above explains that the hypocrites (people who pretend to be believers, but truly disbelieve in their hearts) pretend to be Muslim and think that everyone is against them, but they are the true enemies of Islam and all Muslims. A perfect example of many ""Islamic"" extremist groups today.;
, Some Muslims known as “jihadists” have used violence as a means of power and control, but the concept of “jihad” is actually not a violent one. Jihad, which means “struggle,” was directed to mean the study of, the preaching of, and defense of Islam, but has been misused for military and political means. The use of force is seen as a last resort to protect one’s faith, and even if it is used, the killing of innocents, such as women, children, and the disabled, is strictly forbidden. In Islam, the killing of innocents is seen as the killing of humanity.

, The media may simplify Islam as bad, as a means to simplify a much more complex problem. Take a look at different points of view about a topic, and understand what both Muslims and non-Muslims have to say about Islam. Each news source may have their own biases about Islam.

, Muslims practice their faiths in very different cultural contexts. Muslims living in Indonesia, the country with the largest population of Muslims , have a distinct culture from those living in Iran. So when hearing about incidents such as honor killings or women’s subjugation, try to understand how various social, political, cultural, and religious factors influenced those negative events.

, Throughout history, religious extremism has been utilized as a means to gain political power, and to take control of land. Take the Christian holy wars during the Middle Ages, or the anti-Semitic rhetoric that led to the Holocaust during World War II. The manipulation of religious teachings for one’s own gain has been done before., By putting aside your own religious beliefs, and opening yourself up to understanding another perspective, there is an opportunity for acceptance rather than hate. This does not mean that you need to change your religious affiliation, but rather to know that many people of all faiths are often searching for the same meaning and purpose as yourself.

, No matter where you live, or your religious affiliation, there are ways to connect and learn, such as:


Watch documentaries and films about Islamic culture, and other religions
Take a class about world religions through a local college, or online
Read books about different religions, such as Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism

, It could be through a local community center, a place of worship, or even a Meetup group in your area. In most religions, whether Christian, Muslim, or Jewish, the practice of one’s own religious beliefs (even if they are not the same as your neighbor’s) is welcomed instead of persecuted. Many religious leaders see the benefits of a strong faith, as well as of respecting the religious rights of others.

, By visiting a mosque in person, you can learn about the everyday practices of Islam. Traditionally, Muslims attend a mosque by removing their shoes when entering, and engaging in prayer five times throughout the day. The prayer is led by the local mosque’s leader, the Imam. , Some cities have very diverse religious communities, and make it easier to have interfaith friendships, while other cities may not. Be open-minded about opportunities to learn from people of different religious backgrounds. Listen to their own perspectives on the events occurring across the globe, and learn about their own experiences with their faith.

, Islam is the second largest religion in the world, after Christianity. Over 1.6 Billion people are affiliated with the Muslim faith as of 2010. In the US, there are about 3 million people who identify as Muslim, compare to 5.7 million who identify as Jewish, and 2.1 million who identify as Hindu. While Christianity predominates in the US, there are many communities with religious diversity. , The historical roots of Islam are the same as for Christianity and Judaism. Before these three religions came about, people often believed in multiple gods. Yet with the formation of Islam, as well as Christianity and Judaism, people started to worship one god. Though each religion may use different names, the basic belief is the same--belief in one god (Allah). , As with Christianity and other religions, over time there have been differences in beliefs, despite the same basic principles. Among Muslims, there are two main sects of Islam: Sunni and Shiite, which differ in beliefs based on who were the leaders following the Prophet Muhammad's death.


The majority of Muslims in the world today at Sunnis, with a larger Shiite following in areas such as Iran, Iraq, and Syria.
The extremist groups such as those led by Osama bin Laden, follow a strict sect known as Wahhabism, which has been manipulated for their political gain, and has been discounted by Islamic scholars. , By understanding the teaching of the Qur'an, the Muslim holy book, it will become clear that there are more similarities than differences between Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. The Qur'an actually contains similar information to the details told in Hebrew Bible. The basic articles of faith for Muslims are the following: :


Belief in God, known as Allah
Belief in angels as part of God's creation
Belief in the prophets mentioned in the Qur'an, including Muhammad, Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and others
Belief in the holy book, the Qur'an
Belief in the Day of Judgment
Belief in Predestination

, Based on the Islamic religion, there are many prophets, including Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad. When reading the Qur'an, many scholars believe that the teachings called for peaceful interactions between Muslims and non-Muslims. There is a fundamental respect for religions to coexist. "
"
Find out about Islam.,
Try to understand the deeper meaning of religion.,
Recognize that religions can be misused by power politics.,
Busy yourself with the question of violence.,
Support the tolerance of Islam in society and defend against intolerance.,
Sit with a reliable, recognized, and trustworthy expert on Islam for clarifications and questions.",How to Recognize Peacefulness in Islam," Read the Koran and the Hadith. Think about the various branches of Islam. You can find much information on the web. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam http://www.patheos.com/Library/Islam.html;
, All true religions do lead to God. God is primarily a transcendent experience of the religion's founder. Through spiritual exercises, he has come in contact with a higher cosmic consciousness. This consciousness is described personal by some religions (as a person) and impersonal by other religions (as a higher dimension, truth, love, peace or light).

, Then it is not about to create peace, love and happiness inside the people, but to make bigger the ego of a religious leader or secular ruler. Realize that all religions did wrong, some more and some less.

, Attempt to solve it from the true objectives of the religion. The aim of a religion can be described as holiness, living in God or to get the paradise after death. Paradise is a place of love and peace. A person must develop a consciousness of love and peace so that he can rise after his death into the peaceful and loveable areas of the beyond. Ask yourself which interpretation of the Quran in this context is right.

, Get involved for a positive multicultural coexistence. Get involved for a world of love, peace and happiness. We are one human family. We have to live peaceful and tolerant together, to build up a happy world. Islam is a peaceful religion, if we interpret the Koran correctly.

, Reading is important but meeting with an expert is as important.
