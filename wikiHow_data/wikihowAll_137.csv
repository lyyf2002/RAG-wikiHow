Pray a quick informal prayer seeking God’s help, before starting the conversation with a Muslim to share the gospel.,
Be clear in your own mind of the meaning of the ""Gospel"": The news about what God Himself has done in Jesus Christ for the salvation of sinful humanity.

,
Say, ""Assalam O Alaikum"" (peace be to you), as a polite greeting from you for the appropriate approach from you that softens the atmosphere and prepares a place for you in the heart of the Muslim you will be conversing with.,
Discuss ""Be peacemakers"".,
Minimize English/Christian terminology, but use as much Muslim terminology as possible including—Allah (God), Isa (Jesus), Masih (Messiah/Christ), Maryam (Mary), Injeel (New Testament), Tavrat (Old Testament), Zabur (Psalms), Paigambar (Prophet), etc.,
Ask him/her with genuine interest about his/her understanding of who Isa (Jesus) is and what he has done in this world.,
Avoid arguments, disputes or doctrinal issues, even if the Muslim has the inclination towards them.

,
Do not mention or entertain the phrases ""Trinity"" or ""Jesus is the Son of God"" or ""Jesus is God"", etc.,
Do not venture to say anything negative about the Islamic faith, Qura'n or Muhammad (peace be unto him -- abbreviated in writing as PBUH) or Muslims.,
Share the good news from your personal experience as ‘my-story,’ rather than quoting some verses or proposing what to believe to the Muslim.,
End your visit with a short prayer asking God to bless the Muslim with the truth!

,
Get contact details of the person so that you can follow on, if the person is open and interested in further discussion of the truth of Isa (Jesus).

",How to Share the Gospel with Muslims," A prior acquaintance with the Muslim you want to share the gospel with would be helpful, but is not necessary.;
,, Make your Christian identity clear to the Muslim in the beginning.

, Jesus said, ""Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the Sons of God"" (Matthew 5:9). Point out that Jesus/Isa is the Prince of Peace in the Bible. He calls his followers to bring peace to conflict or peace will have little meaning. We may intervene or interfere in warlike situations. We are to bring love and peace, joy,,... with us -- Why?: ""...brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you"" (2 Corinthians 13:11).

, Let your portrayal of Jesus Christ be restricted to His being Paigambar (Prophet) and as Savior of mankind at this stage.

, Listening always paves the way for a response! Muslims believe in the miraculous virgin birth of Isa (Jesus) and also in his power to do miracles. The most important belief of Muslims about Isa (Jesus) is that Jesus is alive and has ascended to Allah (God).

,, in your conversations. If the Muslim raises them, make an agreement with him/her to put them aside for the next meeting.

, If the Muslim asks about your opinion on these topics you can share your basic understanding of them in a nice, matter of fact way.

, Include in your story how you had lived before becoming the follower of Isa (Jesus) and how you found the truth and how it has transformed your life giving you hope for the future. Prior practice is helpful on telling ""your story"" in less than five minutes.

Purify yourself from all aspects of Shirk (major or minor).,
Prepare yourself to be completely submissive to Allah prior to this journey.,
Be grateful to Allah.,
Refrain yourself from all major sins and protect your tongue from arguing, backbiting and complaining.,
Make your Niyyah (will) to perform Hajj.,
Prepare yourself to invest for this sacred journey.,
Learn about all the legal requirements.,
Start purchasing the necessary items.,
Gather knowledge about Hajj rituals.,
Prepare yourself mentally to face all kinds of hardships during this journey.,
Prepare a wasiyyah (will) before you depart and settle down your disputes with family and friends.,
Have conversations with other Hajis (those who have performed Hajj).,
The journey of Hajj involves a great deal of physical activities.,
Practice a few body exercises daily, specially focusing on your lower abdomen.,
Hajis have to face intense climate, harsh weather along with these exertions.,
Get all your medical tests done before you depart for Hajj.",How to Prepare for Hajj," No deed, no matter how much noble it is, is accepted to Allah without this purification.;
, Tell yourself that this journey is sincerely devoted to please Him and to beg for His mercy and forgiveness.

, Not every Muslim gets a chance to prepare for this spiritual journey. Remember Him always and continue to thank Him for blessing you with this opportunity.

, Remember the morals of Islam and try your best to maintain them. It's hard to be good all the time, specially during a long journey, but that is where you need to ask Allah for His help in all matters.

, Seek the blessings and resources of Allah to perform this journey. Keep your intention strong and continue to supplicate to Allah. Surely, He will make a way out for you from where you might not have imagined.

, If you can afford it, Thank to Allah. If you cannot, ask for His help and guidance. Hajj is a long journey and might require a life-time investment of a person.

, Have knowledge about the laws of Saudi Arabia before starting this journey. Apply for Saudi visa and make sure your passport isn't expired. Complete all the required paper works before you leave for Saudi Arabia. You can contact travel agents to guide you with the whole process.

, Since it is almost a month stay in Makkah and Madina, make sure to buy all the necessary things before you set off. Make a list of things that includes clothes, medicines etc and purchase good quality and long-lasting items for yourself.

, Search the internet for scholarly articles on performing Hajj. There are many handbooks available on this subject too. Plus, get help from those who have already performed Hajj.

, Hajis are bound to experience intense heat, pushing, standing in long lines etc because a large crowd of people has to accommodate in a comparatively small area. Therefore, keep in mind that Hajj is not an easy journey but those who perform it with strong intention, will be rewarded by Allah, for sure.

, It is necessary to complete your uncompleted tasks before you set off for a journey. And since this is the most important journey for any Muslim, it is better to prepare yourself for all kinds of situations.

, Ask them for their experiences during their stay in Makkah and Madinah and how they managed there. Also learn about the beauty of this journey from the experienced ones. This will, indeed, help you to be prepared mentally for all tough situations.

, Therefore, one must prepare his/her body for these challenges. For this purpose, develop a habit of walking at-least one month prior to your departure for Hajj. Start with walking for 30 minutes daily, and then gradually increase the time period.

, You can do squats, crunches, cycling, swimming etc to strengthen your muscles for the great amount of physical activity ahead.

, So it is always better to adapt a healthy and simple life style (if you're not used to one!). Include a greater portion of fruits and vegetables in your diet to get the essential nutrients. Don't forget to take milk on a regular basis.

, Certain vaccinations are required to be done and an overall medical check-up is necessary. If you get approved as medically fit, you are ready for this journey, but still, never forget to keep along basic medicines and first aid material. Also, get more information regarding the medical issues one has to face during Hajj from physicians and health experts."

Praying for 30 minutes or 1 hour will remind you that you love spending time with Him. This way, you acknowledge that He loves to listen. The intimation below are the steps used in praying.



In Jesus Name. This phrase is cardinally important, as it invokes The Power of Jesus in your prayer. This way, the devil won't interfere with your prayers.

Thanksgiving/Praises. Glorify God for all he has done in your life. Under normal circumstances, you wouldn't approach/talk to a king without bowing, thanking/praising him, more so for the Creator.

Intercession. This is the peak of your prayer. It involves supplications/entreaties. For the course of your prayer, use this step to intercede for others.

Benediction. The closing part of your prayers should invoke blessings from God/affirmation. Thank him for answering your prayers.In Jesus name I pray: Your Prayer was prayed in Jesus name.


, It is the gift of God, knowing you are saved unto doing good works that were foreordained that you should do them.


Make your boast in the Lord.

, Listen to gospel songs that are Spirit filled. Recalling that God is spirit and truth!

, Love covers all things. Without love, it is impossible to please God. Show love to your neighbors, to the world, nature and everything. Do these because God created all things and we are the one body of Christ, united.

, (Luke 14:13,14)

, Oh, that man would praise the Lord for His Goodness and wonderful works. Don't stop praising Him! Sing with your heart; it will delight Him, and He will shower abundant and redundant blessing on you like: Oh!, how I love to praise His name.

,, I thank you Lord that your Spirit will never leave us. Let Him be an important part of your everyday life. With God, all things are possible, but without Him, you have nothing (nothing that matters). Choose this day whom you will serve -- God, or the world and its system?


Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption (Ephesians 4:30).

, ""4 ...if a person swears thoughtlessly with his lips to do evil (harsh things) or to do good, in whatever matter a man may speak thoughtlessly as with an oath, but it is not done by him, and then he comes to remember it, he will be guilty in one of these. 5 'So it shall be when he becomes guilty in one of these, that he must confess that in which he has sinned' ""... and make sacrifices"" -- keep the good promise… (Leviticus 5:5)

, Show mercy to the poor and lame: He that is given much/or forgiven much must show mercy.

, Seek not a blessing of your own but for another's well being. When all do that, then all will be greatly blessed. It starts now and here with us. (But recall that you ""do not throw pearls to swine lest they turn and tear you into pieces."") Pay your bills and taxes to whom they are due.


He who steals must steal no more; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with one who has need (Ephesians 4:28).

, Go tell it on the mountains, over the seas, to every island, and to the whole world. Tell them that ""Jesus reigns; He is King -- our only king."" Surrender all to Jesus, but not seeking a reward or pleasures of this world. Our King offers us more (and better) than the world ever could offer.

Make niyyah (intention) to perform Wudu.,
Wash your hands.,
Take water into your mouth.,
Inhale water into your nose.,
Wash your face.,
Wash your lower arms from wrists to elbows, leaving no part dry.,
Clean your head.,
Wipe your ears inside and out.,
Wash each of your feet.,
While pointing the right index finger to the sky, recite a brief prayer of witness (optional).,
Repeat nullified wudu before praying.",How to Perform Wudu," Niyyah is the Islamic concept of performing an act for the sake of Allah. To truly perform wudu, you should center yourself and quiet your thoughts, focusing seriously on what you are doing.


Niyyah doesn't necessarily involve saying anything out loud, but focusing on the phrase ""Bismillah"" (in the name of Allah) is a good way to accomplish the centering necessary. Say it out loud or silently to yourself, whichever makes you comfortable.;
, Use your left hand to wash your right hand. Do this three times. After that, use your right hand to wash your left hand three times. Make sure to wash in between your fingers and all the way up to your wrists., Use your right hand to cup water into your mouth three times. Swish it around in your cheeks and the back of your throat. Do this thoroughly to get all the remaining food in your mouth out.

, Use your right hand to cup water and inhale it into your nose three times. You can use your left hand to close one nostril and blow out if you need to. Snort sharply and abruptly without taking too much water into your nose and choking yourself. If you cannot inhale water into your nose, you can wet your fingers and put water on the lower part of your nostrils.


Make sure to use safe water to perform this ritual; in some warmer areas of the world, water may contain naegleria fowleri, an amoeba that, if inhaled into the nostrils, can cause a rare but usually fatal type of brain infection. Even tap water (usually in third world and developing countries) may be contaminated; to avoid this illness, boil water for one minute (three minutes at higher elevations) and leave it to cool before rinsing your nose with the water. , Wash your face three times by spreading your hands from your right ear to the left, and from the edge of the hair to the chin.

, From your wrist to your elbow, wash your right arm with your left hand three times and then wash your left arm with your right hand three times.


If you have a cast, you are allowed to simply wipe over it instead., Using your wet hands, gently wipe your forehead from the eyebrow to the hairline. Also wipe down your hair, the back of your neck, and your temples. Do this one time.

, With the same water, use your finger to clean all the crevices of your ear. Use your thumb to clean behind your ears from the bottom upward. This is also done one time.

, Clean up to the the ankles and be sure water goes between the toes. Use your pinky finger and go through each toe to eliminate anything between. Start with your right foot and scrub each foot three times.

, Generally, the prayer is as follows: ""Ash-hadu anlaa ilaaha illALLAHu wahdahuu laa shariikalahu, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhuu wa rasuuluhu.""


In English, this is translated as ""I bear witness that there is no deity other than Allah alone; He is One; He has no partner and I bear witness that Muhammad (may Allah honor him and grant him peace) is His (chosen) servant and (true) Messenger.""

, Actions that nullify wudu include natural discharges, including urination, vomiting, defecation, excessive bleeding, and gas. Sleep also nullifies wudu.After intercourse, re-performing wudu alone is not enough to be able to perform Salat. There is another form of purification that must be performed known as Ghusul.

In ancient times, it was not uncommon for pilgrims to die during their journey to Mecca. Though modern conveniences now allow millions of Muslims to quickly and safely travel to and from the holy city, the Hajj should still be approached with the seriousness and dedication of these early pilgrims. Study the rituals of the Hajj, begin to clear your mind of worldly distractions, and, most importantly, be repentant for past sins, which will be forgiven during your pilgrimage.


As with all forms of Muslim worship, the Hajj must be undertaken with sincerity and out of a devotion to God (Allah). The Hajj cannot be performed for the purpose of gaining worldly recognition or material gains in this life.The Hajj must be performed in accordance with the prophet Muhammad's words and deeds as described in the Sunnah.;
, Muslims have three different options when it comes to performing the Hajj. Each offers a slightly different experience in terms of the rituals performed and the timeline of events on the pilgrimage. The three types of pilgrimage are:Tamattu'. This is the most common form of pilgrimage and the one recommended by the prophet Muhammad himself.Tamattu' involves the pilgrim performing the rites of the minor pilgrimage ritual known as Umrah, then performing the rites of the Hajj. Pilgrims performing Tamattu' are called Mutamatti. As this is the most common type of pilgrimage, especially for foreigners to Saudi Arabia, the rest of this guide assumes you will be performing this type of pilgrimage.

Qiran. In this option, the pilgrim performs the rites of both the Umrah and Hajj in one continuous act with no ""break"" in the middle. Pilgrims performing Qiran are called Qaarin.

Ifraad. Finally, this form of pilgrimage involves performing only the rites of the Hajj - not of the Umrah as well. This form of pilgrimage is also notable for being the only one that does not require animal sacrifice. Pilgrims performing Ifraad are called Mufrid.


, The Hajj takes place in and around the holy city of Mecca, which today is located in the country of Saudi Arabia. As when traveling to any foreign country, you will want to have your passports, travel documents, tickets, and so forth sorted out well in advance. Keep in mind that national governments can sometimes be slow to issue new passports when old ones expire.


The Hajj occurs from the 8th to the 12th of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th month of the Islamic calendar. Because the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, the date of the Hajj changes from year to year on the Western Gregorian calendar. Note that, according to the Saudi government, the last day that pilgrims are allowed to arrive at King Abdulaziz Airport in Jeddah for the Hajj is the 4th of Dhu al-Hijjah.
The Saudi government offers special ""Hajj visas"" to American Muslims who have not made the pilgrimage in the last five years.Obtaining one of these visas requires an up-to-date passport, a completed application form, copies of marriage or birth certificates, and an up-to-date immunization record.
Pilgrims often travel to perform the Hajj in groups as a sign of solidarity. Contact members of your local Muslim community to see if any are performing Hajj this year - if so, you may want to consider coordinating your trips.

, As a traditionalist Islamic monarchy, the nation of Saudi Arabia has rules for personal conduct, especially that of women, that may be unfamiliar to foreigners. All women performing the Hajj should plan to travel in the company of a Mahram - a close relative, husband, in-law, etc. Women over 45 can perform the Hajj without a Mahram if they are part of a large group and have a notarized letter of consent from their husband.


All people - women and men - who are attending the Hajj should prepare to be exceedingly modest for the duration of their stay in Saudi Arabia. Clothing must be modest and unadorned - for much of the pilgrimage, special religious garb is required for men. Cologne, perfume, makeup, and scented soap should be avoided. When a pilgrim enters the sacred Ihram state of ritual purity, smoking, swearing, shaving, cutting one's nails, and sexual intercourse are forbidden.

, Ihram is a holy state of purity that all Muslims must assume before performing the rites of Umrah and Hajj and which much be maintained for the duration of the rituals. Ihram requires certain physical actions and behavioral changes, but don't be mistaken - the real state of purity is attained spiritually by proclaiming one's intention to sincerely pursue the Umrah/Hajj and by reciting the Talbiyah prayer. Thus, someone who assumes Ihram externally but doesn't have sincere belief in his or her heart isn't truly fulfilling Ihram. Men and women enter into Ihram differently - see below for details:Men: Shave, comb your hair, trim or shape your facial hair, cut your nails, and remove unwanted body hair. Bathe (or perform wudu, partial ablution) with the intention of Ihram, but don't apply cologne or other scents. Sincerely repent for your sins.

Clothe yourself in clean, plain Ihram sheets - wrap one around your waist and wear the other over your upper body. Wear simple sandals or flip flops that don't cover the top portion of your foot. Avoid covering your head. These simple garments signify the equality of all before God - the wealthiest king and the lowliest beggar wear the same clothes on the Hajj.



Women: As with men, you should shave and groom yourself, bathe, avoid applying scents, etc. You should also avoid applying makeup or other cosmetics. However, besides the requisite sandals, women don't have special clothes for Ihram - their ordinary clothes should be used, provided that they are clean and modest.

Note that in Islam, covering the head with a veil, scarf, etc. is ""mandatory"" attire for women and should be done on the Hajj too.



, A special boundary called a Miqat surrounds the holy sites of the Hajj. Pilgrims cannot cross this boundary without having attained the pure state of Ihram. When a pilgrim in the state of Ihram approaches the Miqat at one of six historical entry points, he pronounces the Niyyah - a short recitation of his intention to complete the Umrah. Then, at the Miqat, the pilgrim recites the Talbiyah, a prayer that will be repeated often during the pilgrimage. The words of the Talbiyah are:


""Here I am O Allah, (in response to Your call), here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise, grace and sovereignty belong to You. You have no partner.""
If she or he has not already entering into the state of Ihram, the pilgrim must do so at the Miqat before crossing.
Note - it is tradition to enter these holy entryways and most other holy buildings right foot first.

, At first sight of the Ka'bah, keep your eyes fixed on it and stand to the side of the crowd as you say ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is Great"") three times, followed by saying ""La Ilaha Illallah"" (""There is no god but God""). Recite other holy verses if you desire. Say a blessing for the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and, in total humility, make your prayers to Allah. This is an especially propitious, auspicious time to pray for something.

, Tawaf is a ritual where Muslims circle the Ka'bah. To begin, men should make sure their Ihram garb is properly arranged - make sure the upper sheet passes under the right arm and lays across the left shoulder, exposing the right shoulder. Next, all should face the Ka'bah so that the Black Stone is on your right. Make another Niyyah for Umrah, saying: "" O Allah, I perform Tawaf of Umrah to please You. Make it easy for me and accept it from me.""


Next, begin to move to the right. Draw close to the Black Stone (the Eastern cornerstone of the Ka'bah) and, if possible, kiss it. If can't get close enough to kiss it, you may touch it with your hand. If you can't get close enough to touch or kiss it, lift your hands to your ears, palms facing towards the Black Stone, and recite this short prayer: ""Bismi'Llah Allahu akbar wa li'Lah al-hamad"". Don't shove or fight for a chance to touch the Black Stone.
Begin to circle the Ka'bah. Walk counter-clockwise so that the Ka'bah stays at your left. Circle the Ka'bah seven times, praying as you do so. There are no designated prayers for the Tawaf, so you may use ones from your daily life or simply pray from your heart. You may also point at the Black Stone each time you walk by it.
When you've completed seven circles, you are finished. Men can now cover their right shoulder.

, Sa'ey means ""to run"" or ""to make an effort"". In practical terms, it means walking back and forth seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwah which are to the South and North of the Ka'bah, respectively. Originally, this was done outdoors, but today, the entire path is enclosed in a long gallery.


When you reach the top of Safa, recite another Niyyah, saying: """" O Allah! I perform Sa’ey between Safa and Marwah to please You. Make it easy for me and accept it from me."" Then, add: ""Inn-as-Safa wal-Marwah min Sha’a’irillah"" (""Indeed Safa and Marwah are among the Signs of Allah."") Finally, face the Ka'bah and recite ""Allahu Akbar"" three times. Add any additional prayers you may wish, then proceed towards Marwah.
As you move towards Marwah, recite: ""Subhan-Allah wal-hamdu-lillahi wa la ilaha ill-Allah wa-Allahu Akbar wa la haula wa la quwwata illa-billa"", or, if you can't remember this, use the shortened form, ""Subhan Allah, Alhamdu Lillah, Allahu Akbar."" You may add any prayers you wish. At the top of Marwah, repeat the glorification of God while facing the Ka'bah, then walk down from the hill again.
When you've walked back and forth seven times, you are finished.

, After completing the Sa'ey, men should have their hair either completely shaved or cut short - both are permissible, though shaving is preferred. However, a man may not want to have his head shaved completely during the Umrah if he plans to complete the Hajj rites in the next few days, which also include shaving. Women should not have their heads shaved but instead may cut a lock of hair or have their hair trimmed several inches.After the ritual hair-cutting, Umrah is complete and the restrictions of Ihram are lifted. You can return to your normal activities, wear your normal clothes, etc. However, if, like many pilgrims, you will proceed to complete the Hajj in the next few days, know that you will need to re-enter Ihram to do so.

, Depending upon how the trip is scheduled, most pilgrims performing the Tamattu' pilgrimage have a several-day break in between their Umrah duties and their Hajj duties, so, for sake of ease, they leave the state of Ihram after their Umrah. However, as with Umrah, the Hajj requires ritual purity and meekness before God, so, at the outset of the Hajj, pilgrims re-assume the state of Ihram. As before, bathe, groom yourself, and don the proper Ihram clothes. When you're ready, say another Niyyah: ""O Allah! I intend to perform Hajj. Please make it easy for me and accept it from me. Amen."" After, say the Talbiyah three times.


The rites of the Hajj last five days - from the 8th to the 12th of Dhu al-Hijjah. You must maintain in Ihram for about three days, abstaining from the activities that are forbidden to you until this period is over.

, On the first day of Hajj, pilgrims head to Mina, a town near Mecca, where they spend the rest of the day. Here, the Saudi government provides amenities - thousands upon thousands of white air-conditioned tents provide temporary housing for each year's pilgrims. On the first night, no major rituals take place, so you may spend your time praying and reflecting with other pilgrims if you wish. Many pilgrims choose to say the Dhuhr, Asr, Magrib, Isha and Fajr prayers.Note that, in Mina, men and women stay in separate tents, which are located adjacent to each other. Though husbands and wives may interact, men cannot enter women's tents.

, On the second day of Hajj, pilgrims travel to Arafat, a nearby mountain. Pilgrims must reach Arafat by the afternoon, because, at this time, a ritual called Waquf begins. From the time when the sun first starts to decline until the time it sets completely, pilgrims hold a vigil on a plain of Arafat during which time they pray and reflect.


No specific prayers are assigned for the Waquf, so simply pray to Allah sincerely from your heart. Many pilgrims like to also spend time reflecting on the course of their life, their future, and their place in the world.

, After sundown, pilgrims head to a place called Muzdalifah between Mina and Arafat. Here, they offer an evening prayer to God (Maghrib) and spend the night sleeping on the ground beneath the open sky.


In the morning, gather pebbles, as you will use these for the Ramy ""stoning"" ceremony later in the day.

, Before the sun rises, pilgrims head back to Mina. Here, pilgrims participate in a ceremony meant to symbolize stoning the devil. Pilgrims throw seven consecutive pebbles at a special stone monument called the Jamrat al Aqabah.


This ceremony can be extremely crowded, tense, and emotional. Trampling deaths, though rare, have occurred. Because of this, the elderly, sick, and injured are discouraged from participating. Instead, they may perform this later in the evening or have a friend or confidant perform the ritual in their place.

, After the Ramy ceremony, it's necessary to offer an animal sacrifice (Qurbani) to God. In the past, each pilgrim did this individually, however, today, it's much more common for pilgrims to simply purchase a sacrifice voucher. These vouchers signify that an animal was sacrificed in your name. After selling vouchers, qualified personnel will sacrifice a lamb for each pilgrim (or a camel for every seven pilgrims), butcher the animals, package the meat, and ship it to Muslim communities all over the world to be used to feed the poor.


Animal sacrifice can be done at any point on the 10th, 11th, or 12th day of Dhu al-Hijjah. If Ramy has to be postponed for any reason, wait until after Ramy to make your sacrifice.

, As in the Umrah, pilgrims must have their hair ritually cut. Men may have their hair completely shaved or cut into a very short haircut (if a man opted for a short haircut during his Umrah, he may now want to have his hair completely shaved off, though he is not required to). Women can have a short lock of hair cut - their heads are not shaved.

, Just as in the Umrah, the Hajj requires pilgrims to perform the Tawaf and Sa'ey rituals at the Ka'bah and the nearby hills. The rituals are performed essentially identically to how they are performed during the Umrah, but it is highly recommended that these ceremonies be done only after the stoning, sacrifice, and hair-cutting rituals.


After completing the Tawaf and Sa'ey, you are released from your state of Ihram and may resume the activities that were previously prohibited.
At the end of your third day, return to Mina and spend the night there in prayer.

, In Mina, you must once again participate in the stoning ritual. This time, you will not throw pebbles only at the Jamrat al Aqabah, but also at two other monuments - the Jamrat Oolah and Jamrat Wustah.


First, throw pebbles at the Jamrat Oolah, then praise Allah and supplicate with your hands raised (there are no assigned prayers, so you may use your own.) Repeat this for the Jamrat Wustah. Finally, throw your pebbles at the Jamrat al Aqabah, but after, you don't need to pray - you can return home.
Repeat this ritual after sundown on the fifth day.

, Finally, your Hajj has come to a close. To mark the end of the most important religious experience of your life as a Muslim, perform one final tawaf, walking around the Ka'bah seven times as before. As you perform the Farewell Tawaf, reflect on the thoughts and feelings you've experienced on your Hajj. Offer praise and supplication to Allah. When you've finished, complete any unfinished business you have remaining in or around Mecca, then depart for your home.


After making the Hajj, many pilgrims opt to travel to Medina, the second-holiest city in Islam. Here, they can visit such holy sites as The Prophet's Mosque and The Holy Tomb. No Ihram is necessary to visit Medina.
Note that foreign pilgrims are required to leave Saudi Arabia by the 10th of Muharram (the 1st month of the Islamic calendar)."

You can also check out a book from your local library, or purchase one online or at a bookstore, about astrology. This can help you learn about yourself by using your Zodiac sign.

, Keep in mind your Zodiac sign is only one small component of how you read an astrology chart. A variety of aspects influence how your sign is read. You have to take all other aspects of the chart, such as your houses and planets, into consideration to completely read an astrology chart. This information is dependent on both your place and date of birth.

, The ascendant is a very important part of an astrology chart. It is the point, by sign and degree, that was rising above the Eastern horizon at the exact moment of your birth. You need to find the ascendant to know how the houses will be labeled in your chart.


If the Zodiac wheel was a clock, your ascendant can be found at 9 o'clock. This points to the cusp of your first house.The astrology chart is divided into 12 inner sections, in somewhat triangular shapes. Count the houses counter clockwise, the ascendant marking the first house.

, The different houses point to different aspects of your life. What sign rules the differing houses will influence your astrology chart.


The first house represents you at birth. That is, your identity, physical appearance, attitude, temperament, and other inherent qualities. Planets and signs found in the first house have a huge influence on your personality.The second house represents your money, personal assets, self worth, and attitude towards such things. Financial security and emotional well-being throughout your life can be evaluated by what sign and planet are found in the second house.The third house represents communication and transportation. How others communicate with you, physical forms of communication like letters, and short distance travel is found in the third house. This also points to your mental attitude, learning style, self-expression, and manner of speech.The fourth house represents home, family, and property. Your roots, background, childhood, and the inner emotions that stem from these areas of your life are dominated by this house.The fifth house represents children and how you relate to them. Romance and love affairs are also found in the fifth house as are how you approach pleasure and fun.The sixth house is the house of health and service, representing your general physical well-being throughout life., In addition to the first six, there are another six houses. Where these houses fall on your chart, and what planets and signs rule these houses, help you read your astrology chart.


The seventh house represents serious, committed relationships. Things like marriage and romantic partnerships are controlled by this house. It can show what you need in a longterm romantic partner.The eighth house is the house of regeneration and rebirth. Birth, death, decay, healing, surgeries, injuries are found in this house. Sex is also found in this house.The ninth house represents long distance travel. Journeys found in the ninth house are both physical and metaphorical. In addition to long trips, of 500 miles and more, emotional journeys and transformations are found in the ninth house.The tenth house represents career and status. Your ambitions and aspirations are found in this house. It also reveals your place in a community.The eleventh house is known as the house of hopes. It represents when and if your dreams will come true. Supposedly, you should wait until you have a significant planet transitioning through this house before taking big risks.The 12th house represents secrets. Things that are hidden, like hidden emotions and secret aspects of one's past, are revealed by the 12th house., Planets that pass through the different houses of your chart affect your reading. Planets are scattered throughout the chart, represented by different symbols.


The sun is represented by a circle with a dot in the center. The moon is a small half-crescent moon shape.
Venus is the symbol for female while Mars is the symbol for male. Mercury is the male symbol, but with two small lines jutting out of the top circle.
Jupiter is represented by a symbol that looks something like the number 4. Saturn is represented by a symbol that resembles 5.
Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto all have fairly intricate symbols representing them. Uranus looks something like an upside down female symbol with four lines on either side, two on each side, that curve outward in opposing directions. Neptune looks like an upside down cross with two lines on either side, looping upward. Pluto is a kind of combination of Neptune and Uranus. It's a female symbol facing upward, with two lines on either side that loop upward.

, The planets are divided into two types: personal planets and outer planets. Personal planets include the sun, the moon, mercury, venus, and mars.


The sun represents a person's basic identity and purpose. The moon represents how a person reacts and reflects on the events experienced in life.Mercury is your ability to relate to and perceive individuals and objects. Venus illustrated what you're comfortable with and what you enjoy. Mars represents your will and your actions., The outer planets include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Pluto, and Neptune. They point to different aspects of your personality than the inner planets.


Jupiter represents how you integrate yourself into society as well as your personal growth.Saturn represents your personal responsibilities as well as personal rules you develop for yourself over time.Uranus represents your ability to learn and grow. Neptune points to your ideals and imagination.Pluto represents your capacity for change and inner growth, pointing to very deep and personal types of change., In order to read an astrology chart accurately, you will need to take into consideration where the planets appear. What house do they appear in and under which sign? This will give you insight into your personality and life path.


Planets represent what you do, that is what you enjoy and what drives you. Houses represent how, which is your manner of accomplishing a given task. Signs represent where, as in which areas of your life you can expect certain aspects of growth or change.Say you have a Uranus in Aires in your fourth house. Uranus represents your ability to learn and grow. Aires is a sign that points to ambition, passion, and strong emotions. The fourth house points to home, family, and property. This could mean you feel passionate about personal relationships and tend to learn and grow most through your family. You may be more emotionally invested and introspective when dealing with your family.

Travel to a miqat.,
Assume the Ihram state of purity.,
Recite the Talbiyyah.,
If flying, consider assuming Ihram before/during your travel to Mecca.",How to Perform Umrah1," As with the Hajj pilgrimage, a Muslim cannot travel directly to the Ka'bah in Mecca to begin Umrah. Surrounding Mecca are five miqat, which are special holy barriers that all Muslims must pass through before proceeding to their religious duties as pilgrims. At the miqat, all pilgrims must stop and assume a ritual state of purity which must be maintained throughout the Umrah. Passing the miqat without assuming this state not permitted — if this is done, the pilgrim must return to one of the miqat before beginning the Umrah again. The sites of the five miqat (with their distance and geographical position relative to the Ka'bah) are:Dhu'l-Hulayfah: 450 kilometers (280 miles) north of Mecca. 9 kilometers (5.5 miles) from Medina.
Juhfah: 190 kilometers (118 miles) northwest of Mecca.
Qarn al-Manazil: 90 kilometers (56 miles) east of Mecca.
Dhat Irq: 85 kilometers (53 miles) northeast of Mecca.
Yalamlam: 50 kilometers (31 miles) southeast of Mecca.
In addition, some Muslim scholars believe it is appropriate to assume Ihram in the city of Jeddah, which is not one of the five traditional miqat but is 86 kilometers (53.5 miles) from Mecca and is home to Saudi Arabia's busiest airport. However, in this case, an additional animal sacrifice may be required.
Finally, most people who live in Mecca use a special miqat called Tan'eem which is only about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the Ka'bah.;
, At the miqat, all pilgrims must assume a special state of religious purity called Ihram. Externally, this is marked by putting on certain special clothing. For men, this clothing is two special pieces of unstitched white cloth also called ""Ihram,"" while for women this is ordinary but loose, conservative clothing.However, Ihram is more than just a uniform — it's a mental state and a code of behavior that marks the pilgrim's complete devotion to the duties of the Umrah. The state of Ihram forbids:Arguing, shouting, using impure language or acting aggressively
Showing affection to one's spouse or having sexual intercourse (a pilgrim also may not marry while in the state of Ihram)
Joking and immodest behavior
Shaving any part of the body, clipping the nails, and using perfume or cologne
Wearing a head covering, socks, or close-toed shoes (for men). Women may wear head coverings and socks. Umbrellas are acceptable for both sexes.
Killing animals except in self-defense or in the case of annoying pests like flies and mosquitoes (in both cases, driving the animal away without killing it is preferable)

, At the miqat, the pilgrim recites a special short prayer called the Talbiyyah. This recitation announces the pilgrim's presence to God and cements his or her intent to complete the pilgrimage. Pilgrims are encouraged to repeat the Talbiyyah throughout their pilgrimage when they have time. The words of the Talbiyyah are:Labbayka-Allahummma labbayk, Labbayka laa shareeka laka labbayk. Innal-Hamda wanni'mata laka wal-Mulk, laa shareeka lak!
In English, this is: ""Here I am O Allah! Here I am! Here I am, there is no partner for you, here I am! Surely, all praise, blessings, and dominion are for You. There is no partner for you!""

, Today, Muslims from all over the world make the trip to Saudi Arabia via air travel. However, since Saudi Arabia's busiest airport is in Jeddah, which is technically within the miqat boundary, many Muslims choose to assume the state of Ihram before or even during their travel. In this case, the pilgrim should bathe before leaving and make sure to change into the proper clothes for Ihram at some point before the plane crosses the traditional miqat boundaries.


It is generally considered better to assume the state of Ihram well before crossing the miqat boundary than waiting until the plane nears the boundary and running the risk of crossing the boundary without becoming pure, so be sure to leave yourself plenty of time to change."

Practice cleanliness.,
Look for water.,
Know when tayammum is allowed.,
Determine if you have enough acceptable water.,
Choose tayammum if you have no water.,
Find a clean place.,
Remove unnecessary items.,
Determine if you need to perform ablution for your feet.,
Memorize the order.,
Recite the following:Bismillaah hirahmaan nirrahiim
""In the name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Compassionate""


This phrase begins the first verse of the first chapter of the Qur’an.,
Make your niyyah.,
Place your hands on the ground.,
Rub your face with your hands.,
Cover each hand.,
Repeat the process of placing your hands on the ground.,
Repeat the process of rubbing your face with your hands.",How to Perform Tayammum," For Muslims, it is required to purify the body through washing before praying and performing salah, or handling and reading the Qur’an.


Purification of the body and clothes before prayer is called taharah.;
, Usually water is required to cleanse one’s body before performing salah. This kind of washing ritual is called wudu, which requires that you clean your hands, forearms, face, head, and feet.There is a more intense cleansing called ghusl that is required after instances of “uncleanliness” (such as sexual intercourse, menstruation, and child birth). Ghusl involves bathing the entire body.Wudu is nullified after any natural discharge (urine, gas, stool, ejaculation), after falling asleep, or after any type of unconsciousness. If one of these things has happened to you, you must perform wudu again before you engage in salah., Tayammum is permitted in the following instances:


When acceptable water is not available within a one mile radius.
When there is a legitimate fear that an enemy or a dangerous animal is near the water.
When using your water for wudu would risk not having enough water to drink later.
When there is no means of getting water out of the well (no rope or bucket to draw the water).
When using water would be dangerous to your health.
When you don’t have enough money to purchase water that is being sold.
When water is being sold at an unreasonable price.
When there is no trace of water and no person to ask about where to find water.

, If you cannot find enough water to perform wudu, or if using the water you have would endanger your health or that of your dependents, it is appropriate to perform tayammum instead of wudu.Permitted types of water include fresh water from a pond or well, melted snow, well water, or river/sea/spring water.Prohibited kinds of water include unclean water, water whose color has changed, water into which something impure has fallen, water extracted from fruit and trees, water left over after animals have been drinking it, or water previously used in wudu or ghusl., When you find yourself in a position where you need to cleanse your body before performing salah, but there is no acceptable water to use, you can perform tayammum with clean earth/dirt instead.


Items on which tayammum is accepted include:

Taahir (pure) earth
Sand
Stone
Limestone
Baked earthen pots
Walls made of mud, stone, or brick
Clay
Any item with a thick covering of dust


The first preference is fresh earth, but if none is available you can choose clay, a lump of sand, or even a stone if necessary.Items that are not acceptable to perform tayammum on include:

Wood
Metal
Glass
Food items
Anything that burns to ash or melts



, This location can be anything natural like a rock, sand, or grass. The location must be clean to maintain the purity of the ritual.


If the location of tayammum is impure, you must purify it with water.
If there is no water to purify the location, you can use any of the items that are permitted to use for tayammum (listed above).

, To perform tayammum, you must clean your body and clothing thoroughly (this is called tahir). This means that you should remove any unnecessary coverings like rings or nail polish., If you put on your socks or shoes while you have a valid wudu, it is unnecessary to take them off and wash your feet every time you must renew your wudu. You may leave your shoes/socks on and simply wipe the top of each covered foot one time with your wet hands instead of washing your entire foot.


If you have no water to wet your hands, you can use any of the items that are permitted for tayammum (listed above) to wipe the top of each of your covered feet.
You can do this for up to 24 hours. However, if you are traveling, this method will work for three days., All parts of tayammum must be performed in the correct order, so it is important that you know the order of the steps so that you can follow them accurately.If you make a mistake in the order, you must begin your tayammum from the beginning again.

, This fact emphasizes the importance of beginning your tayammum in the name of Allah., This is the way that you announce your intention to perform tayammum. You do this by saying “I am doing tayammum in place of wudu, for the pleasure of Allah and to seek closeness to him.It is important to announce your intention for tayammum so that the entirety of the sacred ritual is maintained and respected.

, This is the part where the clean earth is necessary. Strike your palms simultaneously on the earth (or clay, sand, or stone, according to preference and availability).It is not necessary to cover your hands completely with the earth – just touch it with your palms.

, The face encompasses the right ear to the left ear. Place your palms on your forehead at the hairline and pull your hands down until they reach the bridge of your nose. Only use your palms during this process., Move the palm of your left hand so that it covers the entire back of your right hand from the wrist bone to the fingertips. Then repeat this action with the right palm covering your left hand., Once more, strike your hands simultaneously on the ground so that they come into contact with the clean earth., Cover each hand again (beginning with the left and moving on to the right) to conclude the tayammum ritual."
"

Don’t use impure water, water from fruit or trees or previous Ghusl or Wudu water.,
Use clean earth and rub it over your face and hands if you are traveling and can’t find a source of clean water.,

Dry the body with a clean towel and dress.",How to Perform Ghusl," This source can include rain, well, spring, sea, river snowmelt or pond water. Water which covers an area of 21 by 21 feet (6.5 by 6.5m) is generally regarded as large enough to gather pure water., Water that may have bodily fluids from animals or humans is also unacceptable. Discolored water should not be used.


Make sure to use safe water to perform this ritual; in some warmer areas of the world, water may contain naegleria fowleri, an amoeba that, if inhaled into the nostrils, can cause a rare but usually fatal type of brain infection. The CDC has guidelines on how this type of ritual ablution can be done safely. , You should perform Ghusl with water as soon as you find a water source., It does not matter if you engaged in sexual intercourse or not - it is also required after unlawful acts and after wet dreams. Ghusl is not required for discharging madhiy (urethral fluid) which sometimes seeps out after thinking of or desiring intercourse - wudhu is sufficient in this case.

, This extends to bleeding after childbirth. If there is no bleeding after childbirth, it should be performed on the 40th day after childbirth.

, Those who died in Jihad don’t require Ghusl.

, This is preferred but not required.


When a disbeliever is converted to Islam.
Before Friday Prayer.
Before Eid Prayers.
After washing a corpse.

, Blow the water out into your left hand. Repeat three times.

, Wash it three times from your hairline to your chin and jawbone. Extend the washing from ear to ear.


Men should wash their beard. They can take a handful of water below the chin and rub it through the beard. Drag the wet fingers through the beard once.

, Repeat with the left arm.

, If men or women have braided hair, they should wet the base of the braids and hair. If they can’t wet the base, they should un-plait the hair.

, Repeat with the left side.

, Rub every portion of your body with the water to ensure your entire body is clean.

, Wash the feet, right then left, up to the ankles. Make sure to pour water between the toes and rub with your little finger.


Ensure you wash the soles of the foot.
All washing should be completed three times.

Since then, different cultures have developed different methods of interpreting the night sky, and there are many different guidelines out there for burgeoning horoscope writers. The deeper your knowledge of these systems, the better your horoscopes will be. However, if you are just starting out, you should learn the most common system, known as the Solar House System.


Serious astrologers need to know birth times and locations to write personalized horoscopes. However, for general horoscopes like those seen in the paper, the Solar House System is a careful approximation.
Houses are typically known as your ""sign,"" such as Libra, Taurus, Aries, etc. If you are unsure about each sign, or need a refresher, click here to view the overviews below.

For the next several steps, you can watch an original Aries horoscope for April 18th, 2015, as it is written.;
, For example, if you're writing about Virgos, you might start by writing about their work schedule or life at work, since they are the House of Work and Ritual. If you're talking about Tauruses, your might touch on finances. These are often your guiding principles, and they are a good way to start writing or to think about the general tenor of each house.For a Capricorn, you might begin with something like ""Your career is about to..."" then use the rest of the planets to determine trends.Aries, April 18: Optimism and boundless energy fill your interactions today.

, One of the biggest misconceptions in astrology is that every person only has one sign. In reality, your birthday only points to your first house. For example, if you're born October 5th, your first house (and most important sign) is Libra. However, if you continue along the zodiac, the next two houses are your second and third houses, here Scorpio and Sagittarius. You'll notice, reading over the descriptions of each group, that there is some overlap in features between similar months. This can help point to important trends in each group's life.For example, while a Pisces is generally selfless and creative, they are also closely tied to the occasional impulsiveness and burst of inspiration found in Aries.
Serious astrologists note that you have a little bit of every ""sign"" in you, based on the alignment of planets and stars at your birth. Some are just more prominent than others. Again, this is why many writers need your exact birthday and birthplace to properly determine your houses.Aries, April 18th: Optimism and boundless energy fill your interactions today. You're feeling flirty and conversational, but ultimately you're just having fun, not looking for anything serious.

, The proclamations that ""you'll experience a drastic change in ______"" are not just pulled out of thin air. They come from the interceptions of certain planets through the night sky. Pay attention to major astrological events to help determine when changes might happen. To do so, look at astrological event calendars, found with a quick internet search. To determine what the change might be, check out which planet aligns with which house. For example:


On January 5th, 2015, the Moon entered Libra. The moon, which governs the Cancers, is generally associated with identity, emotion, and one's roots, potentially leading to a ""rediscovery of a long-lost friend or lover"" for Libras.
Certain events will make greater impacts depending on their relevance to the signs. For example, the moon entering or leaving Cancer's path will make a much bigger impact than entering Libra's. Mar's movement will affect Aries and Scorpio.Aries, April 18th: Optimism and boundless energy fill your interactions today. You're feeling flirty and conversational, but ultimately you're just having fun, not looking for anything serious. The advent of the new moon in Aries means you've got a chance to plant new seeds for the future.

, These charts are meticulously constructed to show each planet in relation to each sign, illuminating how they move and when they come in and out of contact. They are often color-coded to help you determine the most pressing issues and changes. They are invaluable tools for anyone looking to write frequent horoscopes. For example, to cap off the Aries horoscope, you might notice that Mercury, the planet of communication, is currently in in Aries on April 18th:



Aries, April 18th: Optimism and boundless energy fill your interactions today. You're feeling flirty and conversational, but ultimately you're just having fun, not looking for anything serious. The advent of the new moon in Aries means you've got a chance to plant new seeds for the future. Keep your mind, heart, and ears open for possible opportunities.""

, Astrology is a millennia-deep branch of study that would take a lifetime to master. Many astrologists, such as sidereal astrologists, don't even believe in the same zodiac structure. To complicate matters more, horoscopes must reach a wide audience, and lose the subtly and precision required for personalized horoscopes. As such, horoscope writing has evolved into an art form of sorts, considered by many the literature or poetry of astrology. It is entertainment -- meaningful entertainment, for sure -- but entertainment nonetheless.Daily horoscopes are supposed to be conversational. The reader comes to the horoscope looking for direction or guidance, picking out of the horoscope the things that matter in their lives. They usually forget or leave the rest.
In order to get a ""true"" reading, you need a personalized horoscope. Because this is impossible to write for a large audience, you must entertain and capture the imaginations of a broader group of people.
Enjoy yourself while writing, and make sure your readers enjoy reading. There is no need for a dry, conversational tone.

, It is very difficult for beginners to read, understand, and write horoscopes daily for all twelve solar houses. Focus instead on larger trends. Learn the basics of astrology and apply it to your writing for more accurate, useful, and precise horoscopes. Check out astrology blogs for your day or week, concentrating specifically on the time of the year, the movement of planets (specifically Mars and Venus), and the position of the moon.Use phrases like:


""The advent of a New Moon means opportunity is coming to...""
""The retrograde (disappearance) of Jupiter in your sign signals a bout of bad luck...""
""The slow entrance of Uranus could indicate a long-overdue change in your life.""

, This is getting easier and easier with social media sites like Facebook, which allow you to look up people's birthdays with ease. Ask yourself if your reading matches several of personalities of people born under the same sign. If they do, chances are you're doing something right., This is hard when you're writing for a big audience. However, it gets easier the more your pay attention to the movement of planets and stars. While there needs to be some generalization when writing, try to look for specifics. For example, instead of saying, ""you'll experience an increase in communications,"" try to find the root cause. The influx of Mercury into your sign will increase communications, for example, but the question is how. Is it in your career (Mercury moving into Capricorn) or your love life (Mercury moving into Libra)?""The entrance of Mercury into Libra may indicate some new spice in your love life and close relationships.""
""You'll receive some good news concerning your finances.""
""The movement of Jupiter may mean an end to your streak of bad luck this week.""

, A big reason that people don't trust horoscopes is that they promise grand, enormous changes every other week. The careful astronomer realizes that these changes are as rare in our lives as they are among the stars. Focus instead on the subtle changes in life. Save the big, soul-changing moments for times when they seem imminent due to the planetary movement. Making grand proclamations every day makes them harder to stomach, and takes away their meaning.


Since you're working in generalities, without exact birthdays or times, it is almost impossible to predict enormous and earth-shattering changes.
Pepper your column with ""maybes"" ""possibles"" and ""could"" so that readers don't feel promised anything., Like any other art form, you need to study horoscopes in order to write them well. From the beginner-level horoscopes in your local paper to the experimental and wildly popular writings of ""Free-Will Astrology,"" there is a lot you can learn from others. Astrology is not a perfect science. Generations of writers have been interpreting the stars for their fellow man since ancient times. Keep your mind open to new forms, writers, and astrological signs and you'll be a horoscope writer in no time.How do they speak broadly (to a lot of people), but still stay relatively specific?
What movements and planets come up in multiple signs each day? Which signs have commonalities.
How do the horoscopes change from daily to monthly to yearly.

, More likely than not, you are already familiar with the basics of the solar houses, or astrological signs. Depending on when you were born, you fall under a different sign. This is based on the where the sun rises on the day you were born, creating your ascendant house. You can look up more complex breakdowns of each house, but you need to have the basics down before you start writing horoscopes.


The following descriptions are good starting points, but you'll need to consult 3-4 other sources of house information to get a deeper understanding of the houses.While these houses form the basis of horoscopes, they are not the only determining factor. The movement of planets like Venus and Mars, lunar cycles, and birthplace all have an effect. True astrologers must keep researching and studying celestial bodies other than the sun to be successful., The first sign of the zodiac, Aries tend to have a lot of energy. They are a bit wild, adventurous, and confident. While this energy makes them dynamic and exciting companions, it can also make them selfish, foolhardy, and quick-tempered.

Look up the history of horoscopes.,
Consider how the positions of stars have changed since horoscopes were first formed.,
Consider how the planet positions change constantly.,
Note that sun-sign astrology has some severe limitations when the science is applied to it.,
Realize that horoscopes are just for fun and do not mean anything.,
Think about the personality traits revealed in the signs.,
Think about any previous loves, and the people that you get along with very well.,
Think of how silly the concept really is whenever you read a horoscope.,
Go cold turkey.",How to Stop Believing in Horoscopes," Doing a bit of learning about how horoscopes developed and how they have been used throughout history will help you to see that they are just a pseudo-science.;
, The signs aren't even in the same positions as they once were.

, Due to the fact that all the planets are constantly changing their positions, these cycles in fact never actually repeat themselves, making each person an absolute individual. A single horoscope can therefore never capture the breadth of personality and destiny of any single person.

, For example:


The Sun is a star with a large mass. Extensive research undertaken on earthquakes and the positions of the planets has shown that they strongly affect the rate of earthquakes and that the Sun has no greater effect than any of the other planets.Depending on the Suns' relationship to the the other planets, the nature of the influences can in fact be the exact opposite of what is traditionally stated in sun-sign astrology.
Due to the fact that the characteristics of the sun-sign can be the same as the traditional characteristics, the opposite, or somewhere in between, there can be no sound statistical method that would work just based on the traditional characteristics of the sign.

, You can help to convince yourself of this by trying the following:


Check your horoscope (hopefully for the last time).
Look at what your horoscope says. Then look at a different sign's horoscope. Can they both be applied to you? Then try looking at all the different signs. See how general they are? At least a few can be applied to anyone, including yourself, which proves that they are not specialized in any way whatsoever.
If you find yourself thinking that you need to change to fit a horoscope, you have a clear answer that it's not accurate. It is also not the slightest bit unusual to find yourself thinking that some of the horoscope applies to you, while a lot of it doesn't. Seize that moment and realize it for what it is––your mind is telling you that the fit is wrong because no single horoscope can discern who you are. Unfortunately, many people choose to ignore the bits that don't fit and exaggerate the value of the parts that do, hence giving meaning to something that simply hasn't earned it.

, Do their personalities really match the personalities that the horoscope claims them to have? Do the people born in the same month as you act exactly like you? You will see that this is not the case - everyone has some stronger personality traits, but they don't necessarily correspond to what a ""Leo"" or ""Taurus"" is said to have. If a person chooses to manipulate their personality towards that trait, that's a choice, not a foregone conclusion.


You can test this. Read the types behind signs that are not those of your friends. Do this with an open mind. How many of the things said seem applicable to a friend? It's likely that you'll find many things seem like your friend in the other signs too, precisely because horoscope writing uses generalizations that can apply to all people in some way. It is simply the human desire to fit the pieces according to what we prefer (confirmation bias) that causes us to believe one set of grouped traits is more applicable than another.
One of the dilemmas that horoscopes have always had is in the case of twins. Twins seldom have the same fortune and many have different styles and personality. If horoscopes were real, they'd act exactly the same and have the same love life and fortune. This is simply not true!

, Do they all have the same sign (that is compatible with yours?) Not likely. Horoscopes cannot predict people's personality, and in turn, cannot predict people's compatibility with each other. Chemistry is a lot more complicated than the month when you were born!

, People born of the same month do not have the same personality, and you don't always see sparks with people who have a compatible sign. You will not have good fortune on a certain day because a magazine tells you so. Those magazines are just there to be fun and sell to people willing to believe the generalizations and conditional hope they offer.


Even the more tailored horoscopes purchased online or through so-called horoscope ""experts"" are generalized. The people generating these horoscopes are good at reading people and generalizing about the types of personality traits that apply widely across a population. And within the space of week, every person is likely to have at least one good and one bad thing happen; it is very easy to fit the things that did occur to you into the sweeping statements that suggest such things will happen; in actual fact, it is you who have done the work of matching what has happened to you to the possibilities outlined in the horoscope. There is nothing quite so powerful as self conviction.
Horoscopes are just opinions, like the majority of things human beings offer one another in life. Consider seriously just why planets and stars and the Sun would be intimately involved in your daily affairs. They are mass bodies doing what they are physically capable of, and that certainly does not include steering the events of human lives!

, Hopefully you have been convinced that horoscopes are not accurate. It will help if you just stop looking at them, and live your life on your own terms. Have fun, and don't worry about what a magazine column says!

Proceed to the Ka'bah, reciting Talbiyyah.,
Perform Tawwaf circumambulation around the Ka'bah.,
Offer praise to God while performing Tawwaf.,
Make the Say'ee walk between Mounts Safa and Marwa.,
Have your hair shaved or trimmed and leave the state of Ihram.,
If performing Hajj, do not have your hair cut.",How to Perform Umrah2," Once they have assumed Ihram at one of the miqat, pilgrims proceed to the Ka'bah, the holiest site in all of Islam. Until they reach the Ka'bah and begin to perform the rituals of Tawwaf, pilgrims are encouraged to repeat the Talbiyyah to themselves continuously (or as often as possible when it is reasonable to do so.) Pilgrims may also offer their own unique, special prayers to God or recite portions of the Qur'an — the precise words you offer aren't as important as maintaining a solemn, humble, devoted mindset.

, At the Ka'bah, pilgrims complete the Tawwaf — the act of walking around the Ka'bah seven times in a counterclockwise direction. Each ""circuit"" starts and ends when the Black Stone is on the pilgrim's right (there is a brown marble line marking this starting point.) The pilgrim recites a short prayer to express the intention to complete Tawwaf before beginning. This prayer is:


""In the name of Allah, Allah is the Greatest. O Allah! Having faith in you, confirming the truthfulness of Your Holy Book, fulfilling Your promise and following the Sunnah of Your Prophet (peace be upon him)"".
After this intention prayer, the pilgrim begins to walk. The first three circuits should be completed quickly; the next four slowly. While completing the seven circuits, the pilgrim is encouraged to touch and kiss the Black Stone each circuit if possible (if it is too crowded to kiss, it is appropriate to kiss the fingers and touch the stone.)
Men should expose their right shoulder (and only their shoulder) by tucking their robes under their right armpit., The Tawwaf is a very special experience during which Muslims have a greater opportunity to express their devotion to God than during their ordinary life. While completing the Tawwaf, one's thoughts should be pure and focused on God. Many pilgrims choose also to offer oral praise as they walk. The most common recitations used for this are:



Labbayka Allaahumma Labbayk. Labbayka Laa Shareeka Laka Labbayk.



""My God, I have responded to You. I have responded to You, and I proclaim that there is no other god besides You; I have responded to You""





Innal Hamda, Wan Ne'mata. Lakawal Mulk. La Shareeka Lak



""For You alone is All The Praise and All The Bounty, and for You alone is The Sovereignty. You have no partners.""





, After the Tawwaf, the pilgrim completes another special Umrah ritual called the Say'ee. The Say'ee involves walking back and forth between two small mountains called Safa and Marwah. Starting from Safa, pilgrims complete seven circuits, making a total of four stops at each mountain. At each stop, the pilgrim recites the following short prayer:Allahu Akbar! (repeated three times) Laa ilaaha illa Allah wahdahu laa shareeka lah. Lahul-Mulku walahul- Hamdu wa huwa 'alaa kulli shay'in Qadeer. Laa ilaaha illa Allahu wahdahu, Shadaqa Wa'adahu, wa nasara 'abadahu wa hazamal-Ahzaaba wahdah!

There is no god but Allah. He is One and has no partner, to Him is the dominion and all praise is due to Him. We are returning, repenting, worshipping, prostrating, and to Allah we are very grateful. Allah is true to His promise, He gave victory to His servant and defeated the confederates all by Himself.
Other desirable (but not required) behaviors for the Say'ee include walking at a fast pace between the two green signs on the side of the path, making small prayers or reading the Qur'an, abstaining from talking to others, and reflecting on the Day of Judgement.

, After the seventh circuit of Say'ee, the major events of the pilgrimage are over. At this point, the pilgrims at Marwa have their hair shaved or cut as a sign of their symbolic ""renewed"" or ""rejuvenated"" state. Men are strongly encouraged to have their heads shaved. Trimming the hair is permitted, but shaving the head entirely is preferable. Women only have their hair trimmed.


After this hair-trimming, the Umrah is over and pilgrims are released from the state of Ihram. They may revert to their normal clothes and assume their normal behavior, though they should maintain a devout, humble mindset as long as they are in Mecca.

, While Umrah can be performed by itself, the rituals of Umrah also make up the first part of the longer Hajj pilgrimage. If Umrah is being performed as part of the Hajj, pilgrims typically skip the hair-cutting ritual described above and do not leave the state of Ihram (this may differ depending on the type of Hajj the pilgrim is completing — there are three different varieties of Hajj.) If they do cut their hair, they must re-enter Ihram before starting the rest of the Hajj rituals.


The details of the Hajj rituals themselves are beyond the scope of this article. See our article on the Hajj for relevant information.

"
"
Book travel arrangements to Saudi Arabia well in advance.,
Obtain a Umrah/Hajj visa from the Saudi government.,
Consider attending Umrah/Hajj seminars in your community.,
Prepare for the Arabian climate.,
Know what to pack.,
Know which cultural differences to expect as a foreigner.,
Be aware of the unique challenges women may face.",How to Perform Umrah3," Traveling to Mecca can be an ordeal, especially during the yearly Hajj, when pilgrims from all over the world flock to the holy city in huge numbers. To ensure you're able to make it to Mecca without difficulty (and get the best fare), book your travel arrangements as early as you can. This also allows you to have some flexibility — if, for some reason, you can't make your original Umrah dates, you may still have time to make arrangements for another date.


To avoid the hassle of making travel arrangements to Mecca, many Muslims use the services of special Hajj and Umrah travel agencies. For a fee, these agencies will handle the process of buying tickets and scheduling flights for you.
While you are booking your Umrah arrangements, you may also want to make arrangements to complete other religious duties while you are near many of Islam's holiest sites. For instance, Medina, the second-holiest city in Islam, which contains many holy sites, shrines, and mosques, is only about four hours from Mecca by car.

, If you don't have Saudi Arabian citizenship, making the Umrah or Hajj requires a valid Umrah or Hajj visa. These visas are issued by the Saudi government for free, but require a valid passport, up-to-date vaccinations, and a completed application authorized by a licensed travel agency. For the official application form and a list of licensed Umrah travel agencies in the US, visit the official website of the Saudi Embassy at Saudiembassy.net.Note that Umrah visas are valid for 15 days — pilgrims must not stay in the country any longer than this., The Umrah and Hajj pilgrimages are major life events for most Muslims. Luckily, they're almost never ones that must be undertaken alone. Ummahs (Muslim communities) around the world generally offer some sorts of informational events or seminars for those wishing to make their pilgrimage in the future — this will vary from community to community, so talk to a local imam if you are unsure what options are available in your community.


Note that many Muslim communities and Hajj/Umrah travel agencies will also organize pilgrimage groups so that pilgrims can travel to the holy city with people from their community that they know. For many, especially those who are uncomfortable traveling to a foreign country alone or only with one's family, this is a very preferable option.

, Except for small outlying parts of the country, Saudi Arabia is a very hot, arid desert. Average summer temperatures are about 45o C (113o F), though highs of up to 54o C (129o F) are not unusual. In the spring and fall, temperatures are more moderate, but still quite hot, while in the winter, low humidity and high windchill factors can make the weather surprisingly chilly.In short, the Arabian climate can be very unforgiving, so be absolutely sure to bring proper clothing and accessories.


In the hot months of the year, lightweight clothing that minimizes the amount of exposed skin is essential. Loose, flowing garments that cover the skin but allow air to reach it are best — take inspiration from traditional Saudi garb like the Thoub. In cooler months, more conventional clothing may be worn. Be sure to bring a parasol or umbrella as head coverings are forbidden during Umrah.
Keep in mind that, in the dessert, the temperature can plummet with nightfall, so it's a good idea to have a few sweaters or other types of warm clothes with you to be safe even during the summer.
High-SPF sunscreen is a must to prevent serious sunburns and skin damage, especially if you're fair-skinned. Most skin cancer resources also recommend SPF 15+ sunscreen even for dark-skinned people., In addition to your clothing, there are many other essentials that are best not to forget for pilgrimage. While some may be available from vendors in Saudi Arabia, there's no guarantee. Below is a brief list of must-have items:


Your Umrah visa — without this, you can't enter the country.
Valid passport and identification
Basic toiletries
Over-the-counter medicines
Small bag for keeping track of shoes when entering a mosque
Ihram robes (for men)
Prayer mat/Qur'an
Umbrella
Scissors, razors, and nail clippers (for pre-Ihram grooming)
Lots of bottled water (can be purchased in Saudi Arabia)

, Though Saudi Arabia is a modern country by most standards, there are many significant cultural differences between Saudi Arabian life and Western life. As a general rule, Saudi Arabia is a much more religiously conservative country than most Westerners will be used to. To avoid a faux pas (or more serious problems), it's important to understand these differences before arriving. Below are just a few major cultural differences to expect:Saudi businesses halt operations five times per day for the five daily prayers mandated in Islam.
During the holy month of Ramadan, the pace of daily life slows down significantly and the entire Muslim population practices daytime fasting. It is discouraged to eat food in public.
Pointing the soles of the feet at someone is considered a sign of disrespect.
The right hand should be used for shaking hands and giving things to people.
Saudi men are comfortable standing very close to each other — usually, their idea of ""personal space"" is much smaller than a Westerner's.
It is considered rude to completely refuse refreshments like food, coffee, tea, etc. — as a courtesy, it is best to accept at least a small amount.
Saudi men should not be complimented on their material wealth or possessions.

Most importantly, contact between men and women can be very limited, even in religious/business settings. See below.

, As noted above, women in Saudi Arabia have a very different life than those in Western countries. A Western woman arriving for the first time in Saudi Arabia will probably have to ""cover up"" much more than she is used to and to restrict her interactions with males in public. Women (even foreigners) are expected to wear conservative, loose fitting attire that, at bare minimum, covers their collarbones, elbows, and knees. In public, more conservative coverings like an abaya cloak may be required. Women usually do not usually meet with men without male accompaniment.


Note that women who are menstruating are not allowed to perform the Tawwaf (though they may take part in the other aspects of the Umrah).For this reason, many Muslim women schedule their Umrah for a time when they don't expect to menstruate or use a medical solution (like birth control pills) to change their menstrual schedule.

Ditch the order.,
Be true to yourself.,
Sit by the water.,
Don't let the negative sides of being Piscean take over.,
Meditate.",How to Get in Touch with Your Inner Pisces," If you have a job or calling in life that requires a lot of order for you, it can be stifling. You need to whip up a little chaos. Start with a messy desk or brighter clothes. Perhaps this will surprise others but you must let the real you shine through.;
, If you are in the right job or field, you'll know it. If you are in daily pain and sadness, it may be due to working in the wrong field. Pisceans are best in the arts, fashion or music. See what you can do to gravitate this way.

, Water is the soul of your sign. Your feelings will be much easier to sort through near water and working out your true calling in life should always be done in the presence of water. Water calms, revives and fulfills Pisceans, so be sure to include it in your life somehow, even if it is just a living room fountain.

, Pisceans have a tendency to be unable to know where you end and others begin. Stop letting yourself in for so much pain. It is fine to be empathetic but don't live in other people's shoes. Also quit acting the victim time and again; blaming others for your chaos is not only dishonest but is a poor reflection on the true Piscean nature which thrives on chaos better than others. Turn the negative into a good result by showing others how chaos can benefit creativity.

, Meditation is a pure form of inner connection and peace creation for Pisceans. Do not dismiss its benefits for your holistic health.

, Leo is a sign that likes to work to the full and to do a good job. Work with intensity and determination to get the job done.

, Leos also like to relax to the full. This makes sense as a Leo does nothing by half measures.

, Leos seek the affirmation from others that their deeds are worthy and that their intent is always good. Demonstrate to others that you are noble by always keeping your word, being timely, doing what you say that you will do and never gossiping or rumor-mongering.

, Leos are very loyal to their friends, family, and community. Leos have a very expansive view of who counts in their world and are very capable of embracing every person in their lives as a person to whom they owe loyalty. In turn, Leos always expect loyalty back and do not be surprised if you lose faith in a person unable to give you this.

, Leos are idealistic by nature and coupled with leadership, this is how things happen.

, Leos live it up and are the life of the party. Get out there and inject your warmth, humor, and entertaining anecdotes into the crowd to get it pumping!

For this reason, they will jump to fulfill another person's desire if it is possible for them.;
, Aquarians' belief in causes runs deep and your heart and soul need a cause to keep you whole.

, A star sign that values friendship intensely, keep your friends close to you. Aquarians are strictly loyal, they hate betrayal and are not double-minded themselves. If you do leave a friend, keep a plausible purpose for it because inability of finding a good reason is not an Aquarian's trait.

, Aquarians can be loners at times because they are ahead of the times.

, But don't rely too much on the traditional interpretations of the cluster types.

, Just relying on the four elements' signs can be misleading so don't rely on this too heavily. But the modes are more accurate. Cardinal means initiative. Fixed signs mean stubbornness and rigidity, and passion. Mutable signs often indicate flexibility and a good mind.

, Start always with the ASC or Ascendant. Then the Sun in Sign, Sun in House, Sun's Aspects, the Moon, and so on.

, For example, a Moon in Taurus will have something to say about that person's basic character, family relations (the mother especially), emotional needs, talents and health.


For each Subject Heading, insert the relevant keywords from that placement. In the case of a Taurus Moon, keywords and phrases such as ""emotional stability"" for Basic Personality, ""loyalty"" and ""constancy"" for Relationships, ""fertility"" and ""good singing voice"" in Health and Leisure, etc.

,, For example, ""quick temper"" and ""self-centeredness"" may be suggested by a Sun in Aries, a Sun Square Mars, a Stellium in Aries or Leo, and a Sun Conjunct Midheaven (MC). When this happens, you can be sure you have found a dominant trait in your subject's psyche.


On the other hand, if a trait is suggested only once, it may not be that strong unless it is a very close aspect or the planet involved is strong (personalized, ruling, dignified, etc.). Do not stress a trait too much if you are not sure it is that influential.

, Then think of the qualities of that planet, sign or house. Consider this when writing your interpretation.

Enhance your loyalty.",How to Get in Touch With Your Inner Scorpio," Scorpios are not happy being told what to do by others and can easily curl up and die under such a regime. They'll cope but they won't thrive and eventually, they'll explode, which isn't good for anyone. Hence, plan where you want to go and try to work or live for yourself or at least get great autonomy in all that you do.;
, Scorpios are good leaders but poor managers, meaning that they are able to provide the inspiration, the guidance, and lead the way, but they expect others to do the work and put in the effort as much as them and dislike taking the time to go over details that they expect others to know. Scorpios despise incompetency in others, which is something that a leader Scorpio should be careful not to show but should shift such a person to somewhere that they're better suited.

, Scorpios are known for restorative powers and incredible regeneration capacity. They can reinvent the wheel even after having been crushed by it. Use this spirit to get you back on the track after losing your way, and keep strong in your self belief. Draw on your stubbornness to win through.

, A Scorpio is only truly happy when they are living their passion; when others tell you that few get this chance, ignore them and strive for what makes you happy.

, A good Scorpio knows how to get out of a scrape with very little to hand. This trait is always worth cultivating.

, Scorpios are deeply loyal, to the point of not caring for large amounts of friends, preferring instead to have a smaller group of deeply trusted and intimate friendships. Cultivate this intimacy and loyalty and you will lead a happy life.

Know the history of the movement.,
Read up.,
Understand the basic precepts of existentialism.,
Remember that existentialism is not the same as nihilism.,
Be authentic.,
Create.,
Ponder.,
Avoid organized religion or other groups that tell you how to live.,
Live and let live.,
Recognize the repercussions of your actions.",How to Be an Existentialist," Existentialism is a philosophical movement grounded in a particular historical context, and transferring its tenets to today's cultural moment means understanding what it meant when it developed.


It developed and flourished in Europe during the 1940s and 1950s, in a post-war context in which many people felt disillusioned with organized religion and society and felt like life had no real meaning or purpose.;
, Like all branches of philosophy, existentialism developed through the writings of prominent philosophers. Start by reading works of Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Albert Camus.Check out http://faculty.risd.edu/dkeefer/pod/wall.pdf for a free PDF of Jean-Paul Sartre's short story The Wall, which contains the themes of his philosophy.
While de Beauvoir wrote many works that are considered essential reading, The Second Sex is a great place to start. It is a critical look at society's gender roles, and garnered de Beauvoir a reputation as a founder of the feminist movement.Try Albert Camus' The Stranger, available for purchase on Amazon.

, As a philosophy, existentialism is based on a major premise and several minor premises:


The major premise of existentialism is that the meaning of existence and the nature of humanity cannot be truly understood through natural sciences (like biology and psychology) or by moral categories (found in religion and social codes) alone. Instead, meaning is found in authenticity.Existentialists believe there is no larger meaning or order to the universe or to our lives; that is, there is no destiny or fate, and your individual life has no pre-determined purpose.
Still, people have complete free will and can make choices about their daily actions in order to make those actions meaningful and ordered despite the lack of meaning and order in the universe. Thus, life gains meaning by individuals ascribing meaning through authentic lives.

, Nihilism states there is no purpose to life and there never can be whereas existentialism says you make your own.


While many existentialist writings have themes of anxiety, hopelessness, and boredom, it is not because the writers did not see a purpose in life. It is because they were overwhelmed with the challenge of creating meaning in a world where meaning is not inherent, as well as frustrated with academic systems that ascribed purpose where, to their minds, it did not exist., Existentialism is all about being who you are outside of social norms, culture, religion, or other ideas of what you should be. Its about recognizing that you have the freedom to choose who you want to be and only you can make that choice.


Of course, the problem with authenticity is knowing when you've actually achieved who you really are outside of society's expectations, versus when you are simply doing what you think looks or appears authentic to others-- which is exactly the opposite of what you should be trying for.When you make a choice about your self presentation or actions, ask, ""Is this what I really want, or am I doing this because it will please someone else?"" For instance, when you get dressed in the morning, are you choosing what you like, or what you think others will find sexy or cool?

, Find a passion and go after it, whether it be art like existential painter Jackson Pollock, writing like existential author Fyodor Dostoevsky, or philosophical inquiry.Being an existentialist means that you recognize the value in self-expression, so find a way to let your inner self be expressed on the outside.

, Existentialism is a habit of the mind, and involves considering questions about how individuals must live.


Existentialists ponder questions about the meaning of life and death, whether or not there is a God and whether deity is involved in individual lives (nearly all existentialist philosophers believe there is no God, since there is no meaning or order), the meaning of friendship and love, and other questions that have to do with the individual.Existentialists are less worried about social or political issues like what the role of the state should be., Existentialist philosophy holds that each person must create their own meaning, and in order for it to be authentic, it has to be something that you arrive at on your own rather than being told by someone else.


Existentialists also tend to believe there is no God, but some like Kierkegaard or Dostoevsky believed both in God and in free will and self-determination. The important thing is the freedom to choose what to believe., A major application of existential philosophy is recognizing the inherent value in choice and self-identity, and allowing others to live authentic lives as well.


Do not impose your moral or philosophical code on others. Let them live their own authentic lives, rather than trying to shape them into what you want them to be. Rather paradoxically, this means if they don't want to be existentialists, its not up to you to convince them!

, One reason that the philosophy is often associated with anxiety and hopelessness is because existentialist philosophers recognize that their actions have consequences and are not meaningless.Even though a person may have good intentions, he also always acts on limited knowledge and with limited truth, which means his actions are always imperfect. Because others see the actions, they influence others' perception of truth, which has a ripple effect of potentially devastating consequences."

Listen to people and engage with what they are saying, even if it's just small talk.,
Ask questions.,
Define outer beauty.,
Care about people.,
Do things for causes and the community without looking for rewards.,

Be generous and extend hospitality.",How to Appreciate Inner Beauty," Don't try to be someone you're not. You are you, and that is one of the many things that makes you beautiful. If you are unable to appreciate your own inner beauty, you will have a hard time appreciating it in others.;
, That saying, 'eyes are the windows to the soul,'-- it's true. When you look into people's eyes, you see vulnerability, passion, kindness, and genuine feelings and be more aware of these things in yourself, as well.

, People have unique, special ways of being in and seeing the world that they reveal in how they speak about it. If you try to grasp how they see the world, what their unique perspective can tell you, you learn to appreciate them even more.

, These should be meaningful questions, about what people want out of life, what they value, how they got to where they are and be prepared to accept their answers without judgment. Try to understand what they care about, what drives them.

, Recognize that outer beauty is so much larger than what the media spoon feeds us, and that healthiness & happiness-- things that do show on the outside-- are more beautiful, more accessible, and more special than most the flashy kinds of beauty we're surrounded by.

, Invest in their well-being and put the needs of others first. Root for them, give them thoughtful advice, think about how you can make their day better. You'll feel more connected and all the more appreciative of their beauty, simply by being a friend.

, Many of the most internally beautiful people have something in common: they have given back to the community in some form or fashion, whether through representing an organization, leading a book drive, running a marathon for a good cause, or raising money for the disadvantaged. Do whatever you can to give back to the community, even if you won't get anything in return.

, Try to overcome prejudice and stereotyping by giving others the benefit of the doubt.

, Showing love toward others in practical ways will help you make friends and maintain good relationships.

Try to avoid joining groups of supposedly like-minded others.,
Ditch the 24/7 cable/satellite news cycle.,
Evaluate why you do certain things.,
Become open minded, and question everything.,
Be wary of authoritarianism.,
Learn basic logic.,
Try to enjoy being free-thinking.",How to Be a Free Thinker," Often, you will not share the positions of another group of individuals exactly. Look cautiously when becoming a member of any group that encourages you to dress, act, or believe in certain things. This is often the first step in losing your individuality.;
, The current news environment is a busy box that seamlessly merges political commentary, worthless entertainment, and actual journalism. Sometimes it would appear that almost all networks either have a problem with bias (left and right) or with slanted commentary. For these reasons, it is much better to receive whatever information that you want from unbiased books (those not written by pundits). If you need to know something about a subject, research it online (not from blogs, however.) If you can, it may be best to stop watching TV altogether, and start getting whatever entertainment that you want from online sources.

, Are you someone who is a ""people pleaser?"" There is nothing wrong with attempting to be sociable, but you should not have to do anything that violates your best interest or moral code merely for others. If you dress, act, or make decisions in a certain way just for the sake of ""pleasing others,"" you may wish to re-evaluate.

, Do not mindlessly accept what others tell you to be true, but research it on your own. Keep in mind always that a creed which forces you to hate another person by default is foolish, and wishes to destroy a truly free-thinking spirit. The first step used by propagandists, politicians, and other influencers is distributing questionable or biased information. They assume that you will take their word for everything without any research. Being a questioning person does not mean that you cannot be religious; it is fine as long as you truly believe in what you claim, and you were not influenced by others to espouse your beliefs.

, The ideas of authoritarianism often favor power over reason. Lawful and morally instituted authority should be acknowledged, but some individuals want to abuse their power, and use their position as authority to justify their actions. This is not a good thing, because true authoritarians will attempt to tell you what to believe or encroach on your rights. There are some things that no one, not even authority, have the right to do to you.

, Many common logical fallacies are helpful to learn so you can recognize when they are being used in an attempt to influence you. For example, take this comment: ""Senator A just has to be wrong about this economic plan. I heard that 20 years ago, he was an alcoholic."" As you can see, the discussion mysteriously shifted from talking about the economy to talking about Senator A's past. This logical fallacy is called an Ad Hominem Attack. The above speaker was not criticizing Senator A's plan, but bringing up an old problem that the senator had with alcohol, in an attempt to damage his reputation. How do we know that Senator A has not reformed? There are numerous other fallacies like this one, and you should learn about a good deal of them to protect yourself from those who use them.

, Do not ""lecture"" others that you see who are not like you, because many people are not free-thinkers. Educate them whenever possible, however, about how it is good to have individuality.

Understand what it means to be free.,
Pursue your passions.,
Let go of whatever is holding you back.,
Let go of whatever you’re rebelling against without a higher purpose.,
Live in the moment.,
Keep your ego in check.,
Honor other people’s freedom.",How to Be a Free Spirit," Society likes to serve us up a very narrow interpretation of what constitutes a “free-spirit.” Images that immediately come to mind are the globetrotting bohemian, the manic pixie dream girl, the free-wheeling artist, the minimalist philosopher, or the co-op-inhabiting environmentalist. Maybe your vision of free-spiritedness was defined in high school by that tattooed, trilingual, punked-out guy who never failed to remind people of how many countries he’d been to when, really, it was the quiet, dorky girl who spent every lunch break in the library who couldn't care less what you thought about her. Instead of falling into the trap of molding yourself to some predefined role, live your life as a free agent and don’t be afraid to contradict yourself. If this means you wear hemp one day and leather the next, hang out with hipsters, clubbers, and LARPers, or put both Tom Waits and Kesha on your workout mix, all the more power to you.;
, Being free-spirited means having the courage to not only follow your dreams, but also take the time to figure out what they really are – which is arguably much more difficult. Maybe you’ve given up on getting that master’s in Native American studies because you’re afraid it isn’t practical. Maybe you play a wicked diddley bow but don’t think you’ll ever meet the right folk fusion band. Maybe you’ve been raised by former hippies who have never understood your burning desire to go into real estate. Take the time to unearth a secret passion that maybe you didn’t even know you had – and then take the plunge.

, This entails a lot more than thinking about all the ways that The Man is keeping you down. If a bad experience has left your faith in people broken, rebuild your strength until you’re able to get close to people again. If a strict upbringing has left you with little sense of who you are, work on stripping away these artificial layers to find what’s underneath. And of course, don’t forget to think about the ways that you hold yourself back. Maybe you have a tendency to play the victim and revel in your own misfortunes. Maybe you’re a hopeless romantic who keeps making the same relationship mistake over and over. Maybe you’re afraid of asking for help because everyone expects you to be strong all the time. Only when you’re brutally honest about the barriers in front of you can you find solutions for moving past them.

, If your sole motive is to react against a system, whether it be political, religious, social, parental, communal, environmental, or anything else that might rub you the wrong way, you are still allowing that system to dictate your behavior. Disliking something simply because it’s conventional is just as mindless as liking it for that same reason. On the other hand, rebel if there is a higher purpose, a higher ideal. We are born to make a better world, not to leave it intact.

, It’s easy to spend so much time in your own head that you never actually connect with the things around you. Maybe you’re playing out fantasies, arguments, or zombie apocalypse scenarios in your head when you’re supposed to be having a conversation. Maybe you’re trying so hard to imagine how you look to the people walking past you on the street that you don’t even notice what a gloriously sunny day it is. Engage with the people, places, and things around you on a deeper level and you’ll find that your reactions to them will suddenly become a lot more authentic.

, There’s no denying that people who do their own thing (or do a good job faking it) have a magnetic effect on those around them. This, of course, is a slippery slope. If you have success in your adventure in being a free spirit, resist the temptation to self-congratulate, lord it over those you perceive to be “conventional,” or keep the people you attract on a leash with your charming unpredictability. Remember, you want to be a free spirit, meaning your thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors should be coming from a deep place within you. Ego is the death of authenticity; once you become more interested in impressing than being, everything you’ve been working toward will disappear.

, Free-spiritedness isn’t about promising one thing and doing another, getting whatever you want without paying your dues, showing up to every date a half hour late, or leaving a trail of broken hearts behind you. Remember that your freedom ends where everyone else’s begins.

Make a list of your strong and weak academic subjects.,
Fill any gaps in your knowledge.,
Read several newspapers to stay aware of current events.,
Look up lists of new and old books you should read.,
Get familiar with opposing points of view.,
Study a map of the world to think globally.,
Learn a new language.",How to Be a Renaissance Person1," To be a Renaissance person, you should have a little bit of knowledge about pretty much every academic subject. This includes math, world history, science (physics, biology, and chemistry), reading, and writing. Figure out which spots you’re already strong in, and then focus on building up the other ones.;
, Find some introductory textbooks for those subjects where you need some help. Check your library or go to the bookstore and see what they’ve got in stock. You can also order books online.Public schools in your area might also have textbooks they’d be willing to lend you over the summer.

, Renaissance people don’t just bury themselves in old textbooks, they’re aware of what’s going on in the world around them! Read lots of well-respected newspapers to keep aware of new and important developments happening around the world.Reading newspapers is also a great way to stay informed of new discoveries in science, history, and math.
For English-speaking newspapers in the United States, try the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Look at the Guardian for a paper based in the United Kingdom.
If it’s in your budget to subscribe to a daily paper, do so. If not, you can usually read several articles from popular newspapers based in the United States and elsewhere for free each month.

, Reading teaches you new words and makes you think about the world in new and different ways. Don’t just stick to the classics, however. Go online to find suggestions of great books written both recently and a long (sometimes long, long) time ago.Goodreads.com and Amazon both provide suggestion lists of books that you should read before you die. The New York Times Book Review also releases yearly “best book” picks that can keep you updated on the good new releases.

, Renaissance people are well rounded and can think about issues from lots of different sides. If there’s a hot-button debate going on in your town, state, or country, take the time to read up on both sides. Wait until you have as much information as possible before deciding on your own position.This might require you to read sources produced by different news outlets, politicians, or experts.
For example, to get a good picture of the debate about climate change, you can look at what different politicians around the world are saying and doing about the issue. Be sure to look at people from different parties. Run a Google search to find easy-to-read scientific studies. Finally, check out coverage from news outlets with different political leanings (such as Fox News and MSNBC in the U.S.).

, If the only country you can point out on a map is your own, spend some time learning world geography. This knowledge will help you better understand global history, as well as current political conflicts and environmental concerns.It’s also a good idea to know the capitals and major cities of countries around the world.

, Learn to communicate with people outside the country where you were born. Renaissance people are travelers and explorers (even if they can’t afford to actually visit other countries).If you speak another language, read a newspaper or listen to the news in that language! It’s a great way to build your skill and expose yourself to another perspective.

Decide if you want to be a free spirit.,
Be prepared to be unique.A free spirit is a non-conformist, who isn’t afraid to think for his or herself, and who follows his or her passions.,
Get in touch with your creative side.,
Give yourself time to be spontaneous.Strange as it may sound, you may need to give yourself time to be spontaneous.,
Open your mind to spontaneity.A spontaneous and free spirit will look at the world with a child’s eyes, thinking about how much one doesn’t know, exploring whatever seems interesting, and always asking “why?” and “how?” Give yourself the chance to open up and try new things before making judgments about them.

,
Take advantage of opportunities to be spontaneous.,
Let it go.A free spirit is not tied to many things beyond his or her ideals, and people he or she cares about.,
Consider downsizing your home or moving.A home that is larger or more complex than you need, filled with more material things than you need, costs too much, or is in a location you don’t want to be in can keep you from being a free spirit.,
Be less materialistic.No one can get through life without some material things.,
Decide what to get rid of.Decluttering your life is one of the first steps you can take toward becoming a more free spirited person.,
Try some breathing exercises.,
Practice mindfulness.Mindfulness is a practice that helps people become more aware of their thoughts and feelings, and of how they relate to the world around them in the present moment.,
Try yoga.,
Let go of mental hang-ups.",How to Be a Free Spirited Person," Before beginning a more free-spirited life, ask yourself a few important questions, including:Is it important for you to always be on a set schedule, or on time for events? Free-spirited individuals are likely to have more flexible schedules.
Do you like to plan ahead or be spontaneous? A major aspect of being free spirited is learning to “go with the flow”: accepting things as they come, rather than deciding everything ahead of time.
How organized are you? A free-spirited lifestyle will probably mean a less organized life and/or living space. In its place, however, comes the opportunity for excitement and spontaneity.
How practical and grounded are you? A free spirit can be just as successful as anyone else, but cultivates imagination, daydreaming, and idealism along the way.;
, This can be liberating, but it also takes courage.


Think of the books, ideas, people, etc. that you find fascinating or inspiring. You don’t have to think or do things exactly like these models, but think of them as ways for encouraging you to find your own path.

, A free spirit isn’t afraid to be original and imaginative. This doesn’t mean that every free spirit has to be a great artist or inventor, just that he or she is able to be expressive, whether through clothing, decorating, speaking, cooking, or any other activity.

, This is especially true if you have a busy life or are just learning how to be a free-spirited person.


If you are having difficulty being spontaneous at first, schedule a few minutes per day, or per week, in which you have nothing planned. Do whatever comes to mind, or nothing at all.
Stop to chat with strangers, friends, or coworkers, even if you feel busy. You will enjoy the company, and taking a detour in your day.
Be wary of time traps. Some activities, like endlessly surfing television channels you don’t really want to watch, or getting lost in a smartphone, can eat up lots of time that could be spent being spontaneous.
Don’t plan every day. Sometimes we want to do this so that we aren’t bored. But if you leave time open, you can discover new things. Try leaving an unplanned weekend, for starters, and use the time to get out of the house and do something you’ve never done before.

,, There are many ways to learn and experience new things. A free spirit will seek out these opportunities:Travel to a place you’ve never been before.
Try a new type of cuisine.
Get up and dance, right now, whether or not there’s any music.
Do a routine activity in a different way. Take a different way home for instance, or have your morning coffee on a walk rather than sitting at your breakfast table or in your car.
Offer free hugs.
Strike up a conversation with a stranger when you’re standing in line at a store—you never know what you might learn, or who you might meet.
Take up a new hobby or try to learn a new skill, and don’t be afraid of failing, or of what others will think.

, Part of being a free spirited person is learning to let some things go in life before they hold you back or weigh you down.


As a free spirit, you can certainly still worry about and fight for things that matter. If something seems to be holding you back rather than helping you achieve your dreams, however, it might be time to let it go.

, You could move into a different or smaller home that is more manageable for your free-spirited lifestyle, such as a tiny house.

, However, too many things can weigh you down if you are trying to be a free spirit. Try these techniques:


Buying fewer things will decrease clutter and simplify your life. This will also free up finances for things that might matter more to you, such as traveling or spending time with friends.
Buy less, but of better things. Having quality things but fewer things overall can help you be less materialistic. Higher-quality clothes, for instance, will last longer than lower-quality ones, and you will need to have fewer of them.
Keep in mind that reducing is good for the environment.Consuming less means less production, less waste, less pollutants, etc.

, When choosing how to simplify things, consider the following:


Think about how often you use particular items. Many experts suggest that if you are trying to declutter, if you haven’t used an item in six months, you should consider getting rid of it.
Irreplaceable items of great sentimental value might be an exception.However, remember that memories are more important than things, and you might not need to keep everything. Photographs, for instance, can be scanned for safekeeping without taking up space, and then discarded.
Consider donating items you no longer need to a thrift store, community center, religious organization, or other worthwhile cause. That way, others in need can benefit from the items you can live without.

, Getting plenty of oxygen contributes to physical energy and mental alertness. This can give you an overall boost of positivity. Try one of these breathing exercises periodically:Sit up straight. Put one hand on your belly and the other on your chest. Inhale deeply through your nose. You should feel the hand on your belly raise, but the hand on your chest should not move. Breathe out slowly, with your mouth barely open. Use your hand on your belly to push air out, if you want. Repeat this exercise ten times.
Quickly inhale and exhale through your nose (about three breaths a second), keeping your mouth closed. Then breathe normally. Repeat this process for fifteen seconds or more.

, It is like a particular type of meditation that will leave you feeling more self-aware and positive. Since living in the present is key to being a free spirit, this technique can be very helpful.


Sit in a comfortable position, whether in a chair, cross-legged, or kneeling.
Begin to pay attention to your breathing. Your mind will eventually wander. When you catch your mind wandering, bring your attention back to your own breathing.
Don’t stop to dwell on or judge your thoughts.
Continue this process for a short time, such as five minutes if you are trying it for the first time. Repeat this practice frequently, at least once a day. As you begin to practice mindfulness mediation regularly, you can gradually increase the length of the sessions, if you desire.
Many people engage in mindfulness through prayer or meditation as part of a spiritual practice. A free spirit can absolutely willfully participate in these practices.

, Often characterized as mainly a physical exercise, yoga is very much part of a spiritual practice that can boost your mind as well. Practicing yoga regularly can contribute to a positive outlook. You can begin learning yoga with just some simple exercises.

, Everyone has things in life that can weigh them down, from having to deal with ignorant people to worrying about physical flaws. In developing a positive outlook on life, a free-spirited person will also learn to overcome as many of these hang-ups as possible.


Remember that flaws, including physical imperfections, are part of what makes each person unique.Be proud of what makes you unique, and don’t constantly worry about being the same as others.
Practice compassion. This includes being as forgiving to yourself as you would be to others.If you are able to accept others for who they are, extend the same compassion to yourself.
Practice tolerance. By being tolerant of other people, you will free your mind and emotions. Be ready to accept differences in other people, and always ask yourself how you would feel or think if you were in their place."
"
Commit to an exercise plan.,
Have a healthy, balanced diet.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Sleep for at least 8 hours each night.",How to Be a Renaissance Person2," Renaissance people spend time balancing the needs of their mind with those of their body. Stay healthy by exercising regularly. If you’ve never exercised before, now’s a great time to start! Try to exercise for at least 20-30 minutes each day. Make this workout hard enough to get your heart pumping.
Jogging is great exercise. Try going for a 20-minute jog three-four times per week, and taking a walk or hike on your off days.
You may want to join a gym. This membership gives you access to lots of classes, weight rooms, and machines that could motivate you to really commit to your plan.

, It’s not enough to exercise. If you want to keep up good health, it’s important to eat right. Use your diet to get all the essential nutrients you need, and try to limit the good-tasting (but not-so-good-for-you) sweets.Stick with lean meats such as chicken and fish. Go heavy on the fruits and veggies, and make sure you’re also eating food from each food group.
Make your own meals instead of eating out. This will help you control exactly what you’re eating. Try simple recipes like baked chicken and spinach salad.


, Drinking lots of water helps your body function better. It’ll keep you focused during the day. If you’re drinking water, you’re also probably avoiding unhealthy liquids like soda and sugar-filled energy drinks.Drink enough water so that you’re never thirsty, or about 8 glasses of water per day., Sleep keeps stress under control, and it’s critical for good health. If you don’t get enough sleep, you’re going to feel too tired to work out. You also won’t want to go grocery shopping or cook for yourself, which could lead to a few not-so-healthy meals.To get better sleep, avoid nicotine, caffeine, and heavy foods for the last few hours before you head to bed. You should also limit your daytime naps to about 20 or 30 minutes. Try to stick to the same sleep schedule each night."

Take stock of any creative abilities you have.,
Practice frequently if you’ve already got artistic skills.,
Learn new artistic skills.,
Go to museums, cultural centers, and shows.",How to Be a Renaissance Person3," If you’ve ever played an instrument or shown some talent for drawing, revisit those skills. Maybe you never stopped. Renaissance people spend time working on their creative sides, so get ready to develop any existing talent you’ve got., The only way to be good at music or art is to spend lots of time practicing. Look for free time in your schedule and fill those spots with practice sessions.You may be able to take 20 minutes during your lunch hour to practice. You can also practice after you’ve eaten dinner at night during the weekdays. Add a longer practice session on your off days. Try to practice at least 4-5 days per week, for about 20 minutes to an hour each day., If you’ve never sang a note or picked up a paintbrush, don’t despair! It’s never too late to start. Figure out what artistic skill (or skills!) most appeals to you and start learning.Gardening, cooking, writing, baking, photography, website design… the list of things that qualify as art goes on and on. Find your passion and have fun with it.Take an art or music class in school if you’re a student. If not (and it fits into your budget), sign up for one at a local community college. You can also find guided tutorials online or at bookstores for learning artistic crafts or musical instruments.
If you’re hoping to get into music, look for a community choir or band that accepts beginners. This is a great way to meet people and develop your creativity.

, Get inspired by what past artists have produced. Attend concerts and art shows to see what’s being put other there now by fellow artists. These events will teach you new things about the people and world around you.Observing other artists can also help you decide on your own style. You may start out by imitating something you like, and then you’ll slowly start to create your own special artwork.
Craft shows and local fairs are also great events for experiencing art and culture. These may even let you see the folksy side of art that you can’t get in all museums.

"
"
Read for at least 20 minutes a day.,
Schedule a few hours on your off day for exercise.,
Listen to podcasts or audiobooks when you’re on the move.,
Make art instead of vegging out in front of the TV.,
Use your off-days to explore and see new things.",How to Be a Renaissance Person4," If you’ve decided to be a Renaissance person, you’ve got a long reading list ahead of you. You don’t have to read everything in a day. Start small, and spend 20 minutes reading something different each day.You can alternate days to get through the various textbooks, novels, newspapers, etc. that you’re reading.
If you have time and you want to, read for longer! The more hours you dedicate to becoming a Renaissance person, the farther along you’ll get on your quest.

, Since you won’t necessarily have time to work out on days when you have a full school or workday, take advantage of down time. Plan to do your more intense workouts on those days.Even on busy days, 10-15 minutes of exercise is better than zero minutes.

, Travel time can be used for learning, too! Turn your commute into a classroom by picking audio content that interests you. This’ll help you start and end your workday on the right foot.Try NPR’s Politics Podcast for an in-depth review of the American political scene. The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe is a fun way to learn about science, and it promotes critical thinking. The Moth is also an interesting option for those interested in literature and storytelling., Since your artwork may feel like a hobby or something you do for fun, it could be harder to find time for this than for exercise or reading. Use the time you’d usually spend relaxing in front a mindless show or movie to relax productively., Renaissance people are curious and always looking for new ways to learn. Get out there and explore. When a new museum or restaurant opens up in your town, be the first through the doors."

Observe the simple things and consider all their attributes.,
Contemplate scenes like bustling cities, silent valleys, gushing rivers, etc.,
Know you are a very tiny thing and there is whole world in front of you to explore.,
Learn to love nature.Love is language that can be heard even when it's not spoken.",How to Appreciate Things Around You," Sometimes simple things possess great complexity. Here complexity means undefined beauty. We need to observe these things. Simple changes in life can produce great effect. Many tough problems have a simple solution but we spend time thinking and making them tougher. For example, what we can do with a needle, we can't do with a sword.;
, These are the things that were not there before and might not be there forever. So savour the beauty hidden in these things, which are vanishing with passing time. Before they vanish, observe and understand the language that they speak. A river can give you moment to enjoy. You can have trip friends around them, or can just have a silent night out remembering greatest moment of your life. You can throw stones and observe the waves or count the number of dips that stone made before finally sinking down.

, We are born alone and die alone. But still in life we meet many people just because the world is too vast. We can find different kind of people in a city. But to find the person of our king we need to explore the city, or even a small place. This world is full of varieties.

, Loving nature is of it's own kind. When we die our body resolves into the nature. Experiencing the beauties of mountain, forest, ocean, fauna opens your heart and let you become a human who can contribute to every species in making their life a success. We have the ability to understand such things, so nature has given us many beauties, by loving them we can return a small part of their contribution back. The sunrise, the sunset, the fountains, the showers, glaciers all are something that we could not have imagined. The creatures who always come out as a symbol for innocence. Who understand nothing except one language that's LOVE. And they are there making our life a bit special, adventurous, and awesome. We must pay gratitude to them.

Get help if you need it.",How to Make Life Worth Living," An important element of strengthening your relationships with friends and family is to establish your ability to listen to what they have to say. Active listening demonstrates the value you place on what people are saying as well as your understanding of the concept they are trying to convey.Listen careful to what people have to say to you and repeat parts of it back in your own words to demonstrate your understanding.
Demonstrating how much you care about what people have to say will strengthen the relationships you have together.;
, Strong friendships can make you happier and even increase your lifespan.In order to strengthen the friendships that you have, make a point to try to be the type of friend you would like to have.


Don’t set too many rules or establish too many expectations for your friendships; instead let them progress organically and without pressure.
Take your friends feelings into account when making decisions that affect them and let them know that you think about them.

, While friendship can have valuable benefits in regard to health and mental well-being, the wrong kinds of relationships can have a negative effect on your ability to enjoy your life.Phase out people who introduce stress or negative feelings out of your life and choose to associate with those who have a positive effect on your emotions instead.
Learn how to recognize an abusive relationship and end it safely.
Focus on cultivating relationships with people that make you feel good about yourself instead of those that make you feel bad.

, It can be difficult to be happy for others if you feel as though you are in competition with them in some way. Allow yourself to celebrate the successes and achievements of your friends and family.The successes of your friends are important and worthy of celebrating.
Admire the talents of your friends openly. It will strengthen your relationships and they may reciprocate by pointing out your own strengths that you may not have been aware of.

, Your friends may not find the same things in their lives to be important as you do. This does not have to create distance between you; instead try to appreciate the different perspectives you can gain through your friends with differing viewpoints.Avoid making generalizations about people and instead try to get to know them. You may find those with little in common with you have much to offer in terms of friendship.
Try not to judge your friends over the things they feel differently about than you. Instead, listen to their view points as a way to expand your own horizons.

, Money makes the world go around, there’s no denying it, but studies show that making more money does not necessarily translate to being happier. Instead of chasing the best possible paycheck, consider what things truly matter to you.It is more important that you find value in what you do than it is that you make a lot of money in terms of happiness over time.
Making too little money can also negatively affect happiness however, so it is important that you still find gainful employment.

, While it is important that you find and retain gainful employment in order to maintain long term happiness, finding a job that aligns with your personal passions can help ensure you feel more fulfilled and content.

People who work within an industry in which they feel passionate about regularly report higher levels of life satisfaction.
Look for work that relates to what matters to you: if you enjoy teaching consider a career in education. If you love cars perhaps being a mechanic would be fulfilling.

, An important element to finding a fulfilling career is to find a job that leaves you with a feeling of satisfaction. When you find the right job and get into a groove, you can work in a way that provides you with a regular sense of accomplishment.Finding your “flow” or getting in “the zone” are common terms used to describe finding a job you are in sync with and can accomplish quite a bit in a short amount of time.
Feeling as though you accomplished something of value will help you see your job, and in turn that aspect of your life, in high esteem.

, Having control over your life is important to feeling happy and fulfilled. Of course, the nature of employment often limits the amount of independence and freedom one can enjoy on a day to day basis. It’s important to find a line of work that offers the amount of freedom you feel is necessary and appropriate.Autonomy at work can provide you with an increased sense of ownership of your work and in turn, an increased sense of accomplishment when you perform well.
Having the freedom to choose how you execute your day can often lead to increased levels of workplace satisfaction.

, If your current position can’t help you find fulfillment in life, you may want to consider making a career change. Finding a new job, especially one in a new line of work can be daunting, so do some research before making a change.


Do some deep thinking, then do some research to help you Find Your Dream Career field.
Once you have chosen a career, you’ll have to start the process to Switch Careers.

, Everyone has made mistakes, and it’s important to value the lessons you learn through them, but don’t allow yourself to dwell on them to the point where it affects your ability to be happy.Obsessing over past failures can’t change what happened, it can only change how you feel today.
Try to identify the lessons that you have learned from your mistakes. For example, if you failed a course in your first semester of college, you might have used the experience to help you pass the class the second time around and to improve your study habits overall.

, You should decide on the type of person you want to be, and only your opinion ultimately matters when it comes to how successful you are at becoming that person. The fear of being judged can create significant stress in your life and steal your focus away from things that really matter.The opinions of others carry only as much weight as you allow them to. Don’t let what others think about you affect how you see yourself. For example, if someone criticizes you for often being disorganized, then you might focus on how important being organized is to you. If you think it is important, then you could make an effort to become more organized.
It’s alright to consider the perception of others, but remember that you are only responsible to yourself for your successes and failures.

, Being charitable does not have to mean giving money to a charity, though if you find that rewarding there’s nothing wrong with doing so. You can also be charitable with your time, your attention or your skills. Find a way to give back to the world around you and you will find yourself feeling much more fulfilled.Find a cause you are passionate about and donate to it, volunteer your time, or offer your support in some way.
Giving back to the community offers the opportunity to feel better about yourself while helping others that need it.

, It can be easy to lose sight of the things you excel at over time. Eventually, they just become normal parts of your day, but remember that your strengths are a big part of what makes you great. Weaknesses, on the other hand, are not indications of where you’ve gone wrong, but rather where you can still work to improve.Don’t be too hard on yourself when you don’t take to something quickly. Nurture your weaknesses and value them as an opportunity to improve and develop as a person.
Make a list of five of your strengths and two of your weaknesses. Then use the list to help you find ways to use your strengths to work on your weaknesses.For example, if one of your strengths is that you are good at drawing, but a weakness is that you are shy, then you might try to use your art as a way to connect with people, such as by joining an art club or drawing something special for someone.

, Forgiving can be among the hardest things to master, as often it’s the things that hurt the most that are most in need of forgiveness. Be ready and willing to forgive others for their mistakes, but place just as much emphasis on forgiving yourself for where you’ve gone wrong.Try writing a letter to yourself or to the person who you want to forgive (but don't send it). In the letter, describe what happened and why you want to forgive yourself or someone else for it. After you finish the letter, you can rip it up and throw it away.
Keep in mind that forgiving someone is not as much about the other person as it is about you. The other person does not even need to apologize for you to forgive him or her.By forgiving someone, you are making a conscious decision to let go of the anger that you feel and move forward.

, If you find yourself feeling as though you don't want to keep living, or you're looking for ways to make life worth living because you fear you may hurt yourself, you should seek help. Remember, life is always worth living and there are people out there that can help.You can learn how to cope with thoughts about suicide.

You should do whatever you can to stop yourself from going through with suicide.

If you aren't comfortable reaching out over the phone, you can even get help online.

Learn the value of everything and also learn that they will never be with you throughout your lifetime.
,
Do things now.,
Always tell your family members, relationship partners and friends that they are important to you and you love them.,
Do random acts of kindness.,
Go Green!,
Have fun!,
Go to the extremes.,
Love the moment.,
Take it as it comes Life does not always go the way we would wish or hope for.",How to Live Life Like There's No Tomorrow,", There must be something in life you have wished to and dreamed of doing. But you have been shy or embarrassed to do? Well, one day you will get up from the bed and you will realize that there is not time left for doing those things. Do it now!, It does not have to be serious. You could try telling your parents you love them everyday (if you live with them), or tell your boyfriend/girlfriend or husband/wife that they are a big part of your life.

, When you are dead, don't you want to have everybody remember you for all the great things you did? Maybe by helping that old lady reach the high shelf in the store, or helping that girl scout pick up her cookies, or even just being nice to your friends/family. It really does make a difference.

, Of course you probably do this already, or at least we hope so! Do not litter, be nice to animals and plants and recycle. Doing little things to help the environment can be helpful to your planet.

, This is where it starts getting good! Don't just sit around the house all day! Have a party, make lots of friends, do crazy things like sky diving! Do not be stressed out all the time, relax a little and chill!

, This is optional but be wild! Go bungee jumping, jump off a cliff into water (check if it is safe below first) or have an eating contest, you get the idea! Do whatever you want but just do not kill yourself.

, Stop. Sit down. Look at a sunset or a green field. Look at children playing and enjoying themselves. Look an old couple arm in arm walking down the street. Look at a flower. Savour the simple and beautiful things in life that are all around us. Do not take nature's wonders for granted - marvel at everything that we have on this planet earth that is our home.

, There will be ups and downs along the way. Do not worry about bad news, expect good news and hope for the best. Be an optimist and plan an enjoyable event or happening in your life in the near future, however small or token.

A major part of the late 60s counterculture were psychedelic and natural drugs (like marijuana and LSD).",How to Live by the Late Sixties American Counterculture," It seems so awesome and useful at first, but in the long run, it's all a drain on your spirit and soul. Stop using Facebook; stop caring about your friends' latest status updates. Stop spending every waking moment on your cell-phone texting. Drop the online games.;
, Focus on what makes you happy and what makes others happy.

, Some of the most beautiful, pioneering, mind-altering music is the music of the late 60s/early 70s. Listen to bands such as Jefferson Airplane, Pink Floyd, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Jimi Hendrix, etc. Of course there are lots of great rock bands from today too, like the Black Keys, My Morning Jacket and the White Stripes.

, People these days tend to wear very dark clothes, dark shoes, dark coat, etc. Today's modern man/woman is very depressed, conservative, judgmental and unwilling to try new things; as such, their dress sense reflects this. Brighten up with clothes!

, Love those who make you happy, and as for those who make you upset, love them only less. Don't judge people by appearance, and be friendly to all.

,, If you want to live in the 60s, why are you even on the computer, reading this article, in the first place?

, People commonly smoked indoors in the 60s; doing this will increase the 1960s feeling. Remember that smoking is extremely detrimental to your health. Don't start simply because of this article. We have the advantage of knowing how harmful cigarettes are today, which people did not have in the 60s.

, Responsibly using these drugs may increase connotation of the 60s, but keep in mind that drugs are illegal and can be very detrimental to your health if not used responsibly. Make the decision for yourself.

Find the good, on purpose.,
Learn to let go of judgmental approaches toward others.,
Make a decision to turn your mind to liking other people.,
Bond with your loved ones and friends.,
Think kindly of the new people you meet.,

Deal with confrontational, difficult and mean people with good spirit.,
Consult with others on what to do, as they may have good ideas to help you.,
Be willing to acknowledge other people's flaws.,
Be kind to yourself.",How to Love Everybody," To be able to love everybody, even people you've just met, you need to find something you like, admire or appreciate about them. This means setting aside judgment, bias and prejudices so that you can connect with the person at a similar level. To do this is difficult. Acknowledge that it is difficult but work through that to do your best and show love.


Find at least one to three things about the other person that strike you as being interesting, admirable, inspiring, cool, special, etc. It must be something that you consider a positive aspect.
Keep trying until you manage this. It becomes a fun thing to do, to challenge yourself to this task until it is achieved.;
, Again, this is a hard thing to do. From early on, human beings are trained in ""us"" and ""them"" thinking. It's how families, suburbs, towns, cities, regions, states and countries define themselves. By making some people ""other"" or ""them"", it becomes easier to fault them, to dismiss them and to even hate them. Yet, they are human beings, just like you. Some of the ways to help yourself pass this style of thinking, here are things to try:


Catch your mean thoughts as they arise. You know the ones, the ones that put people into boxes.
Avoid judging the ""book by its cover"". How do you truly know a person until you've taken the time to get to know them?
Remind yourself that everyone consists of layers. Some layers show to some people, other layers to other people. Think about the situation you meet this person in, or the manner in which you have come to know this person. Might those external factors be influencing your opinion of them?
Accept your differences. If every human being looked like and acted like every other human being, you wouldn't be reading this. There'd be no point. Everyone would be of one bland mind, all shuffling along focused merely on surviving, not creating or sparking off one another and not trying valiantly to work out one's place in the world. The differences between human beings enable people to thrive, to create and to innovate. Celebrate this fact rather than finding it something to be feared.

, Put people you meet into positive terms in your mind, using the good things that you've found in them. For example, if you classify people by their outlook, tell yourself that ""she/he is pretty"". Not too much detail, just ""pretty"" is sufficient. And say this loud in your head. Sooner or later you will start to automatically look for and repeat the nice and the kind things about people to yourself, and therefore you will start to like other people better.


Remember, if you think of people in ways that is clearly wrong, like calling morbidly obese folks skinny, this ritual becomes more like something you have to say, rather than something you mean. Look for the good parts of each person, and say those ""aloud"" in your head.

, Knowing what being supported feels like and how to support others close to you can help to make it easier to love and bond with others less close to you.

, This is a kind of judging, only it is one with positive input.

, If you have a nemesis, learning to love him/her will take time. However, it is possible to turn negative thoughts about anyone, into positive ones.

, It's easy to react angrily and to feel spite toward the person who delivers nasty comments, who insists on being difficult to get along with or who is itching for a fight. Be the better person and stay calm. Do not respond to their provocations but pretend that you have not even noticed that aspect of their attitude toward you. Talk kindly to this person and focus on facts, leaving emotional outbursts far behind.


Harsh words usually lead to more harsh words, and increased anger.

, An honest discussion with someone you trust about how hard you find it to like ""X"" (a mutual acquaintance/a friend/someone you know but they don't, etc.) can provide you with a sounding board that reveals what you might be doing to make things worse or it might help you to see what you're missing or perceiving incorrectly. Or, it may just be good to talk it through and find new ways of trying again with the person you're finding it hard to like.

, Remember, no human is perfect; they may say a bad idea but mean well. Determine people's characters through their actions rather than merely the words they speak.


Understanding people's flaws does not mean accepting their bad attitude or poor behavior. It means seeking to understand so that you don't become embittered, feel blamed or take the burdens of that person onto yourself.

, It is hard to not judge others. It is a habit and you may well fall back into it. Recognize this and don't quit. Give it your best.

Visualize the benefits of minimalism.,
Limit your social commitments.,
Pare down your social media activity.,
Join a minimalist community.",How to Live Like a Minimalist1," In large part, minimalism is actually a practice in mindfulness. The act of ridding yourself of possessions is a turn away from the materialism, consumerism, and distractions of our world today. Consider the following benefits of minimalist living:Less focus on material items for personal fulfillment
Reduced stress about how much money you earn
Less clutter, and more free space;
, A harried social life goes against the fundamental goals of minimalism - to declutter, destress, and refocus. Take the initiative and eliminate toxic relationships from your life, focusing instead on the people who contribute to a happy state of being for you. Do not feel obligated to keep up with relationships that do not benefit your well-being, such as:friendships with people who don't have your best interests at heart
on-again, off-again relationships that cause you sadness

, Pick a few social media apps to keep and deactivate the rest. This minimalist move will reduce the number of alerts and notifications you receive during the day, which can grow to be excessive and stressful. If you do not feel comfortable getting rid of applications, turn off notifications and check in for updates at your leisure., There are numerous communities, online and in countries like the U.S., Canada, Australia, Ireland, and the U.K., centered around the minimalist way of life. Local meetup groups are held in these countries - they offer a unique opportunity to meet other people living the minimalist lifestyle, and to learn more from them. Check for meetings in your area, or look for an online community to reach out to other minimalists."
"
List and lose items that you don’t use.,
Get rid of paper clutter.,
Clean out your closet.,
Throw out things that are past their prime.",How to Live Like a Minimalist2," Go through your home and write a list of items that you never use, but that someone else might get a lot of enjoyment out of (e.g. a waffle maker, if you never eat waffles). Ask yourself whether or not you see yourself using the items in the next 3-6 months. If the answer is no, get rid of them by:


giving the items to friends or family who might want them
posting the items for sale online
having a garage sale
bringing the items to a thrift store
donating the items to a local charity

, Unorganized paperwork can create a lot of clutter and make it difficult to find important documents when you need them. Do an initial clean up to sort loose papers into categories (e.g. tax papers, warranties and user manuals, bank statements, etc.) Invest in a small filing cabinet or file folders to keep important documents in, and be sure to recycle unnecessary documents (junk mail, store circulars, etc.) as soon as they are no longer relevant to you. To minimize your paperwork, sign up for online billing with your bank and utility providers., Go through your closet, wardrobe, or dresser and remove everything that no longer fits, is in poor condition, or that you haven’t worn in several months. Sort through clothing, shoes, boots, outerwear, and accessories, and pack up all wearable, extraneous items for a local charity. Throw out worn or damaged items, or put them aside to repurpose (e.g. for household rags, material for craft projects, etc.), There are certain items that are likely to be hanging around your home that should be discarded, both to free up space and to prevent further use. Expired food, condiments, and spices, as well as old makeup are examples of things that should be thrown out immediately to avoid future use. Do a regular cleanup of these items every few months to avoid a build-up of old items."
"
Clear out extra furniture.,
Consider moving to a smaller living space.,
Think about going car-less.,
Discuss the changes with your loved ones.",How to Live Like a Minimalist3," To fully embrace a minimalist lifestyle, consider eliminating pieces of furniture that seem unnecessary in your home. End tables, for example, are not always useful but do tend to collect clutter. Decorative display cabinets (and the knickknacks on display) are also fairly incongruent with a minimalist space, as are large entertainment centres. Sell or donate large items and enjoy the extra space., In keeping with the theme of paring down and simplifying, consider finding a smaller living space. While we live in a society that encourages us to aim for large, impressive ""dream"" homes, opting for a smaller residence can be a better choice for your well-being. The minimalist choice to live in a small house or apartment can make your happier because:it means less debt and less financial risk
a small home will require less maintenance
a small, affordable home will be easier to sell (if you choose to do so)
you'll be less likely to accumulate clutter

, While living without a car is not a requisite component of a minimalist lifestyle, it is very conducive to it. Between gas, repairs, maintenance, and registration, cars are possessions that require our energy and money on a constant basis. Some minimalists require a car because of certain life circumstances (e.g. having children, needing a car for work) but may choose to drive only when necessary. If you are able to go without a car, consider simplifying your life by using public transport, taxis, Uber, or your own two legs instead., If you live with others, it is important to discuss your move towards minimalism with them, and to get their feedback. If they are interested in joining you in trying out a minimalist lifestyle, you should discuss some ways to adapt your shared living space and belongings, and to consume in a minimalist way. If they do not wish to live in a minimalist way, discuss the limits and parameters of your minimalist changes in order to compromise on shared spaces, belongings, and consumables. Maintain communication and discuss all possible changes to your living space beforehand to avoid conflicts."

Identify your interests.,
Determine obligations.,
Assess outside influences.,
Evaluate how well you understand a situation.,
Journal out your thoughts.,
Talk to others.,
Be aware of other’s responses to you.,
Complete a personality assessment.,
Assess the feedback you’re getting.,
Accept responsibility for your actions.,
Keep your promises.,
Monitor your behavior.,
Follow your passion.,
Be who you want to become.,
Surround yourself with positive people.",How to Analyze Your Intentions," Often times, your interests will align with the choices that you make. Your passion tends to lead you even more than you may be conscious of and may drive you to make certain decisions. For instance, if you love dancing, you might prioritize a dance event over something else you need to do, like work or studying.Just because you have interests, however, this is not a reason to skip out on your responsibilities. If you have made promises to others or have responsibilities, then you should attend to those first and seek fun later.
Also, perhaps for you, work is priority over all. This could explain why you choose to work late some nights and find it difficult to make it in time for dinner or other family events.
Remember that being successful in life is about finding balance.;
, In assessing why you do the things you do, consider your responsibilities. This is perhaps the easiest and most straightforward way to determine your intentions. If you were not obligated, however, know that your decision was driven by other factors.For instance, if you fired an employee, you may have been mandated to do so by someone higher up than you.
Also, if you chose to find a second job, you might have done so because your money is tight and you needed another source of income.

, Your intentions might be to help, please or impress another person. Reflect on whether or not your actions have been influenced by someone. Perhaps this person has asked you for a favor and you feel obligated to complete it. The person might also be a significant other or family member to whom you feel a great deal of responsibility.Try to spend more time around people who are positive and who have similar values to you.
Consider whether or not you would have done something had another person not been involved.
Remember that outside influences are not inherently bad. You might, for instance, keep your Tuesday evenings clear because that is the day you take your grandmother out shopping. Your intention could be to please and help your grandmother.

, Sometimes, we make certain decisions and choices without having all of the facts. And sometimes we research extensively before acting. Having an awareness of your level of consciousness of a situation will help illuminate why you acted as you did. In assessing your intentions, be sure to be aware of what facts you may or may not have had in that situation.For instance, perhaps you leave a party with a friend who told you that they would not be drinking, but then they were pulled over and got a DUI. Though you intended to have a safe trip home, you were not aware that you friend had any drinks.
Also, perhaps before you chose your classes you researched your teachers extensively and assessed your level of interest or need for the topic. In this case, your intentions would clearly have been to choose the best class and coursework for yourself.
Be sure to gather all information possible, particularly when making major decisions.

, Take a moment to really think about why you do the things that you do, what motivates you, and what your purpose is and was. Ask yourself “why” you have done something, and be as honest as possible. Write down your responses to yourself. , In addition to doing some self-assessment, you should also have conversations with others. Perhaps you have affected people in ways you may be unaware of, both positive and negative. If there is a specific situation that you are seeking clarity on, ask your friends, family, and coworkers what they think, especially if they were involved. They will be able to give you a perspective you may not have considered.You might say something like “do you remember when I didn’t go on family vacation that year? I’ve been thinking about that lately. We never talked about it much. What did you think about it?”
The insights of others might be hard to deal with, but try not to take it personally. Take it as an opportunity to learn, grow and improve.

, Sometimes, you might be so focused on yourself and your own life that you forget to pay attention to others and the effect you have on them. Tune in more to other’s responses to you. Notice their facial expressions and body language when you speak. Notice whether they smile or not when they see you. Practice being more present in the moments that you interact with others.If someone smiles and looks happy to see you or talk to you, then you likely have positive impacts on people and have good intentions that align with it.
However, if you see your friends or coworkers tense up when they see you or if they don’t speak, then perhaps you should do a bit more soul searching.

, There are many different personality assessments available to help assess your inner motivations. One such that is particularly popular at the moment is the “love languages” assessment. This quiz helps determine how you express and receive love.For example, some receive love through “words of affirmation.” If you received this result, it will mean that you tend to be more verbally expressive. It can help you understand why you choose to say or not say certain things or help you understand why you have a need for certain things.
Another personality assessment that might be useful is the Myers-Briggs. This assessment indicates psychological preferences and assesses how people make decisions.

, Another way to further understand your intentions and analyze the impact you have is the assess the feedback that you elicit from others. For instance, if your boss or coworkers are constantly telling you that they don’t feel that you are a team player, this should create some cause for pause for you. It might mean that you are not truly invested in the work or perhaps your office culture is not a natural fit for you.Think about the feedback that you get from family and friends, as well. They know you better than anyone.

, The responses you get from others will perhaps align with thoughts that you already had about yourself or stand in contrast with them. You may find that those close to you have issues with you that you did not know about. If so, you should listen to them and apologize for any wrongdoing at your hands. Having a greater knowledge of the impact you have and acknowledging it is the first step in aligning the person you want to be with the person you are currently.Accept responsibility for the positive effects you have had on others, as well, and continue to make such an impact.

, After you have successfully considered your behaviors and garnered a greater understanding of the consequences, both positive and negative, of your actions, it is time to work to align those actions with your intentions. One of the first ways to ensure that you are doing that is to keep your promises. Your word should mean something and others should be able to trust that you will do what you say you’ll do. Honor your promises, responsibilities, and commitments.For instance, if you tell a friend that you will pick them up at 7:00PM, do all that is within your power to be there at that time.
If you find, however, that you will not be able to keep your promise then you should tell the other person as soon as possible and work to rectify the situation.
Try to keep things in perspective and in balance.

, Remember that, though you would perhaps prefer to be judged by your intentions rather than your actions and their consequences, that you are always being observed by others. Though first impressions are important, remember that people’s opinion of you is constantly in flux and is dependant upon everything you do and say. Be sure to always act in ways that are positive, kind and productive.Show kindness to everyone you meet and avoid gossiping or speaking negatively of others.
Maintain high ethical standards and attend to your responsibilities.

, If you are doing what you love, then your intentions and actions will often align well. Strive to live a life that is joyful and fulfilling for you and it will be all the easier to understand your inner desires.Remember to still attend to your obligations, however. For instance, though you may love to paint, you should not necessarily quit your day job to do so. Find a way to balance your obligations with your interests.

, Every day of your life, you should make decisions and actions that will direct you into becoming a better person. Don’t set yourself back by making poor choices or falling into bad habits. Instead, work to improve yourself and good decisions will naturally come from you.Consider reading self help books or becoming more spiritual.
Capture your accomplishments and progress in your journal.

, They say that you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Be very mindful of the company you keep and only keep positive and uplifting people close to you. Negative people can be a poison and can lead you to do things that are out of your character. Choose your friends carefully!"

Learn to love yourself.,

Love others as yourself.,
Live.",How to Lead a Spiritual Life," This is probably the most important step in a spiritual life, loving yourself. This type of love isn't one bred from egoic notions of love, yet those given from your higher self. Egoic love is based in petty competition; for example, ""I look so much better than X therefore I love myself"". The higher self loves every nook and cranny of who you are no matter what X does or looks like. When you can love who you are as a person, flaws and all, you'll begin to open up your spiritual awareness.


As many spiritual gurus say, if you only have love within you, then that's all you can give. This is conversely true if you only have anger within you. This is by no means meant for you to suppress your anger, but to learn to love yourself even when you may feel angry.
A good exercise is to consciously let go of judgments of yourself. If you make a faux pas and normally beat yourself up for it, then this time say,"" It's okay, I love myself and accept myself no matter what."" Remember that no human is perfect.;
, This may sound cliché but it is the truest thing there is. That feeling of passion you get from your hobby of surfing, or the joy you feel after working with children, those are the moments you are aligned with your heart. Listening to your heart doesn't mean allowing your emotions to run amok, but to follow down the path you most want in life. If you find yourself in a job that you know you don't like, then move out of it into one you do. If you're in a relationship that makes you feel used all the time, then have a talk, or start making your escape plan. Following your heart may not always look pretty at first, you may lose friends at the job you just quit, or break a lease you signed while with your former partner, but it's leading you in the right direction.


When you make a step to follow your heart, don't be surprised if things look worse straight afterwards; this is just a sign that your life is moving. As Louis Hay suggests, during these moments affirm to yourself, ""Only good will come from this situation, all is well, and I am safe."" If you can remember to say something like this to yourself in life, you'll make greater strides than you can imagine.

, Start small and with something easy to read. It's best to find a specific topic you're interested in. For some people the idea of past lives has allure, so they read popular articles on the web, or the best-known books on the topic. From your first choice in listening or reading, you will be exposed to new terms that can lead your study into greater depths, in a fun and organic way. There are plenty of audio tracks, lectures, available on the web for free. These will be of great help because you will often find people who are masters in their fields, who are able to give you wonderful guidance. If your heart is calling you to live in the present moment more often, then search those terms and see what you can find.


Some people listen to audio track on a daily basis, while others do it sparsely. There is no pressure either way, do what feels right for you.

, Practicing gratitude daily will show you how much you have to be thankful for. If you have a roof over your head, that is a big start in life. No matter who lives with you or where that roof is, the important key here is to find the gratitude for it. A great practice is to say ""thank you"" first thing in the morning; you don't even have to specify when you start out, just say, ""thank you,"" the moment you wake. When you find yourself complaining about certain things, take a look at them from a different angle and find what it is you should be grateful for. If you are going through a rough situation, you can even be thankful for the lessons the situation is teaching you, or how it is making you a stronger person. Every person has so much to be thankful for in the world today, its just a matter of recognising it right in front of you.

, This can be giving your time, or your money, or energy. The point here is to start giving back to the world. The best way to give is to give something you love sharing; other people will recognise this and it will help the world even more.


If you don't like being around children, then don't volunteer at a summer camp because you believe it to be a more ""spiritual"" form of giving. If you are better at fixing cars, then by all means find a way to help someone out, even if it's just giving someone's battery a jump. Giving shouldn't feel like a painful burden, what you do should feel right, and feel good at the end of the day.

, When you unfold down your path in life, you'll see how we are all interconnected. When you start to love yourself more, you will start to love others more. This love will come naturally in time, so don't try to force it. Remember that we all have the human spirit within us, which means we are all coming from the same source. If someone takes the parking space you were waiting for, try to see where they are coming from; while it doesn't make their action right, it will help you love them more. For example, you may realize that they have three children piling out of their car and the husband and wife are bickering endlessly. Look into the situation for understanding and find that love towards them, because you'll realize they don't mean it personally towards you.

, Go out and live. Live your life as you see fit. Don't form into someone else's opinion of what your life should be. If you like to dress differently from others, then go for it. If you want to travel to foreign lands, then go. Spirituality is not about religious notions or being a perfect cookie, it is about living and experiencing what it means to be human in this lifetime. Go be a human. This is what you are here for.

Let's start by clearing through your room.,
Now that your room is cleaned out, ask your parents if you can redecorate.,
Now, go for a look you love.,
Shopping!,
Don't change your attitude just because you got tons of new clothes, a new room, and such!,
And that's it, enjoy it!",How to Live Like a Goddess," What do you not like? Get rid of it. Go through your closet, and make a pile of things you don't like or don't fit you anymore. Put all clothes that fits in that category in it. Go through your makeup. What do you think looks best on you? Keep it! All of the makeup you think is ugly or doesn't look right on you needs to be given away. Go through jewelry, stuffed animals (If you have any), and everything, and just get rid of the stuff you don't want. Giving the stuff you don't like to charity - somebody out there wants all of the stuff you don't like, in fact, needs it.;
, If they let you, paint the walls a color you love. Is your favorite color pink? Paint the walls pink. Blue? Paint the walls blue. Or, if you don't think you'll be able to paint anything without messing something up, ask your parents to try painting, and if they say they can't, try looking for a professional painter by using an address book. And don't stop with painting! Look for furniture you really like, and put it up in your room. Get new blankets for your bed - the bed is a part of my room I really tend to focus on, and I think others should do the same - it's basically the part of your room others tend to look at first, plus you sleep in it, so get some pretty new blankets and pillows to put up. But make sure they're comfy! You don't want to sleep in a bed that feels like sandpaper, right? Also put up pictures of your friends. Doesn't it make you feel great when you walk into your friend's room and there's a photo of you with them on one of your best days of your life? Let your friends have that same feeling. And don't stop with friends - put up pictures of family members, pets, and other things that make you and others feel great!

, It doesn't have to be something that's 'in style', but choose a look you love and that's totally you, and go for it! Two words: be yourself. Go to a local salon or hair stylist, and get a new 'do. Ask them what would look best on you, and if you like it, go for it! Don't choose something you hate just because it looks nice on you - this guide is about living the way you want to, right? Right! So don't live with a hairstyle you hate. Go through the makeup you kept, and try putting some on. There's plenty of great articles here on wikiHow on makeup tips, so try using some! But you don't have to put on makeup if you don't want to - wearing a bare face is fine, too, and if you're younger than 13, you probably shouldn't even be wearing makeup, anyway. Try going to a spa for a relaxing facial or massage to make you feel great, or if you can't afford it, try giving yourself an at-home spa treatment. Like with the makeup, there's plenty of guides on at-home spa treatment recipes on wikiHow that will help. And if you don't like how your nails are looking, give yourself a manicure! Your nails can look just as good as they'd look at a nail salon if you do them at home, plus it's so much cheaper. And don't stop here - if there's any other things you'd like to do to groom yourself, do those, too. The sky's the limit!

, Go shopping, and buy clothes you love. Don't buy things that are 'in' if you don't like them - you can buy 'in' things if you like them, though. Shop at any place you want! There are many different clothing stores, so shop at ones with styles you love. Try not to buy things that are too expensive, you don't want to spend all of your shopping money on just one thing instead of clothing to replace the things you got rid of. Get jewelry, purses, shoes, and other things if you want! Just make sure you like everything you buy, and feel free to show your own personal style.

, Keep your attitude the way you like. Just one thing you should change if you're not already - be kind to others, treat them the way you'd like to be treated. And that's it! Don't care what other people think of you - it's just a small amount of people. Think of all of the other people who love and care about you, and ignore people who are mean to you - think of it this way. When you're out of college and have a job, you'll find tons of new friends, and by that age people won't be so immature just because they don't like your t-shirt.

, By now you're living the way you want to. You have a room you love, a new look you adore, and new clothing and accessories you think are great. You're being yourself, and even improved yourself on the way. You're like a human-goddess.

Know your friend.,
Mention the idea of nudism.,
Tell your friend you're a nudist.,
Dispel the misconceptions.,
Ask your friend if (s)he would like to try nudism.",How to Introduce a Friend to Nudism,"  Start by examining the interests of your friend, their overall personality, and the overall quality of your friendship.  Is your friend highly fashion-driven?  Was your friend brought up very religiously, or very strictly?  Has your friend shown a particularly negative reaction towards the unclothed human body?  (e.g. avoiding locker rooms, avoiding artwork that depicts simple nudity, always wearing very ""modest"" attire, (s)he has made an ""ew"" or an ""oo la la"" sort of reaction to simple nudity etc)  These are strong flags to indicate that your friend might not want to try nudism, or might even be outwardly against nudism.


If your friend exhibits any of the above, you may either want to consider asking a different friend, or thinking very carefully before you decide whether or not you want to ask this friend.  If you do decide to bring up nudism with a friend with any of the above characteristics, then step 4 is especially important.;
, Don't ask your friend, yet, whether (s)he would like to try nudism, or even bring up that you're a nudist.  Simply, casually, mention nudism as a natural part of a conversation that's generally about something else, and see how your friend reacts when you mention the nudism.


For example, if you and your friend are in the process of packing clothes for a vacation together at a textile place, or you're discussing vacation plans in general, you could mention something along the lines of ""Hey, there are some resorts that don't even require people to wear clothing,"" and see how your friend reacts.
If you and your friend are watching a nature special on television, you could say something like, ""Do you notice how all the animals are naked, but people are the only animal that always has to wear clothes?""
If you and your friend are planning on going swimming together at a textile location, and your friend asks you if you remembered your bathing suit, you could joke back in a laughing voice, ""Nah, I'm going skinny-dipping"" and see whether or not your friend finds that amusing.

, After you have tested the waters with the relationship between you and your friend, and gauged his/her reaction about the idea of nudism, you may now let your friend know about your participation in the nudist lifestyle.  It is best to inform your friend of this fact after you have known your friend for some time (say a minimum of three months), especially if the friend is a girl.  Otherwise, (s)he may react more adversely.  Be sure to tell him/her that you're a nudist, or enjoy practicing nudism, what you get out of the experience, and what your favourite nudist venues are.


Do not act shy, embarrassed, or nervous when you tell your friend about your participation in nudism. This can signal to your friend that nudism is something dirty, and to be ashamed of, and that you actually feel guilty when you do this sort of thing. Be sure to be open, honest, and upfront when you discuss your nudism with your friend.

, If your friend has never previously heard the details of what nudism is about, then (s)he might think that nudism is a sexual lifestyle; that nudist venues condone open sex, and that there's a lot of orgies, exhibitionism, and voyeurism going on.


Tell your friend that nudism is about the natural aspect of nudity, rather than the sexual aspect, and that overt sex is not condoned; that the activities that happen at a nudist venue are no different from the activities that happen in a clothed venue, except the participants don't wear clothing, and that it's not a sexually charged atmosphere.Tell your friend that families with young children frequent nudist localities too, and that proper etiquette is especially a priority in a family environment.Be sure to answer any questions your friend may have at this point in a way that is clear to someone learning a new concept.  If your friend is asking questions, that is a sure sign (s)he is interested, and may even want to join you.

, Finally, you're at the part where you have informed your friend that you're a nudist, and you've (hopefully) given him/her a good sense of what nudism is about.  Now, it's time for you to ask if the friend would like to try nudism with you.


Your friend's answer might not necessarily be immediate.  (S)he may need time to think it over.  Don't pressure your friend.  If your friend says, ""Sure, I'll try it out with you"" then chances are, you have successfully introduced your friend to the nudist lifestyle.  If your friend says, ""No, I'm really not interested"" then respect that.  There are many other people in the textile world who would be willing to take on the nudist way of life.

Figure out your personal motivations.,
Work on forgiveness.,
Learn to accept yourself.,
Create a daily happiness practice.,
Develop meaningful relationships.","How to Find Love, Peace and Happiness1"," Attaining happiness does not happen the same way for everyone. Some people require money and power to be happy, while others focus on personal betterment and inner peace in order to find happiness. You need to figure out what will motivate you in life.Look closely at your skills, your life situation, and the world around you. With these in mind, it will help you know what you can do that will be fulfilling and motivating.
For many people, a mixture of financial security and following your dreams is at the core of their motivations. Working in a job that focuses on making a difference in the world can build financial security, personal fulfillment, and a better world.;
, A key element of finding peace, as well as being able to focus on love and happiness, is embracing forgiveness. Forgiving others, for what they have done to you, to people you love, or to themselves, can release a huge amount of stress and disappointment from your life. This is not to say that forgiveness is easy. It can take time to work through the pain, hurt, and disappointment others can cause. However, working on mending relationships and moving on from pain can lead you to find much greater levels of love, peace, and happiness than would occur if you hold onto it.


First, you need to be willing to reach out to the person or people who have hurt you. Then you need to communicate why you are upset or hurt, be able to discuss the issue calmly, apologize for your part, and accept an apology, if it is forthcoming.Sometimes forgiveness simply means letting go of pain and disappointment. If you cannot speak to the person who caused you pain, you can still work on forgiveness. Identify what issues or incidents are causing you pain and work on changing your thoughts and emotions around that experience. Put negative feelings aside and shift your thoughts from resentfulness by identifying the benefits of letting those bad feelings go.

, Part of developing your inner love, peace, and happiness is valuing all the parts of yourself. This may mean accepting a physical characteristic that you have always disliked, or embracing a personality trait that you have always seen as a flaw.One way to accept yourself is to identify what your best attributes and strengths are. Maybe you are a loving person or you are a skilled painter. Maybe you are both. Try writing these down positive attributes so that you can be reminded of them every morning or when you are having a particularly rough day.
Accepting yourself also means coming to terms with your failures and places where you need improvement. Accepting these things is the first step towards changing things for the better. Make a list of things you would like to change, but they must be possible to change, and begin steps to make these positive changes.

, What can you do every day to improve your mood and your outlook? Finding contentment in yourself can be a great step toward finding overall love, peace, and happiness. This contentment is more likely if you find something to be happy about every day. A regular happiness practice will guarantee that you find that thing every day.Some people find happiness in daily spiritual practice. Some people find happiness through daily exercise or time in nature. Whatever you think will clear your mind and enliven your energy, try it for awhile to see if it will improve your life.
One way to care for yourself is to take at least a few minutes every day to meditate and relax. Simply stop all your thoughts, relax your body, and come to rest for one minute. If you like, visualize the cosmos around you or a universe full of stars. Put your hands in your lap, with your back straight and your stomach relaxed. Then bring your mind completely to rest.

, Love is created and spread through your relationships with other people. In order to find love, you need to establish and develop relationships with other people. These could be romantic relationships, but they could also be friendships or new relationships with family members.


Building meaningful relationships requires that you focus on being kind and respectful to the people in your life.
Establish trust by being someone that is engaged and honest when friends need help or advice.
Love begins with friendship and respect and love is reciprocal. If you show others that you love them love is more likely to come back your way. This can be daunting, as it exposes your inner feelings, but the risk is worth it because of the potential reward.

Sacrifice something small.",How to Give," Altruism is difficult to master, but if you want to give effectively, you'll need to adopt an “others-centered” attitude rather than a self-centered one. When you give, make sure that your heart is genuinely in the right place.This also means that you shouldn't give solely for the sake of making yourself look good. Glory is a type of gain, and while you may end up earning respect or admiration for your generosity, you shouldn't seek it.
Life doesn't usually work out exactly as planned. If you give only out of a desire to receive, you'll become discouraged when things don't work out the way you had hoped. Once discouragement sets in, you'll start finding excuses to avoid giving in the future.;
, Believe in your own ability to positively impact the lives of others. Giving will be easier if you trust that your contribution will make a difference.


On the other hand, if you tell yourself that your contribution won't change a thing, it will be easy to start convincing yourself that it doesn't matter whether you give or not. You don't need to tell yourself that your gift alone will change the world, but you do need to believe that you can help.

, You'll need to have a positive attitude toward the recipient of your generosity, too. Trust that they will put your gift to good use instead of wasting it.


Trust doesn't have to be blind, of course. When it's possible to check on the way your gift will be used, there is no shame in doing so. For instance, when donating money to an organization, you might consider researching how much donated money actually goes directly to the cause that organization claims to promote. Knowing where your gift goes and how it will be used can make you feel more positive about the act of giving it.

, Think about how the intended receiver might react upon getting your gift. You might be more willing to give once you realize the impact your gift might make.This can be difficult when the receiver is a “faceless” stranger you've never met, but your imagination is especially important for this type of impersonal giving. Picture someone you do know in the receiver's shoes and try to personalize the gift that way. For instance, if you're giving money to a charity that helps children overseas, imagine how grateful the kids in your own family might be if they received help after experiencing the same sort of need the anonymous kids you're helping routinely experience.

, Think about the blessings and gifts you've received in your own life. Becoming a more grateful person will naturally soften your attitude toward others, making it easier to “pay it forward” and give to others as a result.


Sit down and make an actual list of people, experiences, and things you feel grateful for. The list doesn't need to be long and you don't need to spend much time on it. The idea is simply to consciously work on nurturing gratitude in your own heart.

, Friends and family influence you more than you might realize. When you surround yourself with generous people, their giving nature might begin to rub off on you.


When you spend time with self-centered people, on the other hand, their negative beliefs might begin to impact your thinking instead. If you're having difficulty motivating yourself to give, a self-centered person would likely discourage you from giving, while a generous person might help you see the benefit in it.

, Giving gets easier with practice. Commit to giving habitually instead of giving only on occasion.The only way to turn giving into a habit is to give repetitively. Don't worry if it doesn't come naturally at first, though. If you need help getting started, write reminders for yourself and post them in spots you know you'll visit throughout the day.

, When you have the ability to help someone through a difficulty, do what you can to see that person through it.


Sometimes, support comes in the form of moral support. When you have nothing else to give to someone going through a rough time, give that person some encouragement. Offer a listening ear, a smile, or words of encouragement. Help the other party distracted himself or herself long enough to calm down. Figure out what the other person needs to feel better emotionally and try to provide it.
There are also times when you might be in a position to give practical support. For instance, if your neighbor is struggling financial and needs a ride to the grocery store, providing that ride can support him or her in a very practical way.

, Someone who turns to you for help might want nothing more than a little advice. Listen to the other person's trouble and offer your best advice when asked.Unsolicited advice should usually be avoided, though. Giving advice to someone who doesn't want it will usually make that person feel judged or looked down upon. You may give the false impression that you are trying to dictate how that person should live, and the other party could end up resenting you for it.
Always be honest when giving advice. If you have no experience with the difficulty the other person is dealing with or don't have any sound idea of what he or she should do, say so. Giving no advice is better than giving bad advice, even if that bad advice is well-intentioned.

, There are also times when someone might tell you about his or her troubles without expecting any advice in return. During these instances, you should give that person a listening ear and a shoulder to cry on.


Make sure that you are giving your undivided attention when your loved one needs you to listen. Diffracted listening seems insincere and won't give actually the other person the comfort he or she is seeking from you.

, Everyone needs a little encouragement sometimes. Giving an honest word of praise without being prompted can help boost the receiver's self-esteem and self-confidence, even on a bad day.The praise you give should always be honest, of course. Insincere praise can be perceived as an insult when it's caught. When it isn't caught, it might steer the recipient in the wrong direction by causing him or her to perceive and pursue a strength that doesn't actually exist.

, Even the best of people will have an “off” day every now and then. Do your best to be understanding and patient with someone in a bad mood. The gift of patience might be exactly what that person needs to calm down.


This can be difficult to do when the other person is pushing your buttons. If you find that patience is impossible, consider stepping away from person giving you problems. Spend some time calming yourself down before dealing with him or her again.

, Respect is one of the most basic gifts you can give someone, but it's also one of the most important.


Essentially, this means treating the people you meet with sincerity. Don't answer seriousness with sarcasm. Stop yourself from rolling your eyes when someone accidentally makes a mistake or says something ignorant. Any action meant to demean or cut someone down should be left behind.

, Even though material gifts aren't the most important thing you can give a person, a carefully selected present can brighten someone's day. The key is knowing what to give, when to give it, and how to give it.


Gifts that demonstrate personal knowledge of the recipient are usually best. For instance, if you know that the recipient has a favorite type of ice cream, giving him or her a carton of that ice cream on a bad day might be enough to make that person smile. When you can't think of something personal, go with something classic, like flowers.
Try to avoid gifts that could make the other person feel indebted to you, though. You also shouldn't make a big deal out of presenting the gift.

, Giving is much easier when you feel passionate about the organization, person, or cause you're giving to. Spend some time figuring out the best recipients of your time, money, and energy instead of giving indiscriminately.


You might consider funding a cause based on your own passions. For instance, if you love animals, consider giving to your local animal shelter or to a national organization that supports animals.
Alternatively, latch onto a specific person you admire and consider supporting the things he or she supports. Some people are more easily motivated by the relationships they maintain in their own lives. If that sounds like you, supporting the passions and beliefs of your loved ones might seem more motivating than supporting a faceless organization would.

, Most people associate “charity” with the act of giving money, but giving your time and energy can be acts of charity, too. Any resource you have is a resource you can give.


Give within your means. If you don't have a lot of money, giving your time can be just as meaningful. Likewise, donating money is a great way to give if your life is too hectic for you to spend time volunteering.

, Instead of making a huge gift right from the start, give just enough to help yourself get used to it. If you jump into things too quickly, you might accidentally overwhelm yourself.If you're giving money, start by donating a small amount. Even $1 is acceptable in most cases. The point is simply to get started. After your first donation, gradually build on that amount each time you give to ease yourself into the practice.
The same principle can be applied to gifts of time. Start by giving up 10 to 20 minutes of your time for a certain cause. Gradually increase this amount each successive time you give.

, Once you feel confident about the recipient of your generosity and the resource you intend to give, figure out how much you can actually afford to give. Determining an amount you feel comfortable with may make the act of giving seem more manageable and easier to continue.


This will require a serious look at your budget, schedule, or both. Formally organizing your life in this manner may seem like a lot of work if you've never done it before, but ultimately, keeping track of your resources will make it much easier to spread them out further.

, It might be tempting to give only after taking care of your other wants and responsibilities, but in doing so, you're telling yourself that giving really isn't that important. Giving before you do anything else will nurture a more effective attitude toward generosity.


When giving money, factor your donation into your monthly budget as a necessary expense. Write the check for your chosen charity as soon as you get paid instead of waiting to see what's left of your money after all of your other expenses.
When giving time, schedule it into your day. As soon as you know that your cause needs volunteers for an event, commit to helping, then work the rest of your schedule around that commitment.

, Consider giving up something you don't really need so that you can give a little more. The sacrifice doesn't need to be detrimental, but it should be noticeable.


For instance, consider giving up coffee on Wednesdays or fast food on Fridays. Set aside the money you save when abstaining from this little luxury and donate it to your chosen cause.
By changing your routine in a small way, you can continually remind yourself of the need to give and keep the cause continually on your mind.

, Spreading love can mean a variety of things. It could mean telling your friends and family that you love them. It could be that you spread love in the world through your actions, for instance volunteering to help someone in need. Whatever you can do to show others the love and compassion you have for them, do it.Work on expressing your love clearly and convincingly. This usually requires a combination of words and action.

There are many organizations in the world who work for a better future through nonviolent means and you can find them through the internet. Find an organization by doing internet searches for causes that you believe in. Then contact the organizations you find about what volunteer opportunities they have available.

, Part of promoting love, peace, and happiness is to teach the next generation about its importance. Kids should be taught to help others, to be kind to others, and to respect others, including respecting people all over the world. If they are taught from an early age that love, peace, and happiness are the key ingredients for a better world, they will be more likely to work towards promoting these ideals., Humanity is one family. In a good family, all family members contribute to the success of the entire family. With this in mind, it is our social responsibility to work to end injustice. If one part of our human family is in need or treated unfairly, it is all our responsibility to end that injustice.


Working to eliminate injustice will not only help others to find love, peace, and happiness, it could help you as well. Working for and with others can help you to connect more deeply and concretely with a wide variety of people, expanding your community and giving your more opportunities to experience love and happiness.

, There is a danger along the path of unconditional, all-encompassing love that you can forget to take care of yourself as well. We can overwhelm ourselves and work so hard that we have no energy left for our own happiness. In order to work toward love, peace, and happiness for others, you must take care of yourself.


A path of exhaustion only leads to burn-out, not to enlightenment. Practice spiritually that is balanced for the development of the self and for the happiness of all people.
Along with feeding yourself and keeping a roof over your head, which is physical self care, overall self care requires that you remember your emotional well-being as well. Caring for your emotional well being requires that you manage stress, take the time for fun and happiness, and have people in your life that you can rely on.

",How to Find True Happiness and Peace," Volunteer, practice random acts of kindness, and be generous. The act of giving always makes the heart more content with its self. Peace and selfishness do not coexist very well.;
, Don't be too hard on yourself. No one is perfect. Love yourself and love life in all its forms. Be open to accept things in a positive manner.

, Remain cool and calm as a person. Ignore the negativity (negative comments, happenings, people) around you.Be understanding: many times hard feelings exist due to not understanding the other person's point of view. When you start putting yourself in the person's place you begin to understand why he says what he says and you start breaking the wall of ego.

, Be friendly and helpful. Being friendly does not mean you have to bring home everyone you meet, but you can always put up a good front and behave warmly in front of others. When you give positive vibes, you will attract positive vibes.

, Do not enter into an argument for silly things. Nothing is worth fighting over and you cannot change other people. Remember these two rules before picking up a fight. It's not worth it after all.

, Keep yourself busy with something constructive. But do keep some time for relaxation too.

, Always. Take lessons from the events in your life. Turn disappointments into life lessons. Explore courses in sustainable happiness and positive psychology.

, Try not to compare yourself with others. Everyone is unique in this world. Cherish the fact and feel nice about yourself. You have everything including a nice heart.

, Remember that your body will experience the harmful effects of keeping anger and hatred inside you. If you forgive you will be able to forget. Forgiving may not be easy but it brings you tremendous peace. Forgive for your sake, if not theirs.

, Be honest with yourself and what you want, and what you expect from yourself and others. It is not easy at first. If you know what you really want, then you could achieve your goals easier.

, Being calm keeps a person from making hasty decisions. Once something is said or done, it cannot be taken back. It takes practice, so hang in there.

, You are only in your head. You never know what someone else is thinking or what they meant by their comment. Ask questions if you want to be sure.

, Rarely anything anyone does is about you. It is based on their own dreams and desires. You never know how someone else's life is going.

, True happiness can only be found when you stop worrying about yourself and try to look out for those around you. Helping family members, co-workers, and friends can give your life meaning and joy. Selfishness, on the other hand, will only provide temporary pleasure. Obviously there are some aspects of life where you must focus on yourself, like your body's need for food and sleep, but only focusing on your own needs will never result in true, sustainable happiness.

, Smiling is infectious. If you make yourself smile for a minute, you are using all kinds of facial muscles, and you can't help but feel good.

, If you can accomplish even the smallest goal, it will pave the way for bigger and better things. With goals accomplished, it sends a message to yourself, that you are a winner, and can do what ever you set your mind to.

, You are unique and special in all the world. If life knocks you down get back up. Failing is not in getting knocked down, it is in staying down.

, Choose your own way of life without being pressured by anyone else. As an example of this, Barrack Obama was born to a Muslim father, but chose to be a Christian and Nobel prize winner Bertrand Russel, a great advocate of peace, chose to be an atheist.

,,,,, Comparing your life against others or your past creates a lot of unhappiness, enjoy and make the most of what you have. Don't compare. Comparing your life against others or your past creates a lot of unhappiness, enjoy and make the most of what you have.

, When you experience a thought nagging at the back of your mind, write it down as a question. This focuses your mind and helps you not become obsessed with your thoughts.

, Don't worry about the past and the future. contentment is reached when you make the most of the present as thinking of the past and the future will in the end just lead to disappointment.

, This does not have to be a religious practice, the intention is to give time for your worries to come up, but don't think about them just allow them to naturally pass until you achieve a calm mind. meditation is allowing your mind to become calm. You don't have to spend hours doing this 20 minutes is fine.

, Getting up early helps you avoid feeling rushed and you can relax before you go to work.

, A lot of us do what we think we should do and this is often influence by what we think others think we should do. Instead follow your instincts and do what you feel is right.,"

Answer the door.,
Interrupt them.,
Be honest.,
Politely decline.,
Close the door.,
Ask to be removed from their list.,
Build a fence.,
Post a no trespassing sign.,
Contact your local Kingdom Hall.,
Call the police.,
Follow up in court.,
Prepare yourself by becoming familiar with their training on how to respond to people who try to stop the conversation.,
Know what they believe.,
Note their practices.",How to Have Jehovah's Witnesses Go Away," This may seem counter-intuitive to getting rid of someone, but the fact is that if you don’t answer the door, they are likely to mark you as “not home” and return in the near future. If you truly want to be rid of them, you will need to answer the door and let them know.;
, It sounds rude, but doesn’t have to be. They are likely to delve right into their script and it will only become harder to get a word in. Politely interrupt to take control of the conversation.


When a Jehovah’s Witness starts talking, interrupt with a polite, “Excuse me” to get their attention.
Try raising your hand an holding it between the two of you at chest level with your palm facing the other person and begin your interjection with, “Hold on.”
If you wait until the Jehovah’s Witness asks a question, you can simply reply with, “I’d rather not have this conversation.”

, If you make up a reason for not wanting to talk to them, they may see this as an invitation to come back at another time. This also initiates a conversation.


Be honest and direct with your response in order to get your point across and avoid one of their conversation starters.
Avoid making up excuses. They are trained to respond to specific protests, and may consider returning in the future if you are just too busy right now.

, Choose very few words to decline their invitation to talk. It is unnecessary to be rude, and arguing will only spur on the conversation. A simple, polite decline will do the trick.


Once you have a chance to speak, try a simple, “No thank you.”
You can also be direct saying, “I’m not interested, thanks.”

, Don’t slam it in their face, but understand that they have been trained to keep the conversation going.Once you have declined, close the door gently. This is important, because, like telemarketers or any solicitor, they are not likely to accept the first, “no” and will do their best to reengage you.Closing the door may be the only way to end the conversation.
If this feels rude to you, try saying, “sorry” as you close the door.

, Even though you decline a conversation, it is still possible that another member of the organization may return to your home. If you want to ensure this doesn’t happen, ask that no one comes back. This is the equivalent of being put on a “do not call” list and they are likely to track this information and respect your request.

, If you really don’t want people coming to your door, consider closing the area off with a fence. According to trespassing laws, it is illegal to trespass on land which is fenced in. You can also put a lock on the gate so they can’t reach the porch., These signs are easy to find online using a quick google search. You can ask anyone to leave your property at any time with or without a sign,but it is helpful in deterring people from coming to your door. Once the sign is posted, you can still grant permission for someone to access your property., While most Jehovah’s Witnesses will respect your wishes after the first visit, every large group is made up of individuals. Some of those individuals may behave differently than others. If the visits persist after you have turned them away and asked that they not return, try calling your local Kingdom Hall.


Report the situation. Let the leadership know that someone in their congregation is not respecting your wishes and is acting outside of their expectations.
Be firm in your wishes to be removed from their rotation.

, If someone has entered your property, you have every right to have them removed. Simply asking them to leave is usually sufficient, but if they are not respecting your wishes, you may need to involve the authorities to enforce trespassing laws.Those laws are enforceable because:


They meet the requirement under the law of having intentionally entered your property rather than accidentally.
They have knowledge that you did not give consent if you have a fence, have posted a no trespassing sign, or have asked them to leave.

, If you have had to contact the authorities, you will need to continue on in court to complete the process and lead to a conviction. Like any legal action, this could take quite a bit of your time and some financial resources, but will guarantee that your privacy is protected.


Fines can be issued in a large range from tens to thousands of dollars.
Jail time is rarely enforced, but has been in some extreme cases, usually involving entering the person’s home.
Probation can be enforced. The average length of time for this probation is 12 months. While on probation, they cannot commit any crimes and must pay all of their fines. They may also be assigned a probation officer.

, While they are not expected to force anyone to listen, they are encouraged to do their best to further the conversation using specific tactics.”I’m busy” will elicit a reaction of acknowledging how busy you must be, followed by the importance of the message as well as a promise that they will be brief.
”I’m not interested” will be followed with a series of questions regarding what you aren’t interested in. These include the Bible or religion in general. They are trained to ask whether you used to be part of organized religion and found hypocrisy in the church.
“I don’t want to become a Jehovah’s Witness” will likely lead them into explaining facet of their religion to you under the assumption that you don’t have enough information to make that decision. They are trained to lean heavily on scripture in this response.

, Jehovah’s Witness consider themselves part of the Christian religion, but Christians do not recognize them largely due to the fact that they do not believe in the Holy Trinity. There are several beliefs which separate them from other religious sects.


Witnesses believe that we are living in the “End Times” and that Armageddon is approaching, when God will rule the earth.There is no hell. They believe people outside of their religion simply cease to exist after death. Witnesses can live forever in heaven if you are one of the chosen few, or with God in paradise on Earth.Only 144,000 people will go to heaven. The rest of the witnesses will live in paradise on earth. There are only about 12,000 positions left in heaven since many witnesses have died and filled the available positions., Beyond having specific beliefs, these play out in a system of practices. These practices often make Jehovah’s Witnesses stand out within their communities and effect the way they function and interact socially.


The Bible has asked them to go to people’s homes. This ministry is expected to stay in good standing with the congregation and requires an average of ten hours per week.Holidays and birthdays should not be celebrated. The holidays are often considered to be honoring pagan rituals or putting government ahead of religion. Birthdays were not celebrated in the Bible or by early Christians and celebrating them is considered displeasing to Jehovah.Witnesses are expected to remain neutral. This means that they are discouraged from voting, participating in the armed forces, and holding government offices.Blood transfusions are rejected. The Bible commands that they reject blood. It is also seen as life-giving, which is considered to be God’s place."

Look for the silver linings in life. Often something in life will happen which we interpret as being bad. When we look at it, however, it turns out to have some good aspects to it. Those are called silver linings. For example:

Your partner dumped you. The silver lining? There are so many different people out there that you can meet. Having the opportunity to get to know someone, to be let into their heart and soul, is a powerful thing.
You lost your job. Maybe you didn't like your job all too much. The silver lining? You now have a chance to find a better, more meaningful, higher-paying position.
You failed at something when you thought you'd succeed. Life is funny that way, isn't it? The silver lining? You learn just as much, if not more, from failing at something than you do from getting it right the first time.

, You know what they say about idle hands, right? Research has consistently found that people who stay busy are happier than people who stand idle.Not only is too much free time a little depressing, it can also be unproductive. Think of all the things you could be doing, like joining clubs, visiting places, hearing lectures, and then think of how little time you are given in life to do just that.

, Scientists have found that the act of smiling may actually make you happier.That's right: just smiling. Give it a try. Find any one of the following reasons to smile and give it a go:

A stranger passed you and smiled.
Someone else did a nice thing for a random stranger.






Something unexpected happened that caused you to think about how vast and strange the world is.
You saw something beautiful in the world.

, People who stick with their gut instincts can be happier than people who labor over their decisions. This is why: if you stick with your gut, you're less likely to question what the other options might have been like, tasted like, etc; if you labor over the decision, you're more likely to wonder if you made a mistake in picking one thing over the other.

, You might feel smart for thinking that winning a lottery ticket could make you happy, but you'd be wrong. Money increases happiness only up to a certain level, where your basic needs are met.After that, money makes you no happier than other people. What does make you happy, however, is compassion.


One study has found that people who look at others giving money to charity makes us just as happy as receiving money ourselves!That means you should find ways to be compassionate if you can. Give back to charity, volunteer at your local food bank, help a team of second-graders with their homework, etc.

, Forgiving others is the act of letting bygones be bygones. If you can find it in your heart to forgive other people, even ones who don't deserve it or aren't willing to forgive you, studies say that you'll be a happier person.


Forgiving other people may make you a happier person by reducing blood pressure, lowering overall stress levels, and slowing down heart rate., Research has established a pretty firm link between exercise and overall happiness.Exercise can increase endorphins in your body, lowering your overall stress levels and giving you that blissed-out feeling., Don't do what you think should make you happy, or what makes other people happy; do what makes you happy. Throw away preconceived notions about what you're supposed to do and go after what you know you can get.

, Whether it's reading books, skimming the internet for quotes, or attending interesting lectures, the world is full of inspirational messages if you know where to look. Here are a few inspirational quotes that may get you motivated to go out into the world and find things that make you happy:



“Challenges are what make life interesting and overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.” - Joshua J. Marine

“The best revenge is massive success.” – Frank Sinatra

“Nobody ever wrote down a plan to be broke, fat, lazy, or stupid. Those things are what happen when you don’t have a plan.” – Larry Winget

""It's never too late to be what you might have been."" - George Eliot

Find a form of worship that you feel good about, although you do not necessarily have to go to a church or other places of worship to find your god.,
Participate in a local worship center, if you choose, as this may also be helpful to your search.

,
Look at your local library or bookstore for religious books.,
Do not turn off your brain.,
Start your search with an open mind.,
Choose a person of faith.,
Compose questions for your search:


Can you know God?,
Speak to your god.,
Be ready to discard personal notions such as hate and envy, doubt you may have of the nature of your god.,
Be ready to look beyond of one denomination.,
Consider reading the holy books that are referred to as being or containing the word of your god as penned by prophets and apostles (followers) of your god, for example the bible or qur'an, or the Buddhist bible, etc.

,
Repent.,
Know that your god loves you who make peace without unnecessary humiliation or cruelty.",How to Find God," You can search online or ask people who share your beliefs what place of worship and prayer they go to.;
,, You might be able to find helpful books and videos about particular faiths in the religion section of your local library or bookstore. Books that may help could be a bible , the tao te ching (the central taoist text), the bhagavad gita (A hindu text in the form of dialogue), The art of peace (Morihei Ueshiba's spiritual teachings), a qur'an, a Buddhist bible or the Hebrew bible.

, Faith can be reasonable and rational. Faith is not superstition. As a seeker, you will be looking for reasons for your faith, for truth about spiritual matters, and for seeing your own evidence of a divine being. Be open-minded about the supernatural, without being gullible.

, Examine documents that support faith in your god. Receiving your god is as salvation by your god's grace, through faith, not by works, lest any boast -- but it's the gift of your god. You're saved for good works appointed that you walk in them. Be cautious of people or organizations that mock your god and faith or that profess to possess no clarity about your god. Most churches, synagogues, or temples have at least some truth.

, Ask one to offer some direction to peace. This does not need to be a pastor, prophet, minister, apostle, nun or evangelist. Simply ask someone that you respect about their personal convictions, how and why.

,
What are the attributes or characteristics of the nature of God?
How is an infinite being revealed to mortals?
What is God's assessment of people?
If people need redemption, how is it transacted?

, Most religions recognize prayer as a basic function of faith. Tell your god about your quest and your reasons for choosing to become a seeker. Ask your god for help understanding your god's ways and truth while seeking your god with your whole being.

, It has been said that in order to find your god, one must give up on one's, finite concept of who and what your god is. Using your finite mind to try to grasp infinity is like asking a fish to comprehend all the oceans of the world. You're bound to find something you aren't 100% ready for such as grace/love that passes all understanding. If you don't, you're not being honest with yourself in your search. Maybe your god isn't even a ""He!""

, Religion and your god are not the same. It isn't necessary to decide on a denomination to find your god.

,, Change your mind. Do not allow yourself to be discouraged, in the way of finding your god's grace by faith. Don't look to others to get you to your god, but try to express your god's grace with all your heart, to help others, forgive and pray.

Without accepting the light of grace and faith you could not see your path/way. Seek the old path.

, Give peace to others; pass God's grace forward. ""Blessed are peacemakers""."

Join clubs or organizations that expresses your personality and mirrors your interests.,
Ask other people for help.,
Don't be afraid to open up about your feelings to other people.,
Keep other people's secrets.,
Keep your promises.,
Lean on your friends in a time of need.,
Lean on your family when you need to.,
Have deep conversations with people.",How to Find Happiness in Life2," Whether that interest is bowling, knitting, debating, experimenting, cooking, flying, sporting, or gaming, getting involved with a community of like-minded people will make a huge difference.


When you get there for the first time, introduce yourself. Try not to act shy. Maintain eye contact; try to stay relaxed. Remind yourself that other people are likely to be just as nervous as you are.

, Don't be afraid to ask your friends for help. When you do, be appreciative. As mentioned earlier, people get satisfaction out of helping others out; it makes them feel useful and accomplished. Guess what? Useful and accomplished people are generally happy and fun to get along with. That means that you'll have an easier time socializing and just being yourself around them.


Ask for help on your homework
Ask for directions when you're lost
Ask for help on a project
Ask for advice on a problem you're dealing with

, Holding it all in can be a tricky thing: you can feel stifled, like you have no one to open up to. For these reasons, it's best to trust in other people and tell people you trust about what you're going through. Talking about your problems, with a friend or a professional, can help you reach catharsis, which is a word for the cleansing of emotions.

, If someone trusts you enough to let you in on their secret, be good enough to keep it. That means no gossip, no accidentally letting it slip, and no playing sides against one another. Imagine what would happen if you told someone your secret and they let it accidentally ""slip"" to a group of other people? You'd be hurt and feel betrayed. Don't make the other person feel the same way. Finding happiness is all about keeping your friends close and giving them good reason to trust you.

, Along the same message: if you say you're going to do something, follow through with it. Words are only words until they're made true by actions. Understand that your friends depend on you; keeping your promises will help reassure them that you're a man or woman of your word.


What does happiness have to do with keeping promises? Following through on your promises is all about teaching trust. You teach your friends to trust you. If you constantly promise things that you can't deliver, your friends will stop trusting you. If your friends stop trusting you, you'll find that your friends aren't as close.

, When you're down and need someone to cheer you up, call a friend or two. Find a productive, fun way to keep your mind off of what's bothering you. Your friends believe in you. They're your friends because they want to see you happy, and because they enjoy spending time with you. Hopefully, they would do as much for you as you would do for them. Lean on them when you need to.

, Your family loves you unconditionally, even if they might not show it in the clearest of ways. Your family cares, first and foremost, about your safety and well being. Next, they want to see you succeed and live a fulfilling life. Even just talking with your family about problems you may be having can feel really good.

Try not to worry about your family judging you; ultimately, what they want is for you to be able to find happiness on your own. If you're afraid of telling your parents something, find a friend or another family member to open up to.
You don't have to have a ""problem"" in order to talk or hang out with your family. If you can talk with your family about normal, everyday things, that might bring a lot of happiness to you. Opening up to your family about everyday things is a huge step you can begin to take in your relationship with them.







, One study has found that people who engage in deep conversations experience more happiness than people who chitchat about small, trifling things.So next time you find yourself gossiping about the weather or what Rihanna wore to the Grammy's, resist the temptation to talk about life's emptier subjects and reach for something big and bold. You won't regret it!

Identify your potential/ abilities.,
Set goals


Create a mental picture of what you want to achieve in life then break it down into achievable goals.,
Be happy.,
Reward achievement.,
Meditate and relax.,
Exercise and recreate.,
Seek knowledge.,
Help others.,
Maintain spiritual connection with giver of life.",How to Lead an Excellent Godly Life," Discovering your purpose mainly entails answering the question - ‘why life’ or ‘why am I here on earth’. The author of human life (God) had a good reason for creating you. Finding His reason for your life and realizing it will lead you to the path of excellence. To discover your purpose identify the cause you’re most passionate about. That's a good indication of the purpose you're meant to serve.;
, To enable you fulfill your purpose, God strategically deposited potential in you. This potential is the tool you need to fulfill your divine assignment. Identify your potential by singling out the activities you excel in and enjoy doing.

,
Further break down the overall goal into short-term goals
Finally, incorporate the short-term goals into your day-to-day routine

, Being happy always is a personal decision that only you can make. Contrary to common belief, happiness is independent of every other factor. Conquer happiness drainers by appreciating life as a gift from God and understand whatever else that happens in your life is a gift wrapper procured by your actions. Mark you; a gift wrapper does not change the value or make of a gift. Therefore, celebrate the valuable gift of life despite what wraps it.

, Treat yourself whenever you achieve a goal. A token goes a long way in motivating you to keep on pursuing your goals.

, Take time off to meditate and relax. Doing this will release stress and bring relaxation. It also clears off your mind and prepares it for fresh new ideas.

, Engage in regular exercise and recreational activities. Exercise keeps the body fit and leaves you with a feeling of wellness. On the other hand, recreation brings refreshment and stimulates creativity.

, Know yourself, your society, your world. Develop a keen interest on life and everything that pertains it. Knowledge of the systems in the world not only gives you insight into what you’re up against, but also enables you to cope and adapt easily. In short, it gives you an upper hand on matters of life.

, Reach out to someone in need and help them overcome their limitation. Giving is a gesture of love and care. By showing love and care to a needy person through giving, you not only help them in achieving their objective but you also make a timeless investment for your life. Because whatever a man sows he reaps.

, Establish a strong relationship with your maker. He knows why He created you and therefore walking with Him along the journey of life is giving Him a chance to monitor your purpose closely as it unfolds. There is no formula of talking to God, you just need to focus your mind on Him and begin a conversation.

Keep an open mind.,
Meet the religious leaders, preachers and teachers in your neighborhood.,
Ask yourself, ""Why do I need or want to follow a religion?"",
Beware of cults.,
Don't make a quick decision especially as a young person.,
Find a particular religion to follow if you can.,
Avoid assuming that ""one religion is just as good as the other"" for yourself.,
Learn about the good and the bad aspects of certain religions.,
Think about what you believe about God or gods: If you believe there is only one God, then your choice of religions is narrowed down to monotheistic religions.,
Check to see which religions fit your beliefs when discussing the physical presence of God(s).",How to Find the Right Religion for You," First of all, you should get away from things you've heard about and start with a clean slate. This is one way to learn Truth. Your first task is to learn about religions, not necessarily to pick one for yourself right off the bat. Go to the library and find books on some religions. After you get the preliminary information on each religion, go to their original texts if you wish. Keep reading and learning. Do not accept or reject anything at this point, just keep learning.;
, Ask them about their views on life, God(s), relationships, ethical conduct, and their daily practice of their religion. Ask friends and neighbors whom you trust. Think about the fact that religion is not just facts but accepting a tradition and a potentially important set of beliefs.

, Remember that religion can be an escape, much like a drug. Cults can especially provide a drug-like escape. What is the real reason that you want to follow a religion?

, Cults are social or religious groups that often control their members mentally, physically, maritally or sexually. Beware of their ""Guru""s that claim to have all the answers to life's questions. Beware of tight groups that ask people to strictly conform to certain behaviors, abandon their friends and family, ask for mandatory donations, etc.

, Take the time to learn about the world. Learn about life, faith, people, religion and seek education including history. Then keep reading about your favorite religions.


It may help if good friends or family members share what their beliefs are and why they believe in them; learn about the their religions if you find them desirable.

, These include Buddhism and Buddha, Christian and Jesus Christ (the Messiah), Islam and the prophet Muhammad, Judaism and the Torah, or others.

, That very well may be far from true.

, It is important to know about negative and positive actions done by people who claim a particular religion. Decide for yourself if these people were properly following the religion or if they were simply abusing their power.

, If you believe in Gods (more than one deity), then your choice of religions is narrowed down to polytheistic religions. If you believe that God is all, and all is God, then your choice of religions is narrowed down to pantheistic religions.

, Some religions believe that God(s) is/are not a physical entity, while some religions do believe that God(s) is/are physical entities that have bodies of their own. Some believe that God(s) has/have been found in human form on Earth, while others believe that this has not happened.

, Will you celebrate Christmas, Chanukah, Valentine's Day, birthdays, or new holidays? Why do you celebrate these holidays? How do you celebrate each holiday? What is the holidays name? Example: Christmas - the birthday of Christ- Christmas, tree, cookies, Santa, presents, etc.

, Think about clothing, food, school, work, play, hobbies, manners, and anything else affected. Now some things might not be affected, others might only be slightly affected, some might be completely affected. In some religions everything will be affected, completely or slightly. In others, nothing except worship will change. In some, you can change aspects, but you don't have to. In others, you must. Some are sort of loose about these changes, others are very strict.

, Should they build a shrine(how?)? Should they pray? Should they meditate? Have you discovered a new way to worship? Make sure to give it a name and (in detail) how to do it. In religion, worship is very important. Where should worship be done? Does it matter where? Things to consider: where, when, how, who(mother, youngest daughter, everyone, does it matter?), be specific.

, Will you write one? What is in the scripture? What is the purpose of having of this scripture?

,, Get the word out. Tell everyone you can. Try to convert people and change close minded skeptics. Don't worry if some people shun you, and you don't convert everyone don't get put off by a few people.

Decide what self-enrichment means for you.,
Write in a journal or a diary each day.,
Go to the library.,
Try one new physical activity for two months.,
Learn a new language.,
Improve your social skills.,
Brush up on old or long-forgotten skills or activities.,
Meditate on inspirational quotes or verses or sacred text daily for a month.,
Watch inspirational video clips on YouTube on various inspirational topics that you might find to be of interest.",How to Enrich Yourself Within a Year," Although the word ""rich"" is found within this enrichment, making money or being wealthy aren't the ways to enrich yourself considered in this article. Instead, it focuses in making your internal and inter-relational life richer. For example, perhaps you'd like to perfect a talent, learn a new skill, network more widely, visit a place that has special meaning to you, improve your sense of belonging in the world or become more spiritual. Whatever it is, define it before you begin your enrichment journey.;
, Use the Cornell note-taking method (see 'citations' section below if you are not familiar with Cornell note-taking). When writing in the journal or diary, use the following to guide you:


Always record the date of your journal/diary entry.
Write about current events.
Write about your mood and feelings.
Write about your goals you want to pursue throughout the year.
Write about anything else that you personally want to write about.


Consider buying a separate planner that contains a calendar to help keep you organized with your enrichment goals. Although this is optional, it can be useful to keep you focused.

, This is an opportunity to explore new interests and to find out things you're not yet aware of.


Pick two books: one that interests you and one that does not interest you.
Read one book for one month, write about it in your journal/diary.  State your opinion on the book and anything else you want to write about pertaining to the book.
During the next month, read the second book and write about it in your journal/diary.
You could pick a fiction and non-fiction book (e.g. the fiction book could be a mystery genre or science fiction and the non-fiction book could be a history book or a biography on a person whom you might want to exemplify some day).

, Learn as much as you can about the activity or sport and practice it to keep your body healthy. In your free time, write about it in your journal/diary.

, Research a language that you might find interesting and study it for two months.  Write about it in your journal/diary and record your voice on your cell phone or other recording device to practice.  If you are really interested in this phase, try signing up for a class in the second month that will further your educational enrichment on the language and use your journal/diary to write about the language.

, Communicate with your family members, old friends and new acquaintances. Cut off toxic relationships that poison or hinder your self-enrichment. Write about your relationships with people in your journal/diary.

, Was there some type of skill that you embarked on when you were younger but abandoned as you grew older? Try picking it up again and practice it for two months to see if you remembered it and journal if you have improved this particular activity or skill after the month is over.

Dress up for the occasion.,
Wear bright colors if you feel so inclined.,
Avoid clothes that might be deemed inappropriate.,
Bring a sweater or wrap with you.,
Wear cute but sensible heels.",How to Dress for a Baby's Baptism1," Baptisms call for a fancier attire than what you might wear everyday. You should invest in a pretty dress, skirt, or pantsuit, or wear one that you already own. As a guide for how classy your outfit should be--you should be more dressed up than if you were at a backyard barbecue, but less dressed up than if you were attending a wedding.Some outfit ideas include:


A dress with an optional wrap or light sweater.
A skirt and blouse that is not too revealing.
Tailored pants with a smart top (think business casual).;
, Unlike weddings, baptisms don’t have any rules about what colors you can and can’t wear (its pretty unlikely that you’ll match the baby, unless you show up in white from head to foot). Because this is a happy occasion, feel free to wear bright colors and interesting patterns., While there might not be restrictions on color choice, there are restrictions on what cuts of clothing you can wear. Avoid showing off your bare shoulders and definitely avoid low-cut necklines. If you pick out a dress or skirt, make sure that it reaches down below your knees--miniskirts are frowned upon.Other clothes that you should avoid include: jeans, flip flops, Uggs, sneakers, or anything that you might see at a nightclub.

, Churches can get pretty chilly, especially during colder months. You can kill two birds with one stone when you wear a sweater or jacket--it will make your outfit seem more demure, and it will keep you warm.

, Sky-high heels are generally not appropriate for a baptism. Instead, wear lower heels that you can walk and stand comfortably in. Wear shoes appropriate for the weather--if its snowing outside you might want to leave your open-toed slingbacks at home.

Dress to impress.,
Pick out a fun tie.,
Wear some nice dress shoes.,
Consider bringing a change of clothes for the reception.",How to Dress for a Baby's Baptism2," Pick out either a sport coat or suit that looks good while also being relatively comfortable. While some baptisms may be more casual than others, if you are unsure about how dressy the event is, go for a suit. If you want to skip the sport coat, you can also generally wear a nice dress shirt and tie paired with some killer slacks., Baptisms are a happy occasion and your tie should reflect that. This doesn’t mean you should break out that tie covered in cartoon characters for the occasion. However, ties in light colors and fun patterns are definitely acceptable. Make sure your tie matches with the rest of your outfit’s color scheme.

, Shoes are an important part of every outfit--particularly an outfit that involves a suit. Ditch the sneakers and wear some dress shoes. Before the big day, buff your shoes up to give them a bit of shine.

, If you’re going to a party or reception after the baptism and really can’t stand being in a suit for very long, you could bring a change of clothes that still look nice but are more comfortable than a suit. An appropriate change of clothes would consist of a nice polo and some ironed khakis."
"
Dress your kids up in church-appropriate clothing.,
Think about comfort.,
Pick out comfortable shoes.",How to Dress for a Baby's Baptism3," While they might want to wear their favorite animal onesie day in and day out, you will have to pick out some nice clothes for your kids. For girls, dresses in bright colors or floral patterns are a great option. Boys can wear corduroys or khakis and a collared shirt. Other clothing ideas include:


For girls: A dress and sweater; a skirt and blouse; some khakis, a blouse, and a sweater.
For boys: Khakis and a button up shirt; corduroys and a sweater; slacks and a polo shirt.

, While it’s important to keep the dress code in mind, you also don’t want fidgeting children making a ruckus at the baptism. When picking out their outfits, like the ones listed in the previous step, make sure that the materials are comfortable and loose fitting. If possible, let your kids pick out which fancy clothes they want to wear--they will be happier if they’ve picked out what they want to wear.


You can skip the tights for your little girls--this is a semi-formal event and there is no need to squish them into tights unless specifically asked to do so by the church or family that is having the baptism.

, Like tights, fancy, uncomfortable kids shoes are probably not necessary. However, it is your call. If you do decide to have your kids wear dress shoes, make sure to bring comfortable shoes that they can change into for the reception.

Explain what ""Theism"" is.,
Request 'proof' of 'their' beliefs.,
Ask how and why inter-dependent and inter-related systems could begin from muck or salt water, primordial soup?,
Challenge their idea of what evidence is acceptable.",How to Explain or Defend Theism," It’s the belief in the existence of a god, gods, or the God. It is independent of religion (although inclusive of most). If you believe in an all powerful, all intelligent being, you are a theist.;
, Since Theism is a belief about the supernatural, the challenger will assert that you cannot be justified in believing in supernatural beings. This assertion will take the form of “It isn’t justifiable unless it is a logical truth, quantitative truth, or a conclusion made by using the Scientific Method” (they dwell on the Scientific Method). Start by demanding that they prove that those are the only sources of truth and have them prove that there can’t be any other way to know something. You can remain skeptical and they can’t meet the demand, but usually all of this is skipped (it’s implicit). It’s up to you if you want to slow them down and take them back to what they’ve assumed. (Though if they know anything about the Burden of proof, this will be refuted easily.)


Usually they’ll talk a lot about how reliable science is and that it is based on “hard facts”, and they will demand that you offer any such “hard evidence” for the existence of God or a god. “Hard evidence” means something that can be experienced with one of the five senses.
Either, you can build an argument that says that by looking closely at a number of aspects of our universe (including not just complexity, but inter-dependency, inter-related systems, order, balance, life dependent on life, depending on a supporting planet , etc.) the best conclusion for these is that there is an intelligent designer of it all and logically it would have to be a prime mover (non-contingent being).

, Actually is simple life not simple at all:


Why are there no cells without parent cells, for all observed living cell(s), and all with detailed behaviors, DNA, RNA, assembly line controlled by genes with precise genetic and epigenetic codes to self make oneself, self replicating of traits, chromosomes, cell division, not dividing into half a life, but a whole vital life -- with a cause?
Why did such a cell ever begin and ""then"" reproduce that life form with coded, defined actions, needing and making amino acids, making protein, using many minerals, doing thousands of precisely inter-related chemical reactions, all within the one tiny, microscopic cell?
How did life just happen to start within a needed semipermeable protein-based cell membrane (or in viruses with a semi-crystalline structure/membrane), with required internal cytoplasm (specific cellular fluid), purposeful digestion, required to utilize digested material to build, grow and/or to have energy, having organelles (microscopic, organ like features), some having internal skeletal-like structures and motility/mobility by appendages such as flagella, or cilia, all in a one cell life?

, Their notion of ""Hard evidence"" (""empirical"" evidence) is supposed to give that evidence higher value than other evidence. Your “other” experience is marginalized and you need to demonstrate that it is in fact justification for your understandings. For example, your experience of the deity is like someone who is looking at a rainbow. His friend who has never been able to see is demanding to know how it smells, tastes, feels or sounds. What can you say? Explain to them that by demanding evidence for one of the five senses is not only impossible for you, but also would fail to do anything to portray your experience. You might discover faith by science using common experience and thoughtfulness?


Or you can assert that theism is a matter of understanding and judgment, such as reasoning by a form of knowledge and information called faith, perhaps by faith alone (if that is possible). Since they are claiming that you are doing something wrong by believing without being justified by “hard evidence” and the Scientific Method, they are making an ethics decision to make that claim. You can challenge the ethics of their epistemology by supporting the fact and virtue of faith. They, also, decide what to believe based on their own judgment (resulting in scientific statements alone), you do the same and have the faith to believe in someone that you don’t usually experience with your five senses (resulting in scientific statements and theistic beliefs). If you want to move into the ethics of epistemology you can ask them who made it more virtuous not to trust in anything but science, and since their answer will be a person or people, you can assert that it’s more virtuous to have faith than not and your answer will be just as good as theirs since you’re a person and you share these beliefs with a group of people. This will likely lead you down a long rabbit trail.
The most simplest way to explain it, however, is to tell them in these words ""If you do not believe in an intelligent force/creator, then you're basically saying that none of your beliefs about the universe are based on intelligence"". This would not be intended to insult, but would be to point out how relevant the ability to put facts together (intelligence) is when it comes to the truth. Make sure you let them know that God is not a specific thing, God is characterised by the abilities that are portrayed in his creation. The existence of facts alone proves his intelligent capabilities.

Know that you are not alone.,
Understand that Unitarian Universalism is a non dogmatic religion without a creed that you must accept.,
Find a church in your area.,
Ask questions.,
Sign the membership book.",How to Convert to Unitarian Universalism," Many people are Unitarian Universalists. You may have heard of ""Unitarian"" but not ""Universalist."" They used to be two separate religions but merged into one denomination in the early 1960s. Thomas Jefferson was a Unitarian (which later became Unitarian Universalism) and there are many more examples of famous reformers who came from one side or the other of the faith.;
, In this religion, you are free to explore, refine, and change your religious beliefs. If you don't believe that others are similarly allowed to explore and express their own beliefs, you will probably find yourself uncomfortable in a UU congregation. ""The worth and dignity of every person"" is a common theme among UUs, who tend to support liberal causes. Although it is entirely possible to be a religious liberal and a political conservative, it can be a challenge to be a UU because the members generally hold very liberal views on such issues as economic fairness, gay rights, immigration reform, etc. Political conservatives may need to insist on their right to hold their own views and remind other UUs what it means to accept diversity.

, This could be done by using Google Maps or visiting the website of the Unitarian Universalist Association (www.uua.org). There are many UU churches around the world. Most congregations will accept you and are used to people visiting just to learn about their religion.

, UUs love questions and the questioning spirit! That's why most of them came to this faith. After your first service, you will most likely have many questions. If the congregation has a minister, she or he will be glad to talk with you or make an appointment. If not, find someone to talk with at the social hour. They say, however, that ""if you've seen one UU service, you've seen one UU service."" Services can vary widely from week to week, even within one congregation, so find out the upcoming service topics, pick a few interesting ones, and attend more than once.

, Once you decide that you want to make a commitment to the congregation, find out from the minister or one of your new UU acquaintances what you would need to do to become a member. There may be an orientation class to attend, or it may be as simple as signing your name to a membership book.

, You can change tools to what you have on hand, remove them, add them, or use none at all. You should have one symbolic tool or item for each corner/direction/element, some candles and a compass for knowing which direction you should be facing. Here are some suggestions for corner correspondences:


East/Air- feathers, incense, dried lavender, citrine, white quartz, athame
South/Fire- a red candle, volcanic rock, heated stones, ruby, gold, brass
West/Water- a jar of seawater, shells, mirrors, silver, chalice, pearls
North/Earth- soil, fresh herbs, oats, salt, clay figures, wooden tools

, It doesn't matter which one you choose first, since you can always try a different one if it doesn't work out.

, They do not have to be thick or expensive. Instead, look at one important thing: the author. The author should be an influential stature in the religion, like Yusuf Al-Qaradawi for Islamic books, because they are the believer and know the ins and outs of the religion. Avoid books written by a practitioner of religion about another religion, because they will only express an outsider's opinion.

, Try to chat with him or her about their religion. Is it hard to follow the teachings? Are there any misconceptions about the religion? Why do they celebrate certain days? What is it like in heaven and hell? This can give you a taste of what it is like to follow that religion, although one person's experiences probably will not be enough for you to form a conclusion.

, This way, you can judge it from your own perspective. Try to imitate their culture: learn about their clothes, language, and foods.

, While you are there, find information of the religion. When did the religion started? How did it was spread to other places? How can you prove this religion is true? People will help you if you asked them nicely. Visit a place of worship and ask any questions you need answered.

, You can try out as many as you need to find which is right for you.

, This step is your biggest step towards getting a life filled with contentment. Think about all you have learned to help you choose. You can ask your family members for opinions, but in the end, the decision is up to you.

, Have a happy and blessed life!

Separate physical measurements from believing.,
Replace proof with trust.,
Stop trying to control everything.",How to Believe in God1," Think of knowing God not by measurable events, but through an intangible presence in everything you do. God is Spirit, experienced intuitively, somewhat like experiencing love, air and gravity, and unfathomable love and grace.


Knowing of God has more to do with the heart (core beliefs) than with objects. The belief you form through faith and in a Higher Power than yourself, does not just happen. You do not wake up one morning, brush your teeth, and say, ""today I am going to believe in God. Today I am going to have faith"". Something has to happen for you to need and to seek out that faith.If you approach faith from this premise, then you will see that believing in God is about reflecting on the impact He has on you and on others.
You'll find that believing is not by material means but by personal development of spiritual faith, since God is generally viewed as a living spirit, not having a decaying body,He can be measured by intangible things, like acknowledging His presence, our beliefs, plus our ways and reactions.
Think about all the things you believe in. You may believe that a team is the best team in your sport, for example. But what is this based on? Do you favor them because they have superior statistics and more championships? Chances are you favor them because of the specific impact they have on you as a fan. Your appreciation for them is based on something inside you, individual, and immeasurable.;
, Having faith involves taking a choice. This means deciding to trust without absolute certainty.Chances are you make decisions on faith every day. If you've ever ordered food from a restaurant, you've taken a step of faith. That particular restaurant may have a high customer rating and stellar health score, but chances are you haven't witnessed firsthand your food being made. You have to trust that the chefs have washed their hands and prepared your food properly/safely.
Seeing isn't always believing. There are still things science can't measure, yet people still believe in them. For example, astronomers cannot actually see black holes in outer space, because by definition they absorb materials and the light that is necessary for us to observe them.But by observing the behavior of matter and the orbits of stars around a black hole, we can predict that one is present. God is also non-viewable but has knowable qualities and observable influence, that draws people to Him.
Think of a time a family member has been sick and gotten better. Did you ever pray or hope to something higher for their recovery? Maybe this event is like an orbiting star, and God is like gravity that is exerting His pull on all things., Probably across all religions that have a concept of God, this belief is constant: God created all things.Because God is the creator, only He is in full control.


Relinquishing control of certain aspects of your life does not mean you are powerless. Don't think of God as a puppeteer pulling your strings, but as a parent keeping you safe. You still choose the course of your life, but life may not turn out the way you plan or wish. In times like this, it's important to remember that God is there to help you.Knowing that you are not in control of everything can be empowering. Recovery programs like Alcoholics Anonymous are founded on the premise that people are not fully in control, and that belief in a higher power restores balance by yielding one's broken ego.Once we accept that we cannot control everything, we learn to accept things we can control.
Consider the Serenity Prayer: ""God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.""There are many things you can change but things you can't. You may believe that there are higher powers that shape your life's outcome. This is a great starting place for discovering faith in God.

"
"
Go to places of worship.,
Talk to people who believe in God.,
Pray and acknowledge God in all you say and do.,
Don't think of bad outcomes as the result of God not listening or being present, but of His answering your prayer in a way you haven't considered yet.",How to Believe in God2," Try attending a Jewish or Christian church service. Listen to the words that the minister, rabbi or pastor is saying and try relating it to your life.


Ministers often deliver a speech, called a sermon, that relates every day life to beliefs in God. See if things the priest is saying connects with you on a personal level. Though you may not know the specifics of the Bible, maybe a sentiment or point the speaker makes will connect with you in a big way (for example, treating your neighbor as you would treat yourself).Don't worry about not being of that faith. Though you may be restricted from partaking in certain practices, like receiving communion (bread wafer that symbolizes Jesus' body),there are no restrictions for listening. In fact, leaders are often excited when non-religious people become curious and interested in the teachings of God.
Church services fall on Sunday and usually last about an hour. Synagogue services fall on Saturday. It is customary for regular patrons to arrive on time and stay throughout, although it is not mandatory for casual attendees.Catholic mass is usually a formal to semi-formal event. Be sure that you dress appropriately. Collared shirts, dress pants, and long dresses are acceptable attire.Also remember to be respectful; no cellphone usage and no chewing gum during church services.

, Maybe someone you know has a well-founded relationship with God. Talk to him or her about why and how faith is so strong.


Ask questions. ""Why do you believe in God?"" ""What makes you sure that God is there?"" ""Why should I believe in God?"" These are all questions that a friend might have a unique insight to.Remember to be respectful and ask questions in a curious but non-aggressive manner.

Pastors aren't only available during conversion or confession. If you attend church on a weekday, chances are you will be able to talk to him before or after a service. Such teachers of God will likely be happy to answer any questions you have about believing in Him.

, Many religions believe that a good relationship with God starts with steady prayer of communication with Him.God will likely not respond verbally to your prayers, but there are other signs that show He is listening.


Prayer is especially important in times of need. Many people have a misconception that prayer is a vehicle for wish fulfillment. Actually, prayer is not asking God to solve all your problems for you; it is asking him to help you deal with your problems/opportunities.You might have a tough decision ahead of you: pursue a job or continue on with your education? Try praying to God for guidance. See what choice you make and observe the outcome. Though things may not end up how you plan, think of this as another opportunity to pray.

, The Bible emphasizes the fact that God works in mysterious ways.Think of God as a teacher, helping you learn important life lessons not by just giving you the answer, but by helping you arrive at that answer yourself. Think back to school and ask yourself, ""Did my teachers tell me the answers, or teach me how to understand issues and solve problems?"" Think of events in your life as ""lessons"" more so than ""answers."""
"
Volunteer.,
Do good deeds.,
Show love and concern to find God.",How to Believe in God3," Try giving to others less fortunate than you by helping out at a soup kitchen or food drive.


Believing in a higher power means shifting the emphasis off yourself. Helping others is a great opportunity to look at your life from a different perspective. Interacting with others who are less fortunate often helps you appreciate things you take for granted in your life.
Basic things like having shelter, eating food, or being able to sleep soundly are luxuries that some don't have. These are all things that you can thank God for and can help you believe God is looking out for you.
Be thankful and be persistent. Notice how people who have been not had certain things can still thrive. Tony Melendez, a man born without arms, recently played the guitar for Pope John Paul II using his feet.Being thankful for the things you have shifts attention from all the things that are missing in your life. Focus on the positive; optimism is a stepping stone to believing in something greater than yourself.

, Try extending your charitable acts to everyday life. Volunteering is both unselfish and generous, but don't overlook the little things.


When Peter talked about the healing of the paralysed man (Acts 3:2-8) he described it as a good deed (Acts 4:9) True believers in God can also offer healing of the sick as Peter did


, You can team with God to serve as His hands and feet. Simply holding open the door for someone can brighten that person's day. Little things like smiling, giving up your seat to the elderly on public transportation, or just saying ""thank you"" can bring you closer to God. Don't underestimate the effect a good deed can have on your feeling and believing how a higher power affects others through you.Think of times when someone, maybe even a complete stranger, has done something good to you. Maybe you dropped your cell phone and someone picked it up and stopped you to return it. Did you ever pause to think about that person's actions? Maybe that person was an answer to your simplest prayer: ""Please God, just help me get through today.""
""God bless you"", have you ever helped someone and been told that? Try letting those words truly sink in and appreciate that deeply. What if a good deed is really God telling you that He hears and sees us and allows your intents and purposes to express His love?

Create a god or gods.,
Make it in charge of something people already focus on, but don't have a target for that focus.,
Make it something that people will be reminded of frequently.,
Make it easy for them to ""buy into"" the worship of your New God.,
Make it ambiguous.,
Establish some standards by which the God should be referred to, creating an intrinsic reverence right from the start.,
Make sure that the full title and name are always capitalized.,
Make cool symbols.,
You need an opposing force.,
Notice how we have used all the rules so far with this name and the subtle effects it engenders.,
You need to confuse everybody.,
And last but certainly not least:


The Big Reward.,
And the always present but never written down (written down here because I can't whisper it in your ear) Eleventh Rule:


Get the word out!",How to Create Your Own Religion in Your Pretend Country," One with a catchy name is best. Should be simple and out of the ordinary, but not too far out that people can't remember it.


In our example we will create ""The Great god Lardicus"". It has ""Lard"" in the name which people already associate with fast food. It has ""-icus"" at the end of it, which sounds Greek, so it must be old and have centuries of tradition behind it.;
,


In this case, eating too much fast food and poor dietary practices. Poof! Millions of people are now in your target audience.

,


In this case, whenever they think of fast food, they will think of Lardicus after reading this (at least for a while). In fact, the next time you drive down the road you may think of The Great God Lardicus at least once. And the second time, you'll think of it because you'll remember thinking of it the first time. And so on. See how easy that was!

,


In this case, whenever you eat fast food, you are honoring The Great God Lardicus.
Whenever you pay at the drive-in window, you are tithing to The Great God Lardicus.

, Let both sides of an argument claim it as their own.


In this case, is The Great God Lardicus a ""Dark God"" bent on destroying The Temple Of Your Physical Being, or is he a ""Light God"" and the patron of those who are too busy in their lives to stop and eat a well-balanced meal?
Why define it when you can let people fight it out themselves. People are funny. They'll fight over anything. Even something you just made up. Enjoy the show and try not to think too much about the Karmic issues you are creating for yourself.

,


In this case, The Great God Lardicus must always be referred to as ""The Great God"" Lardicus. Once people see this a few hundred times, they'll start believing it without even realizing it.

, This is because that everybody knows that something that has capital letters is much more important than something that isn't.


This is called ""Marketing"" and all the Most Holy of The Great God Lardicus' High Priests study the Dark Arts of Marketing and practice it many times a day in their Most Holy Rites.

, They should be things that people already know and see everywhere. And they should be easy to draw and say.


In our case, The Great God Lardicus's symbols will be the Arch, the Crown and Pigtails. (If you think you'd look silly in pigtails, just substitute an image of a Pig, which works well when you think of bacon, pork chops, and the obvious ""pig"" symbolism). You'll suddenly start seeing The Great God Lardicus's symbols everywhere. Temples to The Great God Lardicus will appear, as if by Divine Intervention, on every street corner in every town across the nation.

, Not necessarily an arch-enemy, but an opposite perspective so that people can pick sides and fight over things.


Remember the stuff about people up there in Number 5? If everybody gets along, nobody will ever hear about your new religion. Most people hardly ever talk about how happy and content they are with their spirituality. In fact, many feel that they have to impose their beliefs on others in order to validate themselves and their beliefs. Because if you can get other people to be convinced to believe the same thing you do, you must be right! And that validates your choices. You want to play into that if you're going to be creating your own religion.
In this case, we will create The Gentle Goddess Dietima.

, Let's review:


It has ""Diet"" in the name, which is obviously the opposite of ""Lard"". It sounds Greek too, so it fits nicely into our freshly created pantheon of pseudo-Greek deities.
It sounds catchy. And it should. Because we have simply co-opted the name of an actual character from Greek Literature, Diotima. Many people will vaguely (but not quite) remember her name from a high school or college class. This is another great technique when you are creating a new religion: overlay your gods, legends, temples, holy days and whatever else you can think of over top of the ones used by The Other Religions. Why invent something new when you can simply co-opt it and claim it as your own? Then people can fight over who stole what from whom and the nefarious motivations for doing so. People love to fight, and it would be cruel of you to deny them this chance.
Who hasn't been on or thought about going on a diet? The Gentle Goddess Dietima is the patron for you! Is there anyone you know that isn't painfully aware of diets and dieting?
It sounds Feminine with just the right mix of Fluffy-Bunny and Wise Woman. It is sweet enough for the flowering gentle pre-teen who wants a kinder, more understanding world but it also sounds great for attracting the people who would never worship a masculine meat-eating fatso un-environmentally-conscious goat-mater like Grease God Lardicus!
Intolerance is fun and yet still makes you feel superior and important, while at the same time elevating you to the moral high-ground above those who you don't agree with.
Notice how we have made The Gentle Goddess Dietima attractive to the entire spectrum of human emotion! Now we can just sit back and watch Her Faithful fight over which of her aspects is ""The Real One"".
The Gentle Goddess Dietima should always referred to as ""The Gentle Goddess"", unless you are in need of her unspecified warrior attributes which are whatever you want them to be whenever you want to use them.
Dietima's symbols are the cute adorable little bunny (because nobody could not love a cute adorable little bunny), a curved silver knife (crescent moon shaped, great for cutting earth-friendly veggies to eat and tilling the ground, and useful for those unspecified warrior aspects, and similar enough to the Arch to cause more fun bickering) and the egg (fertility, orb shapes are common, and it will further confuse the whole spring holiday symbolism thing and cause more exciting discussions). Now back to the recipe book:

, This will make sure that nobody can be really certain WHAT they believe, because it is all so non-sensical to begin with. And when you don't spell it out exactly (or even if you do) you know how those funny humans will all magically just get along, right! In this case, we'll try to be real thorough here:


The Gentle Goddess Dietima and The Great God Lardicus are Divine Brother and Sister. However, they are also Husband and Wife. And The Great God Lardicus is the child of Himself and The Gentle Goddess Dietima. As is Dietima. They love each other, but argue and even fight regularly for a variety of reasons that we won't go into here because we want people to make up their own reasons, which they can then fight over.
We don't even have to explain how any of this is possible because they are Gods and can do whatever they want. We don't want to specify who was born first or the details of their immaculate self-conceptions, because that might give one side the upper hand in any arguments. Remember Rule Number 5: Keep it ambiguous.
The Gentle Goddess Dietima and The Great God Lardicus may or may not have other children, parents, siblings or acquaintances. We can add them in later if we want or need to, and then the old-timers (historians, scholars, etc.) can fight the new converts (who are always the most passionate about things) about whether they should ""really"" be in the pantheon or not, since they weren't there in the beginning. We'll probably just say we found some ancient scrolls that nobody is allowed to examine that mentioned them when we want to add in any new characters.

, You know everything you always wished you had in this life? After you die, you'll get it! We promise! Hot women. Cute Guys. Flying Cars. Washboard abs. Rivers of Chocolate that won't add an ounce or an inch to your perfectly fit, weightless body. And lots of cute, adorable fluffy bunnies to frolic with in virgin green pastures.
In our case, we guarantee that you'll get everything listed above. All the people you love in this life will be there. But not the people you don't like. They all go to ""The Other Place"". Don't worry. They'll get theirs. And you'll spend eternity in Paradise.

, What good is creating your own religion if you can't get people to worship your Gods and beg you for guidance because they don't trust themselves to navigate their own way through life? They'll be much better having an uninformed random someone else tell them what to do than looking at their own situation objectively and determining a logical path to take that is likely to help them improve their lot in life.

Know how you are going to address your God: his greatest attribute is that He is our Heavenly Father, and that He loves us all.,
Pray to God, as in one of these four categories: a) Petition; b)Gratitude, c)Repentance; and d)Praise.,
Be humble when praying to God.,
Ask the angels and saints in heaven to pray to God for you (Eg: Mary...etc), or even invoke the names of holy men or women when praying (Eg: God Of Abraham...etc.),
Conclude your prayer with ""Amen.""",How to Contact God," Therefore, when you pray to Him, call Him 'Lord,' or 'Father.';
, Petition is when we are asking a request of God. Gratitude is thanking Him for the way He fulfilled that request. Repentance is acknowledging our own sinful and weak natures, and hoping for His divine mercy. Praise is glorifying God, for the very sake of your love for Him.

, Remember, He is the Supreme Being and ultimate reality of the entire universe. He is far greater than we could possibly realize. We are his creation. So, when praying to Him, contemplate his unfathomable greatness, and love for you, a mere creature.

,

, 'Amen' means ""May it shall be.'

Get various books on general religion.,
Read hallowed religious texts.,
Determine how well the religion’s views align with your own after hearing its reasoning for its views.",How to Choose a Religion1," Before going in depth with any religion it would be a good idea to understand what religion is in general. Reading books about the nature of religions will improve your understanding of how and why people choose to be religious. Find a book that gives a good overview of the most popular religions in the world, and see which suits you most.;
, If you are serious about choosing a religion, it would make sense to read from the primary information source for each religion. Each text provides the very basis for the religion, the guidelines for practicing the religion. The following covers some of the sacred books of the more prominent religions of the world:Christians believe in the Bible, which is made up of both the Old and New Testament.
Jews believe in the Torah, which also has the first five books of the Bible.
Hindus follow the Vedas, four ancient Indian texts over 3000 years old.
The Quran, which was written near 652, is the holy book of Muslims.

, Religions have nearly infinite variations, interpretations, and followers. Each religion, however, has its own level of acceptance for specific acts. If you hold a personal stance near and dear to your heart that can’t be infringed upon, then look for the religion that most closely aligns with your internal beliefs. Think about a few of the hot-button topics related to religion.Sexual issues such as celibacy, abstinence, abortion, and birth control
War and peace towards fellow man
Treatment of those who believe in other religions

Learn about the many different religions which are out there, and about what their beliefs in God or gods are.,
Ask yourself, what exactly are you seeking spiritually.

,
Read the different Scriptures of various religions.,
Are you seeking a God which will help you with your relationship with nature?,
Learn the different stories which are associated with God or gods, in order to narrow down your choice.

,
Learn about the different kinds of evil entities, which different religions are trying to oppose, in order to narrow down your choice(Example: if you wish to oppose satanic evil, then most likely the God of Christianity or Islam is the one you wish to worship; or if its the delusions of the Mara, then it is most likely the Buddha whom you wish to follow).

,
Think about which virtues are most important to you.

Go to different religious places.,
Embrace the rituals.,
Talk with practitioners of various religions.,
Consult with religious leaders.",How to Choose a Religion2," In order to get a feeling of how each religion practices rituals, prayers etc., you would have to visit places where practitioners gather. Visiting places like churches, mosques and temples will give you a good indication of what religion would suit your mentality. Remember to be respectful of rules and regulations and prayer times.


While making your choice, finding a service that fits your schedule may be beneficial. You wouldn’t want the inconvenience of scheduling influencing a philosophical decision., Rituals are core elements in every known religion. They reinforce the basics and choice of the religion by connecting the practitioner to religiously significant events or beliefs. While visiting religious places you can study and perform the rituals in order to get an idea of what they require of you.Understanding why the procedures are practiced is just as important as performing the movements. Learn the importance and history of each movement.

, While outside of religious services, ask religious practitioners about the pros and cons of their religion. Get a feel of whether or not they would be welcoming of you, and if their belief structure aligns with what you have learned about the religion.


A few simple questions could provide a better feel for the environment. Ask things like: Why should a newcomer like me join this religion? How does this religion align with current events of the day?
If you at any time feel uncomfortable around a specific group of people, be sure to get a second set of worshippers to talk to about the religious details.
Judge whether those wishing you to join were evangelizing (telling you about the positive aspects) or proselytizing their religion (trying to get you to join).

, While speaking with practitioners is a good first step, the deeper meaning and understanding of religion’s tougher questions must come from religious leaders (e.g. priests, rabbis, imams). They are the guides for religious understanding, sometimes believed to be a conduit of sorts to the deity. Before meeting with the leader, ensure you have a basic grasp of the religion and can ask more profound questions. Potential questions follow:


What happens when we die?
Why do you believe in your religion over others?
What do you want others to know about their religion?
How does the religion respond/reply to current social problems?"
"
Write pros and cons about your potential choices.,
Consider the impact of your decision.,
Determine your ultimate goal.,
Commit fully to your new religion.",How to Choose a Religion3," When you have a greater understanding about various religions you would have to write pros and cons about each religion that has caught your interest. Making the list will simplify the choice of which religion to embrace. Remember, this is your list, not others'. Include only your opinions about the different religions. Religion is a very personal matter, so trust in what you believe yourself.


Truly think about which you believe to have the most merit, the most truth.
Think about which religion makes you feel the best, and the one you understand.Ask yourself which religions are to blame for the problems, hatred, and bloodshed of the era.

, The decision to choose a religion may not necessarily be personal. If your partner believes in a different religion, it could cause familial problems. If a new religion requires considerably more time than you are capable of devoting, it may be stressful to adopt.


If there is a preponderant religion in your country, culture, or family, you should seriously consider how it could negatively affect your life.

, What do you wish upon your death-bed for your future religion? Each religion handles the question of death differently. Some believe in reincarnation, others nirvana, Heaven, Hell, and every variation in between. If you live your life according the tenets of the religion, and believe wholeheartedly, what’s your preferred outcome?, Once you make the decision, religion requires commitment and faith. Make changes in your daily life that supplement beliefs and improves the trust you have in your religion. Consider a few of the following possible changes:


Pray more often. Prayer has been found to have a profound effect on people.
Increase your involvement. Go to more services, join choirs, study more regularly."
"
Determine why you find the religion of Jehovah's Witnesses appealing.,
Have a desire to know more about the Bible.,
Request a free home Bible study:


Ask for one the next time one of Jehovah's Witnesses come to your door.,
Study the Bible on a regular basis, usually weekly, with the help of an appropriate study aid publication.,
Apply what you are learning.,
Cope with opposition.,
Recognize the authority of the ""faithful and discreet slave"".,
Become an unbaptized publisher.,
Get baptized.",How to Become one of Jehovah's Witnesses," Do you like the high moral standards that Jehovah's Witnesses adhere to? Do you like the fact that they teach only things that are from the Bible? Do you like the Bibles message of living forever in a world free of pain, suffering and death? Would you like help to cope with your problems and find a purpose to life? Would you like to help others understand what the Bible really teaches? Are you dissatisfied with teachings of other Christian groups such as the trinity, hell fire and the immortality of the soul? Jehovah's Witnesses have answers from the Bible to such questions that many find appealing.;
, Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the entire Bible is the inspired Word of God, and instead of following human traditions or philosophy, they hold to the Bible as the standard for all their beliefs.

, They believe in the command by Jesus Christ to ""make disciples""(literally in Greek 'make learners') as found at Matthew 28:19,20. So there is a very real possibility that they will be knocking on your door someday, if they have not done so already.
Call or go to the local Kingdom Hall in your area, and request one.Or you can send in a written request online at the jw.org web site.

, Every one of Jehovah's Witnesses is a volunteer so there is no elite clergy class set aside for the teaching and preaching work.

Ask as many honest and heartfelt questions as it takes to determine if what you are learning is true.
Persist until you have found satisfying, Bible-based answers.







, Pray to Jehovah for help and also seek the assistance of your study conductor, and wholesome Christian associates to do this. Associate with Jehovah's Witnesses at their regularly held meetings. This will encourage you and strengthen your faith.

, It is not unusual for non-Witness family and friends to become alarmed when they learn of your interest in becoming on of Jehovah's Witnesses. One of the things you will learn is that your study is leading you to friendship with the Creator of the universe and you should not let anyone stop you from forming the best friendship you could ever have.

Consider the case of Steve and Selma highlighted in The Watchtower of February 15, 2012. When Selma tried to prove a point to Steve he became violent and hit her.
Rather than feel sorry for herself Selma was encouraged to make adjustments and be more Christian towards Steve. Years later Steve himself became a Witness.







, At Matthew 24:45 Jesus asked: ""Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics, to give them their food at the proper time?""

This ""slave"" is known as the Governing Body. To become one of Jehovah's Witnesses means accepting the authority of this ""faithful slave"", who it is believed are providing spiritual food at the proper time.
For example, The Watchtower of July 15, 2013 said ""It is vital that we recognize the faithful slave. Our spiritual health and our relationship with God depend on this channel."" (page 20)







, It is a great honor and a privilege to preach from door-to-door about Jehovah God. After all you are representing the Creator of the Universe. Speak to your Bible study conductor and the congregation elders to find out how you can qualify to preach about Jehovah along with Jehovah's Witnesses.

, Make a heartfelt dedication in prayer to serve Jehovah God forever. Meet with your local elders to determine if and when you are ready for baptism.

If you qualify, then arrangements will be made for your public declaration of dedication to Jehovah through water-immersed baptism at a public meeting (usually assembles and conventions).
Baptism is only the beginning. You must be determined to continue serving Jehovah forever. By doing so you will ensure for yourself a happy future.

Measure the overall length.,
Measure each individual digits.,
Measure your finger flexibility.,
Check your thumb flexibility.,
Check for knotty fingers.,
Feel the consistency of the thumb ball.,
Spacing.",How to Read Your Fingers," The overall length of your fingers is measured relative to the size of your palm. On average, the longest finger is about seven-eighths the size of your palm. If it is as long as your palm, then your fingers are considered long. Short fingers are shorter than seven-eighths of the palm. The overall length and size of a person's fingers can denote a common personality.


Long fingers signify a detail-oriented idea person. They think things through completely and tend to be critical of small details.
Short fingers signify a physically-oriented big picture person. They focus on real world items; usually in an overall manner.;
, The index and ring fingers are compared to each other. If the index finger is even a fraction longer, it is considered long. The ring finger must be 1/8 inch (1/2 cm) longer than the index finger before it is considered long.
The line drawn between these two fingers should be about halfway up the final joint on the middle finger. If more than half is above, the middle finger is long; less than half and it is considered short.
The pinkie finger should reach the joint line of the ring finger. If the pinkie starts low (first joint is less than half-way down the ring finger), you will need to adjust for this when measuring.
The thumb is usually measured against the index finger. Most thumbs end between 1/4 and 1/2 way up the first section of the finger.


The index finger is usually considered the most important in a palm reading. It is sometimes called the ""mirror"" finger as it describes a person's self-image.

A long index finger indicates a natural leader. They are used to responsibility and have high standards for themselves and others. They tend to be drawn to self-reflection whether it is keeping a journal, therapy, or an interest in astrology or palm reading.
A short index finger indicates a lower self-esteem. They may hide behind a persona they create and have trouble expressing their true feelings and thoughts. They are more likely to suffer from health issues that stem from self neglect such as smoking, alcoholism or unhealthy eating habits.


The middle finger, called the ""wall"" finger, represents your attitude towards authority and mental boundaries.

A long middle finger is found on a person who takes rules seriously. They respect not only the letter of the law, but also the intent behind it. They are serious, and can sometimes be called boring.
A short middle finger indicates a free spirit who marches to the beat of their own drum. Alternative paths seem highly attractive.
A difference between the dominant and non-dominant hands shows a difference in attitude between career (dominant hand) and family (passive hand).


The ring finger can only be long, it is never considered short. A long ring finger shows a need for attention and high self confidence.
The pinkie finger measures a person's communication and financial skills.

A long pinkie finger indicates good communication skills and a natural ability with money.
A short pinkie finger indicates a difficulty in expressing yourself. Developing the ability to communicate effectively may seem more difficult, but will greatly help to relieve frustration.
A low-set pinkie can indicate the need for a supportive father figure.


Your thumb is used as a measure of your willpower and self-control.

Short thumbs indicate a lower ability to stick things out when they get tough.
Long thumbs indicate high levels of self discipline and perseverance.



, This is an indication of the overall flexibility of your mind. Try to lightly push them back towards your wrists. Stiff fingers will barely move an inch. Flexible fingers will move almost all the way back; four inches or more.


Stiff fingers indicate stubbornness and significant mental willpower. Once you make up your mind about something, you are not open to changing it.
Flexible fingers indicate an impressionable and spontaneous mind. New ideas are welcome, and you may change your mind with each new viewpoint pointed out to you.

, Place your thumb at the outside base of their thumb and use your index finger to flex the thumb toward the person's wrist.


Stiff thumbs barely move. They indicate a strong personality that can accomplish things based on willpower alone. They may indicate a strong desire to stick to rules, and a low tolerance to people with lower self-control.
Average thumbs flex an inch or two.
Bendy thumbs can flex almost to the wrist. They indicate spontaneity and adaptability. But this comes with a tendency to be easily distracted, and a need for support from others to stick to tough plans.

, Knotty fingers and joints tend to reflect an argumentative, analytical nature. This only applies if the knots are not due to arthritis.


If your joints are generally smooth, then you may tend to be passive, letting others control you, but at the same time quite impulsive which may sometimes lead to carelessness.
If your top knuckles are smooth and your middle ones are internally rough, then you are a person whose intellect and practicality work well together. A strong instinctive drive is a characteristic of well-developed knuckles.

, You want to look at the size and fullness of the fleshy pad at the base of the thumb. This area describes a person's energy levels and basic physical nature.


Full and soft. This person enjoys the finer side of life, and is not very active. They love pleasurable things like food and drink, and have a hard time finding the motivation to exercise.
Full and firm. This is a sign of lots of energy and warmth.
Full and hard. This person is tough, both physically and emotionally. They find it hard to relax and open up.
Flat and cold. This is a sign of low energy levels. They are also less social with others, but can be considered survivors.
Average. If the thumb base is semi-raised and neither soft nor firm, this is average. This can be considered a sign of normal energy levels.

, It is also important to note the way fingers are spaced apart. With your hand in a relaxed position, examine how some fingers stand apart from others and how some stick close to the adjacent fingers.


If your middle finger and the index finger stick close together, it shows that you will gain authority and rank through your own goals and dreams. If they stand apart, then your position will come from other means.
An art related life is shown when the ring finger sticks close to the middle finger. Your fate will also aid in your success.
An independent mind is signified when your little finger stands apart from the ring finger, with a great deal of space between them.

Learn the difference between premonitions, precognitions, and prophecies.,
Start meditating deeply.,
Gradually enter and deepen your trance states.,
Allow your meditative mind to enter into your daily life.,
Pay attention to symbols and signs.,
Analyze the symbols.,
Read up on mythology.",How to Tell the Future1," Any time you get into future-telling, a lot lingo starts getting tossed around. It can get confusing. Keeping terms straight can untangle a lot of mystical mumbo-jumbo and make the techniques and the simple tricks a little more fun for the beginner.Precognition means awareness of the future, through direct knowledge or some other kind of perception, like dreams. Most precognitive experiences occur in dreams, and most occur 24-48 hours before the occurrence.

Premonition involves the feeling that something might happen, but not the knowledge of what it is exactly. Premonitions might include feelings of foreboding or ""hunches"" that something ""feels right."" These can be just as significant as precognition, and much more reliable.

Prophecy refers back to the ancient Greek sense of time, with the future being fixed and immutable. A prophecy is a knowledge of a future that will definitely happen, without question. For something to be prophecies means that it cannot be changed.;
, Scans show that humans only use a tiny fraction of the brain's capacity. But are those dormant abilities really useless and dormant? Not necessarily. Flexing your unconscious muscles is possible through practicing deep meditation, letting your unconscious mind overwhelm your conscious mind, and take over. This is where future telling happens.


Start by making yourself comfortable, in a room with soft natural light. Sitting in a comfortable upright position, preferably on the floor, calm your mind and focus on your breathing. Feel the breath go into your body. Feel the breath go out of your body. Feel the oxygen nourishing your body, and going back out into the world. Just focus on your breath, nothing else.
Gradually, start focusing on relaxing your body as you breathe. With every breath, focus on relaxing one arm, first. Feel the breath going into your arm and relax your arm. Then move to your other arm, then down your chest, and throughout the rest of your body. Calm your head and your mind, as well. Focus on relaxation.

, There's no big secret to meditation. Zazen–the type of meditation done by Zen monastics–is loosely translated as ""just sitting."" The goal is nothingness, letting your subconscious mind take over, with its extrasensory powers of perception. By learning to do this, you'll open yourself up to a wider array of signs and portents, making the future more visible.


As your trance deepens, you should gradually start losing your sense of time, quieting your thinking mind and allowing your subconscious to become more perceptive. Some diviners find it effective to visualize climbing or descending a ladder, or walking into a cave to symbolize diving deeper into your subconscious and deepening the trance state.

, As you begin entering your trances and deepening your meditation, stop trying to force things to happen and begin allowing things to happen. Pay attention to images that arise during your meditations and then seek out these images during the day. Pay attention to faces and people that come up in your meditations and keep an eye out for them. They may be precognitions.


Use all your senses. It might sound silly, but you can think of your body as a ""psychic eye,"" or something that's always gathering information. Temperatures, certain smells, even feelings can all be signs of the future. If you notice feelings of anxiety when you see owls, feelings you've never experienced before, take it as significant. If every time you hear Katy Perry sing, you feel coolness, take it as a significant premonition of something.

, Signs and portents are all around us, but it's up to us to find them. If you're lucky enough to have been gifted with some observation skills and extrasensory perceptions, learning to tell the future still takes a lot of work, but you'll be a better future teller if you work out your extrasensory muscles. If you want to open your perceptions and expand your abilities, stop seeing events and images as “random” and start seeing them as part of a plan.


Pay attention to ""hair on the back of the neck"" moments. When something happens that pricks the little hairs on the back of your neck, making you feel just slightly ""off,"" stop what you're doing and focus. What do you notice? What seems to have startled you? What seems significant?
Pay attention to deja vu. Ever have the feeling something has happened before, and everything feels weird and reverberating? Start paying attention to what seems off about these moments. What do you notice? Where are you? What sense memories are being evoked?
Pay attention to coincidences. Maybe you wake up some morning and see moths on your porch, then the cute barista will be wearing a t-shirt with a furry moth across the back. Mere coincidence? To some, there is no such thing–what matters is that it happened. Take coincidences as symbols, signs, and portents, rather than unexplainable randomness.

, So, you meditated and couldn’t get the image of a fleet of crabs drinking gasoline on a beach at nighttime out of your mind. Weird! What does this mean? It might mean different things for different people, so learning to interrogate your symbols and subconscious portents and apply them to your own experience will be up to you.


Think of it like dream interpretation or poetry analysis. These images should give you impressions, so start simple. Does it seem positive or negative? Powerful or weak? Daytime or nighttime?
Research the individual symbols you find recurring in your life and in your meditations. Crabs, for example, are significant in all kinds of fortune telling, appear on the ""Moon"" Tarot card, and is part of the Zodiac. A significant vision.
The Dream Bible, can be an excellent resource for quick reading about the symbols that appear in your dreams. It's a good place to start.

, If you don't know your yarrow stick from your elbow, telling the future's going to be a tough climb. If you've got an interest in developing your extrasensory muscles and telling the future, it's a good idea to do some research on your own and learn about the collective unconscious, and the important myths and symbols of your culture.


The writings of Carl Jung are deeply influential in the way we understand our minds and the connection we have with our subconscious or ""unthinking"" mind. Joseph Campbell's The Hero With a Thousand Faces is an excellent resource for finding patterns that recur across cultures and mythologies, suggesting that certain symbols, signs, and portents might be ingrained in us as humans, somehow.

Locate the central apex of each mount at the base of the fingers.",How to Read the Mounts of the Palm,",,,,,,,,,,, The characteristics of this mount will be dominant in the person's personality.


If there are multiple dominant mounts, the palm is considered ""lucky"" and indicates drive, ambition and confidence.
If no dominant mounts are visible, this indicates a lack of self confidence.

, This apex is triangular skin ridge similar to a fingerprint.


An apex located directly under the middle of the finger is a sign that this one is the most important in the hand.
If there are multiple central apexes, each one is of equal importance.

Be that kind of person.,
Have a great idea.,
Become historically aware.,
Be a force of creation.,
Keep your socio-economic status high.,
Know that Followers will follow.,
Give back.,
Manage your image.,
Become a founder.,
Become an exemplar person.,
Engage in diplomacy.,
Carefully plan your legacy.",How to Become a Spiritual Leader," Are you a person that has little ego or commits to selfless behavior for the betterment of the human race? Have you thrown yourself away from this seductive world? To be a spiritual leader it means saying ""NO!"" to the flesh and saying ""Yes!"" to Humanity, God, Allah, Yahweh, Dharma, Qi, the Buddha nature and the other spiritual realms which envelope us each and every day.;
, You need a plan, a system, a manifesto, a mission. Write it down. It can be a book, an unpublished manuscript, an essay, a drawing, a diary, a couple of poems, a draft for a constitution, or just a few lines of your thought. Something! Think about Chairman Mao's Little Red Book. Your idea will become the genius sitting on your shoulder and attending your actions; it's your guiding spirit, your talisman, and your protector. Having it will forever distract the critic's eye away from your over-the-top personality toward that genius.

, You must spiritually connect with historical events and famous people in history. You do so by comparing your idea with already existing ones, ideally from two thousand years ago, as if your thoughts were, say, the logical conclusion of the teachings of Confucius, Buddha, or Jesus Christ, etc. Your idea is universal and was previously known to other great men in history, so you are the obvious heir to the kingdom of thought.

, To create is to know, they say. Great leaders are constantly creating new connections between themselves, their followers, and the movement to current domestic, economical, cultural, and political affairs. Everything is interconnected, that is the essence of all spirituality. In addition, just as companies like Google or Apple are putting out new software products and patents, so your spiritual enterprise, too, must constantly produce new consumer products, videos, publications, and invent new word-creations.

, This is essential because it determines what kind of people you will meet and how they will see you. In short, people want to see you have a job. Or superior credentials. Did you win prizes and medals when you were young? Are you a chess master or martial arts champion? Do you own a company; are you affiliated with a university, a religion, or a political party? Are you a professor, entrepreneur, director, or president of something? If not, you better become some; the more the better. If you don't come from money and influence, you can always marry into it. If, however, your social status remains low, you are unlikely to reach the next levels.

, The truth is there is no planning for followers. It's the followers who come to the spiritual leader, and that is that. In fact, since by now you are that movement by constantly creating connections to the happenings around you, people are already drawn to you like moths to a flame. Every remark they make, every piece of paper they comment, every gesture, every meeting, every conversation they will have about you with others will enhance your own reputation, for good or bad that is. Obviously, they will shower you with favors, gifts, their money and their time, sometimes even their real estate and other useful things. Imam Khomeini is often said to have possessed only about $12 on the day he died. Yet, he practically ""owned"" the entire Iranian nation.

, People who don't have anything, cannot give it. But by now you have a lot to give, and I don't mean just all that money and material props, but also more abstract forms of empowerment like access to resources, titles, jobs, or simple the credit of being in your presence. This is an important function of any leader: to distribute resources among his subordinates. Treat all people that work for you as if they were your family and distribute among them your favors (or withhold them), just like a king or pasha. Be benevolent and give and you will be given even more back in return.

, Most spiritual leaders adopt an iconic look and style and stick to that a life-time in order to remain universally recognizable. Now, how to get your image and your idea out to the people? The key is public relations. Many times people will write articles about you, some will publish your stuff, but in order to stay in control over your universal image you must produce in-house. Get a management team and agent(s); create your own newspaper, journal, show, magazine, and publishing house.

, Josei Toda once advised his disciple Ikeda that in order to achieve greatness he must travel the world, talk to great scholars, and build a university. Ikeda did just that. He even founded two universities, high schools, kindergartens, and hundreds of other institutions. You, too, must now establish a school, a label, a temple, a research center, a foundation, a non-government organization, a political party, a religious movement, your own country, whatever suits you best, and the more the better.

, f you can, become a hero. Save little children from starving in Africa, help the victims of natural catastrophes in Japan or Indonesia. And let the public know that you helped those homeless. On the other side of the spectrum, always remember to connect to important people and forums, and let people know about your connections. Your life has turned into a work of art. You are now a force of nature, and you believe, like all people with great power, that you have the highest ethical standards anyway. Write more books about it. Go on TV.

, Like head of states do. Search dialogue. It's been road tested. You are now in a different ball game than most of humankind. Meeting with ordinary people gives you nothing intellectually; you must search for those very few who are your equal. Presidents meet other presidents, CEOs meet other CEOs, and spiritual leaders meet other spiritual leaders. Dialogue is essentially the greatest promotional tool of spiritual leaders that exists today.

, Ideally, you should have died before 40. The shock will make many people say good things about you that they would never have said about a living or elder person. Think about Bruce Lee who died at the age of 33 or Vincent van Gogh who died at 37, or Kurt Cobain who died at 27. If you live longer, your genius has probably left you, but has manifested in your works. Here’s what to do next: Do not take your money into the grave. Keep creating, do saintly work, and when you retire establish a fund or foundation or scholarship or prize in your name that does good work for society.

Start keeping a dream journal.,
Wake yourself up periodically throughout the night.,
Locate and assign meaning to the symbols in your dreams.,
Connect your dream symbols to your life and to the future.,
Practice lucid dreaming and question the future.",How to Tell the Future2," It can be difficult to analyze your dreams if you can't remember them. To make it easier on yourself, keep a notebook beside your bed with a pen ready to go, every time you go to sleep. As soon as you wake up, write down everything that you were dreaming. Describe it in as specific an amount of detail as possible. Try to do it as soon as you've awakened, no matter how tired you are.


What did you see? Who was there? What did you notice around you in terms of senses like smells, tastes, textures? How did you connect to it emotionally? Was it a scary dream? A sexy dream? A pleasant dream?
Write down dialog first. This tends to be the first thing to go and it can be frustrating to think that something important might have been communicated and not be able to remember what it was.

, If you struggle to remember your dreams, wake yourself up in the middle of them. Interrupting your dreams is an effective way of recognizing the symbols in them and keeping the images fresh in your mind.


Set an alarm on your phone to go off every three hours, which will allow you to complete two full REM cycles of 90 minutes each. You can write down your dreams in only a minute or two, meaning that you'll still be able to get a full night of sleep and will be able to record your dreams.

, Just as you might with symbols that come up in your meditation, start interrogating the symbols rise out of your dreams and assigning significance and meaning to them.


Pick up on lots of different things in each dream. Go back to your image of crabs drinking gasoline on the beach. The crabs and the gasoline seem significant, but also consider what drinking might symbolize, what sand might symbolize, and other tactile or emotional elements to the images. How did it feel to watch?
People are symbols as well. Dreaming that you kissed your best friend doesn't necessarily ""mean"" that you're in love with your best friend and you should start kissing. When we dream of specific people, it is because our subconscious has attached a symbolic meaning to those people. Dreaming of kissing your friend might mean that you're attracted to a certain element of your friend as a person, something that you want to get closer to, or accomplish in your own life.

, Common dreams, like dreaming that your teeth are falling out, or that you are flying, or that you're in public with no clothes on have common interpretations–you're stressed out, you're struggling or succeeding with control, you're vulnerable–but you might make more compelling connections to events or coincidences in your own life. Use dreams along with your well-developed extrasensory perceptions of your life to create your own premonitions and precognitive sense of what the future might hold.


If you're waiting to hear the news after a job interview and dream that you're flying high and out of control, you might take it as a sign that you're feeling anxiety about the idea of success, of the freedom a new job might bring you. Which might mean you've got the job.
Temper your dream analysis with practicality. If you've dreamt that your friend is dead, laid out in a coffin, it doesn't necessarily mean ""my friend is going to die."" Rather, a chapter in your friend's life might be closing, or your relationship might be changing in some way, in the future. Apply it to what's going on in your life.

, Some particularly ambitious and skilled lucid dreamers use waking dreams to attempt to question the future directly. If you've practiced and developed the ability to remain conscious while you're dreaming, Try to visualize a pad of paper, or some other oracle, and ask it direct questions. ""Who's going to win the Super Bowl?"" or ""What chance do I have of getting this job?"" See what happens.

Pick an oracle to consult.,
Ask open-ended questions of your oracle.,
Consult Tarot cards.,
Ask questions of the iChing.,
Read shadows.,
Gaze into a crystal ball or other reflective surface.,
Look to the stars.",How to Tell the Future3," An oracle is a practice, object, or method that allows you to ""read"" the future. No, you don't need to climb a mystical mountain and present a floating trio of goddesses with a laurel wreath and a clear conscious to consult an oracle. Think of oracles like tools for seeing, or like shortcuts to the future. Oracles–from the Latin for ""to speak""–are just ways of making it easier on yourself.


If you like unusual images and totemic symbols, the Tarot is the classic way to go. To get started, visit an experienced Tarot reader to see what a reading is like. Then you can start learning about the different cards and the history of the Tarot in divinatory culture.
If you enjoy meditating on stories and coincidences, learn to consult the iChing and gaze into its mysterious world.
If you enjoy deep meditation and open-ended symbols, consider scrying, palm-reading, or other more complex methods of divination that will allow you to put your own spin on the oracle.

, If you want to look to an oracle for your future-telling needs, you’ve got to do most of the work by providing a probing and open-ended question. This will help you interpret the oracular symbols that you receive and apply it to your interests. It only works if you lead with a question that's both open-ended and complex.


Good questions to prompt the oracle usually start, ""What should I notice…"" or ""How should I approach…"" or ""How do I think about…"" Leave enough open that the oracle can give you something concrete to interpret.
Asking ""Will I get this job?"" won't work when you're throwing bones or reading the iChing, because you won't get a yes or no answer. Instead, focus on asking questions like, ""What do I need to know to improve my chances of getting this job?""

, Tarot cards are made up of 78 cards, featuring major and minor arcana, and resembling a deck of regular playing cards. There are four suits: cups, staves, swords, and pentacles, with strange art on each card that you can use to read in any number of different ways. It's one of the most famous and versatile methods of telling the future symbolically.


Most Tarot readings tell stories, focusing on a specific question the querant is asking. If you want to learn more about Tarot, go in for a reading, get a guidebook, and get started familiarizing yourself with the deck.

, The iChing is the book of changes. You can consult it using coins, marbles, yarrow stalks, or by other mathematical methods, which result in the drawing of a six-lined ""hexagram,"" made up of two symbols, that corresponds to an entry in the book. Simply put, you'll throw some dice, ask a question, and read a few mysterious passages. If you enjoy poetry, chance, and meditating on stories, it's a great way of getting in touch the with future.

, Sciomancy is the art of divining the future by looking at shadows, looking into the dark for images and symbols for interpretation. If you want to get started, all you'll need is a candle and a well-develoepd sense of your own ESP.


Set yourself up in a darkened room with plain walls. You should be illuminated from behind yourself with a single candle. Meditate deeply for a while, opening your eyes to look into the corners of the room, watching the way the light plays with the shadows.
Record the images that arise for you out of the shadows, writing them down for later. Imagine that the room is your mind and the shadows are ideas, images, and thoughts that float around in it. What seems significant? What might portend the future?

, Similar to shadow-gazing, scrying is the art of looking into a reflective surface of some kind, most famously a crystal ball, to ""find"" images and symbols for interpretation.


To get started, get yourself a crystal, most preferably made of clear quartz. Other acceptable crystals include amethyst, beryl, selenite, or obsidian. The crystal should be at least four or five inches in diameter. Charge your crystal in the light of the full moon, for the course of a night, and keep it clean and locked in a safe place where it will be free of psychic negativity.
To stare into the crystal, hold it gently in your hands, or place it in front of you on a stand or a dark pillow. Enter your deep meditative state and stare gently into the crystal, looking deep, relaxing your eyes to allow images to reveal themselves., Ever since there have been people, people have looked to the stars for guidance. Astrology has been used for millennia to learn about ourselves and about our futures. If you're interested in moving past your basic newspaper horoscope to learn more about interpreting symbols based on the organization of the stars.


Astrology is just as much of a philosophy, or a way of understanding behavior, as it is a mystic tool. There are 12 astrological signs that combine the four elements, earth, air, fire and water, with one of the three qualities–cardinal, fixed, and mutable. Learning about your symbols, depending on the seasons and the changes can clue you into how you should look into the future and what you can do to make your future yourself."

Roll the ink over the entire hand to be printed.,
Make the print.,
Clean the hand.,
Look at the head line.,
Examine the heart line.,
Analyze the life line.",How to Take a Palm Print," These are the two most essential supplies for the palm printing process. Get any kind of standard paper (8 ½ x 11), but it will work better with slightly thicker, more sturdy paper. For the ink, try to find some block printing ink. This kind of ink is typically available at any local craft or hobby store.Block printing ink can be a little pricey, but one small bottle will go a long way.
This kind of printing ink is also usually easier to get off your hands after the palm print is done.;
, This item can also be purchased at any hobby or craft store. Ink rollers are relatively inexpensive and can usually be found with the painting supplies. They are small tools with a plastic handle and an absorbent cloth or foam roller on the end.The ink roller is what you'll use to completely cover your hand in ink for the palm print.

, In order to make your palm print in a way that clearly shows all the details, you need to create a bit of a cushioned surface that your hand can press into when making the print. Find an old towel that you can fold up and put underneath the paper for the print.You could also use a stack of magazines – just anything to provide a little cushion underneath will work.

, Place a dot of ink onto a smooth, non-absorbent surface – like a magazine cover. Roll the ink over the surface until the roller is covered completely in the ink. Make sure you roll the ink out evenly so that it is distributed equally over the surface of the roller.This should give you enough ink on the roller to coat the entire palm.

, Try to get an even layer using as little ink as possible. Run the roller over the palm until it is all covered. Don't forget to do the fingers as well. The ink should be sticky and tacky.


Make sure every inch of the palm and fingers are coated with ink.

, Create a softer paper surface by placing the paper on top of a folded towel. This will allow the hand to sink into the paper, creating a more detailed palm print. Press the person's palm into the paper using firm, even pressure. Don't forget to press the fingers as well. Try to position the hand naturally, with the fingers slightly spread.Make sure you get the ink-covered palm on the paper within 30 seconds or so after coating it. Otherwise, the ink will start to dry and it won’t make as clear of a transfer of the palm on the paper.
When finished, lift the hand carefully. You may need to hold the paper down while doing this.
You can also make a soft surface under the print paper by placing a few magazines under the paper you plan to use.
Label the print with the person's name and the date the print was taken, as hand lines often change over time.

, Once you have finished making the palm print, you’ll need to clean the hand to get all the ink off. With most types of ink, simply spending a few minutes with some soap and water should do the trick.If you have a lot of trouble getting the ink off, you can try using alcohol-based products like rubbing alcohol, nail polish remover, or alcohol wipes. However, be quite careful and use the alcohol products sparingly as they can be damaging to your skin (if overused) and can also stain clothing.

, The head line is typically the middle line on a palm. It begins just above the thumb and curves downward through the center of the palm.A short head line indicates that you are a quick thinker who makes decisions without a lot of self-doubt.
A long, straight head line points towards an over-analytical person, while a long, curved head line usually indicates a creative thinker.

, The heart line is usually the uppermost major line on a palm. It usually runs from the pointer finger to the edge of the palm.A long, straight line typically indicates a person who is rational and analytical, yet always considerate of others.
A long, curved line usually points towards a passionate person driven by their desires.

, This line is typically the lowest major line on the palm. It usually begins near the head line and curves downward toward the wrist.A long life line usually indicates someone others depend on during difficult times.
A short life line means you are a person who needs to stay busy.

Read the depth of the life line.,
Interpret the curve of the life line.",How to Calculate the Age of a Person Using Palmistry," Often times, a palm reader will rely on both hands to give a more accurate reading. However, some palmists prefer to use one primary hand, and which hand is chosen will depend on both the age and gender of the person being read.Men who are under the age of 30 should offer the left palm as the primary hand.Men over 30 years of age should use the right palm as the primary hand.Women who are under the age of 30 should offer the right palm as the primary hand.Women over 30 years of age should use the left palm as the primary hand.;
, Much like fingerprints, everyone's palm will be slightly different. However, there are certain basic contours that are consistent across almost every palm. Before you can read a palm, it's imperative that you be able to recognize the various palm lines on the primary hand. Knowing where the life line is in relation to the other nearest lines may make it easier to find.The heart line is the easiest to identify. It is located at the top of the palm, and it typically extends almost all the way across the palm, parallel to where the fingers meet the rest of the hand.The head line is located below the heart line, more or less parallel to it. It runs horizontally from between the thumb and index finger straight across the palm.The life line is the next prominent line on the hand. It is typically curved but may run vertically or at an angle, and may intersect the head line and/or the heart line. To find it, look for the semi-curved line that starts between the thumb and index finger and runs down toward the wrist., The life line primarily indicates health, significant life changes, and the general well-being of a person.Contrary to popular belief, there is no real consensus on the correlation between the life line and a person's longevity.However, there is some consensus within palmistry studies that a person's vitality and quality of life can be determined by the life line., There is some disagreement among palmistry scholars on whether or not the life line indicates a person's longevity. Many scholars in the field do not believe that the age or longevity can be read from the palm.However, those who do believe such a reading is possible look to the ratio of the life line to the heart line in order to conduct this reading.If the life line (LL) to heart line (HL) ratio is:


0.36 - this LL/HL ratio indicates a lifespan of 64 years years0.37 - this LL/HL ratio suggests a lifespan of 68 years0.35 - this LL/HL ratio means a lifespan of 71 years0.39 - this ratio suggests a lifespan of 74 years0.34 - this ratio indicates a lifespan of 76 years0.38 - this ratio also means a lifespan of 76 years0.37 - this ratio indicates a lifespan of 79 years0.41 - this ratio suggests a lifespan of 80 years0.36 - this ratio indicates a lifespan of 81 years, A deep, unbroken life line indicates a strong vitality and a passion for life. By contrast, a shallow line indicates that the person may be easily misled or manipulated., The life line's curve is typically thought to be an indication of adventurousness. A line that curves close to the thumb is thought to indicate that the person does not stray far from home. A line that sweeps outward is indicative of a love of travel and adventure.

Use the dominant hand for the reading.In palm reading, the passive hand is said to display what you are born with, what your parents pass down.Alternatively, the active hand is supposed to show what you have done so far in your life.;
, The main lines are the heart line, the head line, and the life line. Some people also have the fate line.The heart line runs from between the index and middle finger to the edge of the palm. It mostly runs horizontal if you are looking at your own palm with fingers up, though it can curve.The head line is the horizontal line that runs underneath the heart line.The life line curves around the thumb pad, while if you have a fate line, it will jut out from the bottom of your palm up towards the middle finger.To see the lines better, try cupping your hand slightly so you can see where it creases., Some people have other lines as well. These are more minor lines.For instance, some people have an intuition line that curves in from the middle outside of the palm and then back out at the bottom of the palm.Many people also have a bracelet line, where the hand meets the wrist.Others have the Girdle of Venus, which scoops down from the top of the palm and back up, all above the heart line.A health line can run from the base of the pinky down towards the bottom middle of the base of the palm, while the children and relationship lines are small horizontal lines under the base of the pinky., Each of the fingers has its own name, as well, which can also give name to creases. The index finger is Jupiter. The middle finger is Saturn. The ring finger is Apollo, and the the pinkie is Mercury.If a person has a ring underneath the creases at the bottom of each finger, they take the name of the finger, such as the ring of Saturn.These names can also be lent to lines that originate at the base of the finger, such as the Apollo line. It runs from the base of the ring finger down through the palm., Like its name implies, this line is related to matters of the heart. It tells about your emotional life and relationships. Examine its length, how it curves, and whether it is broken or crossed. For instance, crosses in the line or places where it breaks can mean you've had episodes where you were very sad.If it's straight and long, that means you're happy with your love life. It also means you're giving emotionally. ""Long"" means it starts underneath the index finger.If it's long and curved, that means you are emotionally open, and that you're especially affectionate when that curve points towards the index finger.If the line is straight and short, that means you're not as tied down by romantic notions. ""Short"" means it starts near your middle finger or even further down your palm.If it's short and curves, that means you keep your emotions closer to the chest, preferring the company of a close group of friends to that of a large party., Your life line isn't about how long you're going to live. Rather, it points to how you've been taking care of yourself, or more pointedly, if you haven't been taking care of yourself.If you see a number or breaks a long this line, that could be an indication you need to take better care of yourself. In other words, you need to get more rest and look after your emotional and physical needs.A short line (one that doesn't go all the way to the bottom of your palm), means you like to distract yourself when tough times hit, while a longer line means you're the person everyone else looks to for support., The head line displays things to do with your brain, such as your intelligence or the way you communicate. It also can show the ways you learn best.Pay attention to how the head and heart line interact. If they are pinched together, it can mean you are a bit more reserved and cautious. The more spread apart these two lines are at the beginning, the more adventurous you are.If the line is straight, it says you're more levelheaded, while if it curves, you're more spontaneous.If the line splits, that could mean you are more able to step into another person's shoes than most people., Because not everyone has a fate line, it can be exciting to find one. It can tell you what your life is going to look like. For instance, if it is often broken in places, that means you have or could have many career and life changes in your lifetime., Not everyone has the minor lines. If they do, it can indicate any number of things. For instance, if a person has a Girdle of Venus, it likely means that person is highly nervous and excitable,while the intuition line, as it implies, indicates a person who is highly in-tune with other's emotions.You can actually have more than one relationship line, and those indicate any person you're close to, not just a lover. If you are able to see them easily or they are especially long (past the pinky to the ring finger), that indicates someone who is able to commit.The rings of the fingers each have a different meaning. For instance, the ring of Saturn (middle finger) indicates people who keep themselves away from others,while the ring of Jupiter (index finger) is a highly intelligent personand the ring of Apollo (ring finger) can mean you're feeling blocked in a creative endeavor., The Venus mount is basically your thumb pad. If you found your life line, that generally encircles your Venus mount.However, it's the part close to the base of your thumb.If it rises about average, that means you are enjoying life, including the arts and other good things in life.If it's a little below average or nonexistent, that means you may be lonely or fall on hard times often.
If it's above average, it can mean you're a bit gluttonous in how you approach life., This mount is the pad just below the index finger, and it is meant to show how confident you are, how well you manage your life, and how society views you. Check how prominent it is in relation to other mounts on the hand.If it is especially developed, you're more likely to have a charmed life, as well as you're likely to be very gregarious.However, it can also go bad, as it can mean you're aggressive and domineering.If it's average, it means you are meant to be a helper and do good in the world.It can also mean you're smart and are able to guide others.If it's less than average, that means you don't have the best self-esteem., This mount is located below your middle finger. It indicates how how responsible you are, as well as how much duty you feel and whether you seek solitude or not.If it is particularly prominent, it can indicate that you put your foot down a bit too much and you tend to not trust others.If it's average, it shows your likable and capable of surviving on your own.If it's low, it can mean you don't have a lot of depth and don't spend enough time reflecting., This mount is below your ring finger. It's connected to happiness, genius, and creativity.If it's high, you have a lot of pride, maybe too much, which can lead to you snapping at people. You enjoy charming other people, and you may enjoy spending money on yourself and others.If it's average, it can mean your less excitable, that you're independent and have high self-esteem. You also like people.If it's low, it shows you are less creative than other people, which can lead to indecision., This mount is located below your pinky finger.It can be indicative of riches and whether a person will go abroad.If it's below average, you're probably shy and not able to connect to many people, which can mean you won't make as much money over your lifetime.An average mount can mean that you are a versatile person who is empathetic to others. You find many things interesting.A high mount shows someone who's full of avarice and who is a bit too talkative., This mount is at the bottom of your hand, on the opposite side to the thumb. It can also represent creativity, as well as intuition.If it's below average, you may still have a decent imagination, but you just don't share it with others.If it's average, it shows it means you're very imaginative without getting too crazy.If it's highly developed, it means you can let your creativity get a bit too crazy, and you can go off the deep end., That is, it's important to look at all the parts together, not just individual pieces. Modern hand readers like to use the whole hand to figure out where a person is in life, and use that to complete the reading.For instance a straight head line and a long life line can indicate that you are levelheaded, which is what makes you so good in times of crisis.

, Many modern readers don't just read hands. They might also read faces or tarot cards, for instance. Learning other types of readings can help you get a sense of the person as a whole, which in turn, gives you a better chance of helping the person with what they're facing., Many modern hand readers use psychology to assist them in their readings. Because so much of modern palm reading is about what makes up a person and how they can use that in the future, having a working knowledge of psychology can help you understand how a person might move forward with a problem.For instance, if someone is feeling frustrated about a project and showing a ring of Apollo, you might suggest ways that person can open up to creativity.
Since the ring of Apollo indicates a creative block, learning new ways to be creative can help the person move forward, a solution that can rely on psychology.

, Just like psychology, holistic healing techniques can also help you offer better solutions to the people you're reading for. Modern readers often bring in these techniques.Holistic healing means looking at the whole person and offering solutions that work for them. For instance, you may look at how the health can affect a person's mental state.As an example, if the person's mount of Jupiter is low, suggesting that he or she doesn't have great self-esteem, you could suggest a two-part approach that includes mind and body to boost self-esteem. For example, you could suggest an exercise program to help the person get in better shape and build confidence, along with a daily regimen of learning to talk positively to themselves so they build better self-esteem."

Examine the finger shape.,
Examine the finger smoothness.,
Examine the finger spacing.,
Examine the finger build.,
Examine the finger length.",How to Read Palms (Advanced)1," Finger shape normally coincides with the shape of the hand. However, most hands represent a mixture of finger types. This mixture helps to create a diversity of qualities and talents for a person. The shape of the fingernail is also used in trying to determine the type of finger.



Square fingers have square nails and represent a down-to-earth quality in respect to the attributes of the finger.

Pointed fingers often have almond-shaped nails and reveal an artistic nature.

Spade-shaped fingers have square-based nails which broaden at the tip and represent inventiveness.

Cone-shaped fingers have oval nails and represents an imaginative quality.

With mixed fingers, if a person had a square type of ring finger, for example, then they would be artistically inclined. But if the same person had a pointed index finger, then their occupation will commonly not be art-related.

When it comes to nails, naturally long nails show a soft heart; short nails show an unfortunate paranoid and uneasy nature; wide nails show quarrelsome qualities; narrow nails show a conservative and refined nature.;
, The smoothness or knottiness of the fingers and their joints is a good indication of which area of life a person would most likely be active in. It also deals with the instinctive, practical, and intellectual attainment in regards to the fields which each finger represents. The middle finger deals with service (goals, restrictions). The index finger deals with authority (position, wealth, happiness). The ring finger deals with fulfillment (fame, success). Finally, the little finger deals with activity (health, mind, commercial ventures).



If your joints are generally smooth, then you may tend to be passive, letting other control you, but at the same time quite impulsive which may sometimes lead to carelessness.

If your top knuckles are smooth and your middle ones are internally rough, then you are a person whose intellect and practicality work well together. A strong instinctive drive is a characteristic of well-developed knuckles.

The fleshiness of the pads inside the fingers as well as the flatness of those areas show a good development or lack of it in regards to the attributes of each finger.

Well-developed balls on the ends of fingers show a strong intellect and courtesy of the mind. A flatness represents a lack of intellectual insight regarding the attributes of the respective fingers.

, It is also important to note the way fingers are spaced apart. With your hand in a relaxed position, examine how some fingers stand apart from others and how some stick close to the adjacent fingers.



An independent mind is signified when your little finger stands apart from the ring finger, with a great deal of space between them.

An art-related life is shown when the ring finger sticks close to the middle finger. Your fate will also aid in your success.

If your middle finger and the index finger stick close together, it shows that you will gain authority and rank through your own goals and dreams. If they stand apart, then your position will come from other means.

, The build and thickness of a person's fingers can denote the personality type.



Heavy fingers often show a more physical nature, maybe with a tough outlook on things.

Long and slim fingers signify more of an emotional and aggressive type of person, so this person may be very sensitive to insults or very literal to sarcastic remarks.

Short and thick shows that a person is more emotionally comfortable.

If your index finger is longer than the normal length, you tend to be a leader and tell others what to do. But if it is shorter, then you tend to sit back and let others control you.

, The length of your fingers are measured relative to the size of your palm. On average, the longest finger is about seven-eighths the size of your palm, and if it is just as long as your palm, then your fingers are considered long. Short fingers are shorter than seven-eighths of the palm. In relation to the fingers, the thumb is normally higher than the bottom joining of the index finger. The index finger, however, reaches a third of the way up the nail of the middle finger. The ring finger normally reaches just above the nail of the middle finger and the little, or pinkie, finger should reach the top joint of the ring finger.



If your ring finger is longer than the normal length, you may have an artistic talent, as well as a reckless and wild nature.

If your little finger is shorter than the normal length, it shows that you lack the ability to influence others. If it is longer, you tend to be very articulate, and good at writing and selling.

Choose the hand for reading.,
Identify the four major lines.,
Interpret the heart line.,
Examine the head line.,
Evaluate the life line.,
Study the fate line.",How to Read Palm Lines1," In palmistry, there is the notion of an active hand and a passive hand. Your active hand is your dominant hand, whereas the passive hand is the non-dominant hand. The passive hand will indicate inherited traits. This should be read as a baseline.
The dominant hand will show any changes from the inherited state from life events etc.
If there is a major difference between the lines of the passive hand and the dominant hand, it means that this person has worked hard to develop themselves.;
, These are the heart line, the head line, the life line, and the fate line (not everyone has this line).1. The heart line runs horizontally across the top of the palm. It reflects the state of your heart on both the physical and emotional level.
2. The head line runs horizontally across the middle of the palm. It reflects the state of your mind and brain.
3. The life line curves around the base of the thumb, starting between the index finger and thumb. Contrary to popular belief, this line does not actually indicate how long you will live but rather aspects such as strength, vitality, and prosperity.
4. The fate line runs vertically from the base of the palm up the middle of the palm (not everybody has this line). It indicates aspects such as success, career path, and vocation.

, This line can be read in either direction (from the pinkie finger to the index finger, or vice versa), depending on the tradition being followed. It is believed to indicate emotional stability, romantic perspectives, depression, and cardiac health. How to read the line and its specific meanings are as follows:If the heart line starts below the index finger it means that you are picky when it comes to love. A heart line that begins below the middle finger indicates a person who is selfish when it comes to love. If it begins in the middle of the palm, the person falls in love easily.
An absent heart line indicates an individual who is ruled by logic rather than emotion. A faint line shows a person who is aloof and places little importance on emotions.
A straight and short heart line indicates an individual who is not particularly concerned with romance. A long and curvy heart line indicates someone who expresses emotions freely. A wavy line indicates many relationships and/or lovers, with an absence of serious relationships.
If the heart line is straight and parallel to the head line, it indicates that the individual has a good handle on their emotions. A heart line that touches the life line means that the heart is broken easily.
A broken heart line or a heart line with smaller lines crossing it can indicate emotional trauma. A chained line can mean depression.

, This represents learning style, communication style, intellectualism, and thirst for knowledge. The specific meanings are as follows:A head absent line indicates a person who is sluggish. A faint line indicates that the individual lacks memory and concentration and is prone to daydreaming. A deep line denotes a good memory, good concentration, and a sensible nature.
A short head line indicates a person who is practical and no nonsense. A long line denotes a person that is focused and very successful with a tendency to be selfish.
A straight head line shows a person that thinks realistically, is logical, organized, and has a great attention to detail. A wavy line indicates a person who is restless with short attention span. A curved or sloping line indicates a highly creative individual.
If the head line begins at the life line, this means that this person is strong-willed. A head line that is separated from the life line indicates someone who has a sense of adventure and enthusiasm for life.
A broken head line indicates inconsistencies in thought. Crosses in the line may mean that vital and crucial decisions have a very important effect on the persons fate. Chains or donuts in the head line indicate personal conflict or emotional difficulty.

, It reflects physical health, general well being, and major life changes (for example, cataclysmic events, physical injuries, and relocation). The specific meanings are as follows:If the life line is absent, the person is said to be high-strung, anxious, and nervous. A faint line indicates an individual who has low energy and a life without adventure. A deep line denotes a person who has a smoother life path.
If the life line is long and deep, this indicates good health stamina and vitality. A short, deep line shows a person who easily overcomes physical problems.
A curvy life line means the person has an abundance of energy. A straight line that is close to the edge of the palm means the person is cautious.
A line that runs close to the thumb shows a person who tires easily. If the line swoops into a semicircle, it shows strength and enthusiasm. Lines that are straight and close to the edge of the palm indicate a cautious individual.See if there are multiple life lines. Multiple life lines indicate extra strength and vitality.
A break in the life line means a sudden change in lifestyle or interruption. If the life line is broken on both hands, this may indicate a serious illness or injury. Circles in the line or a chained line indicates that the person is susceptible to many health problems and that their life may take them in many different directions.

, This is also known as the line of destiny, and it indicates the degree to which a person's life is affected by external circumstances beyond their control.This line begins at the base of the palm. Its principal features are:A deep fate line means that the persons life will be strongly controlled by fate. Remember, not all individuals have this line.
If the fate line starts joined to the life line, this indicates a self-made individual who develops aspirations early on in life. If it joins the life line somewhere in the middle, it indicates a point in mid-life where one's interests must be abandoned if favor of those of others. If the fate line starts at the base of the thumb, this indicates that this person has a strong relationship with family and friends.
Breaks and changes of direction in the fate line indicate many changes in life from external forces.

Determine the hand shape.,

Examine the hand and finger size.",How to Read Palms," In palmistry, it is thought that:


For females, the right hand is what you're born with, and left is what you've accumulated throughout your life.
For males, it is the other way around. The left hand is what you're born with, and the right is what you've accumulated throughout your life.
That being said, you can also choose whichever hand is dominant to be your present/past life hand (the non-dominant hand would then be your future life hand).

There are different schools of thought on the matter. Some say the left-hand shows potential and what could be -- not necessarily what will be. And a difference in the hands could mean one is or is about to take action when it comes to their lives, changing it.;
, There may be breaks in them or they may be short, but at least three of them are there.


(1) The heart line
(2) The head line
(3) The life line
(4) The fate line (only some people have this).

, This line can be read in either direction (from the pinkie finger to the index finger or vice versa) depending on the tradition being followed. It's believed to indicate emotional stability, romantic perspectives, depression, and cardiac health. The basic interpretations are as follows:

Begins below the index finger - content with love life

Broken line - emotional trauma






Smaller lines crossing through heart line - emotional trauma







, This represents a person's learning style, communication approach, intellectualism, and thirst for knowledge. A curved line is associated with creativity and spontaneity, while a straight line is linked with practicality and a structured approach. The basic interpretations are as follows:

Wavy line - short attention span






Deep, long line - thinking is clear and focused






Straight line - thinks realistically






Donuts or cross in head line - emotional crisis






Broken head line - inconsistencies in thought






Multiple crosses through head line - momentous decisions.







, This begins near the thumb and travels in an arc towards the wrist. It reflects physical health, general well-being, and major life changes (for example, cataclysmic events, physical injuries, and recolation). Its length is not associated with length of life. The basic interpretations are as follows:

Runs close to thumb - often tired






Curvy - plenty of energy

Swoops around in a semicircle - strength, and enthusiasm






Straight and close to the edge of the palm - cautious when it comes to relationships






Multiple life lines - extra vitality

, This is also known as the line of destiny, and it indicates the degree to which a person's life is affected by external circumstances beyond their control. It begins at the base of the palm. The basic interpretations are as follows:

Deep line - strongly controlled by fate






Breaks and changes of direction - prone to many changes in life from external forces






Starts joined to life line - self-made individual; develops aspirations early on






Joins with the life line around in the middle - signifies a point at which one's interests must be surrendered to those of others






Starts at base of the thumb and crosses life line - support offered by family and friends.







, Each hand shape is associated with certain character traits. The length of the palm is measured from the wrist to the bottom of the fingers. The basic interpretations are as follows:



Earth - broad, square palms and fingers, thick or coarse skin, and ruddy color; length of the palm equals length of fingers

Solid values and energy, sometimes stubborn
Practical and responsible, sometimes materialistic
Work with their hands, comfortable with the tangible



Air - square or rectangular palms with long fingers and sometimes protruding knuckles, low-set thumbs, and dry skin; length of the palm less than length of fingers

Sociable, talkative and witty
Can be shallow, spiteful and cold
Comfortable with the mental and the intangible
Does things in different and radical ways



Water - long, sometimes oval-shaped palm, with long, flexible, conical fingers; length of the palm equals the length of fingers but is less than the width across the widest part of the palm.

Creative, perceptive and sympathetic
Can be moody, emotional and inhibited
Introverts
Do things quietly and intuitively.



Fire - square or rectangular palm, flushed or pink skin, and shorter fingers; length of the palm is greater than length of fingers

Spontaneous, enthusiastic and optimistic
Sometimes egoistic, impulsive and insensitive
Extroverts
Do things boldly and instinctively.



, That's what the fleshy bit below your fingers are called, on the opposite side of your knuckle. To make them visible, cup your hand just a bit. Which one is the largest?


A high Venus mount (the one under your thumb) indicates a predisposition for hedonism, promiscuity, and the need for instant gratification. A non-existent Venus mount indicates little interest in family matters.
The mount under your index finger is called the Jupiter mount. If this is well-developed, it means you are dominant, possibly self-centered, and aggressive. A lack of one means you lack confidence.
Under your middle finger is the Saturn mount. A high mount shows you're stubborn, cynical, and prone to depression. If it is low, it's an indicator of superficiality and disorganization.
The Sun mount is under your ring finger. You're quick-tempered, extravagant, and prideful if you have a high Sun mount. A low Sun mount means you lack imagination.
The Mercury mount is under your pinkie. If it's protruding, you talk too much. A low mount means the opposite -- you're shy.

None of this is based on science. And your hands are known to change throughout time. Don't take any of it too seriously!



, Relative to the size of the body, some say that small hands are active and don't dwell on thinking about what to do. Large hands are on those who are contemplative and slow to action.Remember, this is relative to the body. If you're 8 feet (2.4 m) tall (2.4 m), you're going to have bigger hands than a 4-year-old. It's all proportional.
What's more, long fingers may be an indicator of anxiety, in addition to being well-mannered, good looking, and delicate. Short fingers are found on those who are impatient, highly-sexed, and creative.
Long fingernails, on the other hand, mean you're kind and a good secret-keeper. Short fingernails mean you're critical and sarcastic. If they're almond-shaped, you're sweet and diplomatic."

This is especially so that when the Life Line may be faint or hard to see. If a person has very faint Fate, Fame, and Success Lines, then the Health Line also lays a strong part in the development of material wealth. The Health Line can be found extending from below the little finger, down across the palm, to the base of the thumb. Sometimes, it may even join with the Life Line.



Missing - it is likely that you'll have little to no health problems.

Strong and undisturbed - strong business sense as well as the strength to work hard and make money.

Wavy - potential health problems as a result of anxiety and nervousness.

Broken - poor health will cause problems in business situations.

Smaller lines crossing Health Line - prone to accidents.

Extra lines branches onto the Life Line - sign of life-threatening situation in old age.

Square encircling the line - a sign of protection, whether it be in the form of good medical treatment, or aid in solving a business problem.

Break in the line to form a donut shape - a need for hospitalization.

A triangle formed by the Life, Head, and Health Lines - known as the Lucky Triangle, where the broader the angle of the triangle, the greater your luck.

, The Line of Fame reinforces the Fate Line. The Fame Line influences the social rewards of success. This line, if visible, starts at the base of the hand, and moves its way up to below the ring finger, running parallel to the Fate Line.



Missing - one's future fame must be looked for in other areas of the palm; may still be successful but prefer to do without public acclaim.

Strong and clear - distinction and satisfaction with your life's work.

Broken repeatedly - indication of the ups and downs of social recognition.

Travels straight to the ring finger - likely to have fame in the arts.

Starts at the Head Line and runs through the Heart Line - hard work and success late in life.

A separation at the end of the Fame Line (becoming two smaller lines) - success may be dubious in value.

Ends beneath the ring finger in a star or triangle - spectacular success awaits in the fine arts field (acting, singing, dancing).

Ends beneath the ring finger in a square - a kindly patron.

, Relationships are indicated by the little line (or lines) that are located just below the base of the little finger. The closer the lines are to the base of the little finger, the later in life these relationships will be.



Several light lines - romances.

Strong and clear lines - marriage.

Numerous overlapping lines - affair(s).

Lines that meet but don't cross - children that will be born in affairs.

Fork at the start towards the back of the hand - long engagement.

Fork at the end towards the palm - separation (with or without divorce).

Line at the end that cuts the line off sharply - end to a relationship due to death or divorce.

Breaks that resumes with an overlap - separation with a later reunion.

, These lines don't indicate material wealth, so much as they represent skill in acquiring riches and how it can be done.



No Line - You will be making so much money you'll wipe your nose with a $100 bill

Line from the base of the thumb to below the index finger, ending in a star - a natural talent for moneymaking.

Line from the base of the thumb to below the middle finger - money made in business.

Line running to the ring finger, cutting through the Fame Line - money obtained through luck and surprise.

, The Travel Lines are a major indication of the trips taken throughout your life that have had or will have a penetrating impact on your life. These lines generally start from the edge of the palm at the 'heel,"" opposite the thumb, and extend horizontally.



Intersecting the Life Line - a trip will be made under circumstances of health, or your health will be affected by a trip.

Crossing the Travel Line - danger, or problems within travel.

A square encircles the lines - a sign of protection in your travels.

Breaks - possible delay in your travels.

Intersecting the Fate Line - travel will present a life-changing experience.

, The Minor Lines can be found in most hands. They include the lines of Opposition, Intuition, Escape, and Influence.



Lines of Opposition: These lines can be found on the outside of the palm, between the Heart and Head Lines. These lines illustrate the opposing forces that we all must deal with in life.

Line of Intuition: This line appears on the outer palm (at the base of the hand under the little finger). It illustrates strong insight. If you have this line you are an extremely sensitive, intuitive person and may have ESP (extra-sensory perception). The line can appear to curve into the palm or out to the edge of the palm. Either way, the meaning stays the same.

Line of Escape: This line is more towards the bottom of the palm, near the base. It often crosses the Life Line, and this crossing symbolizes the time in your life the following experience may happen. The Line of Escape illustrates an individual who escapes the problems of their life by indulging in their imagination. If it connects with the Line of Fame, they retreat into creative arts ease themselves. If the Line of Escape crosses with the Health Line, the person will resort to drugs and drinking. This may also foreshadow suicide.

Lines of Influence: These lines originate from the base of the thumb, and radiate out into the Palm. Where they connect with other lines, they illustrate an important event. The much sought after influence lines are the ones that show how and where you will come into money, if it crosses the Money Lines.

Look for prints.,
Dust for latent prints.,
Photograph the prints.,
Determine the type of surface the prints are on.,
Lift the prints.,
Match the prints.",How to Analyze Fingerprints1," In forensic fingerprinting, there are a few types of fingerprints and a few ways to find them. As you start looking for fingerprints, some will be visible (patent) and others will be invisible (latent). Search for patent ones first and place a marker of some kind by it remind you later. To search for latent prints, it can be good to use an alternate light source, such as a blue light with an orange filter. This helps make latent prints stand out.There are also ones called plastic prints which are in soft surfaces like soap.;
, Once you have found the latent prints with an alternative light source, you need to dust them to make them more visible. Professionals use special powder, but for amateur home use, talcum powder or cornstarch is a great alternative. You’ll also need a brush with a lot of soft bristles on it. With the light source still revealing the print, lightly dust the powder over it until it is sufficiently revealed.


When using an alternate light source, it is most effective to turn the other lights in the room off, making the light more powerful.

, For patent prints that are already visible and latent prints which you have revealed with light and dust, the best collection method is to take a picture with a high resolution camera. It is easier to study prints in photo form anyway. Make sure you take the picture close enough to see the details of the print. You always want to have a ruler of some kind next to the print to give a scale for how big it is.This is also helpful because it allows you to upload the prints onto the computer for analysis and file storage.

, Fingerprints can be found on any surface. Surface types are categorized into porous, non-porous smooth, and non-porous rough. Things of a cloth nature, or anything water could seep into, are considered porous. Non-porous smooth would be things like glass or a varnished table. Non-porous rough would be a leather couch or a plastic container with a textured edge.This is important because the surface type can either make it easy or hard to lift a good print.

, Besides photography, the second way to collect the prints is to lift them with tape or gel. For smooth surfaces, lay a piece of clear tape over the print gently, then peel it off and place it on a white square of sturdy paper. You must be careful to lay the tape straight down on the print and not move it side to side at all as this might smudge it.For porous and non-porous rough surfaces, just the photograph is the easiest collection method, but there are other options. These require something that will get into the grooves, such as gel lifter or superglue. A gel lifter is a product specifically made for lifting prints from rough surfaces and it is laid over the fingerprint and creates a small 3D cast of the print. Superglue can be applied to the print and allowed to dry and then peeled off creating a mold.
This gives you a backup to the pictures that you took and allows you to file a piece of physical evidence of the prints.

, This is not easily done for someone without training or proper technology. If you have a set of known prints, you can compare the ones you lifted to those. Look for similar patterns to rule out some of the prints. There are advanced computer programs which can read dozens of points on a fingerprint and match those points to other known prints, but this is more for professional endeavors.

, Fasting is not an excuse to not help out in doing work. Broom the house, water the plants. Small jobs like this will help your mom or dad out, and will pass time.


Once it gets to about two to three hours before the break of the fast, help out in the kitchen; you will be busy doing a task and you won't notice the time passing.







, If you do not have school or work the next day, stay up until Al- Fajr, then sleep afterwards. You should see yourself waking up at noon!


Have a nap during the day if needed, including after the evening's food has been prepared but before it is time to break the fast.







, There is nothing wrong with watching some TV; just don't watch the food shows.

, Buy or re-read a very interesting book, or recite/ read the holy Qur'an, and time will fly by!

Find the other significant lines on your palm.,
Study the health line.,
Read the fame line.,
Evaluate the marriage line.,
Read the money line.,
Study the travel lines.",How to Read Palm Lines2," In addition to the four major lines (heart line, there are several other lines that are worth noting and reading. These lines are the health line, the fame line, the marriage line, the money line, and the travel lines.


The health line can be found extending from below the little finger, down across the palm, to the base of the thumb. The fame line, if visible, starts at the base of the hand, and moves its way up to below the ring finger, running parallel to the fate line.The marriage line is the little line (or lines) that are located just below the base of the little finger.The money line has varying paths and its meaning is interpreted in relation to its location. The travel lines generally start from the edge of the palm at the 'heel,"" opposite the thumb, and extend horizontally. , The health line deals with material well-being as much as the physical. When the life line may be faint or hard to see. If a person has very faint fate, fame, or success line, then the health line also plays a strong part in the development of material wealth. The health line can be found extending from below the little finger, down across the palm, to the base of the thumb. Sometimes, it may even join with the life line. Some of the features to look for include:The lack of a health line indicates that the person will have few, or perhaps even no, health problems. A strong and undisturbed line means a strong business sense as well as the strength to work hard and make money.
A wavy line indicates potential health problems as a result of anxiety and nervousness
A broken line may indicate that poor health will cause problems in business situations. Smaller lines crossing health line mean that the person is prone to accidents. Extra lines branching onto the life line are a sign of a life-threatening situation in old age. A square encircling the line is a sign of protection, whether it be in the form of good medical treatment, or aid in solving a business problem. A break in the line to form a ""donut"" shape signifies a need for hospitalization.
A triangle formed by the life, head, and health lines is known as ""the Lucky Triangle"". This triangle signifies greater luck the broader its angle.

, The fame line influences the social rewards of success. This line, if visible, starts at the base of the hand, and moves its way up to below the ring finger, running parallel to the fate line. The following are characteristics of the fame line to look for.A missing fame line indicates that one's future fame must be looked for in other areas of the palm. The individual may still be successful but prefer to do without public acclaim. If the fame line is strong and clear this indicates distinction and satisfaction with your life's work.
If the fame line is broken repeatedly, it is an indication of the ups and downs of social recognition.
A fame line that travels straight to the ring finger shows a person likely to have fame in the arts. If it starts at the head line and runs through the heart line this shows hard work and success late in life. A separation at the end of the fame line (becoming two smaller lines) indicates that success may be dubious in value.
A fame line that ends beneath the ring finger in a star or triangle shows that spectacular success awaits in the fine arts field (acting, singing, dancing).If it ends beneath the ring finger in a square this indicates a kindly patron.

, Relationships are indicated by the little line (or lines) that are located just below the base of the little finger. The closer the lines are to the base of the little finger, the later in life these relationships will be. The characteristics of the marriage line to look for are: Several light lines indicate several romances. Strong and clear lines indicate marriage. Numerous overlapping lines indicate affair(s). Lines that meet but don't cross show children that will be born.
A fork in the lines towards the back of the hand indicates a long engagement. A fork at the end towards the palm means separation (with or without divorce).
A line at the end of the marriage lines that cuts the line off sharply means end to a relationship due to death or divorce. However breaks in the lines that resume with an overlap show separation with a later reunion.

, This line is not a direct indicator of accessing material wealth. It represents the bearer's skill in acquiring riches, as well as giving some indicators of how to achieve this. The characteristics of the money line are: A money that runs from the base of the thumb to below the index finger ending in a star shows a natural talent for moneymaking.
A line running from the base of the thumb to the little finger indicates wealth acquired through inheritance or family allowances. A line that runs from the base of the thumb to below the middle finger means money made in business. A money line running to the ring finger, cutting through the fame line would indicate money obtained through luck and surprise.

, The travel lines are a major indication of the trips taken throughout your life that have had or will have a penetrating impact on your life. They can also indicate your desire to travel. Some things to look for in relation to the travel lines are: Travel lines that intersect the life line mean a trip will be made under circumstances of health, or your health will be affected by a trip. Travel lines that intersect the fate line show that travel will present a life-changing experience.
If the the travel lines cross this means danger, or problems within travel. If a square encircles the lines this is a sign of protection in your travels. Breaks indicate possible delay in your travels.

They include the lines of opposition, intuition, escape, and influence.

, These lines can be found on the outside of the palm, between the heart and head lines. These lines illustrate the opposing forces that we all must deal with in life.

, This line appears on the outer palm (at the base of the hand under the little finger). It illustrates strong insight. If you have this line you are an extremely sensitive, intuitive person and may have ESP (extra-sensory perception).

Choose which hand to read.,
Focus on the thumb.,
Look at the basic shape.,
Look for a loop.,
Look for a whorl.,
Look for an arch.",How to Analyze Fingerprints2," You’ll hear different schools of thought on which hand you should read, but there is one main thing which you can keep in mind. Almost everyone has a dominant hand, the one they write with and tend to perform most tricky tasks with. The dominant hand is the best to read in regards to the public self. It reveals things about you that the world sees. Reading the non-dominant hand will tell you things about the private self.Other methods say choose which hand based on male or female, or present life versus future life.
In matters of your work life and career, the dominant hand is the one to read. Emotions, relationship issues, and your dreams are often revealed by the non-dominant hand.

, The way that fingerprints show up on each finger tends to reveal different things about a person, so a shape on the middle finger may not mean quite the same thing as a shape on the pinkie finger. As you get better at analyzing fingerprints, you can learn more about each finger, but for now start with the thumb. It is good to read the thumb because it is thought to be representative of the hand as a whole. The thumb is said to represent the person’s overall identity., When you first start out, it can be good to press the thumb into black ink to reveal the ridges better and make it easier to read. There are three primary patterns of prints, which are the loop (most common), the whorl (second most common), and the arch (least common). There are even further distinctions, which are more rare, but these are what you will typically find.A loop looks kind of like a lasso. An arch looks like a wave or a bridge. A whorl looks like a bullseye.
There are also variations such as the tented arch, which has a much steeper peak, and the composite whorl, which is sort of like a swirl or yin-yang sign.

, There are two types of loop, ulnar and radial, with ulnar meaning the loop opens toward the fingers and radial meaning the loop opens away from the fingers. Ulnar loops are the most common print and tend to be found on likeable people. This print can identify someone who is flexible and goes with the flow and is sociable and easy to get along with. The negatives of ulnar loop people tend to be that they are scattered and have a hard time organizing. They may also be restless, not quite feeling at ease.The less common radial loop represents someone who is open-minded and clever. They often live lives of altruism, giving to those in need. The downside for radial loop people is that if they do not stay centered, focused, then they will start to absorb too much stress.

, This print shows up as a series of closed circles, or a spiral. This print tends to be found on people who may be a little self-centered, having a strong sense of independence and individuality. They are often rigid in their mindsets and can become overly focussed. The downsides of this print type are that they may have a short fuse and become angry easily. They also tend to lose interest in projects once they start them.Variations of the whorl include the peacock’s eye, which resembles a peacock’s feathers, and a composite whorl, which is sort of a series of circles that got smudged on one side.

, This print is often found on someone who is analytical and practical, always trying to figure out the best approach to situations. They are often not a fan of change and may be hard to get along with if they are particularly set in their ways. However, arch people often tend to be exceptionally loyal to the people they care about.This print comes in the variation of the tented arch, which is basically an arch with a much more pointed top. These people may be very open and friendly one day and closed off the next day.

Use the Salam greeting when meeting a Muslim.,
Do not expect the Salam greeting from a Muslim.,
Expect a Muslim to return the Salam greeting.",How to Greet in Islam1," Greet a Muslim as they would greet one another.

You might also choose to use the longer greeting of ""As-Salam-u-Alaikum wa-rahmatullahi wa-barakatuh"" (""Peace be unto you and so may the mercy of Allah and his blessings”).
The pronunciation is “us-saa-laam-muu-alie-kum waa-rah-ma-tull-laa-hee wa-bara-kaa-tu-hu.”;
, Traditionally, the Salam greeting is reserved for those of the Muslim faith, so if you are not Muslim, you might not receive this greeting.Some current Islamic scholars believe that, in the interest of global peace and understanding, it is permitted to initiate the Salam greeting with non-Muslims.If you do receive the Salam greeting, respond with ""wa-Alaikumussalam wa-Rahmatullah.""
The pronunciation is ""waa-alie-kum-us-salam waa-rah-ma-tull-la""

Define ad make sure about your intention in doing Dawah.,
Pray to God and ask for guidance and a sound mind for you to be able to share your faith according to His holy will ad not by your own desire.,
Teach yourself to be humble and to control your temper.,
Seek knowledge in every field of the religion.",How to Give Dawah (Calling them to Islam) to the Non Muslim," You need to have a pure and good intention because Allah is good and pure so he only accepting good and pure offerings. And we must know that our actions are will be judge by our intentions. And we must have the intention to seek only Allah's pleasure and to seek closeness to him AND NOT BECAUSE OF SHOWING OFF that we are a knowledgeable person, if your intention is this Allah will never five you a reward but punishment and torment and also He will not accept the good deed you have done because of your showing off, and the worst is God will call you a liar on the judgement day and he will put you in the hellfire as a punishment of your hypocrisy, like the religious scholar narrated in a hadith.;
, For God to answer your Du'a you must need to have a righteous life far from doing unlawful things, remember Allah (God) is far removed from every imperfection and only accepts that which is lawful (23:51;2:172), so if you are living with the unlawful lifestyle, one thing is for sure, Allah will ever accept and hear your Du'a to Him except you repent and ask for His forgiveness. When you are making a dua you also need to be patient (sabr) and do not be one of the un-sincere servants as the Prophet (saws) said in a Hadith: "" The dua of any one of you will be answered so long as he is not impatient and says, ‘I made dua but it was not answered. ""and also he said "" Let not any one of you say, ‘O God, forgive me if You will, O God have mercy on me if You will. Let him be resolute in the matter, whilst knowing that no one can compel God to do anything."" so be one of the patient Muslims.  However sometimes God responds in a different way, He might keep some evil away from the supplicant, or He will reward him with something good but not exactly what the supplicant asked for.  It is important to remember that God knows what the future holds and we do no (2:216), Sometimes God will save his response to a dua until the Day of Resurrection when a person will be most in need of it.  (cf. http://www.islamreligion.com). Make dua and be patient and never give up, for God will answer, in the best possible way, at the best possible time (21:88;42:26). Even the Prophets of Allah has also their problems, but instead to loose hope the patiently turn to Allah ad put their trust to Him (7:23;21:87;2:83;28:24;20:25-28;7:155-156;27:15;38:35;) all we need to do is to be patient, never and never and never give up and the most important submit your self to Allah. In sha Allah He will grant you the knowledge you want to gain, just wait patiently ad be a good student, in sha Allah if He saw that you are serious in searching knowledge He will give it to you some day.

, We humans are created by God in order for us to worship him (51:56), so if you really understand the purpose of your creation, you will never be like the arrogant people, you will learn to humble your self in submission to God, and do not be like Iblis who refuses to prostrate and give homage and respect to Adam (15:30-35), remember that those who are humble and God conscious are most honorable i the eyes of Allah i the mids of us. You must keep away your self to the men with their pride, because Allah does not love each arrogant boasters (31:18). Remember that if Allah gives you good things or let say you learn new knowledge, instead of being an arrogant person, the more you need to humble your self to others, because Allah loves the Humble toward other creation. Being a Humble person is a sign of a True Muslim (25:83).

, Allah love those who seek knowledge (Behar ul Anvar v : 1; p : 172, Alkafi v : 1), and seeking knowledge is much better than performing fast and salat a thousand years ( Behar ul anvar V : 1 ; P : 166), Masha'Allah, you see how important the seeking of knowledge? God will grant you more of this if you will do it for his sake. ' “O young nation; keep your honour by being polite and your religion by knowledge. ”Knowledge is more than what you can learn all of that, then learn the best one. ” Ghorar ul Hekam. and it is said in the quran: { Say (O Muhammad): “This is my way, I invite to Allaah with sure knowledge.”} .

Make sure you have the right intentions before giving Dawah.,
Take a short Dawah course to learn how to give Dawah to a variety of different individuals.,
Learn how to answer frequently asked questions about Islam.,
Integrate Islam into your life as much as possible.,
Pray to God and ask for guidance and a sound mind for you to be able to share your faith according to His holy will.",How to Give Dawah1," You should have pure and good intentions. Oftentimes, many Muslims decide to tell the world about Islam but do it in a way that causes more damage than good, putting themselves in unfortunate situations.


Don't give Dawah if your intention is to show off that you are a very knowledgeable person; make sure your intention is to please Allah.
Giving Dawah is essentially a special mission to invite people to worship Allah according to the way that He wants to be worshiped. You are delivering a message of truth and showing others how to follow it.
The purpose of Dawah is not only to spread the knowledge of Islam but to grow closer to Allah yourself. Take the act of inviting others to Islam as a way to bring yourself closer to Islam as well.;
, You can often find organizations or community groups that come together to teach about Dawah. Most of these courses are free.


Some organizations, like Mission Dawah, offer online training or training apps. You can find courses that come in audio, video, or written format for your convenience.
Conferences dedicated to teaching how to give Dawah are often held, so be on a lookout in your local area for those. There, you can meet others wishing to give Dawah and learn from educated and experienced teachers and preachers.

, If a Dawah course is not doable for you, there are many materials and resources that talk about common questions people may ask about Islam and how to answer them. Search local Islamic centres for books or the internet to learn what others are asking about Islam. Some questions you might be asked are:


What is the difference between the words Islam and Muslim?Who is Allah?Who is the Prophet Muhammad? And why do Muslims believe he is the last prophet?What do Muslims believe about Jesus?
What does Islam say about homosexuality, abortion, and marriage?, This means you live and breathe Islam both mentally and physically. You should continue to present yourself as a Muslim as well as bring Islam material into your daily interactions and environments.


Maintain the physical appearance of a believer by growing and maintaining a beard and wearing your hijab.
Bring Islamic materials to your workplace or where ever you go. This makes giving Dawah easier, as it may spark conversations or questions from others.
Bring halal meat to your workplace and share them to others to generate conversations.
Pray at your workplace or wherever you are. Let people know prayer is very important to you. You may need to arrange a place or room with your employer and employees in order to pray.

, For God to answer your prayers, you must live a righteous life and repent any unlawful things you may have done.


Truthfulness is one of the most important qualities to have when calling people to Islam. Having this mindset will lead you closer to Allah and also prepare you better for Dawah.

Give Zakat away on the harvest day.,
Calculate accurately.",How to Observe Obligatory Charity (Zakat)," Zakat must be given away ""on the day of harvest"" (6:141).

Whenever you receive ""net income,"" you must set aside 2.5 percent and give it to the specified recipients - parents, relatives, orphans, the poor, and the traveling alien, in this order (2:215).
The vital importance of Zakat is reflected in God's law: ""My mercy encompasses all things, but I will specify it for the righteous who give Zakat"" (7:156).;
, Zakat must be carefully calculated and given away on a regular basis whenever you receive any income.

Government taxes should be deducted, but not other expenses such as debts, mortgages, and living expenses.
If you do not know needy persons, you may give the Zakat to a mosque or charitable organization with the distinct purpose of helping poor people.
Charities given to mosques or hospitals or organizations cannot be considered Zakat.

Stop indulging in sin.,
Abstain from all sins, out of love for Allah Ta’ala.,
Develop the conscious awareness that Allah Ta’ala is with us : He is watching us, He is hearing us, He knows all and everything about us; We cannot hide from Him; We cannot conceal our actions from Him.,
Remember the angels too are witness to all our actions; that the earth is recording our behaviour and that all of it is also noted in our books of deeds – that we are accountable to Allah Ta’ala on the Day of Judgement.,
Reflect daily.,
Ponder over the fact that the Angel of Death does not give respite.,
Ponder over the fact that Allah Ta’ala has blessed us with the gift of sight, hearing, health, wealth, and so much else – and has also granted us the gift of respect.,
Contemplate on the consequences of such behaviour and a little bit of Mujahada – which entails ‘not doing’ and Alhamdulillah, the sicknesses are cured.,
Attend the talks of the learned Scholars of Islam whenever possible, or listen to recordings of their talks and read their books to gain benefit of pious, righteous company.",How to Give Up Sins (for Muslims)," We all sin sometimes and even excessively indulge in those sins, but we can learn to moderate this by following Islam. Alhamdulillah, many who followed through with this prescription have found a whole new life – of peace, happiness, blessings and mercy. On tasting the sweetness that comes with obedience, there is no desire to return to any form of disobedience. Try to understand why Allah Ta'alaa has made the rules that He has made and do your best to follow them in full. Be aware that whilst Allah Ta'alaa is inclined towards mercy for those that sincerely repent from their sins, he can be severe in punishment for those that disobey Him.;
, He has granted us everything and asks for very little in return. It is the nature of human beings that we love the person that is kind and generous to us. Then what of Allah Ta’ala who has provided us with plentiful blessings – in fact, with everything? The sight, hearing, speech, the organs that are functioning in such an amazing manner, the limbs - all in our service – for eating, drinking, walking, sitting, etc. The gifts of wealth: the clothing, shelter, transport, food, drink, and so many other comforts. …We use them all, but do we keep in mind, the Generous Benefactor? Do we give thanks for these bounties or show any appreciation to the Giver? All he asks in return is that we worship and obey Him.

, Then should we not feel ashamed that in His Presence, we are disobeying Him? Are we not showing ingratitude to the Benefactor, when engaging in sins in His very Presence?

, Added to this, our actions are also presented to Rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam), so we should give thought to whether our actions are a source of joy or grief to him. …In this manner, we will develop that shame and modesty which will make it easy to restrain from Haraam.

, Muraqaba is meditating on the actions engaged in during the day: We should reflect over our deeds for the day and seek forgiveness for shortcomings and resolve not to return to those bad deeds. We should also express gratitude on good deeds and make dua for an increase in them.

, It must not be that whilst obeying the Nafs in sinful pleasure, the Angel of death visits; and departure is in disgrace, and return to Allah Ta’ala is at a time when He is angry, and that death is an embarrassment to the person, family and community who find out that death came in sin. May Allah Ta’ala protect us all from death in a state of transgression, but this is very much a reality.

, However, what He gives, He can also take away. He has explicitly stated that ingratitude for His Gifts will draw very severe punishment. So is sin not abuse and ingratitude for the gifts of sight, of heart, of mind, of limbs?

, You may find it helpful to read up about some of the punishments that Allah Ta'alaa has prepared in the Hellfire for those that disobey him.

, Join and participate in the Deeni activities with those who follow the Qur’an and Sunnah. On will, Insha-Allah, find a great improvement in one’s condition by keeping the right company

Shake hands with male Muslims if you are male.,
Do not shake hands with female Muslims if you are male.,
Do not shake hands with male Muslims if you are female.",How to Greet in Islam2," It is common for Muslim men to shake hands.


There is generally no prohibition against men shaking hands with other men.
The exception is some Shia Muslims prohibit shaking hands with any non-Muslims.Do not be offended if a Muslim declines to shake your hand. It isn’t a personal affront but a reflection of their religious beliefs.

, While there is debate on the appropriateness of female Muslims shaking hands with men, you should not do so unless she initiates the contact.


Many Muslim women do not shake hands with men due to religious prohibitions against a woman being touched by a man outside of her family.Some Muslim women, especially those working in corporate environments, might shake hands with men.Some Muslim women wear gloves in order to get around the prohibition against touching a male who is not a relative., Regardless of your religious beliefs, you should not reach for a male Muslim’s hand unless he initiates the contact.


Pious Muslim men do not touch women outside of their family (wives, daughters, mothers, etc.)Refraining from touching a woman she is not related to is considered a gesture of respect and modesty."
"
Greet your fellow Muslim by wishing them peace.,
Remember that Allah commands that Muslims greet one another.,
Return the greeting.",How to Greet in Islam3," One should always greet a fellow Muslim.


""As-Salam-u-Alaikum"" is the most common greeting among Muslims.This is the minimum required when greeting a Muslim.
It is permissible to use the minimum greeting when time is short, such as when passing each other on the street.
Add “wa-rahmatullahi wa-barakatuh” to complete the greeting.

, Be mindful of the rules governing who initiates the greeting.The one who comes greets the Muslims that are present.
The one who is riding greets the one who is walking.
The one who is walking greets the one who is sitting.
The smaller group greets the bigger group.
The young greet the elders.
Say the Salam greeting when arriving and leaving a gathering., Always acknowledge the greeting by giving a response.


Respond with ""wa Alaikum Assalam wa Rahmatullah.""It is permissible to respond only with the first part (""wa Alaikum Assalam"").

"
"
Begin by getting to know the person.,
Ask them if there is anything they do not understand about Islam.,
Say thank you.,
Be polite and don't argue or debate with who you are giving Dawah to.,
Speak the truth.,
Don't worry if non-Muslims do not accept Islam.",How to Give Dawah2," Talk to them about themselves, their family, their work, and show that you genuinely care about them. Each person is unique and getting to know them will help you plan the best way to give Dawah to them.


Try to find out as much as you can what they know about Islam. Some good opening questions are: How did you first hear about Islam? What do you know about Islam? Or bring up some recent news involving Islam.
Do not speak too much about Islam at one time -- let them set the pace. It is best to give Dawah in small doses. Depending on who you are talking to, you can continue the conversation or give literature for them to go through on their own. Giving Dawah is about simplicity.Just be friends with them. Sometimes introducing or reminding someone of the Islam faith is just to be a good friend and show through example. This is especially effective if you know of a Muslim that is straying from Islam.

, You can ask, ""What do you think is wrong with Islam?"" or ""What do you think Islam is?"" Then clear each misconception with as much knowledge and clarity as you can offer. Or point them to the right direction to obtain these answers.


Many people will have confused Islam traditions and teachings with ideas that they are already familiar with outside of Islam. For example, people who are familiar with the Christian Bible and its many interpretations may draw the same interpretations when they hear that the Quran mentions Adam and Eve. Some believe that, because of the Bible, society sees women as lesser than men and then have the misconception that women are also oppressed or dominated by men in Islam. Point them towards the Quran and outline the differences between the Quran and the Bible and what these differences mean.
In the media and popular culture, many Islamic traditions are the subject of heated debates. The hijab worn by Muslim women is a popular debated topic. You should clarify these misconceptions and lead them to view these concepts of Islam in the framework of Islamic thought which sees the wearing of the hijab as honouring purity of both thought and body.

, Thank the person for giving you the chance to share about Islam to them. You might even want to try saying thank you if someone asks you a rude question or insults Islam, as exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad. By saying thank you in response to abusive statements, you show others that Islam is, indeed, a good faith. It may also surprise them and make them more open to listen to you.


For example, someone might ask, ""Why do Muslim women cover their heads? Isn't this a sign of subjection of women?""Tell them, ""Thank you for asking me about my religion"" and continue with ""You have an interesting question concerning Islam and I congratulate you for seeking correct knowledge about our faith.""

, Arguing and debating is against the teachings by Allah in the Quran; ""He who gave up disputing while he is right, a palace of high rank in Paradise will be built for him"" (At Tirmidhi). Although your intentions may be good, arguing could lead to disputes and it is best to spread the knowledge in a peaceful way. In Islam, backing down is better than debating.


Stop looking for ""loop holes"" in others' beliefs or putting them down for their beliefs. Belittling others is against the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad.
Be more inviting and less defensive. Being defensive or argumentative pushes people away from Islam. It may also hurt people such as your family or friends and even you, bringing in frustration caused by these disputes. In the end, God knows your intentions and will work his will.

, Islam believes that truthfulness is one of the pillars the world's survival depends on. Since speech or speaking is an exclusive human trait, lying is seen as losing your humanity. So when giving Dawah, not only is it important that you do not lie, but also preach that you cannot lie and the faith of Islam is all about truth. You can give examples from the Quran and Sunnah of what lying means and what its consequences are.


Some examples of lying are lying when buying and selling, lying about visions and dreams, telling lies as jokes, or being hypocritical.Allah also warns against speaking about everything you hear as you may hear both truths and lies, and speaking about everything could count as lying.
Do not tell lies about Allah and His Messengers: “Telling lies about me is not like telling lies about anyone else. Whoever tells lies about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1229.If you do not know the answer to a question, say ""I don't know"". Don't lie about your knowledge or spread misinformation. The best way to go about this is to be truthful and direct the person to another source that may contain an answer to their question.

, The purpose of Dawah is not to convert or convince others to Islam. The decision should be made by the person's own free will.You're duty is to convey the message of truth. Allah guides whom He wills.


Ask them, even if they do not accept Islam, what they think of Islam now. This can aid you in future attempts at Dawah or even continue the conversation.

"
"
Hand out materials such as a CD, book, or brochure of other more experienced Da'ee (caller of Islam).,
Do charity work to help others and also show how Islam has affected your life.,
Provide materials to your Islamic community by recording lectures, or posting videos.",How to Give Dawah3," One of the easiest ways to give Dawah is to spread the message through another Da'ee, especially if you are still working on acquiring knowledge.


You can also give a translated version of the Quran. The Quran is your most effective tool in telling others about Islam, as it is the most powerful book at your disposal.
Give out leaflets or brochures of upcoming conferences to people or to your local Islamic centre.
If you plan to do Dawah in public to strangers, giving material is the best way to engage others in conversation.

, Get involved in your local area by helping the old or disadvantaged, or with organizations that help with the environment, community, animals, and much more.


Engaging in charity work or sadaqah is a very important virtuous deed in Islam and shows Allah and others your faith in Islam. There are no preliminary requirements in order to give sadaqah and you can should give it freely without any limits or expect anything back.People touched by your charity work will most likely have a more open mind about you and Islam. This makes the message of Islam much easier for others to accept.

, This is especially needed if your community is lacking materials to give to members who have strayed from Islam or cannot attend meetings regularly. It will also bring you closer to others in your local community.


The Prophet Muhammad encourages that knowledge be shared and not withheld. There will be people in your community that are not willing to share the knowledge."

Think carefully about the divorce.,
Get an arbiter.,
If all else fails, file for divorce.,
Observe the waiting period of three months, or 'iddah.,
Decide who gets the child custody.,
Finalise the divorce after the 'iddah.",How to Get an Islamic Divorce," Is it necessary? Think long and hard about who is going to be affected - the children; the family; yourselves? In Islam, divorce is only a last resort if it is not at all possible to continue a marriage. When a marriage is falling apart, both spouses should try their best to bring the relationship back together; they should evaluation their relationship and reconcile.

Find forgiveness and patience for your partner and communicate them about why you may think things are not working out - perhaps your partner is particularly stressed or upset about something, thus leading to a negative behaviour. If, however, you think divorce is the only option, move on to the next step.;
, The Qur'an says, ""And if you fear a breach between the two, appoint an arbiter from his relatives and an arbiter from her relatives"". A marriage affects the whole family, and it is vital for family elders to attempt at reconciliation.

Some people are reluctant to get their family involved; in this case, you can speak to an independent marriage counsellor, although they are detached from the issue.

, Divorce, or talaq, is different for the husband and wife. In Islam, there is a three-month waiting period before the divorce is finalised.

The husband's divorce pronouncement can be verbal or written, but it must be done once. The wife is able to keep the dowry, or mahr, with her.
If, however, the wife initiates the divorce, she can either return her dowry to end the marriage, or petition a judge for divorce. She must show proof that her husband has not fulfilled his responsibilities. A separate legal process of divorce may also be required, in which attending hearings and obtaining a legal decree of divorce are required.

, The couple may live in the same house, but must sleep apart. The 'iddah gives the couple a chance to calm down and perhaps reconcile, as decisions are often made in haste. The 'iddah is a way of determining whether the wife is expecting a child - if so, the waiting period continue until after she has delivered the child. If the 'iddah is completed, the divorce is complete. The husband's financial responsibility to the wife ends, and she returns to her own family home. Do note that the husband is still responsible for the financial needs of any children.

During the 'iddah, the couple is free to resume their relationship, ending the divorce process.
The wife has the right to remain in the family home, and the husband is responsible for her wellbeing.

, Islam requires that the custody must go to a Muslim who is in good health physically and mentally and can meet the children's needs. Some judges allow preference of the children, while others award the custody to the mother if the child is under a certain age, and to the father if older.

The main concern must be that the child is cared for by a responsible parent who can meet the needs of the child.

, This is encouraged to do in the presence of two witnesses. After this, the wife is free to remarry.

It is discouraged to have a yo-yo relationship, nor engage in blackmail.

;
, One of these is the University of Southern California's Comependium of Muslim Texts database, which includes English translations of the two Saheehs.


Other useful hadeeth search engines include SahihalBukhari.com and SahihMuslim.com.






It is best, however, to compare the online English translations with those published by Darussalam, to ensure their accuracy.







, Muslim Hadeeth scholars unanimously consider the ahaadeeth of these two books as authenticexcept in a few extremely rare cases.


These exceptional cases have been quite thoroughly discussed by many renowned scholars of Hadeeth criticism in their works, such as ad-Daaraqutnee in At-Tatabbu` and Ibn Hajar in Hady-us-Saaree., The hadeeth may not be found in either of the two Saheehs, or its authenticity could still in doubt if it is one of those criticised by Hadeeth scholars. For these cases, the best online resource currently available in English is Hadeeth Encyclopedia, which is an online hadeeth categorization and classification project, but also provides hadeeth verification and validation services. There is also the Authentic Hadith Foundation's ""Check a Hadith"" service, but unlike Hadeeth Encyclopedia, they limit themselves to the rulings of just one Hadeeth scholar, Shaykh al-Albaanee.

Take a clean glass and fill it with water according to your requirement.,
Recite ""Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim"" / ""بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ"" (In the name of Allah , the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful).,
Drink water with the right hand.,
Sit down and drink water.,
Drink water taking three breathing pauses.,
While drinking water, do not blow or exhale your breath into the glass.,
Recite ""Alhamdulillah"" / ""الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ"" after drinking water.",How to Drink Water in Accordance with Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad Sallallaho Alaihi Wasallam," It is necessary that you don't drink a lot of water at a time even if you're very thirsty.


Prophet Muhammad (Sallallaho Alaihi Wasallam) said: ""Do not drink directly from a water pitcher (or any water container)"". (Hadith Bukhari)
Drinking water is healthy but drinking it in an improper way is not. So the main thing is that you drink water according to your daily requirement (1.5-2 liters/day).
Science proves that when a person drinks too much water in a short period of time, the kidneys cannot flush it out fast enough and the blood becomes waterlogged which can, strangely, become a cause of death. ;
,


Prophet Muhammad (Sallallaho Alaihi Wasallam) said:""When commencing to drink first recite Bismillah."" (Hadith Tirmidhi).
By this act, we actually praise The Almighty Allah who gave us water to drink without which nobody can survive on earth.

, Like most of other daily routine works are said to be performed with right hand, drinking water is also among them.


Prophet Muhammad (Sallallaho Alaihi Wasallam) said, ""Never eat and drink with the left hand because Shaytaan (Satan) eats with the left hand."" (Hadith Muslim)

, Everyone is in a hurry for something, but that should not stop us from taking a moment to sit down and drink it in a healthy way.


Prophet Muhammad (Sallallaho Alaihi Wasallam) said: ""Sit down and drink."" (Hadith Muslim) and also said: ""None of you should drink while standing; and if anyone forgets, he must vomit."" Science has proved that drinking water whilst standing or walking can cause Gastrointestinal Tract (GIT) damage, kidney damage, arthritis, nerve tension and other disorders. , It is prohibited to drink water in a single gulp, an act that we normally do when we are extremely thirsty.


Prophet Muhammad (Sallallaho Alaihi Wasallam) said, ""Do not drink water only in one breath, but drink it in two or three breaths.""
Scientific studies show that there are many harmful effects in drinking water in one gulp. It can cause choking of esophagus. It especially weakens the muscles and nerves. It is also detrimental for the liver and stomach. , This is an important etiquette of drinking water.


Abdullah Bin Abbas (Radi Allahu anhuma) narrates the Prophet of Allah (Sallallaho Alaihi Wasallam) said, ""Do not blow from your mouth into food and water."" (Rawahe Tibrani).
Science shows that exhaling CO2 into a glass of water causes it to react and form carbonic acid that can disturb our internal environment causing a pH change. This, in worse condition, can lead to 'Acidosis' (a condition where the blood has too much acid, or a very low base, and often causes decreased blood pH). ,


Prophet Muhammad (Sallallaho Alaihi Wasallam) said: ""Recite 'Bismillah' before drinking and say 'Alhamdulillah' after drinking."" This act is performed to praise The Almighty Allah for blessing us with water; colorless, odorless, tasteless yet the most important drink on the whole earth.

Familiarize yourself with the different signs of the zodiac.,
Learn the elemental classifications of each sign.,
Check for compatibility between signs.,
Know which signs have low compatibility.",How to Check Zodiac Sign Compatibility1," To understand relationship compatibility, you must first have an understanding of the signs of the zodiac and what they mean. The twelve signs are: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. Each sign is derived from a configuration of astral bodies thought to dictate the characteristics of the people born during times when those bodies are prominent in the heavens., In addition to its constellation form, each sign is assigned an elemental significance, bearing one or more traits of the earth’s natural forces. The classifications are as follows: Fire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), Air (Aquarius, Gemini, Libra), Water (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), and Earth (Capricorn, Taurus, Virgo). A sign’s element comes from the role of its physical form in the natural order.Elemental classifications are a kind of rough grouping of attributes: Fire signs tend to be inquisitive, passionate, optimistic, while Water signs are loyal, sympathetic and driven; Earth signs are known for their rationale, practicality and stability, and Air signs are friendly, sociable and love making connections.

, As a general rule, zodiac signs that fall under the domain of Fire are believed to have the greatest compatibility with those of Air, while Water and Earth signs make the best pairings with their respective qualities. There are also other compatibilities that fall outside of the usual elemental matches; these mostly have to do with the complementary traits, preferences and emotional behaviors of the different signs.Examples of strong compatibility through the zodiac include Pisces and Capricorn, Sagittarius and Aquarius, and even Virgo and Virgo—people of a certain sign are often quite compatible with another of their kind.
Make a note of what types your sign is compatible with and be on the lookout for these types when dating.

, No two signs in the zodiac are truly incompatible—there are only varying levels of compatibility, the highest of which are expressed in the traditional elemental pairings. However, any two signs from differing elemental groups are less likely to possess the attributes necessary to foster a strong, long-lasting relationship.Incompatibility is most often caused by opposing traits causing disagreements and making communication difficult.
Sometimes, a particular characteristic of a sign might be too much for the sensibilities of another, even if they’re technically compatible. Much of astrological compatibility has to be put to the test in reality, with the symbolism of the signs acting as guidelines.

You’ll have access to resources on the signs and their meanings, ideal compatibilities, classical texts and more technical information on the interactions of astral bodies.Be wary of websites that try to get you to buy or subscribe to anything. The owners of these sites will usually try to sell “special” products that contain the same information as resources that are free to the public.

, Most astrology websites contain a lengthy blurb describing the common characteristics of each sign of the zodiac. Find your sign and read up on it, as well as that of your love interest. Think about what is true in each summary and what doesn’t apply. Studying the zodiac can enlighten you to tendencies you don’t necessarily see in yourself, or help confirm what you already know.There is a wealth of available information about how astrological conditions affect personality. Read all you can on how you and your love interest’s signs react to various situations in order to gain an understanding of how a relationship between the two of you might fare., Find and fill out an online compatibility test.

Simply put your date and time of birth into one of these forms to find out your astrological sign and be given a list of other signs that you’re likely most compatible with.Online compatibility tests quickly sort through the relevant data you provide to give you an overview of what zodiac personality types are the best match for you.

, Astral bodies don’t directly influence a person’s character, of course, but one thing that the zodiac signs are useful for is indicating which personality types will and won’t mix well. Pay particular attention to articles and descriptions of how the signs relate to one another in relationships, and keep these considerations in mind when dating someone of a different sign.Zodiac signs only give you an idea of what to expect from a person—they should not decide whether or not you attempt to form a relationship with that person, or influence the relationship itself."

Listen as the particulars of your sign are explained to you.,
Have your relationship charted.,

Some might operate out of their homes, or perform astrological assessments as part of a holistic therapy treatment. Your best bet is to search the internet for astrology authorities in your vicinity.

, The astrologer you consult will need to know your date and time of birth, as well as a few other things about you.

They will also go over optimal relationship matches, tips for keeping your business and financial affairs in order and warnings about how to avoid pitfalls in your personal life.

Heeding the wisdom of an astrologer can give you a leg up when it comes to dealing with matters of the heart.Talk with your astrologer about what traits you and your prospective partner have in common, and in what ways you differ. Having this knowledge in advance can help the two of you unlock one another's passions and prepare you to effectively resolve unexpected disagreements later on.
When two signs seem especially incompatible, a good astrologer will have recourse in the reading of moon signs and Venus and Mars alignment, advising you on ways to cultivate a fruitful relationship despite initial appearances., One of the benefits of scheduling a face-to-face meeting with an astrologer is that you have an opportunity to ask questions and receive answers on the spot. Think about any questions you might have regarding your zodiac sign, relationships, or how best to balance your innate temperament. Rather than cryptic mysticism, modern astrology should function as a kind of in-depth personality assessment making use of thousands of years of social analysis.In addition to general compatibility criteria, ask your astrologer about what qualities in particular you should look for in a lover to complement your own. Even within the right elemental signs, there are stronger and weaker pairings.

Like most professionals, they are there to do a job for which they are hired and they don't want to pursue heavy marketing to t.v. audiences which require them to do ""tricks"" and other magic-looking hocus-pocus.

, It's best to keep your question as simple as possible in the beginning and that you try to stay as neutral throughout the reading as much as possible. If you start to show your emotions, this will force the seer to consider holding back on details that you could possibly be very interested in - even though they may not be what you want to hear. For instance, if there's an unwanted event and you get upset about it, s/he might think of focusing on other topics rather than giving you the kind of information that will help you change this event or even stop it from manifesting. Worse, a false seer will use your emotional displays to start to give you an opinion instead of sticking to giving you valid predictions. I used to live in a building near Central Park and downstairs was a little ""psychic shop"". On a daily basis I would overhear her phoning people to tell them that if they didn't pay her $3000+ to put a spell on their lover that she would instead put bad luck on themselves. Clearly, she had managed to tap into the emotional weakness…and lure her clients into paying more for her personal belief systems. It's not fair and its really not truly psychic.

, It's okay if your seer asks you to sit in a certain way or to close your eyes, or to mention the first name of someone you would like to know more about: this simply helps them get connected to you and to start downloading information that you will find accurate. But, if the seer starts to ask you detailed questions about your relationship or who the person is at that point, you are unfortunately not really with a genuine psychic and it's possible you've been taken by a potential fraud.

, A professional seer should only predict events, rather than going into the role of becoming a spiritual advisor. On the other hand, if you are interested in spiritual opinions that they may have, by all means ask for them. You may also wish to ask for a different rate though. This is because the ability to see into another person's decisions, thoughts or events is a high quality expertise or skill. Spirituality is really a general community virtue which in my opinion can be shared but it really is not a type of service.

, Really accurate and professional-level descriptions of upcoming events, including decisions, is not a luxury the minute you learn how to take advantage of it to do well in your job, your relationship and basically your whole life. At that point, the price of such excellent service is and should be treated like the price of medicine: you don't want to have to depend on medicine the same way you depend on food. Likewise, medicine can get you results much, much faster than food but the idea is that you use it only when the problem debilitates your ability to live off food. In this case, the medicine is the high quality reading that comes at a much higher price than say, advice you give yourself for free or that a friend might give you. Just make sure you don't pay a high price to a seer who is not effective.

, Feedback is powerful. I really value their feedback and I know my work is excellent Unfortunately, a lot of my clients prefer to just phone me and not bother writing after every call. That's perfectly alright. And to be honest with you, sometimes I get a client who is angry and/or abusive - especially after a prediction came true that I had warned them about but they didn't believe me. It's rare but it does happen - especially in the hottest weather moments. When it happens, they can leave feedback that is much too personal and even dishonest. Dismiss those. Read the ones that seem objective. Aim to see the ones that say whether or not predictions come true.

, For example, if a person is thinking emotionally about their pet's name, then the pet's name can be 'seen' psychically. I remember on CNN how Anderson Cooper and a few others were trying to discredit the entire psychic ability process by asking someone to guess the colour or a number. Again, it is possible but only if there's an event associated with it. Decisions are events. Decisions can only be predicted at the moment of readiness to orient towards it. Truly, no one can predict free will in advance and any seer that says that they can is misleading. Before a decision is made, it is only possible to describe the orientation of a person based on his or her emotions. This is like describing the way a bowling ball is likely to roll based on the 'feel' of the alley and the thrust from the bowler's hand. And yet, only a high quality seer can predict what is also Unpredictable interference or obstacles that are coming up. This is extremely valuable.

, Yes, it might be tempting to ask your 'seer' what you should do . Don't! Instead, ask your seer to explore the outcome that would happen if you tried different approaches. List those approaches and let her/him do the work psychically rather than from the basis of an opinion.

Know the prophets of religion.,
Worship The One God with no partners, as it is he alone who made you; follow the prophets; believe in the Day of Judgment; enjoin good; forbid evil.,
Acknowledge the other scriptures; five known scriptures were revealed: the Scrolls to Abraham, the Torah to Moses, the Psalms to David, the Gospel to Jesus, and the Qur'an to Muhammad .

,
Don't believe everything you hear.,
Research the religion and know the what the Five pillars of Islam are.",How to Find Truth According to Islam," Islam means submission to the will of the only God and peace. That God is our Creator, who created us out of nothing and deserves our praise. A Muslim is someone who peacefully submits to the will of The One Creator, Who will test us on the Day of Judgment based on our obedience of His Laws (not the ones we create for ourselves). That Creator's proper name is Allah (The One to worship, in Arabic).;
, The Lord sent a prophet to every nation to teach them right from wrong and warn them of the Day of Judgment. Relaying the message of Allah, the prophets gave the glad tidings of eternal Paradise to those who obey, and a stern warning of eternal hellfire to those who reject the truth when delivered to them.

, (According to Shia beliefs) The vast majority of Muslims believe that the religion need no completion after the Qur'an was revealed and instructions left by the prophet.

,, Investigate for yourself. This is the most important decision of your life, it's not like choosing what degree to seek, and which house to buy. This life has an end.

To visit the Kaaba in Mecca, if able to do so.

Using a compass, draw three concentric circles on a piece of paper.,
Divide the space between the outer two circles into 12 equal sections.,
Label each section with its sign, represented by the sign's glyph (symbol).,
Divide each section (sign) into 30 equal degrees.,
Find the subject’s ascendant sign by looking up his or her birth date and time in an ascendant table in an ephemeris.,
Mark the ascendant sign on your chart.,
Determine the positions of the Moon, Sun, and Planets, and mark them on your chart.,
Draw in the houses.,
Calculate the aspects.,
Consult a book on the interpretation of the planets in each sign and house and make observations on the subject's personality and behavior.

",How to Create an Astrological Chart," The innermost circle should be fairly small relative to the outer circles.



Alternatively, obtain blank horoscope forms from an astrologer or astrological bookstore. Much easier than drawing circles by hand.

, Each section will symbolize one of the 12 signs of the zodiac (Cancer, Libra, etc.).

, If you label one section as Leo, the next section (see sub-steps below) should be Virgo, the next sign of the zodiac in the yearly order.



If you know the birth time, determine the Ascendant (Rising Sign) before putting the Signs into their spaces.
If the horoscope is for a Northern Latitude location, put the Sign of the Ascendant into the leftmost section: this is East when looking toward the South from a Northern location. Then fill in the rest of the Signs in counter-clockwise order.
If the location is of Southern Latitude, put the Sign of the Ascendant into the rightmost section, and place the rest in in clockwise order.

Strictly Speaking: If the location is within about 27½º of Latitude, the Declination of the Ascendant should be compared with that Latitude to check whether the Ascendant is North or South of the place - hence which side it should be placed at. In practice, however, this is almost never done, so you should be safe using the general practice above!!

, The whole circle has 360 degrees, so each of the 12 equal sections will have 30 degrees. Using small notches on the second circle, mark each degree. You can mark only every other degree or so if you wish, but keep in mind that the angles between points on the circle will be critical in interpreting the chart, so accuracy is important.


If you use a ""store-bought"" chart form, this may already have been done.

, An ephemeris is a chart of the positions of heavenly bodies at given points in time—you can purchase one or find one at the library, and several are available on the Internet. The ascendant is the sign of the zodiac that is rising over the eastern horizon at a given time (the time of birth, in this case) at a given place (the subject's place of birth) on Earth. Thus, in order to construct a very accurate chart, you will need to know the longitude and latitude of the subject’s birthplace (use an online search for ""longitude of -name-"" if you don't have a reliable map at hand), as well as the exact date and time. Computer programs available free on the Internet can provide you with the ascendant sign if you enter the necessary information.

, The computer program or ephemeris you use to determine the ascendant sign will tell you a location (in degrees) within that sign, for example 12 degrees Virgo. To locate the correct point, find the sign (in this case Virgo) on your chart, and, moving forward through the Sign, count in the number of degrees (in this case 12) from the Sign’s “beginning” edge. To put this example another way: if we imagine the circle to be a clock, and Virgo takes up the space between 9 and 8, Virgo begins at 9 (not 8), and you would count 12 degrees in from the 9 toward the 8 to find 12 degrees Virgo.

, Consult the ephemeris or computer program again to find the locations within the zodiac of the major celestial bodies at the time, date, and location of birth. These locations will be denoted by both the sign and degrees within the sign, as for the ascendant. Also, as with the ascendant, you will need to adjust the locations given in the ephemeris to take into account the actual time and place of the subject’s birth. If you use a computer program instead of an ephemeris, this adjustment will be made for you. Mark the positions in the space between the inner two circles of your chart. Denote the positions with glyphs (symbols used to represent each of the celestial bodies), and write the location in degrees next to the glyphs.

, The houses are imaginary divisions (usually twelve), each one signifying an aspect of the subject's life (money, children, family, personality, etc.). These are located in the large space in the chart between the inner circle and the second circle. The division method of the houses is controversial and there are several methods to choose from. One of these (perhaps the easiest) is the equal-house method, in which each house is 30 degrees wide. The “beginning” edge of the first house is drawn at the ascendant. If the ascendant is at 12 degrees Leo, the first house runs from there to 12 degrees Virgo, and the second house runs from 12 degrees Virgo to 12 degrees Libra, and so on. The houses are numbered 1-12 counterclockwise.

, An aspect is the angle formed between a pair of celestial bodies, with the earth as the center (or vertex) of the angle. You can estimate the aspects by simply looking at the chart. For example, if we imagine the chart to be a clock, if the sun is located in the 12 o'clock position and Venus is located at 3 o'clock, we can see that the angle between the two is 90 degrees. For more accuracy, you can calculate the aspects using the degree readings you recorded on the chart, keeping in mind that the entire circle has 360 degrees, and each sign has 30 degrees. You can draw in the aspects in the center circle if you wish.

Give them a chance to cool off.,
Allow them to vent.Once they cool down, Leos are going to need to vent a bit.,
Make empathetic statements.These statements are phrased so that they do not fuel anger.,
Explain how much you appreciate them.Leos are very self-sufficient, but they have a deep need for the love and admiration of others.",How to Apologize to a Leo1," The Leo sign is associated with the element of fire.Because of this, Leos tend to be high spirited and quick tempered.If you’ve upset a Leo so much that an apology is in order, give them a chance to cool down first. A Leo’s fiery temperament makes it very difficult to approach them immediately after they’ve been angered. Once they calm down a bit, Leos think more clearly and logically.


If you attempt to rationally engage too quickly, Leos are likely to lash out.
At minimum, give a Leo about 20 minutes or so after an incident before you approach them to apologize. By then, you should be able to have a logical conversation with them.;
, It might be unpleasant to sit through, but let it happen. They’ll burn off some of their initial anger and reduce a lot of their frustration this way. After venting their frustration, Leos will become more receptive to rational thought.


Avoid interrupting a Leo who is venting.
Give them the spotlight and allow them to say what they need to say.

, Instead, they reflect what an angry person is saying back to them in a non-threatening way. During the venting process, start using empathetic statements to calm the person down. The venting will begin to slow down and then eventually stop as the person runs out of steam. These statements usually being with “So you…”


Example: A Leo might say, “I was trying to get your attention because I needed your help upstairs. But you just sat there talking on the telephone.”
You should reply with, “So you felt that I ignored you when you needed help.”
Example: A Leo might say, “I wouldn’t have interrupted your phone call unless it was important. I expected you to pay attention and come help me.”
You should reply with, “So you felt the interruption was necessary and I should have recognized that.”

, Their fiery temperament is the source of many good qualities, but they do tend to act a bit like a spoiled child when they feel they’ve been slighted. What they need most, in order to forgive you, is the reassurance that you love and appreciate them.


Leos do not like to be ignored.After the initial cool down, step in as soon as possible.
Once you diffuse the worst of the situation, go to great lengths to reassure them of your appreciation and affection.

Look at the person carefully and see if any of the following descriptions are true for them. What strikes you most about how they look?


Usually the ascendant influences the physical appearance more dominantly so you may be able to guess that using physical traits and not the sun sign (which is the typical zodiac determined by your birth date alone).

, These traits include high set and narrow facial bones, broad foreheads, rosy cheeks, strong, well-proportioned body, above or below average height, and dark or sandy colored hair, strong eyebrows (not necessarily large though, they're often extremely thin but very notable), as well as clear and penetrating eyes which are often close-set.

, Taurus is ruled by Venus so these people will often be very attractive overall. Taurus people usually appear innocent, with childlike eyes, full lips, small/even teeth, with thick hair and strongly defined jawlines. Their bodies tend to be quite square overall. They typically have low foreheads, slightly thicker than usual necks, and attractive faces.

, A mischievous smile, full lips, average height, and a well-proportioned chin are standard characteristics of Geminis. They usually have high cheekbones and a youthful appearance. They are typically thin or even bird-boned, with pointy features, long fingers, a jaunty walk, and bright and sparkling eyes. They usually have a great fashion sense. They have a great ability to mimic things such as expressions. Their mimicking ability can help you distinguish one.

, Cancers have far-apart eyes and innocent facial features. They are of below average height, have a fleshy body and short legs, usually with brown hair, a round face, and a prominent forehead. They usually have very rounded bodies. All their features are very soft looking (unlike Aries). Their eyes are typically small, with a small or average sized nose, crooked teeth, and a full mouth. In essence, the upper body is invariably larger in proportion to the lower, which may make for a rather clumsy or top-heavy bodily appearance at times.

, Leos are known for their glamorous, thick, mane-like dark hair, large dark eyes, proud and confident expression which usually results includes their chin going up a little (resembles a lion), Leo is one of the attractive signs, but they can sometimes have bad luck. They may get irritated and have a prominent nose. They are typically tall with thin waists, trim athletic legs, broad shoulders, and muscular bodies. Leos are the type to have a Leo symbol tattoo. They also have very dramatic appearance .

, Virgos are typically fair, with clean-looking skin, a roundish head, and delicately-shaped lips. They have large and expressive eyes with an outward apex, and strong symmetrically refined features. Virgos are always very clean.

, Libras are ruled by Venus so they're going to be very attractive. Libras have dimples on the cheeks, nose, knees, or elbows, with chiseled lips, a roundish head, pretty face, thin nose, and generally refined and well balanced features. They make lots of facial and hand gestures while talking and have a loud, ringing laugh.

, They have strong features, intense hypnotic penetrating eyes that could burn holes in your soul, glowing tan almost oily skin, and a fixed expression. They tend to have very dark hair. There's something very sexy about this sign, and it's not necessarily in their physical appearance although it's definitely there.

, Sagittarius people have faces, chiseled jawlines, usually with a large and well-shaped skull. They have a high, broad forehead, a wide and infectious smile, and a tall well-formed figure with strong legs. They are usually good runners. They usually have a loud, booming voice.

, They typically have a chiseled, certain face, doe-like steady eyes, and brown or dark hair. Their hands are capable, and they have prominent cheek bones. Their faces aren't usually very expressive.

, Key characteristics of Aquarius people include a friendly but aloof expression, large and rounded eyes, and finely chiseled facial features. Aquarians also have average noses and lips that are full at the center and thin out toward the edges. Aquarius usually has something distinct and somewhat strange about their appearance (like a disproportionate feature, or an odd walking pattern etc.)

, They typically have innocent features, with a delicate and feminine expression. Pisces natives tend to have petite features. They have a gentle look about them. Their expression is often very dreamy and disconnected. They can lean toward corpulence (obesity) in their later years.

, People born in the Spring tend to have an attractive face (not necessarily handsome or pretty, just striking): Aries, Taurus, and Gemini.

, People born in the Summer tend to have exceptional skin and hair (hair does not have to be straight, just glamorous): Cancer, Leo, and Virgo.

, People born in the Fall tend to have natural, attractive gestures, looks, and movements: Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius.

, People born in the winter usually have strong, attractive bodies: Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces.

, Aries, Leo, Sagittarius: These people are physical and active. They tend to be rude and selfish, headstrong, confident, talented, charismatic, sociable, in good shape, and into sports. In a word, they are the doers.

, Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn: These people are physical and passive. They are perfectionists, hard-working, and tend to be introverted. They are confident, reliable, consistent, and understanding of many things. They're often overlooked but they, in a lot of ways, hold society together. In a word, they are the back-bone.

, Gemini, Libra, Aquarius: These people are mental and active. They are intelligent, interested in knowledge, energetic, charming, and good with words. They tend to be too changeable, articulate, and optimistic. In a word, they are the thinkers.

, Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces: These people are emotional and passive. They are emotionally sensitive, and deep. They are capable of powerful thoughts and actions; they are passionate and sexual. They are very intuitive and can almost seem psychic. In a word, they are the feelers.

, It has little to do with being macho or girly. In fact, men with astrological femininity often compensate by acting macho (working out, claiming to be promiscuous or tough) and women with astrological masculinity often compensate by acting ""girly"" (wearing ""girly"" clothes and makeup, claiming to be emotional).


Astrologically masculine qualities: Independence, dating a lot, they may come off as rude to those that don't understand them but in reality they just stand up for what they think is right, traveling a lot, and preferring to pursue people; being energetic, active, headstrong, talkative, confident, open-minded, sexual, and flirtatious.
Astrologically feminine qualities: Preferring long-term relationships, preferring to stay at home, needing more sleep, and preferring to be pursued; being methodical, considerate, reliable, kind, stubborn, polite, and shy.

, Are they confident in their habits? Do they display distinct qualities that most people do not possess? Do you know the person rather well? If so, this person may be a good candidate for analysis. On the other hand, does the person tend to act like everyone else? Is the person shy? Is the person quiet?

, Think about people you know very well and compare this person to them. Consider many personality traits, physical traits, and how they respond to stress. Compare this information to people that you know intimately to help you guess their sign.

, It is especially important to observe their behavior while they are in conflicts or while working in groups. We all learn to hide our inner feelings to some degree while in public. People usually display their astrological traits in relationships and tense interactions.For example, Aries' first reaction when faced with conflict is to yell or threaten, Gemini will talk his/her way out of it, Cancer usually responds with an emotional outburst, Taurus responds to conflict with silence and a posture of strength, etc.
Cardinal (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn): These people usually responds to conflict with a bold, decisive, instinctive action in an attempt to trump the assault. They are easily motivated to start tasks.
Fixed (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius): These people tend to hold in their reaction and respond that the attempt to hurt them was futile, with passive aggressive behavior or with silence. They concentrate on finishing things well.
Mutable (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces): These people tend to be artful with conflicts, and are known to try to avoid arguments. They are good at motivating people.

, Aries is considered the youngest, while Pisces is the oldest. The younger signs tend to display quick tempers and be more selfish and eager to learn while the older signs are wiser, more compassionate and more set in their ways. This is where people get the term old soul.

, Base your prediction from your study of astrology. The average guesser should have a 1/12 guess rate, but any study of astrology, however small, will improve on the 1/12 rate. Keep studying astrology from experts and from your own observations and your ""guessing"" will be 1/11 - 1/10.

, This will help you verify your guesses and improve your skills. You can use Google to find a birth chart calculator.

Treat them like royalty.Symbolically, the Leo sign is associated with the lion.Like the lion, they feel they are the kings/queens of their domain.,
Compliment them.Since Leos like to be lavished with attention, an apology might be more effective if you work in a few sincere compliments.,
Give them the spotlight.Leos have a flair for the dramatic and they want to be the center of attention.,
Be sincere.When a Leo feels hurt, they will make sure you know it.",How to Apologize to a Leo2," A Leo will react positively if you express loyalty and adoration. Along with your apology, lavish them with attention and pamper them.


Leos don’t like to be unhappy, and they are quick to forgive when the apology is done right.
Offering a small, thoughtful gift along with your apology might also be effective.

, Leos love the attention and they never tire of hearing good things about themselves. It might feel a little over-the-top or strange to couple an apology with compliments, but give it a try.


Example: “I really look up to you because of how hard-working you are. I’m really sorry that I didn’t finish my part of the project, and I understand why it would upset you.”
Example: “I know how much you value friendship – it’s one of my favorite things about you. Anyone would be upset if their best friend forgot their birthday, but I know it’s especially hurtful to you and I’m very sorry.”

, If you’ve upset a Leo, be prepared to give them your complete attention. Allow them the chance to fully explain their thoughts and feelings about the matter. Don’t interrupt them. If they clam up at first, encourage them to open up. It won’t take much.


Example: “I’m know I’ve upset you and I’m very sorry. Can you tell me how you’re feeling about this situation?”
Example: “Please tell me exactly what you’re thinking and feeling – I know that I’ve offended you, and I want to make sure I never repeat this same mistake.”

, It's best to take them aside for an earnest and private conversation. Explain that you are sincerely sorry, and that you'll be more careful with their feelings. Look them directly in the eye during the apology. Speak in a serious tone. Leave behind your cell phone and other distractions, since Leos will always want your full attention.


Show them respect, love and kindness – you’ll find that a Leo will get over a situation pretty quickly when you do.
Leos are loyal to their friends. In general, they are very forgiving and don’t usually hold a grudge."
"
Flatter them.Leos tend to be self-absorbed and a little arrogant.,
Apologize profusely.,
Give them an expensive gift.,
Avoid criticisms.",How to Apologize to a Leo3," Praise and flattery will appeal to their ego. They need to feel respected and adored in equal amounts. Shower them with flattering statements that focus on their best qualities. It might feel a little excessive to you, but a Leo will enjoy every second of it.


Example: “The presentation you gave at the meeting today was absolutely stellar. You’re always so prepared and you make it look so easy! I’m really sorry that I came in late.”
Example: “You are one of the most punctual people I know and I know how important being on time is to you. I’m sorry that I told you the wrong time and made you late.”

, A Leo tends to need a little convincing that you’re actually sorry. Along with being very sincere, apologize multiple times, in different ways. Once a Leo sees that you are earnestly trying to win back their friendship, they are quick to forgive and they won’t look back.


Leos don’t dwell on the past, so once your apology has been accepted, you shouldn’t either.

, Leos are known to be lavish spenders and they enjoy the finer things in life.If you give a gift to a Leo, make sure it reflects their personality and appeals to their dramatic side. They love fine art and jewelry. Flashy clothing in vibrant colors will also get a good reaction from a Leo. Look for something sophisticated and stylish, which will align with their lifestyle. Dinner at an upscale restaurant is another idea a Leo will love.


You don’t have to break the bank on this if you’re on a budget. Just make sure that your gift shows a deep appreciation for who they are and what they like.
A Leo will appreciate the extravagant gesture and take it as a sign that you care for them.

, Leos are extremely independent and they don’t handle criticisms well.When you're trying to apologize to a Leo, adding a criticism into the conversation will likely result in failure. If you do have criticisms, save them for another conversation.


It’s not that you can’t ever voice your honest thoughts to a Leo, but timing is everything.
Don’t expect to smooth anything over with a Leo if you follow up an apology with a criticism."

Lie down on a flat surface.,
Close your eyes and relax.,
Keep relaxing until you feel or hear vibrations.,
With your eyes closed, imagine your spiritual (astral) body lifting up from your physical, rested body.,
Keep doing this until you feel like you're floating up.,
If your astral projection was successful, you should see your physical body lying down below and could be walking around.

",How to Astral Project (Beginners)," A bed, couch, or sofa are good surfaces. If you're comfortable with lying down on the floor, then that's fine too.


Make sure you are as comfortable as possible, and wearing comfortable clothes (pajamas are recommended);
, Try to not fall asleep, however. The goal here is you're allowing your body to fall asleep while your mind is still awake. Breathe softly, in and out. This will help you relax more.


Focus on your breathing, and don't get carried away with thoughts.

, Vibrations are totally normal during astral projection and are a sign that you are on the right path. Avoid getting too excited though, as this will only ruin your astral projection. Just stay calm and positive, and relaxed.

, Don't overdo this and don't think too hard.

, This is a great sign that it is working.

Recognize how a syllogism makes an argument.,
Determine the three parts of a syllogism.,
Determine the minor and major terms.,
Look for categorical terms.,
Understand the distribution of terms in a syllogism.,
Identify an enthymeme.",How to Understand Syllogisms1," To understand syllogisms, you need to familiarize yourself with several terms often used when discussing formal logic. At the most basic level, a syllogism is the simplest sequence of a combination of logical premises that lead to a conclusion. A premise is a proposition that is used as evidence in an argument. A conclusion is asserted by the logical result of an argument based on the relationship of the stated premises.Consider the conclusion of a syllogism to be the “thesis” of an argument. In other words, the conclusion is the point proven by the premises.;
, Recall that a syllogism includes a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. Jumping into an example: “All humans are mortal” might function as a major premise, and would stand as a generally accepted fact. “David Foster Wallace is a human” might follow as a minor premise.Notice that the minor premise is more specific, and immediately relates to the major premise.
If each of the prior statements are considered valid, the logical conclusion would be “David Foster Wallace is mortal.”

, Both the minor and major premises of a syllogism must have one term in common with the conclusion. The term that is in both the major premise and the conclusion is the major term, which forms the predicate of the conclusion – in other words, it states something about the subject of the conclusion. The term shared by the minor premise and the conclusion is the minor term, which will be the subject of the conclusion.Consider the example: “All birds are animals. Turkey vultures are bird. All turkey vultures are animals.”
Here, “animal” is the major term, as it is in both the major premise and is the predicate of the conclusion.
“Turkey vulture” is the minor term, as it is in the minor premise and is the subject of the conclusion.
Notice that there is also a categorical term shared by the two premises, in this case “bird.” This is called the middle term, and is of immense importance in determining the figure of the syllogism, which is addressed in a later step.

, If you’re preparing for a logical reasoning test, or simply want to better understand syllogisms in general, note that most syllogism you will encounter will be categorical. This means that they will rely on reasoning akin to: “If ____ are/are not , then ____ are/are not ”Another way to think of the logical sequence employed by categorical syllogisms is that they all employ the logical sequence of “Some/all/no _____ is/isn’t ______.”

, There are four different types of propositions that can be made by each of the three parts of a syllogism. Think of how they differ in terms of how they each distribute – or don’t distribute – any categorical term. Consider a categorical terms to be “distributed” only if all individual members of that category are accounted for in the term. For example, in the premise ""all men are mortal"", the term ""men"" is distributed, as every member belonging to that category is accounted for – in this case, as mortal. Note how each of the four different types of propositions distributes (or does not distribute) the terms:


In ""All X are Y"" propositions, the subject (X) is distributed.
In ""No X are Y"" propositions, both the subject (X) and the predicate (Y) are distributed.
In ""Some X are Y"" propositions, neither the subject nor the predicate are distributed.
In ""Some X are not Y"" propositions, the predicate (Y) is distributed.

, Enthymemes, aside from having another really hard to pronounce name, are simply compressed syllogisms. Another way to think of an enthymeme is as a one-sentence syllogism, which may help you recognize both how and why syllogisms are a convenient reasoning device.In specific terms, enthymemes disregard the major premise and combine the minor premise with the conclusion.
For instance, consider the syllogism: “All dogs are canine. Lola is a dog. Lola is a canine.” The enthymeme of this same logical sequence would be: “Lola is a canine because she’s a dog.”
Another example of an enthymeme is “David Foster Wallace is mortal because he is human.”

Get an associate's degree or a bachelor's degree.,
Obtain a master's degree.,

Ask plenty of questions.",How to Study Philosophy," At the undergraduate level, philosophy majors usually study a mix of different philosophies from the historical and/or theoretical perspectives.Two-year associate programs in philosophy are somewhat rare since the study of philosophy can be applied to so many different areas of knowledge. As such, four-year bachelor programs taken at liberal arts institutions are more common.
You will likely study both ""continental"" philosophy—the work of Greek and European philosophers—and ""analytical"" philosophy--mathematics, logic, and theoretical physics.
Common areas of study include ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, and aesthetics.;
, If you want to further your education in philosophy after obtaining a bachelor's degree, you can pursue a Master of Philosophy, also called a ""Magister Philosophiae"" (M.Phil.) degree.


Master's programs in philosophy usually take about two years to complete.
For the most part, you will complete the same sort of work expected in a doctorate program. The primary difference is that you will not need to write a dissertation.

, Obtaining a doctorate degree in philosophy can get somewhat complex since many different areas of study are awarded with a ""doctorate in philosophy"" (Ph.D.). You will need to do a little extra searching to find a doctorate program that focuses only on philosophy and no other subject.


Most Ph.D. programs focused on philosophy are labeled as degrees in ""social philosophy"" or ""applied philosophy.""

, Most students of philosophy will need to read through philosophical readings several times before they fully understand them. As you advance in your studies, you may work out your own system of reading. At the start, however, it can be helpful to work through a reading four times.


During the first reading, look at the table of contents, key points, and/or glossary, then quickly scan through the passage itself. Move quickly, reading one page in roughly 30 to 60 seconds. Underline terms and ideas that jump out at you in pencil. Mark any unfamiliar terms, as well.
For the second reading, flip through the text at a similar pace, but stop to look up any terms or phrases you do not recognize and cannot define by context. Your focus should still be on identifying key terms and ideas. Check off paragraphs you think you understand in pencil, and mark those you do not understand with a question mark or ""x.""
During the third reading, go back to the sections you marked with a question mark or ""x"" and read them in greater detail. Check them off if you reach an understanding, or mark them with a second question mark or ""x"" if you do not grasp their meaning.
During the fourth reading, quickly review the text again to remind yourself of the main focus and key arguments. If you're reading for class, identify the marked passages you had difficulty with so that you can ask questions.

, The only way to familiarize yourself with philosophy is to immerse yourself in the philosophical works of others. If you do not read philosophy, you will not be able to speak or write it.


When studying philosophy for a class or degree program, you should always do the readings assigned to you. Listening to others' interpretations of those readings in class is not a good substitution. You need to review and grapple with the ideas on your own instead of having others do the work for you.
Reading on your own is also beneficial. As you become more familiar with different branches of philosophy, you can gradually begin selecting your own readings on potential topics of interest.

, While most lasting works of philosophy offer truths and reasoning that can be used in modern times, each one also has its own cultural biases to take into account.


Think about who wrote it, when it was published, where it was published, its original intended audience, and the purposes it was originally developed for. Also ask yourself how it was received in its own time and how it has been received since then.

, Some theses are obvious and explicitly stated, but many are not. You will need to consider the key passages and ideas you spotted during your first and second readings to help you determine the main idea the philosopher is trying to argue.


A thesis can be positive or negative, meaning that it can accept a particular philosophical idea or reject it. Identify the idea being addressed first. Then, use the writer's statements about that idea to figure out if the thesis is positive or negative.

, Supporting arguments should back up the writer's thesis. You may already know a few if you had to work backwards to find the thesis, but you should comb through the key ideas of the work again to identify any you may have missed.


Philosophers usually use logical argumentation to support their theses. Ideas and patterns of thought that are clearly sound will be presented and used to support the thesis.

, Not every argument presented will be a valid one. Question the validity of an argument by looking at the premises and inferences it is built upon.


Identify the premises and ask yourself if they are as true as the writer claims. Try to come up with a counter-example that proves the statement wrong.
If the premises are true, ask yourself if the inferences derived from those premises are sound. Apply the pattern of reasoning to a different case and see if it holds up. If it does not remain valid, the inference is not sound.

, Once you have examined all of the premises and inferences surrounding a thesis, you will need to evaluate how successful and true the idea is.


If all of the premises and inferences are sound and you can think of no logical argument against the thesis as a whole, you must formally accept the conclusion, even if you still do not believe it personally.
If any of the premises or inferences are faulty, though, you can reject the conclusion.

, Every paper you write will have a purpose. If you are writing an essay for a class, the question you need to address may already be provided. When this is not the case, though, you need to identify a single question or idea you want to tackle before you begin writing.


Make sure that you have a clear answer to your primary question. This answer will become your thesis.
Your primary question may need to be divided into multiple sub-points, and each of these points will need its own answer. As you plot out these sub-points, the structure of your essay will begin taking shape.

, As previously noted, your thesis will be derived from the answer you developed to your essay's central question. This thesis needs to be more than just a statement, though. You will need to show some line of reasoning leading up to it.

, Anticipate counter-arguments to each point you make. Note these counter-arguments in your essay and explain why those objections are not valid or sound.


Only spend a fraction of your paper addressing these objections. The majority of the essay should still focus on explaining your own original ideas.

, Before you actually write your piece, you should organize the ideas you plan to use. You can do so using any drafting or prewriting technique of choice, but outlines and cluster charts are often among the most helpful.Identify your thesis at the top of your chart or outline. Each major supporting argument should be given its own box in your chart or heading in your outline. Your secondary boxes or sub-headings should list points that further expand those main arguments—i.e., your premises and inferences.

, When writing your essay, you should use concise, concrete language and write in an active voice.


Avoid unnecessary, flowery language meant to sound impressive and focus solely on providing meaningful content.
Leave out anything unnecessary, for that matter. Irrelevant and repetitive material should be left out.
Define your key terms and use them throughout your essay.

, After you write your first draft, go back through and double-check your reasoning and your writing.


Weak arguments should be strengthened or cut from your paper.
Poor grammar, disorganized thought processes, and cluttered paragraphs should be rewritten.

, Making preparations in advance may not be possible when you enter into an expected philosophical dialogue, but usually, philosophical discussions that occur during your studies will be planned in advance.


Review the assigned materials for the discussion and draw your own conclusions based on sound reasoning.
For unplanned dialogues, briefly review your knowledge of related concepts before actively entering into the discussion.

, A philosophical dialogue would not be very interesting if everyone had the exact same ideas. There will be disagreements, but you should always be respectful of others and their ideas, even when trying to prove them wrong.


Show respect by listening thoroughly and trying to view opposing points as worthwhile ideas.
When a conversation brings up a significant issue, the exchanges will likely become more passionate, and conflict can occur. You should still try to end the conversation on a positive, respectful note, however.

, If the ideas being discussed are ones that you do not have strong opinions on or firm knowledge of, spend more time as an active listener than a speaker. Simply speaking is not enough. If the points you contribute are not sound ones, your contribution will not further the dialogue much.


Conversely, if you do have strong arguments to make, speak up. You should not try to override others, but you should definitely make your ideas and support known.

, Insightful questions can be just as important in a discussion as sound arguments.


Ask for clarification on any point another person makes when it seems hazy to you.
If you have a point that no one else has addressed yet, but do not have a firm stance on it, bring that point up as a question.

Distinguish between validity and “truth.” Even when a syllogism is logically valid, it may sometimes lead to a conclusion that is not factually true.,
Look for linguistic giveaways that indicate invalidity.,
Be skeptical of conditional syllogisms.,
Watch out for syllogistic fallacies.",How to Understand Syllogisms2," If a syllogism is valid, it’s premises will be arranged in such a way that only one conclusion is possible. This is the criteria that is important to logical validity. However, if the premises themselves are flawed, the conclusion may be factually inaccurate.For instance, consider the syllogism: “All dogs can fly. Fido is a dog. Fido can fly.” This syllogism is valid in terms of logic, but since the major premise is untrue, the conclusion is clearly inaccurate.
The structure of the argument made by a syllogism – the reasoning of the argument itself – is what you’re assessing when assessing a syllogism for logical validity.

, Observe the affirmative or negative nature of the premises and conclusion when looking to determine validity. Note that if either of the premises is negative, the conclusion must also be negative. If both premises are affirmative, the conclusion must also be affirmative. Further, at least one of a syllogism’s two premises must be affirmative, as no valid conclusion can follow two negative premises. If any of these rules are not followed, you already know the syllogism is invalid.


Further, at least one premise of a valid syllogism must contain a universal form. If both premises are particular, then no valid conclusion can follow. For example,“some cats are black"" and ""some black things are tables"" are both particular propositions, so it cannot follow that ""some cats are tables"".
You’ll often simply know that a syllogism that breaks one of these rules is invalid without thinking about it, as it will likely sound illogical.

, Conditional syllogisms are hypothetical, and their conclusions are not always valid, as they depend on the condition that an unproven premise is true. Conditional syllogisms will include reasoning along the lines of “If_____, then_____.” These syllogisms are not valid when there are additional factors that may contribute to a conclusion.For instance: “If you keep eating Jolly Ranchers every day, you’re putting yourself at risk for diabetes. Sterling doesn’t eat Jolly Ranchers every day. Sterling is not at risk for diabetes.”
This syllogism is not valid for several reasons. Among them, Sterling may eat copious amounts of Jolly Ranchers several days a week – just not every day – which would still place him at risk for diabetes. Or, Sterling may eat cake every day, which would definitely place him at risk for diabetes.

, Syllogisms can allow for incorrect conclusions to be implied by a false argument. Consider the example: “Jesus walked on water. The green basilisk lizard walks on water. The green basilisk lizard is Jesus.” This conclusion is not necessarily true, as the middle term – in this case, “” – is not distributed in the conclusion.As another example: ""All dogs love food"" and ""John loves food"" does not logically indicate that ""John is a dog."" These are called fallacies of the undistributed middle, wherein a term that links the two phrases is never fully distributed.
Beware of the fallacy of the illicit major too. For instance, consider: ""All cats are animals. No dogs are cats. No dogs are animals."" This is invalid because the major term ""animals"" is undistributed in the major premise – not all animals are cats, but the conclusion relies on this insinuation.
The same may be said of an illicit minor. For instance: ""All cats are mammals. All cats are animals. All animals are mammals."" This is invalid because, again, not all animals are cats, and the conclusion relies on this invalid insinuation.

"
"
Recognize types of propositions.,
Identify the mood of a syllogism based on its propositions.,
Determine the “figure” of the syllogism.,
Recognize the valid forms of syllogisms.",How to Understand Syllogisms3," If each of a syllogism’s premises are accepted as valid, the conclusion may also be valid. Logical validity, however, also depends on the form and figure of the syllogism, which both depend on the propositions of the syllogism. In categorical syllogisms, four different types of propositions are used to make up the premises and the conclusion.“A” propositions propose a universal affirmative, such as “all are .” For example “All cats are felines.”
“E” propositions propose exactly the opposite: a universal negative. For instance, “no are .” More demonstratively, “No dogs are felines.”
“I” propositions include a particular affirmative qualification in reference to one of the terms in the premise. For instance, “Some cats are black.”
“O” propositions are the opposite, including a particular negative qualification. For instance, “Some cats are not black.”

, By identifying which of the four types of propositions are used, we can reduce a syllogism to three letters to help determine whether it’s a valid form for the figure of that particular syllogism. Different figures of syllogisms will be described in a following step. For now, simply understand that you can label each part of syllogism – including each premise and the conclusion – according to which type of proposition they make to identify the syllogism’s mood.For instance, consider a categorical syllogism with the mood of AAA: “All X are Y. All Y are Z. So, all X are Z.
A mood refers only to the types of propositions employed in a syllogism of standard order – major premise, minor premise, conclusion – and may be the same for two different forms based on the figure of the syllogisms in question.

, A syllogism’s figure is determined by whether the middle term serves as subject or predicate in the premises. Recall that a subject is what the sentence is about, and the predicate is a word that applies to the subject of the sentence.In a first figure syllogism, the middle term serves as subject in the major premise and predicate in the minor premise: ""All birds are animals. All parrots are birds. All parrots are animals"".
In a second figure syllogism, the middle term serves as predicate in the major premise and predicate in the minor premise. For instance: ""No foxes are birds. All parrots are birds. No parrots are foxes.""
In a third figure syllogism, the middle term serves as subject in the major premise and subject in the minor premise. For instance: ""All birds are animals. All birds are mortals. Some mortals are animals.""
In a fourth figure syllogism, the middle term serves as predicate in the major premise and subject in the minor premise. For instance: ""No birds are cows. All cows are animals. Some animals are not birds.""

, Although there are 256 mathematically possible forms of syllogisms – since there are 4 possible variations (A/E/I/O) for each part of a syllogism, and 4 different figures of syllogisms – only 19 forms are logically valid.For first figure syllogisms, the valid forms are AAA, EAE, AII, and EIO.
For second figure syllogisms, the valid forms are EAE, AEE, EIO, and AOO.
For third figure syllogisms, the valid forms are AAI, IAI, AII, EAO, OAO, and EIO.
For fourth figure syllogisms, the valid forms are AAI, AEE, IAI, EAO, and EIO.

Begin by reading some of Plato's dialogues.,
Don't change your life immediately.,
Follow Socratic principles and ideals.,
If you truly wish to live like Socrates, then you need to devote yourself entirely to philosophy and searching for the truth.,
Make sure where you debate with others is in a public area.,
Never be afraid to voice what you think, or more importantly the truth.,
Never fear death.,
Show humility.,
Remember the Socratic paradoxes.,
Stick to your principles even in face of death, as Socrates did, as described in Phaedo.,
Be sure to ""know thyself"".,
Meet distinguished or influential people.,
Remember that truth is the most important thing ever and you must do all you can to find it.",How to Live Like Socrates," The dialogues pit Socrates against notable Athenians, from sophists, politicians, poets, and wise men. These dialogues will teach you a lot; start by reading some of the early Socratic dialogues, like Ion, Laches, and Euthydemus. In the early dialogue, the format is much the same--with Socrates asking other interlocutors, often 'experts' or sophists to define a concept such as Friendship, Bravery or Self-Control. Socrates then suggests the interlocutors answer yes or no to a series of questions by him, so they might discern whether the given definition is true. Socrates usually by asking questions succeeds in getting the other interlocutors to think more carefully about their preconceived notions of virtue and morality, illustrating how in many cases that the results of their definitions will lead to inconsistencies. However most early dialogues end Aporia, ultimately unresolved.;
, Try to do it gradually. If you change straight away it'll be a shock to your system and you'll find it even harder. If you want to succeed, do things bit by bit, so as to build up a resistance or strength before going the full mile and discarding everything. (You don't necessarily need to give up everything, just lead a simple life, although if you want to truly be like Socrates you should give up everything.)



Wear simpler clothes.

Eat plainer foods.
Do not waste your money on material things.

, The Socratic method of investigation should be the main focus of your beliefs. The Socratic method follows this basic pattern: Socrates asks someone a question, like ""What is holy?"". The interlocutor will then give a big speech on what he thinks it is without ever giving a true answer. Socrates then asks the interlocutor to answer ""yes"" or ""no"" to his questions. By this method, he shows the inconsistencies or irrationalities in the person's thinking, hence Socrates is prompting people, who are often arrogant, to think more carefully and most importantly more consistently about their beliefs. To learn more about the Socratic method, look at How to argue using the Socratic method.


Question everything.
Do not merely take something at face value, or do something because someone says so, whether it is one person or a hundred.
All knowledge is made up of smaller bits of knowledge and so on till at the bottom there are fundamental axioms or self evident rules that require no proof, Socrates sought to breakdown peoples 'beliefs' down to the axioms so he could say I know this not I believe this, however he usually found irrationality or contradictions in peoples thoughts.

, Socrates gave up all work to dedicate himself to questioning others. This might be difficult in these modern times, but not impossible.


Make sure you ask anyone you meet who is willing to answer philosophical questions.
Like Socrates, dissect their answers until you prove that they are on shaky ground.

, This is so that many people will be able to see. Socrates used the Socratic method in public in order to teach many others through the interlocutor's mistakes and to humble the usually rash characters that Socrates debated with. It is best for you to debate with the arrogant, as you'll be doing them a favour by proving them wrong.

, Even if it makes you an outcast and hated, it is important to stick with your thinking and the truth. Fear is not an emotion a philosopher should have and a philosopher should never follow the majority when they do evil, a principle advocated by Socrates. While this made him a laughingstock in Athens, his memory has been revered and his teachings followed by the greatest philosophers ever since.

, Socrates once opined that ""Death may be the greatest of all human blessings"". Socrates believed in an afterlife and often described scenes from heaven which often had double, allegorical meanings. If you are an atheist though, Socrates philosophy of metaphysics catered for this. Just remember that death is a release from everything that is evil and painful, to a place of eternal rest.

, As a philosopher, you are going to get a lot of stick. People just hate to be proved wrong and the fact that Socrates' philosophy is centered around showing how wrong everyone is, you're bound to have clashes. If you practise humility, it will ensure that you have a lot of admirers who will be drawn to you for your stoic calm and inner strength, which is an admirable quality. From here, you can spread your philosophy to a more sympathetic and interested audience who won't storm off in anger at being corrected.

, These are:


No one desires evil.
No one errs or does wrong willingly or knowingly.
Virtue - all virtue - is knowledge. (I.e. Knowledge of good and bad)
Virtue is sufficient for happiness.
The phrase ""Socratic paradox"" can also refer to a self-referential paradox, originating in Socrates' phrase, ""I know that I know nothing"". Socrates believed that the first step towards wisdom is knowing that ultimately you are ignorant; if you want to be a philosopher, remember that you know nothing.

, Socrates showed no fear or distress at the fact he had been wrongly accused, and even refused to flee from prison when he had a chance, as he believed that, that would break his social contract with the people and it would seem as if he feared death.

, This is much harder than it seems and only you will be able to find that; the unexamined life is not worth living. Nobody else can help you there–it is all up to you.

, Using the Socratic method, show how those that originally thought they knew much are lacking. This will give you more of a profile and experience. If you can disprove a university professor at Oxford who lectures in Ethics, then you will know that you are getting somewhere. In fact, Socrates debated primarily with people who were considered wise and just by Athenians of the day. There was an oracle who claimed that Socrates was the wisest man ever. Socrates tried to disapprove the oracle, but ultimately failed. He concluded that he was wise because he knew that he knew nothing, whereas all the people who were considered wise, thought they were wise, but were not.

, The Socratic method is one path to find truth. Only by having knowledge of right and wrong can you ever be wise and therefore good. The Socratic paradox-All virtue is knowledge; that is, knowledge of good and evil.

Be kind.,
Be thoughtful.,
Use your manners as a form of kindness.,
Give out compliments generously.,
Think about people who quietly make a difference to your community and thank them.,
Cheer up the lonely.,
Volunteer.,
Shower a coworker with kindness.,
Share a little wealth around.,
Give your family a break.,
Hold a friends night-in.,
Send a message.,
Forgive somebody.,
Share a smile.,
Expect nothing.",How to Practice Random Acts of Kindness," Kindness as an attitude is infectious. When you're willing to share your kindness, others will be inspired by your example and think about doing something as kind themselves. Fan that flame by being kind to everyone.;
, Random acts of kindness can be shown through thoughtfulness about the needs of others. How many times do you wish someone could have been more thoughtful before they did or said something? Try to be an example of this for others to follow.


Put someone else first. If you get to the grocery store check-out line at the same time as someone else, you can decide to smile and wave them through first.
When you're stuck in traffic and the last thing you want to do is let a car get in front of you, just remember that somebody else had to let you in, and repay the favor to the next person!

, Manners aren't dead, they've just been forgotten in many ways. Yet, manners are the bedrock of courteous and kind relations and their use is an indication of respect for others. Hold doors open for others, hold an umbrella over someone in the rain, and be on time for everyone you've promised to meet.


Say thank you. Whenever anyone does something for you, be grateful and let them know it.

, There's usually an awkward silence when you're stuck in an elevator or waiting in a queue with a stranger. Instead of staring at the floor, find something you like about the other person and compliment him/her on it. Not only will it make him/her feel good, it just might kick off a conversation with a new friend.


Surprise your neighbor by telling him or her how pretty he/she looks today.
Tell your boss how truly clever he/she is – and mean it!
Tell your assistant how truly clever he/she is and mean it. Praise any subordinate who's stayed late or done anything extra on the job honestly. Notice those things.
Praise your child for her/his skills and good thinking. Make it something out of the blue that you've noticed rather than run-of-the-mill schoolwork or chores.

Write a handwritten note to a friend or family member telling them how much you care about them.

, Think of all the people in your life whose faces and names you'll never know but who serve and protect you day after day.


Send some prepackaged treats like donuts or pastries to your local police station, paramedics, or fire department, with a card letting them know how much you appreciate their service to the community. But make sure to also acknowledge the people we take more for granted that make things tick- consider thanking your garbage man or janitor. (Since homemade desserts could be contaminated, unless they know you such homemade treats probably won't be eaten, so it's best to buy something from a reputable bakery.)
Send your child's clean and good condition toys and books to a local preschool. Say thank you to the early childhood carers and teachers who do so much for young children.
Pop over to your neighbor's house with a freshly baked cake. Yes, your neighbors are an important part of your community and they make a difference just by being about. Acknowledge their importance and role in your life.

, Lonely people are everywhere, in all walks of life, of all ages. Helping lonely people to feel wanted is a hugely rewarding random act of kindness.


Write a letter to a stranger. It only takes a few minutes to write, but a letter can make someone else's day, or even their week. Think of all the people who are lonely, isolated or just in need of cheering up: soldiers fighting overseas, kids in juvenile detention centers or elderly people in nursing homes. Do a simple search online and you'll find services that will provide you with list of people who'd love to hear from you.
Pay for someone else's coffee in the queue. If they've got time, offer them a chat.
Visit a retirement home and spend time talking to the residents. You could offer to read to them, sing for them, or even get them involved in writing poems, stories, or a playing on a wiki!

, Offer helping hands. Do you ever see homeless people and feel overwhelmed by your inability to make a difference? Even if you can't save them all, you can do a lot with one small act. Buy a pair of gloves or dig up an old blanket, and give them to someone who's living in the cold streets or to any organization that serves the homeless.


Clean up without being asked. The next time you see someone littering, don't just shake your head and look the other way. Pick up the litter and throw it away, and while you're at it, look around the street for any other trash that needs to be removed. If you take a walk, take a plastic grocery bag so you can collect the trash that would otherwise just make you unhappy, and know that you're doing a random act of kindness for the people who will come through after you!
Make up food parcels for people in need.

, Offer to take them out to lunch or shout them a beer after work. Finish off something for them so they can go home early for their kid's birthday party.


If your coworker has had a horrible day, buy them some flowers or give them a warm hug to make them feel better. Everyone needs just a little extra love sometimes.
Take freshly baked muffins or cookies in to work and share them with your coworkers, staff, and others.

, Why not surprise someone completely by paying for something they were expecting to pay for? Here are some fun suggestions:


Pay for the coffee and cake for the table next to yours at the local cafe.
Pay for the movie tickets of the people in the line behind you.
Pay for the entrance fee for some children and their parents waiting to get into the zoo.
Pay for the parking for the car next to yours. Feed the meter if it's allowed to stop someone from getting a ticket!

, There are lots of kind things you can do for your loved ones. Some of these can include giving them a break from the more mundane chores around the house so that they can do something different for a change.



Make them breakfast in bed.
Wash their car(s).
Do the weeding while a family member's at work.
Promise to do the dishes for a week – without complaining!
Print out a photo of them and write exactly why it's so special to you, why they're so special to you. Tell them how that moment shows how important they are to the whole world

, Order pizza for everyone, and play board games or watch movies together. Treat them to a special cake at the end in honor of the friendships that each of you share together.

, Write down your favorite poem on happiness or jot down some thoughts on hope, then leave it somewhere for a stranger to find. You could also leave a message in a favorite book you've enjoyed, letting someone else know they can have the book to read and hope that they love it as much as you did; leave the book somewhere for them to find.

, You'd be amazed at the ripple effect an ounce of forgiveness can have in your life and in the lives of others. Unburden yourself of the past and think kind thoughts again about that person.

, When meeting a new person, or even chatting with an old one, express joy. Show that you're happy to be with them, and that they make you happy.


If you meet someone grumpy and frowning, give them your smile. Ask them if they're having a hard day, commiserate with them, and wish them better luck from this point on. Don't see it as their bad mood reflecting negatively on you; instead, make it about how you can help them to feel better.

, The greatest act of kindness is the one that is freely given because you care about another person and want them to be happy and you don't expect anything in return. The thing about kindness is that it has its own rewards and will improve your sense of well-being and happiness; what more could you possibly want?

Regard normal life as an adventure.,
Take a leaf from the book of David Grayson.,
Learn to slow down, to be aware and to notice.,
Set aside non-electronic time to begin noticing, listening, seeing.,
Try to look at each event, person, circumstance as something imbued with the unknown.,
Make a conscious choice to shift your perspective.,
Cultivate spontaneity.,
Stop scolding yourself for behaving like a child; the more you connect to that child within, the more you're freed up for adventure, wherever you go.","How to Let Adventure Be the Rule, Not the Exception, in Your Life"," We all long for the grand adventure. One like Abby Sunderland experienced. As a 16-year old, she started off to sail around the world, was shipwrecked in the Indian Ocean and wrote the book Unsinkable about her voyage. We all want bigger, farther away, more exciting. This is natural, because the majority of our lives seem mundane and repetitious.
But try to take a slightly different view. In changing your perspective, you can begin to see adventure, even the ability to create adventure, in that very daily routine of life. While there is nothing wrong with harboring the dream of the grand adventure, in the meantime, life still remains to be lived. How do you make an adventure out of it? The rest of this article explains how to go about creating adventure from your everyday life.;
, He wrote The Adventures of David Grayson, a story of a man who gave up his fast-paced city job and bought a farm in the New England countryside. His ""adventures"" consisted of morning walks through his property and all the things he noticed and smelled; his interactions with all kinds of people; the work he did; the books he read; the interesting discoveries he made simply living life. None of this involved fast cars, jet travel and exotic islands to take him away from it all. Instead, he rediscovered what his senses were telling him but that busy city life had covered up. You can do the same with every single day. It does take thinking about your habits and ways differently for your own life to take on this flavor. But most importantly, don't lose your ability to truly see things for what they are. It has long been said that familiarity breeds contempt, and it is nowhere more obvious than in the daily grind.

, When was the last time you simply stared at a tree, a cloud or a flower without trying to analyze or understand, instead just being glad that they,and you, are? Notice the world around you, especially the small things you've been overlooking since childhood.


What odors can you smell around you right now? Can you push past the coffee machine, the new furniture smell and notice other less invasive odors? Is there a plant near you perhaps, or a lovely perfume lingering on the air? At lunchtime, go for a walk and smell the fragrances of the local streets, a park, the waterfront.
What can you see? Not just the cubicle walls and your neighboring co-workers. Can you see the sky, see across a street, or see a beautiful plant in the office? Can you see beyond what is in front of you to things that really matter to your mind?
What can you sense? The hum of machines, the working of other people, the vibrations of other people's thoughts?
What can you touch? What textures, patterns and surfaces around you awaken a new approach to seeing your daily seat and desk? Find something new about the usual dullness you feel confronted by.

, Give yourself permission to be device-free for a period of time every day. If that seems scary to you, then there's all the more reason to do it. As you get used to this time each day, cherish it and guard it.


Start creating boundaries around when you answer emails and phone calls. Only set aside a certain time of the day to focus on these things, allowing focused attention instead of permitting these time-thieves to distract you throughout the day. You'll be more alert and efficient. You might even get an early minute. But most of all, you'll be in charge of the technology rather than letting it run you. Adventure only starts when you're the master of your destiny.

, The people around you are a mystery. They may seem dull and boring, but perhaps you seem the same to them. You may think you know them, but do you? Often impressions of people are completely wrong until you finally get to know them. And often people are trying their hardest to fit in to what seems like the appropriate daily grind look while inside they're screaming for adventure like you. Take a chance. Find out by reaching out.

, What makes for adventure in daily routine? Primarily it's about choosing, through the exertion of your willpower, to see things differently. Wake up and tell yourself: ""Who knows what adventures this day will hold?"" Even if you have to say this through clenched teeth at the beginning, make yourself say it. If you tell yourself that life can be adventurous often enough, you will begin to believe it and start to look for it everywhere.


Try to see life with the mind of an artist or an author. What stories can be told, what pictures can be painted, what poetry written about the sub-texts and undercurrents around you all the time? Delve in to find the mystery and bring it to light.

, Adventure comes through spur of the moment, impromptu decisions, lack of planning and impulse. This is all about living in the now and being present. Be intentional about changing it up. Get off the couch and go for a walk. Build a fire outdoors, stay up late, and watch the stars slide across the sky.

, Don't be afraid to look ridiculous. Climb a tree or join a child in drawing on the sidewalk. Run through a lawn sprinkler. Life's too short to worry about what people think. They're probably thinking they'd like to join you, anyway.


Stop berating others for ""behaving like a child."" When we accuse someone of being this way, we belittle the good things about childhood and assume that chasing away awe and imagination is desirable. It's not; don't destroy other people's sense of adventure either just because it seems like the ""done thing.""

Start small.,
Observe your emotional attachments.,
Trace your emotional attachments.,
Practice letting go.,
Work on acceptance.,
Let go.,
Recognise the peace within.",How to Live in a State of Non Attachment," The best way to practice this concept is by starting small, even at a minute level. Learn to let go of something that you don't hold a strong bond to first; then snowball from there. If you keep old clothes in your closets that you've never worn due to wrong sizes, or shoes with large holes in them that you'll never wear again, you'll be familiar with clinging to things that don't enhance your life. Try taking some of those items and giving them to a charity or thrift store. Immediately, you'll feel how liberating non-attachment can be. This first step will get you into the practice of letting go; it's walking before running.;
, The basis of attachment ultimately boils down to an emotional connection to things, places, ideas, and more. A great way to better understand these bonds is to find something you would hate to give away, and to imagine yourself letting go of it.


At this stage it's important that you don't let go of it, but just observe what happens inside yourself, and what messages crop up. If you're attached to a favourite food that might cause health problems in the long run, just imagine yourself never eating that food again. What thoughts instantly arise? Are you feeling defensive? Don't guilt yourself or use the word should, just calmly watch your mind.

, Going along with the previous food example, can you trace any of these thoughts back as to why you're feeling defensive? Do you love the food because you hold nostalgic memories of the past in which the item played a role? This can be a tough stage, understanding why you've formed these bonds, but if you're gentle and patient with yourself, it can actually be fun. Sometimes you can trace your attachments to certain things that are based out of fearful thoughts, which no longer benefit you. In another example, if you're attached to a certain concept like, ""If I'm not aggressive, then others will take advantage of me,"" you can find those traces link back to prior events in which you were hurt. This is where it's important that you are kind to yourself, because you only want to keep yourself safe, but maybe you can begin to let go.

, If in your head you're still looking at the previous example of being taken advantage of, then ask yourself what it would feel like if you let it go. Maybe you'll find that you imagine terrible things at first, such as people pushing you around if you're kind, or similar thoughts. Do not judge these thoughts, just understand them. When you are calm enough to allow them to be, start to pull examples of where these terrible events didn't take place in your past, meaning those occasions where you practiced being open and kind to others and they reciprocated that back to you.


In this step, you don't have to let go of the connections, but allow your mind to bring you an unbiased list of examples. Even if you've never had a positive experience in the area you'd like to change, now is a great time to imagine wonderful things happening, to set the intentions into motion. The key here is to begin filling your mind with thoughts of positive changes that will come.

, This is an important stage for you. Often when you feel that you don't have enough strength to let go of something, you may tend to beat yourself up for it; don't. Accept where you are and know that you'll only grow stronger. If you're not ready to call it quits with a toxic relationship, then practice the above steps until you can reach that positive moment of detaching. If you can't give away an old book you no longer need then accept that about yourself, when the time is right you'll be ready for anything you need to do. When you can accept that you can't follow through with something actively, then you allow yourself the time to prepare for it by visualising the moment, until it comes true. Imagine it through this analogy, if you want to be in Florida but currently live in California, then visualisation is exemplary of the gas you put in your car that will take you there. You won't make it to Florida on one tank, but if you continually fill up your car along the way, you'll eventually reach your destination and say, ""I'm here, I've made it!'

, When you let go of things, you free yourself in ways that will make you a better version of yourself. When you let go of that old book you no longer need, and give it to someone who will use it, you are not only giving but allowing new good things to come into your life. You discover that these old thoughts, beliefs, ideas, emotions, items, and more were only taking up space in your life, and keeping you from living at your best. If you can let go of the need to be right and can live from a standpoint of love, you've freed ourselves from the tyranny that you've created in your own life. Letting go is a great step in change and will help you immensely. Nothing defines you or dictates who you are, and when you can let go of the superficial constructs you place in attempt to define your life, you will begin to actually live.

, Letting go of anything in your life will show you that you are merely a spiritual being having a human experience. The jobs you have, the awards you get, the people you associate with, the ""toys"" you collect, and all else, never touched the true greatness you have within.

Serve others.",How to Find Yourself," Write down all of your major goals that you feel you have achieved and want to achieve. In turn, write down the events in your life that have already happened and that have shaped or affected you. When life brings problems or misfortunes it shapes our belief system and makes us think differently, but it also makes us us. These things you list are organically you, not a simple reflection of society.


This isn't an exercise in wallowing. It's about clarification and identification of issues. These issues might be keeping you from reaching your present potential and letting your true self blossom.
Spend a little time clarifying the past in your timeline. A timeline is an incredibly objective method for marking down past occurrences in your life that you consider to be major. You can look at them as formation blocks and as changing experiences along your timeline without imbuing them with too much emotion (as would occur within a diary account). As if writing a résumé, keep it simple, real, and condensed to the major effects or lessons learned from each past incident.
When analyzing negative past experiences, focus on what you learned from them. Everyone has these blips in their timeline, but exaggerating or ignoring them won't help you. Instead, recognize that these experiences shaped you.;
, For most people (it's more common than you may think) life is pretty easy to go through while on autopilot; we practically get handed a road map for how reality ""works."" Go to school, get a job, get married, think this, that, and the other, and boom — hope you had a good time. And that's all well and good — it gets the job done certainly — but it doesn't allow room for you. So sit down with yourself. At the end of the timeline, come up with a few beliefs of yours that aren't based on logic, but are based on what you've been told. We all have them. Now, what do you actually think?


Society has a very covert way of handing us the ""misfits"", condemning the ""losers"", idolizing the ""beautiful"", alienating the ""strange."" But here's a heads up: These describing words have no basis in reality. How do you feel about the world around you? Think about what you believe to be good and bad — not what anyone else has told you.
Feel free to think more concretely. Do you actually agree with your parents' political or religious affiliations? Is having a career really the most important thing to you? Do thick, black glasses really make you feel ""cooler?"" If the answer is no, great! There's absolutely zero problems with not molding yourself to pre-existing norms. Now all you have to do is unlearn and then relearn. Only this time, relearn based on your gut.

, Confidence and reliance are at the heart of finding yourself. If you don't have a solid sense of self-worth, you'll listen to what others have to say all the time and to be swayed by their insistence on what is appropriate. Learn to believe in yourself and trust your own feelings. Then, you'll come up with a structure to base your new sense of self on. Remember, be patient with yourself and confident in your abilities. Everything will come with time.


If you have been victimized in the past, confront these issues. They're not going to go away on their own. They might be coloring your approach to daily life, causing you to live up to other people's expectations instead of your own.
Start trusting your own judgment and decision-making processes, mistakes and all. We all make mistakes, but through mistakes we find ourselves growing, learning, and reaching our real selves.
Start taking responsibility for budgeting, household matters, and planning about the future. People who lack a sense of self tend to disregard the ""details"" of life with a carefree attitude, believing that things will all sort themselves out. But things don't always sort themselves out. Taking responsibility pulls you back from the precipice and lets you be self-reliant and self-determined, no longer carried along by the waves of fate.

, Develop your own moral conduct and practice sticking to it. Start by overcoming bad habits.


Stop smoking, over-eating, and abusive drinking. These are examples of lapses or habits that will prevent you from functioning at your peak. They also let you ""off the hook"" by sidestepping the analysis of why you use these crutches instead of finding better ways to brighten your life.
This step may take some major rehabilitation for some individuals but putting it into the too-hard basket won't make it go away. Remember, you can't drive your life forward if you are always gazing through your rear-view mirror!

, You may find that having all your other affairs in order will help expedite the process to grabbing a firm hold on your identity. So clean your room. Do your homework. Resolve that fight with that friend. Getting everything else out of the way will clear up the path to ""me"" time.


We all have excuses for why we're not growing in the direction we want to be growing — it could be money, school, a job, a relationship, you name it, someone's used it. If you're a busy bee, take strides to clear your schedule so you can sit down and tackle this thing head on. If it's always priority #2, it'll never get done.

, Give yourself some time and space to get away from the expectations, the conversations, the noise, the media, and the pressure. Take some time each day to go for a long walk and think. Plant yourself on a park bench and look. Take a long, thoughtful road trip. Whatever you do, move away from anything that distracts you from contemplating your life and where you want it to go. In solitude, you should feel independent and self-sufficient, not lonely, needy or afraid.


Every person needs time alone, whether they're introverted or extroverted, single or in a relationship, young or old. Solitude is time for rejuvenation and self-talk, for utter peace and for realizing that purposeful ""loneliness"" is not a bad place to be but rather, a liberating part of your overall existence.

If you are a creative person, you may find that alone-time will help stoke your creativity. While it's nice to collaborate with other people sometimes, it's hard to be truly creative when you're always surrounded by other people. Step back and tap into your creativity.

, When you believe in something or see beauty in something, you should do it no matter what anyone else thinks. If you have found something that is worthy of your best efforts, sacrifice, and tears, then you have found the most important pursuit of your life. Often, that pursuit can lead you to something ultimately fulfilling.


The key here is to realize that it doesn't matter what it is. It could be preventing child hunger or it could be painting. There is no scale when it comes to passion. You either feel it or you don't; none is better than any other. When you find something that zaps you out of bed in the morning, cling onto it. You'll only bloom from there.

, Though ultimately soul-searching can only be done by you and it's only you that determines what you need, having a mentor will be an incredible resource when you hit those unavoidable bumps in the road. Seek out someone you trust who has a definite sense of self. How did they do it?


Let them know the process you're starting to undertake. Stress that you know it's your journey, but would love to use their strength as a guide. Take a look at them as objectively as you can. What seems to ground them, making them who they are? How did they find that? How do they stay true to themselves?
A support system is key to any self-improvement tactic. Not a lot of people will understand what you're going through and will brush off your broaching the topic as a flash-in-the-pan moodiness. Use this mentor as a sounding board, too, for what you come up against. The outlet will surely come in handy.

, If you're meandering all over the place looking for the right ""fit"", chances are that you're not happy inside. You could be using the job-changing as an excuse for not fully realizing your true potential. Find yourself by really taking an interest in what you love to do. If money weren't an issue, what would you spend your days doing? What way can you monetize this activity/skill?


Spend some time free-associating. Think about what you like and don't like; think beyond those things to other ideas that simply pop into your mind while you're associating. Keep a record of these things. Then, come back to the career question and look at the free associations. What type of career seems to gel most with the things that excited, moved, and really energized you from the free-association exercise? As Alain de Botton says, this exercise is about looking for ""beeps of joy"" amid the cacophony of must-do's, shoulds, and expectations.Bear in mind, however, that work may not be where your ""calling"" is. If that's the case, you'll need to work out a work-life balance that lets you pursue your ""true self"" more outside of the workplace, even if this means more hours and less income. It is all possible, especially if it's in the pursuit of finding and sustaining your true sense of self.

, Accept that some people will think poorly of you no matter what you do. It's important to forget about what everyone else thinks because you cannot please everyone. And while you might not want to disappoint the people close to you, they should want you to be happy. As long as you continue to exist just to fulfill other people's ideas of who you should be, you'll never know who you really are. This thought is aptly summed up by Raymond Hull: ""He who trims himself to suit everyone will soon whittle himself away.""


Realize that some people will become jealous, afraid, or overwhelmed when a person changes their usual habits and grows more mature and self-loving (others will love it). It's a threat to the relationship you've always had, and it forces them to take a cold, hard look at themselves, which they may not want to do. Give these people space and compassion; they may come around in time. If they don't, leave them be. You don't need them to be you.

, Although it sounds abstract, it's not difficult. Make a conscious effort to minimize judging — others, objects, and yourself. This is for two reasons: 1) Positivity is nourishing and can usher in a sense of happiness which being ""lost"" masks, and 2) Opening your mind to new experiences and new people (that you previously wrote off) will show you a whole new world that may be better than the one you knew before — one where you can find your corner of the sky, your castle on a cloud, your niche in this crazy world.


Try to do something every day that you would've brushed off as ""weird,"" ""illogical,"" or just plain ""uncomfortable"". Getting out of your zone will not only teach you something, but it will force you to get to know you — what you're capable of, what you like, what you definitely don't like, and what you were previously missing.

, Ask yourself difficult and far-reaching questions, and record your answers. Beyond your time spent in solitude, it's easy for these purposeful thoughts to slip to the back of your mind and be forgotten. If you have them written down, then every time you reflect, you can review your notes and take it a step further, instead of answering the same questions all over again. Keep them in a notebook that's easy to access and update; it will be a source of sustenance for you, by which you can continue to measure your growth through life. Here are some to get you started:


""If I had all the resources in the world — if I didn't need to make money — what would I be doing with my life and why?"" Perhaps you'd be painting, or writing, or farming, or exploring the Amazon rain forest. Don't hold back.
""What do I want to look back on in my life and say that I never regretted?"" Would you regret never having traveled abroad? Would you regret never having asked that person out, even if it meant risking rejection? Would you regret not spending enough time with your family when you could? Would you regret keeping your unique view of society to yourself by not sharing with friends? Did I conform/stick out beyond the level I'd have like to? This question can be really difficult.
""If I had to choose three words to describe the kind of person I'd love to be, what would those words be?"" Adventurous? Accepting towards few? Open? Honest? Hilarious? Optimistic? Unreliable? Don't be afraid to choose words that are considered negative because that proves you're a real person, and not a lopsided combination of parts other people want to be known for.

Sometimes the traits that you don't like become useful in emergency situations — like being bossy. Sometimes they are valuable to the job you're meant to perform — like being nitpicky.
If you do have a truly negative trait, acknowledging it openly can give you the motivation to work on redirecting that energy to something positive. Try channelling that bad habit and into a hobby. Don't wash your clothes much? Try camping — maybe you'll like it. Even something like pole dancing could be your golden ticket! Know you're lazy with certain tasks? Maybe you can lead yourself to find another task that hardly ever bores you.


""Who am I?"" This question is not static. It should be one you continue to ask yourself throughout your life. A healthy person continues to reinvent themselves throughout their life. By asking this question regularly, it updates your understanding of who you are and how you change. Instead of answering who you think you ought to be, keep it focused on who you actually are, because in all likelihood that's a very good answer, warts and all.

, Pick up those watercolors. Write a short story. Plan a trip to Mombasa. Have dinner with a family member. Start cracking jokes. Open up. Tell the truth. Whatever it is that you've decided you want to be or do, start being and doing it now.


You may shake your head and come up with excuses such as ""no time,"" ""no money,"" ""family responsibilities,"" etc. Instead of using these as excuses, start planning around the hurdles in your life. You can free up time, find money, and get a break from duties if you make time how to plan and find the courage to ask for these things.
Sometimes, the real you is too afraid to face the practicalities because it'd mean facing up to what you've limited yourself by. Start planning what you really want to do and investigating what needs to be done to get you to that point instead of flinging excuses at them, stopping the goals and dreams dead in their tracks.

, Finding yourself is a journey, not a destination. A lot of it is trial and error. That's the price you pay in return for the satisfaction you receive: More often than not, you hit a bump in the road, and sometimes you fall flat on your face. Be prepared to understand and accept that this is a part of the process, and commit to getting right back up and starting over.


It's not going to be easy — it never has been for anybody — but if you learn to see that as a chance to prove how much you want to find yourself, then you'll find fulfillment and security in your pursuit. When you know yourself, most people will respect you more and treat you kindly. Best of all, your light will shine on both you and others, making them (and you) feel even more certain about your sense of self.

, Mahatma Gandhi once said that ""the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others."" Being introspective without reaching out to others can cause you to navel-gaze and shut yourself off from others. Service to other people and to the community is the ultimate way to find purpose and a sense of your place in the world.


When you see how hard life can be for those in greater need than you, it's often a wake-up call that puts your own worries, concerns, and issues into perspective. It helps you to see what you do have, and the opportunities you've been able to seize through life. That can fuel a great sense of self because suddenly everything can fall into place for you and you realize what matters most. Try it. You'll like it.

Ponder the concept of the Universe.,
Ponder the planet Earth in relation to the Universe.,
Ponder the necessity of the existence of your biological parents to your personal existence.,
Ponder the requirements for your personal survival and for that of your species.,
Ponder the relationship between your body and mind and the continual interaction between them.,
Ponder the significance of your natural mental and physical reflexes.,
Ponder your freedom to make personal decisions within the realm of possibility.,
Ponder your astute linguistic abilities as a sentient member of the human race.,
Ponder your innate desire for superiority.,
Ponder your natural aversion to ignorance and your natural curiosity about reality.",How to Know Thyself," There are some who postulate that the Universe is as old as time itself. Assuming that this assertion is accurate, this would suggest that time and space are inextricably linked and it allows for the premise of somewhat personifying the Universe as ""one whole being"" which is growing and changing from one moment to another. It also does not allow for the possibility for anything which happens to be undone.;
,


For example, contemplate that the planet Earth is a spherical and rotating part of the Universe, which is surrounded by a combination of air and water, and houses liquefied fire around its core.
The planet Earth rotates once each day (i.e. once every twenty-four hours), and most inhabitants spend approximately twelve hours in substantial darkness when half of the planet is hidden from the Sun, and twelve hours in substantial light when half of the planet is exposed to the Sun. Also, the planet Earth is orbited by the Moon, and it (along with the Moon and other uninhabited planets) orbits the Sun (i.e. one of many stars) in one of many galaxies. The Moon encircles the Earth once every twenty-eight days whereas the Earth and the Moon encircle the Sun once every three hundred and sixty-five days and a quarter of a day. There are approximately thirty days in a month and there are twelve months in a year. The four seasons of the year are winter, spring, summer, and autumn. The winter months are the coldest months whereas the summer months are the hottest.
The planet Earth is a beautiful habitat for plants, animals, and people. The mobile capabilities of biological entities range from the ability to swim in water, to moving around on land, and flying in the air. The Sun is a spherical gaseous whole which emits immense quantities of light, whereas the Moon is a rocky spherical object, with a reflective surface, which houses and empties itself of the light from the Sun.

, Life is uniformly characterized by the existence of opposites. Each person is posterior to the existence of one mature male person and one mature female person. Also, each person is either of the male sex or of the female sex. Further, each person has the capacity to grow into a mature person with a partial ability to produce more people provided that biological defects have not interfered with such ability.


The symbol of occupant depicts masculinity and the symbol of house depicts femininity. An occupied house is typically associated with a pleasant experience whereas an empty house is typically associated with an unpleasant experience.
A child is an interwoven wholeness originating from the father’s blissful union with the mother. In the reproductive process, the mature female person houses the unborn human being for approximately nine months and endures the suffering as the body of the young person separates from her body during childbirth.
There is a precedence of existence, the Universe, the Milky Way galaxy, the Solar System, the Planet Earth, life, humanity, and dual parentage providing the foundation for each person to launch from.
A person is shaped by heredity and environment. Parents have a duty to train and equip offspring to survive and thrive in a self-supported manner.
Existence has negative aspects, neutral aspects and positive aspects and people are oriented to perform from sunrise to sunset to justifiably partake of life's perfections.

, Each person requires air, water, food, sleep, and physical contact for his or her personal survival (i.e. to temporarily extend the duration of his or her life).


The requirement for physical contact with respect to survival is most acute in infancy and somewhat diminishes as an individual matures and some amount of physical contact between a member from each gender is essential for the collective survival of humanity.
However, at some point, due to either natural or man-made occurrences, it is a certainty that it will become impossible for each person’s power to live to continue to exist. Coverings, shelter, transportation and an occupation as a source of financial income are also prominent features of a modern lifestyle.

, Each person is comprised of his or her body, mind, will, emotions and conscience.


The body refers to a person’s strong physical presence, which is situated at a location in the universe and the mental presence in the universe is the brain which is a powerful computing machine capable of precise logic and beautiful creativity.
The brain is the part of the body which coordinates the activities of the body. A person’s awareness occupies the universe and perceptions of the universe occupy a person’s holistic awareness. The primary emotions are love, fear, happiness, sadness and anger or the impulse to protect one’s ego which is one's sense of self-importance. The emotion of anger communicates that something is unacceptable to the person experiencing the emotion. Additionally, the conscience emotionally rewards personally beneficial behavior and emotionally punishes personally destructive behavior.
Human awareness is submerged in mental dreams when asleep, and is not cognizant of the rest of the physical body until awake, in a similar way to the way in which an unborn human being occupies his or her mother, and is not cognizant of the rest of the universe until the time of delivery.
A mother’s body is either fully occupied, partially occupied, or empty, and a person’s awareness is either awake, asleep, or dead.

, Each person has an innate propensity to move away from any source of an unpleasant sensation be it mental or physical, and to move closer to any source of a pleasant sensation be it mental or physical.


A person returning some type of harm to another who has caused him or her to experience some type of harm is an example of a mental self-protecting reflex, and a person’s hand recoiling from a very hot surface is an example of a physical self-protecting reflex.
Concomitantly, recognize the universality of a person’s natural inclination to an expression of laughter when feeling high and to that of tears when feeling low. People also have a natural configuration to respond to certain patterns of music with various patterns of movement and to laugh when tickled. There is a natural inclination to pursue more and more pleasant sensations and to avoid all unpleasant sensations. The presence of these opposite sensations is interpreted by many to be an innate signal to each individual to survive and to grow rather than to stagnate and rot to naught.

,


The will of a human being is functional when a person is awake and voluntarily initiates those activities of the brain and the body which are not reflexive. The choices which a person makes today are the architect of the future which he or she may live long enough to inhabit tomorrow. People set various types of goals to satisfy needs and wants and work in an effort to achieve them.
Some endeavors are a means to an end and some constitute an end in and of itself and some are a hybrid. The general ends which all normal human beings tend to seek a means to are the will to live, the will to pleasure, the will to superiority, the will to connection and the will to identity.
Life presents people with problems or difficulties to prevent, solve and manage and there are some facts of life that each person must simply learn to live with that come with the territory of the life experience. Challenges can be intimidating but they afford richer opportunities to develop and showcase strength and knowledge and to love and be loved and provide a greater appreciation for comfort. Life is the way it is and it is up to each person to love himself or herself enough to live his or her best life.
Each person has the capacity to assess what is possible at a given moment, and to personally decide upon a course of action or inaction from among his or her options, as well as the capacity to act without such assessment having taken place.
The ability to autonomously assess one’s options allows an individual to act without reference to the instructions of another person and without reference to a pattern of behaviour which may have been exhibited by another. Further, as it is possible for the human will to dominate most innate propensities, this means that it is possible for a person to opt to rebel against the natural mental signal to exclusively pursue pleasant sensations, and it is possible for a person to opt to rebel against nature's urging for him or her to pursue a viable means to survive and flourish as an individual.

, Human beings belong to the most advanced category of organisms in terms of the ability to communicate (i.e. to produce symbols or virtual duplicates of things or events which may be real or imaginary).


As a sentient being, each person has an awareness of his or her existence and has an awareness of the existence of his or her awareness. Whilst it is relatively easy for a human being to view his or her body as a part of the Universe, the mind appears more as a ""mirror"" of the Universe, and this ""mirror"" might be viewed as allowing for any manner of distortions to the extent that people may adjust this “mirror” to remember the past, or to observe the present, or to imagine events with respect to the past, present or future.
This would lead to the conclusion that a word is a “mirror” of awareness, and that awareness is a “mirror” of either the common physical Universe or an individual’s own personal mental “universe.”
A person's awareness vacillates between the mental realm of the brain and the physical realm of the body and the voice of a person can recreate the content of his or her awareness using words or he or she can be silent. Words are thought packages which can be used to convey ideas, feelings, and requests from one mind to another.
This extraordinary capacity to communicate possessed by human beings, in terms of the production, consumption, and exchange of information, allows for two separate individuals to decide to consolidate efforts to produce one cohesive result, and this accounts for how civilizations may appear more and more advanced as time progresses.

, Each human being has the natural capacity and proclivity to evaluate himself or herself and other human beings as individuals with respect to appearance and performance. Each human being also has a name as a point of reference for him or her as well as a reputation to uphold.


The five standard senses used for such an evaluation of things in the physical realm are seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, and tasting and each is sensitive to pleasant and unpleasant sensations. The eyes feature the unity of love and the ears feature the separation of fear. The nose protrudes as a mountain on display and the mouth is a receptive basin. The skin captures the oneness of existence. Sights and sounds have a duplicating feature which allows them to be recorded.
Human beings also have a natural desire to be sophisticated and impressive mentally and physically and there is also an innate desire to appear and perform more impressively than others of the same gender. Mental and physical characteristics are inherited from one's parents. There are some popular theories which suggest that physical characteristics range from aesthetically unpleasant or aesthetically challenged at the lower end right the way up to those which are aesthetically pleasing. Health and fitness are universally regarded as attractive qualities.
The human skeleton is mainly comprised of three houses or cavities. The skull may be viewed as a house of knowledge, the ribcage as a house of strength, and the pelvis as a house of beauty. It has been observed that males tend to have greater capacity with regard to physical strength whereas females tend to have greater capacity with regard to physical beauty. It has also been suggested that aesthetically pleasing features may be an indicator of an individual’s health and high potential for survival and reproduction. Additionally, it is apparent amongst human beings that the average height of males exceeds the average height of females.
A pear shape is considered to be classically feminine with an abundance of curvaceous pelvic beauty reflecting the separation of the ovaries whereas an apple shape is considered to be classically masculine with an abundance of muscular thoracic strength and pelvic narrowness reflecting the unity of the testes and the skull is considered to be transcendent with the wholesome oneness of a mango and the brain.
People are naturally predisposed to pride with respect to the possession of strength, attractiveness, knowledge, highness and fullness and shame with respect to the possession of weakness, repulsiveness, ignorance, lowness and emptiness. Human beings also each have an innate desire to be noticed and looked up to by at least one other individual in the Universe other than himself or herself, and there is a general and innate fear of complete rejection and absolute loneliness.
Each person has his or her own unique repertoire of gifts, talents, skills, qualities, abilities and interests on which to build high self-esteem for a higher potential of success in activities and relationships. Some people experience a high as thrill seekers and have a sense of adventure.
With regard to competing for a romantic partner, it is quite obvious that if another person is more attractive than a particular person, then there is a greater chance of this particular person being ignored by some potential romantic partner due to the presence of the more attractive person. People admire each other and a person may feel uncomfortable or envious if another’s excellence in an area is making him or her look inadequate in the competition for wealth, respect and love.
The two main manifestations of love are as a hunger for the presence of a person or thing and as a willingness to exert oneself to help someone. Time, money, products, services, compliments, humor, advice, appreciation, affection and encouragement are all commodities of love. Sometimes loving a person is accompanied by a feeling of jealous possessiveness.
Competitive tendencies amongst people may at times be hazardous to the security of life, possessions and values and authoritative protection and regulation are often necessary to facilitate peaceful and constructive interaction. Traditional ethical principles prescribe that others should not be extended treatment which one would find it objectionable to be the recipient of and that for a person to qualify to enjoy a benefit that person should suffer the cost of it.
Each person is naturally directed to pursue life, pleasure, superiority, connection and self-knowledge and to avoid death, pain, inferiority, isolation and self-ignorance along with possessing the freedom to choose his or her words and actions.
Another uniquely human characteristic is the human capacity for empathy, which allows each person to imagine himself or herself to be another, and to assess such a hypothetical experience to the extent that one may anticipate what is likely to help or hurt another person in the real world, by way of reference to one's self as a person sharing a common nature with the other.

, Existence is both real and imaginary or tangible and intangible.


A person’s physical body is hungry for physical materials, his or her holistic awareness is hungry for non-physical truth, and both of these types of resources are necessary for a person to feel fulfilled.
Holistic awareness is a mirror or a virtual house that reality dwells in as knowledge the more a person observes, experiences, and learns. Human beings are rational organisms and the goal of understanding one's self and one’s surroundings is a hallmark of how people naturally operate. The psychological heritage of humanity establishes that freedom is guided by a fear of death, pain, inferiority, isolation and ignorance of the source, meaning and destiny of identity, and a love of life, pleasure, superiority, connection and knowledge of the source, meaning and destiny of identity, such that ignorance, weakness, ugliness, lowness and emptiness are concealed with shame, and knowledge, strength, beauty, highness and fullness are showcased with pride, amidst emotional punishment for the destructive use of freedom and emotional reward for the constructive use of freedom.
There is a distinct difference between belief and knowledge and between theory and fact. Beliefs and theories are possibly true depending on how rational they are whereas knowledge and facts are definitely true based on the proof of observation and experience. Some issues are a matter of opinion, personal judgement and personal preference but even in these matters sound reasoning can improve the quality of mental functioning.
Life may be a gift of love from a divine being which is the product of planning or it may be the unintended product of the natural unfolding of the cosmos, but either way, life is structured with creativity, rationality and dignity and affords much of value and utility for which to be thankful.
People are able to investigate what is necessary for things or events to exist or happen as well as the potential or actual usefulness of things or events. People attempt to make sense of the mystery of existence and tend to be discontented to the extent that this is not possible.
There are the fixed laws authored by nature and the flexible laws authored by people which bring order and dignity to existence.
Additionally, human beings tend to experience mental discomfort with regard to comparing the vastness of the Universe with the relatively minute size of a human body, and there is also usually some level of fear with regard to not knowing for sure what happened in the distant past, what is happening in distant space, and what may happen in the immediate and extended future.

They’ll convince themselves that the problem is smaller than it really is or that it doesn’t exist in the first place. You need to recognize when you start thinking this way because it’s true what they say: the first step in overcoming a problem is admitting that you have one.


This isn’t a fun part of the equation. Accepting that this challenge is real and that you’re going to have to deal with it can be really scary. If you’re scared of what this challenge can mean for you, just remember: so far in life, you’ve met every challenge that’s come before you and made it out okay. There’s no reason to think that this is any different.;
, It’s important, with any challenge that you end up facing, to start doing something about the problem as soon as you possibly can. Each moment of inaction becomes an action in itself. By doing nothing, you’re still doing something. And that something probably isn’t helping the situation. Problems usually multiply when left to themselves, like rabbits. The sooner you start facing the challenge, the easier it will be to overcome.

, So, you’re ready to start tackling this challenge? Great! The best place to start is by evaluating the facts. What do you really know about what’s going on? Are you sure you understand the situation? Don’t just deal with what you think the problem is; the real issue might be something you didn’t even realize was a problem. Take some time to make sure that you understand the situation as fully as possible.


This usually means that you’re going to have to talk to people, although who will depend on your situation. Are you having problems with school? Talk to your teacher. Problems at work? Talk to your boss or a coworker. Problems in your relationship? Talk to your partner. Problems with your health? Talk to your doctor. You get the idea.
It can help to make a list. A challenge is rarely one single task or problem, but is instead made up of lots of different parts. Make a list talking about what the smaller, sub-challenges are and what you’ll need to do in order to combat them.

, Now that you know what you’re dealing with, you’ll want to think about what tools and resources you have available to help you in facing this challenge. What resources are most important will depend on your problem, but there are lots of things you can consider. Think about your strengths, the people that can help you, and any physical resources you might have (like money). You should also think about areas in which you are weak. This will let you plan ahead so that you can compensate or at least be prepared in areas where something might go wrong. Be realistic about both the good and bad things that you have to offer this situation: fantastic optimism is not your friend here.


For example, let’s say that you’re facing a challenge in your marriage. What do you have that can help you face this? Well, you’re good at communicating how you feel. That’s important for reaching understanding in interpersonal issues. You also have your parents available to you, as they’ve managed to stay together through some pretty serious fights. They might have some advice. You also know that you’re not good at changing your habits, so you’ll know that you’ll need to be prepared to pay extra attention to that.

, Now that you know about what the facts of the situation and what you have available to you, you can start finding information that can help you. Find out more about the challenge you’re facing. Talk to people that have faced the same challenge. The more you know about the facts, similar situations, and the experiences of others, the easier time you’ll have making smart decisions about facing your own challenge. It’ll also help keep you from feeling alone.


You can find a lot of information by going online and using Google to find websites that deal with your specific problem.
For example, let’s say that you’re facing a challenge at work; you are up for review and you’re worried that your performance has been poor. Now, go to Google and search for performance reviews. You’ll learn about the process and hear how things have gone for other people. You can also learn about what you can do to improve your chances for keeping your job if your review goes badly.

, When we’re worried, we tend to see only a few paths out of a challenge. You might see your situation as “either I do this or I do that”. However, this is rarely an accurate view of the situation and thinking of it in this way can often be harmful to your decision-making process. Challenge your ideas of what is really necessary to the situation or what your options really are. Find the paths between the ones that are so clearly marked in your mind. You may find that a middle road or a total detour is better for you in the long run, even if it doesn’t match what you thought the situation would be.


If you’re having a hard time looking at a situation and finding an alternative route, one of the easiest ways to get ideas is to talk to someone you trust. Get advice. If you’re on your own though, look at you main goal point (the thing you’re trying to reach). It’s got a problem in the way, keeping you from getting there, right? Now, look at the actual function of the goal. Is there another way to get the same thing to happen? This can open another path for you to take.

, If the challenge you’re facing in any way involves other people, then a large part of your challenge can be dealt with by talking to other people. Most of our problems come up in the first place because we fail to communicate in the way that we should.


For example, let’s say that you’re having problems in your relationship. The best way to solve relationship problems is to talk to your significant other. Be honest about how you feel and what you want and encourage them to do the same. If they won’t talk with you, well that kind of answers the question, doesn’t it?
Another example would be if you’re having problems at school. Talk to your teacher or the school’s counselor. No matter what the problem is, one of them should have some ideas that can help you. You might think that they might be mad at you, judge you, or make things worse, but that is very likely not true. You’re very unlikely to tell them something that would surprise them and they’ll have a lot more experience in handling the problem and will probably have some good ideas for you.

, When you’re facing a challenge, one thing you can do to really transform your experience of the situation is to find a mentor. This can be a person, a website, a book: anything that can give you advice on your specific situation and inspire you to take it like a champ. Having a mentor can make your experience more positive and help you change how you experience what’s happening to you.


For example, if you’re having problems with a friend, talk to your older sister. She’ll probably have had similar troubles at some point in her life, so she’ll be able to give you advice. She’ll also be able to support and comfort you.
Online communities can also fill this role, so don’t worry if you’re not that great at talking to people or asking for help face-to-face.

, The final key for dealing with challenges in your life is to just keep trying. You have to be persistent. Without being persistent, you’ll frequently find yourself unsuccessful in the things you try. We won’t recommend trying the same approach over and over again but you shouldn’t give up on finding a solution. Every challenge can be met and every situation made better, so long as you keep your mind open.


Now sometimes the solution to a challenge is accepting the inevitable. Let’s say that your challenge is that you’ve been diagnosed with a chronic illness. Now, you shouldn’t keep fighting to get rid of the illness. The reality is probably that you’re stuck with it. However, the solution in this situation would be that you should find a sense of community and identity with others who share your situation and learn to better embrace and appreciate the good things that you do have in your life.

, So you’ve got this incredible challenge before you: now you need to really face it. How do you deal, how do you cope, when this very upsetting thing is happening to you? It’s very important to remember that time passes and things change. Always. The only constant is that the sun will rise each morning. Whatever you’re dealing with, however terrible and permanent it feels, it’s important to remember that you will not always feel this way. Your challenge will not be there forever. A new reality will form and you will find a way to keep living. Just keep telling yourself: This too shall pass.


For example, your boyfriend that you’ve been with since you were young might have just left you. It will feel horrible, like you’ll never be happy again and you’ll never find someone else that you love that much. It might feel like you’ll never find anyone. But time will pass, you’ll be out at a party, and then suddenly...your prince charming will walk into the room. He’ll be funny and charming and he’ll think you’re just the most incredible thing to grace this Earth. It’ll happen. You just need to be patient and give it time.

, When bad things happen to us or when we’re stressed, we tend to forget about all of the wonderful things that exist in our lives. No matter how bad things seem, the world really is a wonderful place. Take account of the good things in your life. Spend time enjoying them and tell the people that love you how much you love them in return. Not only will this keep you sane during this challenging time, it might also help you find a way to take on your challenge.


People sometimes have a hard time seeing the good things in their life. Don’t let this happen to you. You don’t have a significant other? You do still have friends and family. Not much in the way of friends and family? You’re alive and you have the wonderful opportunity to go out into the world and make friends and have experiences. There’s always some incredible experience that’s just waiting for you to get up and take it.

, No matter what challenge you’re facing, being flexible will make a huge difference in helping you face it. See yourself as a tree that’s fallen in a river. You can try to go against the flow, but you’ll end up struggling and you’ll bang against every rock on the way. If instead you go with the flow, change with each direction that the river wants to take you, you’ll glide smoothly until it carries you to a resting place.

, When you have a goal or find some kind of greater meaning in your life, you’ll find that facing any challenge is easier. This is because it gives you something to work towards, hope for, or will simply inspire you and make you happy. There are lots of ways to go about this. You can set a goal, like that you want to buy a house in five years. Some people become more religious and find comfort in their religious community. Some people volunteer and find strength in helping others. Find something that works for you.


Finding meaning if you don’t have meaning can be tricky. The best way to go about it, as with most things in life, is to give it a try. When you find the right thing for you, you’ll know it. Just keep yourself open to as many possibilities as possible and don’t keep yourself from getting out there and trying things.

, Handling stress takes practice. You’ll find that you have an easier time facing challenges if you face more of them. When you keep yourself sheltered and always take the easy route in life to avoid the challenges, you’ll never show yourself that you can in fact face a challenge. Let challenges happen. Take risks that have promising rewards. You’ll find that you can do more than you give yourself credit for.


It’s a bit like learning to ride a bike: you have to get up on the bike and you might get a few scrapes and bruises while you learn to keep your balance, but each wobble will teach you something about staying upright. If every time you wobble you get off the bike and stay off for a few years, you’re never going to learn.

, When you do face challenges in your life, be grateful for them. Each challenge you face will teach you more about yourself. It will become a part of who you are...and that person is an incredible person. You are unique and wonderful and it is your challenges that have made you that way. You might be struggling right now but remember, even while you’re worrying and upset, that this challenge is going to make you a better person.

, The most important thing you can do for facing any challenge is to believe in yourself. When you doubt yourself, you’ll falter. You’ll make poor decisions. You want to make good decisions! Not believing in yourself can also powerfully transform what you take away from this experience. Either you believe in yourself and what you take away is ultimately good and you learn from it...or you don’t believe in yourself and this experience is negative because you see it as a failure on your part. Which experience would you rather have?


Sometimes, life has been so unkind that we really don’t want to believe in ourselves. Please, don’t let your experiences diminish your wonderful spirit. You are so strong. Look at all the stuff that you’ve made it through so far! We know that you can face this challenge and do so with grace. We believe in you and we are so proud of the person that you are. Just keep trying and don’t forget to be awesome.

This careful introspection requires time and focused attention on your part. Before you get started, find a safe, comfortable, and peaceful location where you are unlikely to be disturbed for a while. If necessary, eliminate any distracting noises or lights.


This location can be anywhere you feel at peace — a cozy armchair in your study, a mat on the floor of an unfurnished room, or even outside in the wilderness.
Most schools of meditation recommend against attempting this sort of introspection somewhere that you associate with sleep, like a bed, as this can lead to unintended naps.;
, Free yourself of any worries or stresses that may be weighing on you. Realize that whatever is distracting you from devoting your full focus to your introspection is just a thought — a thought that, like any other, can be ignored in favor of more important thoughts. Remember: There's no worry that you didn't create for yourself, so there's no worry that you can't set aside.


This doesn't necessarily mean pretending whatever problems you have don't exist. Rather, it means acknowledging these problems and resolving your feelings about them so that you can turn your thoughts to other things.

, Find a comfortable position, still your body, and close your eyes. Slow your breathing as you take deep, filling breaths. Keep your back straight and upright to prevent yourself from falling asleep — other than this, your exact position isn't important. Allow your thoughts to decouple from the normal, unproductive cycle of stress and worry. If stressful thoughts arise, acknowledge them, realize that they are extensions of your innermost self that can be controlled, and set them aside.


Meditation is a topic that been captured by much excellent, inspired writing. For more detailed discussion of meditation techniques, see wikiHow's article on the subject or outside resources like this guide for traditional Buddhist meditation., Allow your thoughts to turn back onto yourself. Detach yourself from your emotions. Realize that your sense of experience, your sensations, and your feelings are all a creation of your inner self. Everything that exists within you and without you is an extension of your mind — your surroundings, for instance, are just images created and interpreted by your inner self. Thus, by exploring the layers of your mind, you can come to a greater understanding of the world in general.


You are not attempting to scrutinize or criticize yourself here — any feelings of emotional pain or discomfort should be a sign that you have not yet detached yourself from your emotions.

, If you can't get the hang of meditation, broaden your horizons. Some people find that they are able to achieve transcendent states of consciousness by participating in activities that they would normally have an aversion to. This benefit can be long-lasting — in the most extreme cases, semi-permanent personality changes can make it easier to achieve introspection in the long term. As long as these activities are safe, you may want to try one in place of meditation. A few examples are below:


Performing strenuous exercise
Going on a wilderness journey
Speaking or performing in public
Talking about a secret memory or feeling with someone else
Writing about inner emotions in a diary
Skydiving or bungee jumping

, The first, surface layer of the mind is the layer that you use to present yourself to others (especially people you don't know well.) This layer is often used to build a complicated façade that hides your true thoughts and feelings behind a ""proper,"" ""acceptable"" state of being. Let yourself explore thoughts of who you are to other people. To begin to get a grip on your mental layers, you must recognize these surface-level characteristics before you can search for their source.


You may want to use these basic thoughts to get you started:
""My name is ...""
""I live at ...""
""I work at ...""
""I like this, I don't like that ...""
""I do this, I don't do that ...""
""I like these people, but not these people ...""
... and so on.
The memories, experiences, and personal values you find during this step and the others in this section can be valuable. You may want to consider writing down any major insights you have during these exercises, especially, once you venture deep into your consciousness. A digital recorder can be handy if you don't want to break your concentration to write.

, Thinking about the things you do regularly can offer unexpected insights when viewed through an introspective frame of consciousness. Allow your thoughts to turn the regular events that punctuate your daily life. Think to yourself, ""how do these things make me feel? Why do I do them? The goal here is to start to see how much of your sense of self is caught up in these repetitive behaviors.


Here are a few example thoughts. Notice that these are surprisingly mundane. If you are like most people, much of your mind may be dedicated to things that don't ultimately have much importance.
""When I get up?""
""Where I buy my groceries?""
""What do I usually eat throughout the day?""
""Which interests do I pursue at precise times during the day?""
""Which people I prefer spending time with?""

, How did you get where you are today? Where are you going? Truthfully answering these questions can be eye-opening. Experiences, people, goals, dreams, and fears aren't usually things that affect us for one single moment — rather, they extend from the present into the past and future, shaping who we are over time. Thus, understanding the ""was"" and ""will be"" of yourself can help you get a better picture of who you ""are.""


Here are some questions to focus on:
""What have I done for work in the past? What do I eventually want to do?""
""Who have I loved? Who will I love in the future?""
""What have I done with my time in the past? How do I want to spend the time I have left?""
""How have I felt about who I was? How do I want to feel about myself in the future?""

, Now that you've broken down the important aspects of the self discussed above, you have a chance to contemplate your true, inner self. Start by finding the parts of yourself that you don't show to others. These may be opinions that you're embarrassed about, things you've done that you don't want others to know, feelings you don't know how to express, and much more — anything that isn't part of the ""self"" you present in your day-to-day life.


For example, you may want to ponder these sorts of questions:
""How do I really feel about the things I spend most of my day doing?""
""How confident am I really in my plan for the future?""
""What memory or feeling do I spend a lot of time thinking about that no one else knows?""
""Are there things that I secretly want but don't have?""
""Do I wish that I could feel a certain way?""
""Are there things that I secretly feel about the people close to me?""

, The way you truly view the world — your worldview — is one of the most profound layers of your self. In some ways, your worldview is the single most important piece of your personality since it affects the way you interact with almost everything: from people, to animals, to nature, to, of course, yourself.


To determine your worldview, use broad questions about humanity and the world at large, like, for instance:
""Do I think people are basically good, or basically bad?""
""Do I believe it is possible for people to surpass their flaws?""
""Do I believe in a higher power?""
""Do I believe there is a point to life?""
""Do I have hope for the future?""

, Finally, allow your thoughts to turn inward until you discover what you truly think of yourself. This layer of the mind is one of the deepest — it's not often that we spend time thinking about how we feel about ourselves, but these deep thoughts can affect our cognitive patterns and the quality of our lives more than almost anything else.


Don't be afraid to unearth truths that may profoundly affect you — digging this deep into the layers of your mind is usually a very enlightening experience, though it can be fraught with emotion. You will emerge from your introspection with a greater understanding of yourself.
Here are just a few things you may want to consider. As you answer these questions, keep your answers to your earlier questions in mind.
""Do I criticize myself too much? Praise myself too much?""
""Are there parts of myself that I like or dislike when I see them in other people?""
""Do I want certain things that I see in other people?""
""Do I want to be the person who I am?""

, Acknowledging harsh truths about your self-image should not be the final step of your introspective journey. With careful contemplation, improvement is possible. First, try to determine why you have the self-image that you do. There may or may not be a single primary cause. You may not be able to explain it at all, no matter how hard you try. This is OK. In this case, simply try to acknowledge that you feel the way that you do about yourself for a reason. Once you realize that your self-image has a cause (even one that's hard to define), you can try to improve it.

, If you are like most people today, a self-image that's less-than perfect may be due to the fact that you place too much importance in things that don't actually have any value or benefit for you. Ideally, removing your attachment to these things will give you a happier life and a better self-image — if you're not constantly chasing these things, you'll remove many of your daily stresses and you'll be able to concentrate more on the most important things of all: yourself and the people close to you.


Things that are often highly prized today but which have little effect on your true happiness include money, material goods, social status, and so on.
On the other hand, things that are often sacrificed in favor of relatively unimportant distractions include personal time, contemplation, personal projects, friends, and family. In fact, strong family ties have been scientifically proven to bring more happiness than a high income.With this in mind, list that prioritizes the importance of the major things in one person's life might look like this:



Kids
Spouse
Relatives
Job
Friends
Hobby
Wealth





, Unfortunately, people sometimes betray something high on their list of personal priorities (such as a strong sense of ethics) in order to protect another lower down on the list (such as being able to drive a nice car.) Your goal here is to determine how far you are willing to go to achieve the things at the top of your list, knowing, of course, that this may mean sacrificing the things at the bottom.


One good example of this is from literature: In Shakespeare's Othello, the character Othello kills Desdemona, the woman he loved, because he was led to believe by his friend Iago that she was cheating on him.In this case, Othello is unfortunately driven to permanently give up perhaps the most important thing in the world — the person he loves — because he places his personal honor and reputation above it. Placing this much importance in something that doesn't truly make him happy doesn't work out well for Othello: at the end of the play, he kills himself.

, Once you've determined exactly what you're willing to do to get the things that are at the top of your list, it should be clear what you can and can't reasonably get. Thus, you should ideally no longer have any reason to maintain a negative self image: you now have a plan for getting the most important things in the world to you, so all you need is to simply do it! Having a negative self-image won't help you, so you don't need it.

, Realistically, it's often difficult to give up major portions of your life immediately. The important thing in these cases is to acknowledge that you're devoting your energies to the wrong things and make plans to fix this. Make concrete plans to strip away all of the unimportant aspects of your life so you can focus on what's most important with your full attention.


For instance, if you have the epiphany that you spend more time worrying about your job than you do spending time with you family (when, in reality, your family is more important to you) you still may not be able to change your job right if your family is dependent on you for income. However, you can start looking for new jobs while maintaining your obligations to your family.

It is easy to paint yourself as the hero of your own story, but consider what it is that you might be ignoring about yourself. By practicing mindfulness, you can take a look at yourself and your life more objectively.Mindfulness involves two components:


Paying attention to yourself.Think about who you are in this moment. What are you thinking about? What are you feeling? How would you describe your behaviors? Learning to pay attention to who you are and what you are thinking at each moment can make you more aware of your emotions and reactions.
Observing non-judgmentally.When you have a strong emotional reaction, it can be useful to act as an objective observer of your own behaviors. Is your emotional reaction worth it? Rather than letting your feelings drive your life thoughtlessly, take a few moments to consider where these feelings are coming from and how you should be reacting to them.;
, People who are introspective are more likely to behave morally and empathetically. The key is to compare how your behaviors measure up to your core principles. Are you meeting the standards you believe everyone should hold for themselves? Make a list of the qualities that are most important to you in others; then ask yourself how you might be able to embody these qualities.

, Many people who are uncomfortable with how they live their lives seek to escape from introspection and self-knowledge. They do this through alcohol, drugs, mindless entertainment, or other problematic behaviors. Don't give in to these temptations. Tell yourself that getting to know yourself is hard work that you must not try to shirk or escape.

, When people are trying to learn more about themselves, they instinctively begin to compare themselves with others. For example, someone who has recently changed jobs will likely compare herself both to her new colleagues and to her old colleagues in order to figure out how competent she is. Understand that these comparisons are a normal way for people to develop insight into who they are. However, rather than becoming blindly jealous of those who are superior to you or becoming smug about those who are inferior to you, be mindful about the instinctive comparisons you make. Tell yourself that these comparisons are a more useful barometer of what is important to you than about your actual skillsets.


For example, if you find yourself constantly comparing your smaller home to the larger homes of your friends, resist the urge to be jealous. Instead, understand that this instinctive comparison is giving you information about your priorities in life. Ask yourself why you care about the size of your home: do you wish to be more financially secure? Are you interested in growing your family? Or do you wish to be respected by your community? Use comparisons as a source of information about your priorities, not as fuel for jealousy.

, Studies show that the way we think about our internal selves does not always match up with our external selves.As a tool to develop insight into your own life, record yourself speaking or interacting with someone else, such as through a vlog or video diary. Pay attention to your voice, your body language, your intonations, your facial expressions. Ask yourself whether what you see in the video matches your self-conception.

, There is no such thing as a single, unchanging self. Your life will involve experimentation, change, and dynamic interactions with others. Try to keep a healthy balance between staying true to your own values and desires and admitting when these values and desires must change. Try to view personal development not as an obstacle to your awareness of a single truth but rather as a journey to multiple truths and insights about who you are., Personality tests help test-takers determine their personality types, desires, and skillsets. There are many different kinds of personality test, though the Myers-Briggs inventory is one of the most widely used.The science of personality tests and inventories is shaky, and you should take the results with a grain of salt. However, it is also likely that the results of your personality test will allow you to consider whether your self-perception lines up with the test's evaluation. Did anything unexpected turn up? Have you learned something new about your personality or your self-perception? You can take a personality test for free at many websites.

, Studies show that persons who train in meditation techniques are more likely to know themselves in a thorough, objective way. Take a meditation course or learn meditation techniques in order to train yourself in self-awareness. If you are not comfortable with traditional meditation, you might also experience a similar benefit from engaging in focused, repetitive activities such as running, biking, or knitting.When you meditate, it is helpful to:Maintain a routine. Meditate at the same time in the same place each day.
Keep good posture.
Breathe deeply.
Shut out distractions, worries, and nagging thoughts.
Use mantras in order to keep yourself focused.

, Goals are one of the keys to living a happy, satisfied life. People who work hard to achieve goals that are important to them report feeling more content with their lives and are more confident in who they are.It helps to set goals that are positive (such as learning a new skill) instead of negative (such as not failing calculus).In order to make sense of your life goals, do the following:


Make sure your goals are achievable and reasonable. Do not make your goal to ""become a trillionaire"": instead, have your goal be something you can attain in your lifetime, such as to ""become more effective at my job.""Set a goal that you can control. There are many things in life that are great but also totally outside of our control. For example, a life goal of winning the lottery is not something you can ever control.Think about where you want to be in 5 years. How about 10 years? 20? Feel free to daydream about where you want your life to be headed. Daydreaming is one of the most important tools to reaching a bright future in your life.Think about all aspects of your life. How do you want your career to look? Your family? Your social life? Your personal development? Your hobbies? Don't limit yourself to one particular area of life: think about all of your most important activities.
Break large goals down into smaller, achievable tasks. It can be difficult to work toward a vague, large goal such as ""becoming my own boss."" However, if you break a large goal down into its component parts, you might find that the goal is easily achievable. For example, the first step to becoming your own boss might be to expand your social network in order to develop a potential client base, which is something you can do right now.
Develop an action plan. Once you have a sense of the large goals you are working toward as well as the small tasks involved to get there, you can begin to work towards them one-by-one. Challenge yourself to achieve great things, and reward yourself whenever you achieve one of your goals., Daily journaling can allow you to consider your deepest desires, darkest secrets, and outlook on life. Get to know yourself better by writing your thoughts down every day. Set a timer for 15 minutes, and make sure that you write throughout the entire period. Your journal will be a valuable tool to allow you to develop insight into your current self as well as how you develop over the course of many years.If you find that you have writer's block, consider using a journaling prompt such as:


What is the most interesting thing that happened to me today?
What did I daydream about?
What topics make me uncomfortable to write about?
Who are the 10 people I care about the most?

, Our memories often take the shape of a narrative or story, in much the same way that memoirs and autobiographies do. Articulating this life story can allow you to process these memories and make sense out of a great deal of chaotic information.Take a few minutes to think about how you might tell the story of your own life. What memories are the most significant? What life events have shaped the person you are today? What arc has your life taken? Simply thinking about your life story or talking about it with friends is beneficial. However, you might also consider more formal ways to communicate your life story, such as through:



A memoir or autobiography
A photo album
A short film
A graphic novel

, Your appearance is one of the first ways that you communicate yourself to others. At the same time, your appearance also allows you to gain a better handle on yourself. Indeed, many introspective, reflective people take some time to consider how their self-presentation is related to their values, likes, and tastes.Consider experimenting with how you look in order to understand your own tastes and, by extension, your own life. You can:


Wear a color you've never worn before
Experiment with a new hairstyle

Consider getting a tattoo or piercing
Try to find a fashion or accessory designer you admire
Remember to take standards of professionalism into account when you experiment. Some workplaces forbid visible tattoos and facial piercings for example., Many people are able to learn about themselves by engaging in some kind of creative activity. By making beautiful works of art, you come to know your own preferences. At the same time, you are honing a skill that might allow you to tell your own story more effectively.Consider taking a class at a local arts studio if you are a novice. If you already practice a craft, be sure to take time to work on it every day. Some arts and crafts you might consider are:


Sculpting
Painting
Creative writing (poetry, fiction, or non-fiction)
Blogging
Photography
Dance
Woodworking
Pottery-throwing
Gardening

, You do not exist in isolation: who you are as a person depends in large part on how you interact with other persons, especially those who are closest to you.In order to get to know yourself better, get to know your loved ones better. Not only will you discover surprising things about yourself, but your loved ones might be able to assist you during confusing or troubling times in your life. In order to cultivate strong relationships with others, you must:


Be empathetic
Practice forgiveness
Demonstrate active listening skills
Be willing to initiate conversations and activities

, In order to develop insight into your life, you have to admit that sometimes you might be deceiving yourself. Perhaps you are blind to your own prejudices, or perhaps you sometimes think that you are a more generous person than your actions demonstrate. In order to be able to work through your blind spots and pernicious patterns, you will need to find a smart, objective person who can help reveal the darkest corners of your life to you.Many people find that talking to a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist can serve this key function.

, One key tool of self-knowledge is the information we get from observing the behaviors of those we interact with.Think about the cues you are being sent when you talk to old friends and to new acquaintances. Consider whether you can interpret them in order to develop insight into your life, behaviors, and values.


Be aware that not everybody can (or should) get along with everybody else. Pay particular attention to the reactions of those whom you respect, care for, and admire.

, People can be affected by their surroundings in many subtle, subconscious, yet significant ways. Do not tell yourself that you are immune to the world around you: your life has been irrevocably shaped by the world you live in. While you cannot (and should not) escape the world, what you can do is learn more about the world in which you find yourself. You might be able to understand more clearly how the world has shaped your life.

, Studies show that some cultures value speech as a tool of self-knowledge, while others value silence.Consider whether your own native culture has shaped how you view yourself and what you prioritize in life. Read about your own culture as well as other cultures in order to begin to understand how culture has impacted you.

, Routines can be important and healthy in everyday life. But sometimes they can leave us stuck in a rut, unwilling to discover new places and ideas. Shake up your routine by actively seeking new and different opportunities. Some great ways to broaden your horizons include:


Taking a class in a new topic
Reading about a brand-new idea
Visiting a place you've never seen before
Have conversations with strangers

, Think of the causes you care about the most, and devote several hours each week to helping that cause. You will learn about your own potential as well as about the world around you. You will meet people who share your ideals and vision as well as people who might come from a completely different background. You might even discover a new career pathway by helping others., Read the news daily. Be sure that you turn to reputable journalists and news agencies so that you are getting the most accurate, up-to-date information about local, national, and international events. Take a few minutes each day to react to these events. What are your thoughts on how the world is moving? What can you do to help or change things? What is most important to you right now?

, If something can be easy, do it in the simplest way. Don't take 15 steps to solve a problem that requires 2 steps to solve. Now this doesn't means that the simplest way is always easy - work smarter, not harder.

, If you don't have anything to say, then don't say anything. If you do have anything to say, think about what you're saying to avoid making further embarrassment and stupidity of yourself.

, Simple people are the most productive people because they have the 5 life senses (book sense, common sense, street sense, fashion sense, and business sense). Not everyone is going to have these senses in equal amounts, but try to improve yourself in all of them.

, Don't go for anything too colorful or too dull. If it's a formal event, wear some dark slacks, a decent white dress shirt, a red tie, and some black dress shoes. It's as simple as wearing a T-shirt and blue jeans. But your style is you.

, It won't kill you and good manners will take you very far in life.

, Stand up for what you believe in. Simple people also think before mental and physical argument.

, This is by far the most important thing to have. A good attitude is worth more than a billion dollars. If a simple person is told to do something, he does it, but he doesn't get pushed in the wrong direction either. He doesn't get used or taken advantage of.

, You can try to get things done by yourself such as cleaning your bedroom, doing your homework, maybe cooking or cleaning. This will show you are responsible and independent.

, Don't drink, smoke, do drugs or party all night. These things aren't important, they won't help your future-and they're definitely not good for you or your health. Stay away from it! If moderate alcohol use is traditional in your family, ask an adult for advice on responsible drinking. Stick to a curfew hour even if your parents haven't set one for you, like always be home by midnight or earlier. (This is an example of good business sense.)

Our world is a reflection of who we are, what we want and how we want to live our world. In conclusion, if we want to change the world then we have to change ourselves in the way we talk, eat, mix, and the way we love.;
, Live a life of a true Christian and not that of a hypocrite. Show the people around how to live and let live, your children, family and friends are also your priority so be a good example to them... We all say things we hear from others because we like it. Once people notice a change about you, tardily they too will change the way they do things around you and be cautioned. The people around are being affected with the way we live, especially our young ones, be of a good virtue and they will learn to live that way by learning from you. Be that change you want to see in the world.

, Instead of sitting alone in the room watching 24 hours or Prison Break, call your friends in to watch it with them, definitely argument will arise but don’t take it far, but if argued well y'all have fun without any getting hurt.

Pay a visit to an orphanage home. What are those good things you don’t need anymore? Give them to someone. Don’t just give money, give your time, give your listening ear, and give the Word.

, Learn to be quiet even when the situation demands so much that you interrupt because it’s what you say while you interrupt that you will still say when you listen. Sometimes we won’t even get the whole story if we interrupt people in their talks and learn the language to use if you have to correct them like, if I may get you well, according to what you say, then you talk. Remember some are also shy when it comes to expressing themselves to be able to read between lines and read beyond their lips. Know what their mood says and always ask if you can be of help.

, Instead catch little tips by smiling at the person coming your way or give a wink at others as long as you don’t flirt with married person lol…A lot go about their way frowning for something that doesn’t even worth it and they don’t even have a clue of what they look like in that image. So smile all day, remember a laugh a day keeps doctor away…

, Remember your neighbors also, you can do without friends but not without neighbors and remember they are your first family in case anything happens to you. So pray for your friends, neighbors, families, country and your spouse. Pray for your friends, family, the nation and everything and everyone around you.

If you would like to make the eyes even more realistic and shiny, you may make the circle and make lines around it like the sun its rays around it.



, Make a vertical line for the nose. This line will appear like the letter ""J"" because it will be curved at the bottom. Then make a mirror image of ""J"" besides it. There at the bottom you may make the nostrils.


The nose is thin at the top and expands at the bottom.

, Draw few lines below the nose to make the lips. If the lips, at the corners are curved upwards, it gives an expression of a smile. Hence, according to your preference, you may either have the lines curve up at the corners or remain rather straight to give a plain expression.

, Add light lines to the face. These lines will guide you as to where you need to shade once the sketching is done.


A hint to adding these lines is to assign a place for light. Which means, you must make the face slightly darker at some areas (to create depth) and lighter at some other areas.

The darker areas will include the area below the eyebrows.
At the eye lids (both upper and lower).
At the sides of the nose.
At the side of the face (the jaw).
And below the lower lip (at the chin).


This creation of depth is optional depending upon your comfort level with shading. You may skip it if you are not very comfortable with doing so.

, Make the scarf right at the forehead and flowing till the end of the image. Make the neck and the shoulder line depending upon how much you would like to add to the drawing.


You may make a rather colorful scarf or just a single colored one.

, You may have some extra lines appearing beyond your drawing. Just erase them. If the color has smudged outside, you may use a thick, not much diluted, color patch to cover the area., You may just shade the drawing with pencil or color it. You can do shading in a way that it looks very light and that it does not show the pencil work with lines which are horizontal, vertical and diagonal. To avoid showing all these lines in your shading, you may use a piece of paper and rub on the shaded area to blend the pencil work to make it appear natural.


You may follow the same rubbing method while coloring with color pencils.

Charcoal pencil (which is black).
Crayons.
For coloring with liquid color like water color, you may have to use thinner brush and color with adding a little extra water to the color solution. As thin colors could be thickened later but a thick coat of color gets a bit tricky to cover or change unless you are proficient with coloring.



, Color the drawing using some shades of ocher for the face. If you are not happy with the colors you have, you may blend two or more colors to enhance the drawing of Mother Mary.


Use the lighter colors first if while coloring, the colors tend to smudge more often. Because lighter colors could be covered with darker colors on them easily but not vice versa.
You may outline the drawing in the end which will enable you to conceal any color that spread outside and also to make your drawing look more presentable.

, As the warrior faction, the Dauntless maintain great physical health and strength. So, in your free time you may like to start running, lifting weights or doing other physical activities you enjoy.

, Take some risks in your everyday life. Tris herself said: ""I never thought I would need bravery in the small moments of life. I do.""

, Dauntless believe that they should protect those who cannot defend themselves.

, Put yourself in situations that are out of your comfort zone. Learn what your fears are (perhaps write them down) and then tackle them in safe environments when you can.

, This applies to a range of life situations, such as in relationships, friendships and personal opportunities.

We are all the same, all human, but all different to each other and being different is a good thing. We don't even look the same, so our personalities are all different too. We can't judge someone because they are different from us. Think about what would happen if everyone was the same? Would our life be interesting? Would their be anything different in life to learn?;
, We should all help each other if we see others are struggling with things. Imagine you had something that you were struggling with and no one to help you. What would you do? How would you do it? Will it work if you are doing what you are doing?

, We should all try to go to visit someone who is in hospital and take care of this we know that are ill or in pain. Think how it feels to be all alone without any friends when you are suffering. Would you like it if no one came to visit you?

, Someone is drowning. What do you do? (You think of anything that will save them, the best thing that will save them would be some think that floats) throw them a floating hoop, if there is nothing that floats go and dive to save them.

, Like stealing, killing someone, rape etc. These are the worst things that you could do in life to someone.

, If you are not happy, think why are you not happy. Think how can you improve it or do it? Will I be able to do it? If you can't do it think to yourself that you are lucky for the things you have that some people might not have?

, Some people do mean things because of how they were treated when they where younger. But you can change your life into a better life then being mean. We all have good and bad things in us. Find yourself some good friends to hang around with, to play basketball, go to the cinema, go to the club and shopping.

, There is a good drug called the African Iboga plant. But it costs a lot of money. If you could make this for free this would change the whole world. Imagine a place where no one takes drugs, doesn't smoke and doesn't have any silly habits. There will be less criminal things happening around the world like killing, stealing, etc. People don't do things without a reasons there is a reason to why people do it.

, People should make every child do meditation. In schools they should teach them how to relax. If somebody really wants to something bad they could meditate and relax and not do anything bad at all but instead, go and do something nice. In schools they should do a relaxation room where they do meditation. If someone gets bullied they could go and meditate to make themselves feel better. It might be a good idea if they teach children about differences.

, They should teach children how to protect themselves from bullies and how to react and not react. There are some reaction that could make a bully want to bully you even more. Go and read some articles about bullying. They should teach children some stuff from wikiHow.

Be aware that there are as many definitions of the philosophy of possibilitism as there are possibilitists.,
Define possibility as broadly as possible.,
Keep an amazingly open mind, prepared for all possibilities out there.,
Find and be accepting of the many potential ways.,
Learn about possibilities behind the probability curve.,
Join some possibilitists in appreciating an avenue of growth for human comprehension, if you so wish.,
Join some possibilitists in the following understanding of time, if you so wish.,
Consider the quandary: ""What about lies and outright deception(s)?"".,
Be curious about what is viewed as material and immaterial.,
Be free to explore your spirituality.",How to Be a Possibilitist (Adherent to Possibilitism)," It hardly serves you well to begin explaining some of them until you've had a chance to start defining it for yourself, as is your perfect right to do. The fact that there may be temporary agreement on some tenet(s) or other of the philosophy is of little consequence because the name of the game is quite possibly change.

However, generally speaking, the ability of nature to discover and utilize new niches for life is appreciated by possibilitists, and you may join in this appreciation and enthusiasm.
You are encouraged to read and study other philosophies, but always bear in mind that they are merely possible paths to the Truth. Many include exclusions and negations/denials of various aspects of awareness, such as hallucinations or delusions, whereas the possibilitist realizes that such are actual bio-electrical phenomena occurring in the brain, within tangible reality that is, and so must be taken seriously.;
, Learn that the various dictionary definitions of ""possibility"" are not broad enough or imaginative enough or playful enough! What about ""pause+ability"" and ""Pos+Sybility"", for just two examples of how the word may be heard and reinterpreted semantically by the creative mind., Most of all, a possibilitist does not believe in the word ""Not""! Why? Because, to deny a premise, one must accept it first, which is on its face absolutely contradictory nonsense. Besides, it is unclear; for example, when someone says something like ""not the foot"", does this mean the leg, the area around the foot, the volume the foot occupies but without the foot in it? Whatever is meant by ""not the foot"" is less than clear and is hardly obvious at all. To clarify the statement, ""The possibilitist does not believe in the word 'not'"" is to state ""The possibilitist believes in the word, and/or in silence, and/or in words, and/or in parts of words, and/or in humming, singing, et cetera."", Possibilitists defer to unique definitions by other possibilitists, as is their right to establish a unique possible niche of definition. There is a right way: It is all ways., It is stated as y = e^x^2, or y = e^x^n in some texts, where all possibilities under its curve sum to 100% = 1. This is looked at by possibilitists as just one of many possible curves under which the sum is One = 100% for one thing. And what about the possibilities in the area above the curve? Or under the axis it rests upon? In the third and fourth quadrants -- what about possibilities therein? A possibilitist is not satisfied with the statistical frame of Possibility whatsoever., The possibilitist appreciates an omniscient being or beings who is/are aware of all possibilities and all time everywhere reconciled, as includes time beyond light speed and light speed squared. Just because a thing is less than clearly defined currently, or understood in a particular form or way now, is hardly a reason to believe that it will never become susceptible to the human imagination., The possibilitist appreciates one definition of the past and future as being on the opposite side of every spinning particle in relation to one's perception and the forces acting upon one from the far side of said particle(s). Thus, after a particle is presently facing an individual as it spins, it turns about to become the past, while at the same time still spinning around to become the future. This explains the great continuity we humans sense as reality within time, whereas actually there is only now, the instantaneous awareness of all parts of all particles within and without oneself. The rate at which now occurs is of little consequence once one experiences now (or now experiences)., The possibilitist recognizes that lies and omissions and deceptions are still based upon a kernel of the truth, and in that they contain such, are to be wholly considered as creations of wayward minds, perhaps, yet manifest creations nonetheless. Discerning whether a statement is a deception is important, of course, and yet not as important as considering it as a potential possible condition that may yet manifest, given the ""right"" (or ""wrong"") circumstances. The possibilitist keeps an extraordinarily open mind to all statements and is free to modify them at will, according to his or her own grasp of what's possible -- that is, one may grasp the kernel of truth within a lie and expand on that, for example., Within the discrepancy, the discarded and the put aside lie the possibilities. For example, within auditing is the concept of materiality, whereby the financial statements as a whole may not be materially misstated if an immaterial error or misstatement has occurred. But to the possibilitist, such discrepancies are representations of how possibilities are at work in the business world and statements of financial condition -- and they ""matter""; they are of interest insofar as how they arose and were allowed to be carried forward, etc. This same concept applies in law, although somewhat differently than in auditing, for a fact that is immaterial in law to the prosecution may be essential to the defense, or vice versa. Such ""matters"" are of material interest to the possibilitist. The concept of materiality or relevance or statistical significance also arises in physics and other branches of science and the possibilitist is very interested in results that get tossed out of the findings for being too extraneous. The possibilitist often works in the area of the muddled and not obvious, the chaotic and the perturbed -- because this is where the outside (less likely) possibilities are probably coming into play in a given situation or event-series., Possibilitism lets you explore your spiritual side freely. Here is an image depicting that freedom.

Think long and hard about what you are deciding to do.,
Write out a list of reasons why you are leaving the church.,
Do some research on the actual doctrines and practices of the Church over time.,
Many ex-Mormons and people considering leaving the church find it helpful to seek out and talk to or read blogs and articles by others who have left the church.,
Don't try to explain to others why you are leaving.,
Stop going to church activities.,
Tell those who ask about you that you appreciate their concern and that you are searching your heart to make decisions that are right for you.,
Find something to do that makes you feel good on days you would normally go to church related activities and programs.,
If you made a final decision, write a letter to Church Records.",How to Leave the Mormon Church Gracefully," When you decide to leave the Mormon church, outline your reasons very clearly in your mind and have confidence in your decision. If you're certain that you'll never want to re-join the Church, write a letter to the Bishop and request to have your name removed from church records.;
, Sometimes it helps to have something solid to look at when Mormon family and friends try to convince you otherwise of your decisions.

, Many people find it is much easier to leave the church once they come to a solid decision.

, Doing so is a good way to expand your understanding of the church and strengthen your resolve. There are many websites, archives, and blogs on the internet which you can turn to to find a diverse and supportive community of people willing to help you make the transition out of the church.

, Attempting to help them understand your reasons is likely to only result in frustration and increased friction with the Mormons who remain in your life. Faith does not rely on facts, so presenting evidence to people determined to believe is generally a waste of time and energy.

, When invited by members to attend, decline politely. If they insist, tell them you'll think about it and then give it some actual thought, but always remain true to yourself.

, Be friendly, but politely and assertively tell them that you will no longer be attending church activities or functions.

, Talk to people about your feelings if you're feeling guilty/upset. Ask yourself why you feel that way.

, Make sure to include your full name, your date of birth, your current address and today’s date. Address your letter to: Member Records Division, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 50 E North Temple Room 1372, Salt Lake City UT 84150-5310. (Actually you should address it to the Bishop of your ward. If you send it to Salt Lake they will most likely refer you back to your Bishop anyway.) An example is one written below:




This letter is my formal resignation, effective immediately, from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I hereby withdraw my consent to being treated as a member and I withdraw my consent to being subject to church rules, policies, beliefs and 'discipline'. As I am no longer a member, I want my name permanently removed from the membership rolls of the church.
I have given this matter considerable thought. I understand the 'seriousness' and 'consequences' of my actions. I am aware that the church handbook says that my resignation ""cancels the effects of baptism and confirmation, withdraws the priesthood held by a male member and revokes temple blessings"". I also understand that I will be ""readmitted to the church by baptism only after a thorough interview"". (Church Handbook of Instructions)
My resignation should be processed immediately, without any 'waiting periods'. I have made up my mind and cannot be dissuaded. I expect my request to be handled promptly, respectfully and with confidentiality.
As of today, the only contact I wish from the church is a single letter of confirmation to let me know that I am no longer a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Sincerely, your signature followed by your printed name.

You can get literature about Mormonism directly from the LDS Church website to begin with. Once you feel like you know what the religion is about, you can move on to talking with people about the religion.The best source is a member of the Mormon Church or their missionaries.;
, It’s also important to ask about the LDS Church from those who are outside of the religion. This way, you will get a more complex and rounded view of Mormonism. If they are willing, you can talk to people who were in the religion but left it. You can also speak with those who know about the religion, but were never a part of it.You can ask those who left the religion what originally brought them to Mormonism, what their experience was like, and why they left.
A religious studies professor would be another person to talk to about Mormonism.

, This book is central to Mormon beliefs. Read it with an open mind, and compare its teachings to the Bible. There are always manuals about it available on the LDS Church website in a variety of formats if you're having difficulty understanding the Book of Mormon. Although these were designed for children, they are helpful for adults, too.You can purchase a book directly from the church or online at the LDS Church’s website.

, These missionaries devote up to two years of their lives to teaching others about Mormonism. Approach them on the street when you see them or invite them in when they knock on your door. They can tell you more about the Church and invite you to visit it. You will usually be required to take lessons from these missionaries once you’ve expressed interest in becoming a member.If you don't see them around, invite them to come to you using the Mormon church’s website.

, Once you’ve expressed your interest, you will become an “investigator.” An investigator is invited to take lessons and learn more about the church. This period of learning could take a few weeks or a few months. The lessons conducted by the missionaries are called “discussions.” The discussions are usually pretty formal. The missionaries discuss their personal feelings about Mormonism, ask questions, and teach the gospel of Jesus Christ.The “investigation” period depends on the individual’s rate of preparation for the baptism.
These lessons are often taught in a home setting to a small group.

, As an investigator, you will be asked to make commitments during your time of study. The commitments range from daily prayer, learning about scripture, and prayerful study of the Book of Mormon. You will also be encouraged to start living the LDS lifestyle., The LDS lifestyle means following a Christlike attitude in your behavior and actions. You will be asked to attend church meetings and serve those in need. You will also be expected to maintain chastity and abstain from harmful substances—like coffee, tea, tobacco, drugs, and alcohol.You can ask a missionary and member for advice if you aren’t sure if a certain item is considered harmful.

, You will be expected to attend worship services and meetings. When you're attending the services, listen to the messages that are taught, talk to members around you, and try to speak with the bishop/branch president or his counselors. Take notes during the services so that you can review them later., Take some time to reflect on what you have learned as an “investigator” as you draw closer to your baptism interview. Find a quiet place in your home or in a park. Reflect on what you have learned so far. If you feel the need, pray about your experience and ask for guidance on whether or not you should become a member. Ultimately, the decision is up to you.A missionary, member, or official will likely pull you aside to have a discussion with you when they think you are ready for the baptism interview.
You can also reach out to a missionary about some lingering thoughts and questions.

, You will need to have an interview before the baptism once it has been decided that you are prepared for it. The interview is typically conducted by an official Church representative. As a baptismal candidate, you will be asked if you have a heartfelt testimony of the fundamental doctrine of God. You will also be asked if you follow and will continue to follow God’s commandments as long as you live.You can review what you’ve learned, but don’t worry too much about the interview. The interview is simply meant to make sure you’re ready to be baptized and fully become a member of the Mormon church.

, If the Church representative feels that you are ready, you will be given an invitation to be baptized as a testimony to others and to God that you have accepted Jesus Christ. Baptism is one of the requirements for membership. Baptism is symbolic of the washing away of sin and rebirth, as well as eternal life. Members of the congregation will sing hymns, pray, and offer words of support during the baptism. You can invite friends and family members to witness this special event.The requirement for baptism is described in the Doctrine and Covenants.

, The confirmation will happen directly after the Sunday afternoon baptism. A Priesthood holder will lay their hands upon your head and confirm you a member of the LDS Church. You will also receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Once you are confirmed, you will be presented for acceptance and as a member in full fellowship. You are officially a member of the worldwide church in both the spiritual and physically tangible senses at this time.Being confirmed also entails that your personal information will be added to the Mormon Church's records.

, Becoming a member of the LDS Church means taking part in it. This means attending sermons and serving within the church. You could also serve by teaching Sunday school classes, organizing social activities, and coordinating emergency preparation, among other responsibilities. Serve in whatever activity you feel called to. If taking part in these activities is too much for you, simply being there for others is enough.All adults are asked at some point to serve as a home or visiting teacher. This means visiting members’ homes to ensure that they are being cared for and taught.

, Being a Mormon means having a unique cultural and ethnic identity. Not every new member of the LDS church experiences culture shock, but it is a common occurrence. Speak with other members, both new and old, about what you’re experiencing and any problems you may be having.Culture shock doesn’t mean you’ve made the wrong decision. It just means that you’re experiencing something unlike anything you’ve experienced before.

Take some time to think about what your life would look like if money was not a factor and nothing was standing in your way. Describe in writing what your relationships, work life, and environment would look like in an ideal world. This will give you some direction and purpose to help you cultivate hope.
, To get into a more hopeful state of mind, realize that your future is yours to take control of. You are in charge of deciding what you will achieve.


Think about what you want your life to be like in a year and realize that, with hard work, you are capable of making it happen., A hopeful mindset thrives on possibilities, so be aware of new opportunities that arise in your life. Exploring different options and choices increases your odds of finding fresh resources to help you achieve your goals.The best way to discover new possibilities is to be open. Try striking up a conversation with a stranger, taking a walk with no set destination, or signing up for a class about something you’ve always wanted to learn.

, Setting achievable, time-bound, and specific goals can help you become more hopeful by giving you a positive future to look forward to. Imagine yourself achieving your goal in as much detail as you can, and think about the different routes you can take to get there.For example, if you are interested in traveling around the world, you might set a goal to save the money for a plane ticket and other necessities. Then, to get you inspired to work towards the goal on a daily basis, you might imagine, in vivid detail, yourself arriving at your first destination. Think about the sights, sounds, and smells you will encounter to make it seem as real as possible.
Write your goals down to help make them more concrete and read over them daily to remind yourself what you are working towards.

, It’s true that laughter is the best medicine – researchers have found that a daily dose of humor can help people feel more optimistic about the future. Humor inhibits negative thoughts while stimulating positive emotions, which encourages a hopeful state of mind. Watch a comedy or YouTube video. Spend extra time with that silly classmate of yours. Or, offer to babysit your five-year-old nephew.
See if there is a laughing group in your city. These are groups that meet for the purpose of having a laugh.

, Thinking about the things you’re grateful for is a powerful way to maintain a hopeful state of mind, even when you’re dealing with difficult circumstances. By focusing on the positive things in your life, no matter how small or large they are, you prime your mind to seek out more positive events and stay optimistic.To make gratitude a habit, try keeping a gratitude journal. Every night before you go to bed, take a few minutes to write down several things you felt thankful for that day.
You can also use a phone app to help remind you to add to your gratitude journal daily.

, Cognitive distortions are negative or unrealistic thought patterns that can keep you feeling stressed or depressed. Your mind perceives reality in a distorted manner, leading to rumination or persistent obsessing over negative events or experiences. There are many cognitive distortions recognized in popular psychology. Some are listed below.All-or-nothing, or black-and-white thinking- seeing everything in absolutes, either this or that no in-between (e.g. ""If they do not love me, they must hate me."")
Emotional reasoning- attaching your reality to your current emotional state (e.g. ""I feel crappy today, so no one will want to be around me."")
Labeling- identifying shortcomings excessively (e.g. ""I'm a loser."")
Jumping to conclusions- either mind-reading or predicting a negative future by fortune-telling (e.g. ""I saw Chelsea today and she didn't speak to me. She must not be my friend anymore"" or ""I already know I will make myself look like a fool at the talent show."")
Magnification- blowing things out of proportion (e.g. ""I made an F on my English paper. I'm going to fail the class and have to take it over again."")
Should statements- using ""should,"" ""ought to,"" ""have to,"" or ""must"" in your self-talk (e.g. ""I should have known better than to think he liked me."")

, One you learn what cognitive distortions are and how to identify them, you need to learn how to attack their logic. Doing this gives you power over your thoughts and teaches you to become a constant observer of what's going through your head. If you notice yourself playing into negative thought patterns, try the following strategies:Start by examining the accuracy of your thoughts. For example, you say ""No one likes me."" You need to pay attention to see if this seems accurate or not in your life.
Consider the evidence. Are you always alone? Do people purposely try to be with you sometimes? Do your friends and family ever comment about how they enjoy your company?
Practice mindfulness. It's no fun to beat yourself about your thoughts. When you notice yourself thinking negatively or unrealistically, practice deep breathing and mindfulness. Inhale the positive; exhale the negative. Notice the cognitive distortions, but think of them as ships coming into your harbor. Steer away the negative and allow the positive to safely dock.

, Realistic hope involves taking steps to achieve the goals you want, instead of just waiting for good things to happen to you. Research has found that people who take responsibility for their choices and believe in their own self-control tend to do better at overcoming their difficulties.Taking responsibility for yourself doesn’t mean trying to control every aspect of your life. Rather, it means taking responsibility for your choices, while accepting that some things are outside your control.

, Being realistic means becoming aware of your own biases, flaws, and internal assumptions. Having a clear-eyed view of yourself can help you decide which traits and beliefs are helping you and which ones you need to change.However, make sure that you do not compare yourself to other people. Just stay focused on yourself.


Ask yourself which beliefs, either conscious or unconscious, you hold about the world. Are these thought patterns helping you or bringing you down? For example, maybe you have come to believe that people are incapable of fidelity because your last partner cheated on you. How is this helping you? Will it be a positive contribution to your future relationships? No, it won’t.
If you need help coming up with an objective judgment of your personality, ask a trusted friend for their perspective on your flaws and positive traits. Friends can help you to see yourself objectively and point out things you might not notice.

, A good understanding of the reality of a situation – whether positive or negative – is necessary for an accurate outlook on life. When you’re sizing up your current circumstances, don’t shy away from noticing the bad as well as the good. It’s important to take negative situations into account so you can decide to change them or work around them., Laying out a concrete, workable plan is the surest way to make sure your goals become realities. Plans don’t have to be complex to be effective. However, a good plan should include a “when” component and a “where” component. Planning when and where you’ll do an activity makes you far more likely to follow through on your commitment.For instance, instead of telling yourself “I’ll study later tonight,” tell yourself, “I’ll study at the library at seven o’clock tonight.”
A great strategy to make habits stick is the ""if-then"" planning method. Put simply, this method states that ""if X happens, then Y should follow."" X can be a time, place, or event. Y is the action you will take in response to it. For instance, if it's Monday at 7pm (X), you know that you should spend 2 hours at your university library (Y). Research shows that you are 2 to 3 times more likely to succeed at your goals by following this method., Keep in mind that life is not a straight upward curve. It often includes many setbacks along the way. Your success or failure has a lot to do with the way you handle setbacks. People who assume they will encounter obstacles and make plans to overcome them tend to be much more successful than people who assume success will come to them easily.It isn’t pessimistic to assume things will go wrong – it’s simply realistic. Things do, in fact, go wrong all the time, often for reasons beyond our control. Pessimism assumes that obstacles are insurmountable, while realistic optimism finds ways around them.

, If your expectations are unrealistic, then this may cause you to feel disappointed sometimes. Consider whether or not your expectations for yourself are realistic, and if they are not, then consider how you might adjust them to be more realistic.

For example, if you always expect to get A+ grades on every test you take, then you might feel incredibly disappointed if you get an A- on a test. However, this is still a great grade, so you might want to adjust your expectations to accept a wider range of grades.

, Pessimism tends to come from negative beliefs or thought patterns. When you’re feeling pessimistic, take a step back from your emotions and think about where your feelings are coming from.If you find that you’re holding onto self-defeating ideas or a negative self-image, remind yourself that these ideas aren’t rational and they don’t have to hold you back.
Make sure that you are surrounding yourself with optimistic people as well. You can meet new like-minded people by searching for groups on sites like Meetup.com.

, When you start having pessimistic thoughts, ask yourself, “Is this really true?” Often you’ll find that pessimism is driven by emotions that don’t have much to do with reality. Maintaining a rational mindset can help you see these thoughts for the illusions they are.For instance, if you have the pessimistic feeling that one of your coworkers doesn’t like you, instead of dwelling on the thought, ask yourself why you think that. Is there a more likely explanation? Perhaps your coworker is having a bad day, or they simply have a gruff demeanor.

, When you’re feeling pessimistic, it’s easy to see all the negative in your life and forget to look at the positive. Remind yourself of the good things you’ve achieved in the past to guide yourself back into a better state of mind.As much as you need to, bring to mind all the accomplishments you have achieved and all the obstacles you have already overcome in your life. Pay yourself on the back for graduating college. Give yourself a round of applause for finally detaching from your toxic best friend.

, All-or-nothing thinking can easily put you in a negative state of mind because it views any mistake, even a minor one, as a failure. In reality, no one and nothing is perfect.


For example, all-or-nothing thinkers may view others as “either you love me or you hate me,” when, in truth, it’s entirely possible to love someone but not like all their habits or qualities.
Identify areas of your thinking that match this framework and challenge how realistic they sound. Let go of all-or-nothing thinking by focusing on making progress instead of being perfect. Commit to improving on your mistakes while taking your successes into account, too.Also, be willing to let go of control sometimes and accept that life is unpredictable and uncertain.

, Feeling alone and unsupported can be a major trigger for pessimistic thoughts. If you’ve been feeling down or negative, reach out to someone else – a family member, a friend, a coworker – who can help you get back into a positive frame of mind.


Social support is a powerful tool for boosting your hope and optimism, so don’t hesitate to ask others for help when you need it.Doing something as simple as calling a friend and saying “Hey, I’ve been feeling down lately, do you have a minute to chat?” can work wonders for your state of mind.
If you are constantly feeling pessimistic, then consider seeing a mental health professional to help you with this.

If you don’t go to one of these colleges, you can try to take a few classes or go to campus events to meet someone to potentially date., You can find an LDS church near you and attend a worship service. You might run into someone you like or see flyers with information on dances or other events you could attend to meet someone., Visit an online dating site specifically geared toward Mormons (such as LDS Singles and LDS Planet). Make sure to use a recent photo of you in modest clothing. If you are not Mormon make sure to clearly state that in your profile., Some areas (especially in the Western United States) have very large singles conferences. Sometimes people even come from miles away to attend them. These big events are a good way to meet people who are Mormon., You can visit your local chapter of the BYU Management Society to try to meet someone. You can look up information online to find the nearest chapter to you. There will be many married people at these events who could introduce you to someone they know or you might meet single people at the events too., Members of The Church of Latter-day Saints are not allowed to date until they are 16. If the person you are interested in is under 16, they are not likely going to date you. Keep in mind that once a person turns 16, it does not mean they are necessarily going to want to date. When they are allowed to date, it is encouraged that it is casual only and not serious, such as dating as friends or in groups., They're not allowed to drink alcoholic beverages, coffee, tea, smoking of any kind, and use illegal and illicit drugs. If these are things you enjoy doing, don't consider dating a Mormon., They only believe sexual relations are okay after you are married and only with your husband or wife. The law of chastity also includes not passionately kissing, not lying on top of another person, and not touching private parts of another person’s body. Arousing sexual emotions in any way before marriage is not allowed.


The law of chastity also includes dressing and speaking about chastity appropriately.
Viewing pornography or even watching movies with nudity is not allowed., While these are the guidelines of The Church of Latter-day Saints, everyone is different. Don’t just assume something about someone because of their religion. Let them open up to you about what their personal beliefs and choices are.

, If you are not Mormon, you might not understand certain reasons the person you like does certain things. It is okay to not understand everything about their religion, but be open-minded to their ideas and beliefs. Ask them questions about their religion and keep an unbiased, open mind.


You could ask something like, “What are your personal beliefs on your religion?” or “What are your opinions on chastity?”

, If you don’t agree with what the person you like believes, that is okay. However, it is still important to respect their beliefs, even if you don’t agree. Don’t pressure them into doing something against their beliefs and don’t judge them for what they believe. Accept them for who they are.


If your partner does not want to get intimate, respect that and don’t pressure them.
If your partner does things that you don’t understand, such as pray, don’t judge them or try to stop them.

, You don’t have to change who you are to get someone to like you, but consider keeping your clothing modest when you are with the person you are interested in. Dressing appropriately is part of the “law of chastity.” Wearing modest clothing is a way to show them that you respect their beliefs.It is especially important to dress appropriately if you meet their parents.

, Many Mormons go on missions when they are around 18 or 19 and are gone for 18 months for women and two years for men. They go somewhere and serve wherever the Church calls them to go.If the person you are interested in plans on going on a mission, they might be putting off serious dating until they get back. Learn if the person you are interested in is planning on going on a mission and keep that in mind if you are interested in them., If you want to pursue the person you are interested in who is Mormon, and they seem interested in you back, take them on a date! Avoid bars and ""loud""dance halls. Instead, take the person you like to the movies, dinner, on a hike, to the beach, sports events, and anything else the two of you like."

Keep learning.",How to Learn More About the Mormon Church," Just as you would not spend your life savings on the first house that 'looked good', you wouldn't want to spend your life in a religion or belief system in which you haven't fully investigated. This means not only talking to those currently in the faith, but those who have left as well. Find out why people have both good things to say and why people have bad things to say about it. The LDS church is as much a culture as it is a belief system, one which does require significant life changes in order to practice.;
, Stop listening to what those who claim to have information about revealing the truth about Mormonism have to say about it. Most often, what they say is grossly inaccurate.

, Find a member of the Mormon Church or a pair of Mormon missionaries and ask them to share with you what their beliefs are. Take the time to honestly and completely understand what they are saying; don't just assume you understand or leap to a conclusion based on one conversation.

, If you aren't sure you understand or if something sounds strange, ask about it. Remember that the person you are talking to is likely an intelligent, hard-working person who has probably asked him or herself the same question. Give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they really understand what they believe and give them a chance to explain it fully.

, Just as you cannot fully explain Quantum physics to someone who doesn't know anything about math or basic physics, you cannot understand LDS (Mormon) teachings about heaven or temple ceremonies until you understand what Mormons believe about God and Jesus Christ. Be patient and make sure you fully understand these fundamental teachings; don't just assume you know them. This may seem difficult since most people want to learn about the things they think are weird or strange (such as temple ceremonies, the Church's connection to polygamy, etc.). You cannot understand the big ideas until you understand the basic ideas like God, prophets, prayer, scriptures, and so on.

, Imagine someone was trying to learn what you believed. How would you feel if that person tried to tell you what you believed? How would you feel if they immediately concluded that your beliefs were crazy because they could not understand them? Allow for some time and try to understand how Mormon teachings could make sense to someone, rather than just assuming that they are crazy. Try to understand their beliefs just like you would want someone to try to understand yours. Once you have asked someone about their faith in Mormonism, listen carefully to what they say. If you feel they did not answer your question or if you did not understand their response, let them know. No doubt, they will be happy to clarify their response.

, Everything that Mormons believe is available in books. Mormon scripture includes the Book of Mormon (a history of the people in the Americas at the same period of time as the Bible,) the Doctrine and Covenants (additional teachings and revelations from Church leaders), Pearl of Great Price (a collection of short writings and translations from Joseph Smith), and the Bible (King James Version).

, By attending church you can see how the teachings of Mormonism are used by its members in their everyday lives. To attend church services first locate the nearest Mormon chapel and learn what time they begin. Dress in clean clothing. For men, this might mean suit pants with a dress shirt, and a tie if you can. Women should wear a dress or a blouse and skirt, preferably covering the knees and shoulders. Arrive ten or so minutes early so you can find a seat and chat quietly with the local members.

, Even life-long members of the LDS Church are always learning and striving. Never assume you know it all. Think about what you read, what you're told, and what you see. No Church member should want you to take everything at face value or force you to agree with their beliefs. Their goal is to help you come to your own conclusions.

Reflect on what you honestly believe, and consider other faiths and world views.,
Become a truth magnet.,
If you cannot embrace another religion, keep the faith you have--attend church.,
Forgive.,
Look upward.,
Communicate.,
Realize that you are not alone (though it feels that way).,
Retain active remembrance of identity.",How to Cope As an Excommunicated Latter Day Saint," Rather than wallow in self-pity over your rejection by the Mormon church, consider the options that are available to you from other religions or belief systems, ones that have not (yet) excommunicated you. There are over twenty major world religions in the world, most of which contain dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of sects; and there are many smaller faiths. You could find another religion which worships the same god under different rituals, or you could find another god or gods entirely, or a religion with none at all. However, if you truly believe the LDS faith to be true, hold to that faith. It may take time, but you can eventually be re-baptized and return to full membership.;
, Rather than lament the loss of spiritual and social practices which seem vital to your way of life, remember that the seeking of truth is at the core of Church principles (and life). This seeking never ends, whatever one's religious status/membership. Walking away from a Church disciplinary council does not change that your ability to know truth. Opening the envelope containing the letter that officially declares you are no longer a member of the church, delineating denied access to heretofore sacred ordinances of worship, does not take away your power of inner direction and choice. This is the time to embrace fully the scriptural declarative, ""Know the truth and the truth shall set you free."" If depression seems to sap the strength for the search, merely the desire for truth will allow it to find the seeker. This, in turn, will fuel those ""gut feelings"" of intuitive, functional understanding so vital, now that religious habits and opportunities seem mind and heart-numbingly void.

, Church leadership--yes, the very folks who decreed the excommunication status--almost without exception urge the ""wayward soul"" to keep coming to church. A seasoned Latter-Day Saint ecclesiastical leader (an experienced Stake President) confessed to an excommunicated Saint (a former Mormon Church member) that he has often envied the excommunicated members who ""come back"" (are re-baptized into church membership again later). ""They seem to know something the rest of us don't. They have a deeper, more profound understanding of something Godly than I am able to grasp. Their experience has somehow enhanced, not diminished, their faith.""

, Employ forgiveness at all times, in all situations, and with all people; begin with yourself. Sincere, deep forgiveness is practical power available to everyone through desire. If the very being whom the Church takes its name from (Jesus Christ) can look down from the torture instrument from whence he hung, bodily life ebbing away, and forgive his tormentors, then this must be the greatest truth of all--forgiveness heals categorically. After all, his own death was not lasting, and countless stories (in art and life) through all cultures, religions and generations attest to the power of forgiveness. Deep, often overwhelming hurt may attend an excommunicant. The might of forgiveness is the only sure healing balm for that hurting. (Study atonement teachings.)

, An almost unknown teacher of teachers during the Civil War era, Emma Curtis Hopkins, remained constant in exhorting her pupils regarding truth, God and healing. ""Look up,"" she said, meaning it literally, inwardly, religiously and philosophically. Even equations of quantum physics now appear to point scientifically to the literal power of our thinking to create our world. Stop blaming God, a neighbor, a former spouse, the boss, the church, a rock in the path or even yourself for woe and ""look up.""

, After excommunication is no time to stop talking with God. Meanwhile, meet regularly with the congregational (ward) spiritual leader (the Bishop) and, if desired, a higher church authority (the stake president). Whether God or man, convey in honesty; Do not hold back. Like you, church leaders are also enlisted in truth seeking, which is not limited to scripture study, prayer and church/temple going, but found in dedicated service to their fellow brothers and sisters--regardless of church status. Obligation to growth in yourself is discovered through a trust in others' too. These religious leaders' obligation to one seeking counsel with or from them is guided by a profound charter: love, abiding in paramount respect for one's freedom to choose.

, Ask the bishop if an appropriate church sponsored confidential 12-step-like program exists in the area. If so, the atmosphere and conviviality may resonate with you. If none exist, speaking in confidence to someone who is known to have gone ""successfully"" through the disciplinary processes of excommunication may help. If a woman, spiritual leaders may recommend confiding in the congregation's Relief Society president. Either gender might arrange for an appointment with a professional Church Family Services Counselor (a nominal fee may apply). Remaining silent with nary a trusted human to share your despair and/or anger is to risk further self-destructive despair and anger. Excommunication can feel tragic enough while in the experience. It can readily be compounded by further tragedy if feeling utterly abandoned, isolated, or guilt-ridden. Turn to inspired, comforting sources of care and understanding in humanity as well as deity.

, As a child of God, as one who is of Deity and will be Deity, as one who has a Home on High and will one day return to that Home, create thoughts from that pureness of identity. Make this a moment-to-moment thing through desire. Place on the mirror the following: ""I am an immortal spirit. I have been created in the image of God. I am His child, and He loves me."" Read this first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Also, meditate morning and night for just a few minutes in the feeling of gratitude in the heart. Make it a wordless feeling. Roll that feeling (literally heart-felt) into the desire to be aware/experience God's Love while offering Love to God/Heavenly Father. Rest in this. Literally, and heart felt, rest in this feeling/sensation within. This is the surest way to remember deep within true identity that has nothing whatsoever to do with time, space and earth travails. This is perhaps the most powerful step in overcoming what is seeming anguish, loss and disorientation while seemingly on this planet earth.

Make sure there are plenty of signs that direct people to where they need to go for services, offices, childcare and parking. Keep the grounds and the buildings clean and presentable.;
, When a new member joins the church, a letter from the pastor or a welcoming committee is a good way to make them feel supported and welcomed. The letter can express the church's gratitude that they have joined, and provide helpful information on who to contact for which needs, service times, special events and other announcements.

, Always be intentional about saying hello and goodbye when new members come to services or events. Greeters and ushers should wear name tags and be prepared to help or answer questions. Escort them to where they need to go the first couple of times, rather than simply pointing out places or giving verbal directions. That personal and attentive touch will make a difference to new members.

, Becoming involved will help new members feel welcome. Find out about interests and secular activities, and offer to match them with different church groups and ministries.

, Be sure your newcomers are familiar with the social calendar at your church. Fill them in on the regular get-togethers as well as special occasions. Let them know when childcare is provided so they do not feel prohibited from joining events if they have kids.

, Keeping the worship service easy for a new member to follow will help them feel welcome. Print the words to all songs and prayers, and verbally welcome new members and visitors at the beginning or end of the service.

, Contact your new church members a few days after they join to find out if there is anything they need. Use the contact information they provided the church to call them or send them an email. If they did not provide a phone number or email address, send a letter. Ask for feedback on the service, the pastors, and their first impressions of the church. Some people are more comfortable providing truthful information anonymously, so consider using a survey and asking them to complete it.

Last but never the least, give God all glory.",How to Give a Sermon in Church," Nothing is better than having a conversation with God to know what exactly the audience want to hear or want in their lives. It is better, if you ask God for guidance, than to take any random topic, and speak anything and everything. Be it a 5 minute sermon or a sermon that goes beyond an hour, you need to be specific about the topic (unless the Holy Spirit guides you in a different way).;
, Sticky notes help a lot, especially if you have a tendency to become nervous and blank on the stage. You can use a reference Bible for this preparation.

, Check and re-check whether your sermon is to-the-point and whether the Bible verses match your points.

, That does not mean you mug up the speech that you have prepared, but practice so that you know where you stand. Use a mirror, if possible and watch your gestures, actions, facial expressions and listen to your voice modulation. These are very important while giving sermons.

, The examples should be relevant to the topic. Not everyone likes listening to a preachy person. Bring in some humor, plan stories before-hand instead of making personal references or situational jokes on the stage.

, A short word of prayer before starting is essential - that God uses you, that the crowd receives what they really need.

, No matter how terribly nervous you are, you gotta look and sound like the experienced one. Be firm, being sure of what you say. In the Bible, Satan seeks to instill fear, to cause timidity, tempt, snare, injure and generally cause problems (No, he can not kill the soul.) -- as he does go around ""as a roaring lion seeking whom He 'may' devour"" -- such as lead off astray into a wasted life, for example.
Avoid letting simple embarrassment, timidity, or fear limit your effort and keep you from your success. Minor and even major difficulties shall be overcome. You can succeed in all kinds of things.

, Do not over-do the intro part. That could be boring. You can also pray while on the stage.

, Make sure you add some dollops of humor here and there. Don't overdo it either. Your aim is not to make them laugh, but to make them think while they laugh.

, Do not sound bossy or rude, giving Bible verses for your inspirations. Do not sound judgmental or proud. This is a huge turn-off. Do not boast of your knowledge or wisdom. Boast in the Lord, admit that you are not the judge or final authority. You might be one of the most sought-after persons out there, but people won't like your claiming it. Speak rather simply, being humble.

, Simply quoting or reading verses won't help the understanding.

, You don't want to be standing there stiff and preaching. Move around the stage (not too much either). Use actions appropriately. Engage in some voice modulation. These things should happen spontaneously and should not look like acting or made up.

, No matter whether its your first time or second time, make sure you look at the audience while speaking. You are not standing there to preach to the walls or air! Make unobtrusive eye-contact with the audience, not staring, or look briefly at hair or foreheads, just over the heads. Smile occasionally.

, If you have been given a specific amount of time to give a sermon, make sure you make concluding statements at least 3-5 minutes prior to the dead-line. Do not stop too early or too late. Keep a regular check on the time. Do not use too many or long stories, if you have very limited time.

, Whatever you say should come inspired by the Holy Spirit -- and not your intellectual lecture or rambling. If you are unsure about something then don't say it. Try not to use fantasy/imaginations while speaking. Sound genuine. Sound real. Avoid much slang, but don't sound too formal either. Your dressing should be appropriate too. Standing there on the stage wearing tee shirt and bluejeans or shorts looks awkward and not everyone can digest it.

, You are standing there to glorify Christ. Make that your goal, your priority. Whether people recognize your or not, they should recognize Christ. Also practice whatever you preach. If you say do not lie, you must make sure that you are honest. Have a testimony of good reputation among the believers. That would give you more attention and respect. But the ultimate honor only goes to Christ.

Don't start to date until you are ready to get married.,

, Build dating standards that can work through that kind of restraint


Sex can include a lot of things besides just intercourse. Some know that sex before marriage should be off limits, but others do not. You have to work on getting agreement on waiting until marriage.
If you did have sex with multiple people before marriage, it would kind of deaden pieces of your heart. Every time you have sex with someone you are cleaving to the other like sealing your situation in an envelope. The Bible describes this as the two becoming one. When you split up with the person it is like ripping that envelope open, which represents breaking your heart.
Eventually, your heart becomes so scarred from love that was lost that it is hard to feel anymore. If you want your someday marriage to be full of life and beauty, don't have sex, or do anything else that arouses passion, with anyone until you are married. Then sex will be a bonding experience made special by marriage.

, The longer you are together, the harder it will be to break up. Also, the longer you stay together, the more of an imprint this can have on your heart, which will make it harder to forget and heal later.


Keep your relationships before marriage short. For most people, it takes about two months to be able to tell whether someone is the one or not. If you really don't think so after that time, end the relationship.

,


Go out to dinner or to the movies, but never be alone with that person. In general, meeting at the restaurant or movies rather than driving together there would head off getting physically attracted. This will greatly save you from temptation.

, You never know, there might be only one thing of interest, and not marriage. Don't let a date into your heart until there is proof of worthiness. Don't wear your heart on your sleeve, so to speak. Don't be easily affected by your date too soon, keep your heart on reserve for the right one.

, Say what is okay and what is not. And don't let yourself fantasize or think longingly too much when you are not with him or her. Guard your thought life.

, Those may cause you to get ""swept away"" by infatuation or charms of life.


Always keep both feet on the ground. Romantic movies have a way of painting love in a very unrealistic way. In the movies, it always works out and it is almost always wonderful. In life, dating is not always wonderful and most of the time it does not work out. Stay in reality, not in fantasy.

, Have your date over for a family dinner. Invite your date to come to church with you and your parents, to measure how that fits.


Ask for advice from people in your church or mentors on what you should do in regards to the relationship. If your parents don't like the person, listen to their reasoning.
One of the greatest commandments is ""honor your mother and father, that it may go well with you and that you may live long on the earth."" Your parents have been around the block a few more times than you and they know what they are talking about. Listen to them. They aren't trying to spoil your fun, they are really trying to protect you.

, It is too difficult to date too long.


Don't be overly concerned about wedding plans, etc. The longer you stretch out the engagement, the harder it is to guard your heart and live in a pure way.
Also, many times long engagements are broken off. Get married as quickly as possible, if you have both decided that is for sure what you want and thus avoid the pressure of time.

Go over this short ""checklist"" to make sure that you are truly saved:


Are you aware that God became flesh in the person of Jesus Christ
(John 1:14), and that he died for the sins of the world?,
Next, do these to save you from pain:


Feed on the Word Daily - Each day, find somewhere quiet, and thoroughly soak your soul in the Word of God.",How to Grow As a Christian,"
Did you come to the Savior because you had sinned and needed forgiveness?
Did you""repent"" (say sorry and decide to turn away from your sin) and put your faith in Jesus?
Are you convinced that He suffered and died on the Cross and that He rose again three days later?
Have you been born again of the water and of the Spirit?(John3:3-5)
Are you willing to do the will of God as revealed through the scriptures (Matt. vii.21-27, James ii.18-20)?;
, In Romans 12:2 the Believer is told to do something with his mind.
Faith - In a world where we are continually disappointed, we can totally rely on, trust in, and count on His promises. They are sure, certain, indisputable, true, trustworthy, reliable, faithful, unfailing, dependable, steadfast, and an anchor for the soul. In other words, you can truly believe them, and because of that, you can throw yourself blindfolded and without reserve, into His mighty hands. He will never, ever, let you down, if you put your trust in him.
Evangelism - We should share our faith with others whenever we can. The Bible says that there are two times we should do this -- ""in season and out of season"" (2 Timothy 4:2). i.e. at all times. Jesus did not send out the disciples for about a year and a half to do evangelistic work, so don't feel bad if you find this difficult at first. Even Paul in Galatians 1 said that he retreated for 3 years before he started to teach. Paul also said in Galatians 2:1 that he worked in the early church 14 years before being sent as a missionary to Europe. Learning to witness will take time and you will get better and better as you study Gods word and practice witnessing. In John 4 Jesus says that one sows and another reaps. Sharing the word is sowing, and motivating others to pray with your and accept Christ is reaping.
Prayer - As far as God is concerned, if you belong to Jesus, you are a VIP. You can boldly come before the throne of Grace (Hebrews 4:16). You have access to the king, because you are the son or daughter of the king.
Pray in the Spirit regularly to build up your faith (Jude 20)
Spiritual Warfare - The way to overcome and his demons is to make sure you are outfitted with the spiritual armor of God listed in Ephesians 6:10-20. Become intimately familiar with it. Sleep in it. Never take it off. Bind the two-edged sword to your hand so that you never lose its grip. Jesus resisted the Devil with the Word of God.
Fellowship - Don't become a ""spiritual butterfly."" Send your roots down. If you are moving from church to church, how will your pastor know what type of food you are digesting? The Bible says that your shepherd will have to give an account to Him that has entrusted you to him (Hebrews 13:17), so make yourself known to your pastor. Pray for him regularly. Pray also for his wife, his family, and the elders.
Give Thanks - We have so much to be thankful for. God has given us ""exceeding great and precious promises"" that are ""more to be desired than gold."" Do yourself a big favor -- believe those promises, thank God continually for them, and ""let your joy be full."" II Cor 1:20 says that all the Old Testament promises also belong to you.
Water Baptism - The Bible Says , ""Repent and be baptised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. . ."" (Acts 2:38). There is therefore no question as to whether or not you should be baptized.
Giving to God - It was once said that the wallet is the ""last frontier""-- that it’s the last thing that comes to God in surrender. But it should be the first, along with our surrendered heart. Jesus spoke much about money. He said that we cannot serve God and mammon (see Matthew 6:24). The word ""mammon"" was the common Aramaic word for riches and it signifies ""that which is to be trusted."" In other words, either money is our source of joy, our sense of security, the supplier of our needs -- or God is.
Troubleshooting - Finally, the way to prevent sporting injury and pain, is to keep yourself fit. Exercise. The Apostle Paul kept fit through exercise. He said, ""Herein do I exercise myself, to always have a conscience void of offense toward God, and toward men"" (Acts 24:16). Do the same. Listen to the voice of conscience. It's your friend, not your enemy. Remember the words of Solomon: ""Fear God and keep His commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil"" (Ecclesiastes 12:13-14).
Better Covenant and Better Promises - Hebrews 8:6 says that you have a better covenant established upon better promises. YOU must get stronger in the Word of God to be strong. I John 2:27 says that the anointing that you have within you will teach you. God will teach you as you read His Word.
Learn how to follow your Conscience - Paul said that he always followed his conscience in Acts 23:1. Paul also said that Christians can expect to be led by the spirit of God in Romans 8:14. He goes on to say that the *Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit in Romans 8:16. In Acts 16:6-7 Paul had a warning experience in his conscience. This I call the ""Red Light"" experience. Paul also perceived that the voyage would be with much damage in Acts 27:10. When God is silent and I do not have any witness in my conscience, I call this the ""Yellow Light"" experience and this means ""Wait"", it is not God's will or it is not God's timing. The ""Green Light"" experience is when I am witnessing or praying and I feel God's presence or I feel peace inside or I feel joy inside. This is God telling my conscience, ""Yes"" this is His will.

Get right with God.,
Pray something like this: Dear Jesus, I know and believe that You came to Earth and died on the cross for my sins.,
Surrender your life to God.,
Talk to Him often (i.e.,
Even when trials, temptations, and persecution come to you (because you belong to Jesus) nothing will be too great for you to overcome with the help of the Lord.",How to Go to a Higher Place Through Jesus," John 15:3, ""Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken to you."" Titus3:5-6 ""Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;"";
, I know that I've sinned in my life Lord and I need Your forgiveness. Please forgive me and use me for your purposes on Earth. Amen.

, If you turned to Jesus for forgiveness then his blood has purchased you and he owns you. Live for him as a faithful servant/slave according to the Bible. He gave it to us to know how to live for Him and how to live in this world.

, prayer). This is the most important in your fellowship and relationship with Him. Don't be afraid to ask Him questions at any time of day or night. He is always there to lead you in the right direction if you ask Him to. Christians talk to God more than their significant other, more than their closest friends, and more than their children.

, And if you yield your life to Him as the Apostles and all the faithful Christian martyrs have, then so be it; You will go and be with the Lord eternally, as well as the believers who have gone on before you. Praise God in all things!

If asked about your beliefs, say that Jesus Christ is your Lord and savior, and that you trust Him for ""salvation by grace, through faith, not by works or good deeds you are to do"".
, There is singing of worship songs, a few hymns and listening to a sermon. It is not about reciting sermons, written prayers and going on with business. This church involves personal spiritual and emotional growth, and giving , not necessarily financially, but getting involved in a fellowship which promotes learning, growing, healing and restoration.

, Ask around for a church. Look for church signs, look online, or in the phone book for a church that calls themselves charismatic, or evangelical, some are called Pentecostal. It may be difficult to find in a phone book, so try getting references from contacts.


When you find the church that appeals to you, no need to call the pastor and introduce yourself. If you do, he might ask why you want to attend this sort of church and how you came to find God.







, Friendly members will be happy to see a new face, so politely introduce yourself to someone who greets you, and tell them that you are currently searching for a new church. It takes more than one session to know if this is your church, so don't feel that you should join that church immediately.

, By introducing yourself to members, forming mutual attachments, and going to the external activities, people will know that you intend to stay. In a very small church the pastor may agree to pay a visit to your home.

, Ask to join and you can. Some churches have lessons, or training, but it is usually very informal, up to you;., People will definitely ask you why or how you came to find Christ. Tell them the truth, if it seeking God was say to overcome an addiction or spiritual ordeal just let them know. As you get to know members you will discover that they also have undergone similar experiences and emotions as you have. Evangelical churches are open to hear people's testimonies.

, You can commit to any activity you want, such as sharing Bible studies, youth groups, healing-prayer groups, old people groups, alpha courses, choir, music, whatever suits you. Cooperate in such a way as to know and grow with others.

, You will want to if you genuinely like the church then you've found home!

,
Write notes to your friend and/or text a buddy.

,
Pay attention!,Sit with your friends, even if you're older or a teen, sitting with your friends makes it more fun and meaningful.,
Research and investigate what it is like to live in another country as a Christian, compare it and/or think about how different it is to your usual life.,
Think of something that you can relate to in the lesson and make the gospel your prayer, and think of ways you can progress in your knowledge or abilities to save non-believers.

",How to Pass Time in Church," This way you get the spiritual blessing even if the sermon/homily is dull.


Even if you're not spiritual (but have to go to church out of respect for your family, etc), the Bible does have some interesting historical aspects to it, especially if it's an abridged/modernized language version. There are plenty of very engaging sections related to war, betrayal, etc.;
, Is there someone new in church today that you could make friends with?

, As in... Draw pictures. You may want to take a small blank page diary to church for this purpose. (You could draw on the church bulletin, but please do not draw in a songbook or on the offering envelopes.)

, A small notebook will do nicely for this purpose, and you have the dual benefit of being able to remember the sermon later.

,, Be aware that you will need to do any paper cutting in advance, as scissors make noise when you cut paper. Some ""church crafts"" that might be appropriate are:



Ribbon Bookmarks. These are quiet, easy to make, and don't take long, so if the sermon gets interesting, you can just quietly put it away.

Jute Jewelry. This is another quiet craft that can be easily stowed in your purse.

Origami. The only caution here is to do any paper cutting in advance and take care when folding not to crinkle the paper. (makes noise)

, You can use the excuse of amusing the child / keeping the child quiet to play with the child and the felt set!,,, You can learn a lot from a minister/preacher and that can help you in your walk with the Lord. A great use of time would be to write notes in a notebook about the sermon, or you can highlight verses in your Bible. It makes it easier to find key verses!

,, This enables you to understand that going to Church in some countries is nearly impossible, or is simply unheard of and you will begin to understand just how blessed you are in your life.

Recite the Novena to the Sacred Heart.,
Use the Novena to the Infant of Prague.",How to Pray a Novena," A novena is a form of Catholic prayer. Those praying a novena recite a specific prayer or a series of specific prayers with a certain request or intention in mind. This practice continues over the course of nine days or nine hours.;
, A novena is not a magic spell. In other words, praying a novena does not guarantee that a miracle will occur, and the mere words of your chosen novena do not hold any set power alone. It is the act of devotion you display by praying a novena that has spiritual significance.


Understand what a novena is. The Catholic Catechism even warns against acts of superstition. When a practice or the performance of that practice is deemed magical in some manner, the individual viewing it as such is only looking at the external aspect of it, not its deeper spiritual significance. Novenas are among those acts that have deep spiritual significance but are commonly treated as superstition.Trust God. When you pray your novena, say the prayers with faith in God and trust that God will give you the right answer in the right way. Do not pray a novena in the hopes of manipulating God into an answer.

, After Jesus ascended to Heaven, Mary, the Apostles, and other devoted disciples prayed constantly for nine days until Pentecost Sunday. Catholics looked to this example and, from it, derived the practice of praying nine-day novenas.Count. The word ""novena"" comes from the Latin word for ""nine,"" hence the consecutive set of nine prayers.

, As noted already, a novena is not a magic spell that will answer all your needs and wants. Nonetheless, there are spiritual benefits that can be derived from reciting a novena, and these benefits should not be overlooked.


Praise God. Novenas, like all prayers, are a means of praising God.
Express. The novena structure also provides a unique channel to express strong spiritual wants, needs, or sentiments.
Connect. Novenas spoken as a Church family also keep the individual believer connected to the Christian community.

, Most novenas can be classified within one or more of four categories: mourning, preparation, prayer, and indulgence. Some novenas may fall into more than one category.Anticipate. Novenas in the mourning category are said in anticipation of a burial or for similar periods of mourning. The prayers are often recited for the sake of the individual who has passed (when applicable) or for the comfort of those grieving.
Prepare. Preparation novenas are said in anticipation of a Church feast day, Sacrament, or similar spiritual event. The purpose is to prepare the soul for the significance of that day.
Plea. Novenas of the prayer category, also known as the ""petition"" category, are among the most common. These novenas are pleas to God asking for intervention, signs, or other help.
Pray. Indulgence novenas are those prayed for the remission of sins. In other words, these novenas are prayed as an act of penance for previous wrongdoings. Usually, these novenas are done in conjunction with the Sacrament of Confession and church attendance.

, As previously noted, novenas are prayers recited with a specific intention in mind. Before you begin your novena, get a clear idea of the intention for which you are praying your novena.


Analyze your intention. Your intention might be an earnest prayer for direction when you reach a crossroads in your life, or it could be something as simple as an expression of great joy or great sorrow.
Focus. Regardless of what your intention is, you will need to keep it in the center of your thoughts throughout the novena period, even when you are not actively praying.

, Since novenas are an act of devotion, reciting them while performing other spiritually significant acts of sacrifice and devotion can further emphasize the seriousness of your intention. For instance, consider fasting or meditating throughout the novena period.

, Once you decide to start praying a novena, stick with it. While there are no punishments for quitting halfway through, finishing the practice can be spiritually beneficial, regardless of whether or not your original request has been answered by the end of the novena period.


Meditate. There is some debate regarding whether or not you need to start over from the beginning if you skip a day or hour of your novena. Tradition holds that you should meditate on your reason for skipping and ultimately start over afterward. If the reason was unavoidable, however—like a sudden and dire illness—the decision to start from scratch may not be so clear. Regardless, the issue is a matter of conscience, so the decision is yours to make based on your own circumstances.

, The most traditional way to pray a novena is to recite it at least once a day over the course of nine days.


Choose a time of day to recite your novena prayer. You should pray your novena during the same time each day. For example, if you pray at 9:00 AM the first day, you should pray at 9:00 AM the remaining days.
Recite your novena once a day for nine consecutive days.
Reflect. When you are not actively reciting your novena prayer, you should try to reflect and meditate on your chosen intention.
Seek. Given the fact that this is done over the course of nine days, some distraction is expected. You should seek to minimize that distraction as much as possible, though.

, A shorter, more concentrated alternative is to pray a novena once every hour over the course of nine hours.Prepare accordingly. Let your friends and family know that you will be unavailable for the next nine hours, then turn off your phone and any other potential distractions.
Choose a time to start. Keep in mind that you will need a full nine hours, and that these hours should be back to back.
Recite your chosen novena prayer at the start of each hour.
Spend time meditating on your chosen intention in between prayer times. You can do other activities, like cleaning the house or taking a walk, but your activities should allow you to reflect on your intention instead of distracting you from it.

, There are a range of different novenas with a range of different prayers you can use. Some novenas will call you to recite the same prayer each time, while others will call you to recite a different prayer each time. Even though most novenas use formal prayers, you can also pray informal prayers if doing so has greater meaning to your current circumstances.


Be vocal in prayer. The only limitation is that your prayer must be a ""vocal"" one. You do not need to say a prayer out loud for it to be a vocal prayer, though. A vocal prayer is merely a prayer that uses actual words to address God.
Direct your prayers. The prayers of your novena can either be directed to God or to the one of the Saints.

, Oftentimes, novenas are prayed alone and in private. When a particular intention concerns a larger group of people, though, they may choose to pray the novena together.


Meet with other like-minded believers. Public novenas are usually organized by a church. They can be spoken for specific purposes or in preparation of specific feast days. Your church may ask you to come to the building during the time the novena is prayed each day, or it may simply ask you to pray the novena at home during a certain time to maintain spiritual unity within the congregation, even though the members are physically apart.

, This novena can be said for any consecutive set of nine days but is most often started on the beginning of the Feast of Corpus Christi and ended on the Feast of the Sacred Heart.


You will recite the same prayer once a day:

""O most holy Heart of Jesus, fountain of every blessing, I adore Thee, I love Thee and with a lively sorrow for my sins, I offer Thee this poor heart of mine. Make me humble, patient, pure and wholly obedient to Thy will. Grant, good Jesus, that I may live in Thee and for Thee. Protect me in the midst of danger; comfort me in my afflictions; give me health of body, assistance in my temporal needs, Thy blessing on all that I do, and the grace of a holy death. Within Thy Heart I place my every care. In every need let me come to Thee with humble trust saying, Heart of Jesus help me.""



, This novena can be prayed for nine consecutive days but is more commonly prayed over the course of nine consecutive hours during a single day.


You will recite the same prayer once each hour:

""O Jesus, who has said ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you, through the intercession of Mary, Thy Most Holy Mother, I knock, I seek and I ask that my prayer may be granted.""
Pause here and mention your intentions.
""O Jesus, who has said all that you ask of the Father in My Name, He will will grant you, through the intercession of Mary, Thy Most Holy Mother, I humbly and urgently ask Thy Father in Thy Name, that my prayer be granted.""
Pause here and mention your intentions.
""O Jesus, who has said 'Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but My word shall not pass,' through the intercession of Mary, Thy Most Holy Mother, I feel confident that my prayer will be granted.""
Pause here and mention your intentions.



"
"
Begin by thinking of praying such as:""How much You, Oh God, have done for me from day to day up until this very moment.,
Think of Jesus' life:""I exalt You for taking the form of a man to die on the cross in atonement for my sins and for rising again that I might share in Your life"".

,
Let awareness soak in and enable you:""I praise You for day to day life, and realizing that You gave Yourself brings gratitude for Your love that permeates my life."",
Start naming qualities or attributes for God, eg.,
Thank Him: ""I thank you for all things (huge and tiny) in my life; You have provided all things for my good.,
Utilize creation for your praising God, e.g.,
Let Him take over as you express your deep love for God and ""I praise You, Lord, for inhabiting the praise of Your people"" !,
Do things for others as praise as Jesus said ""What you do to the least of these little ones you do to me."",
Praying within His will and praising him work together for the ultimate success in your prayer life.

,
Make a prayer journal because you will be blessed when you see the progress of your prayers and praises in all areas of life.

,
Praise Him through the storms in your life: ""I praise you, Father God, that you are and will always be there for me, to help and give me peace and comfort.,
Put on some Christian music and worship God wherever you are.",How to Praise God (Christianity)," Lord, You have all power to influence my life."" -- and how about sublimating negative emotions you feel, i.e.:""I feel You working through me; I will let my praise take form as worthwhile, peaceful actions and 'turn my anger (or rage) to higher purposes'."" (Rage may seem counter-Christian, yet there is a reason for harsh emotion that you need to work on and settle proactively.)


Guide your anger: ""I praise you during my rage against"" ""for a constructive, loving purpose and expression. I will not let it become vengeful or hateful"".;
,, Try saying:""I will not be afraid to admit my limited understandings of facts and truth"". Consider:""I praise you that my learning (and research) is an individual journey that I do not undertake all on my own in the Bible, but with fellow believers and the Holy Spirit to give greater order to my thoughts"".

,:""You are mighty!"", ""You are Omnipotent, my Father, my Lord!"", ""You are all and in all.""

,"", try saying some praises audibly.



""I thank and glorify You, Oh Father, God, for the gift and beauty of Creation and for creating and conforming my life to your will"".

,:""The sky and the sea, praise the Lord""; ""Let all that is within me bless the Lord.""

, Psalms 22:3

, And, Isiah said: ""Isn't this the praise that He has chosen : praise the Lord by visiting and sharing your goods and the Good News of the Gospel with the poor--especially widows and orphans.""

,,, Your plan for us is bigger than I can realize or even imagine. Praising You and the shelter of your arm gives me confidence.""

, Whether it is in your bedroom or your car, or on a walk, God will bless you for glorifying his name.

Artists and bands such as Third Day, Casting Crowns, Sidewalk Prophets, and For King and Country have some great worship music that you may find on YouTube.

Extend a verbal invitation.,
Host a community event.,
Use printed invitations.,
Work in groups.,
Hold a church-wide campaign.",How to Invite Someone to Church1," Verbal invitations probably account for the majority of church discoveries between individuals. Preaching the Word and speaking about your faith with a friend are two of the most common verbal invitations people use to invite others to a faith community.Speak with kindness and sincerity.
Let others know about all the fun things your faith community participates in. There may be raffles, fundraisers, community meals, community projects (often involving charitable acts), and even musical events.;
, An indirect approach, especially community events like a lawn fete or barbecue, is a great way to invite non-church members to your faith community. These community events generate money for the church, bring the community together, and allow non-churchgoers to mingle with parishioners in a low-stakes environment.Put up flyers and advertise in your local newspaper to generate community interest in your event.
Focus on creating a fun event. Don't worry about making it ""religious"" - if non-churchgoers have a fun time with the priest/pastor and parishioners, they'll develop an organic interest in learning more about your church, and current parishioners at other area churches may decide to join your parish.

, Some faith communities find that a printed invitation is highly successful for getting non-churchgoers to attend. That's because it provides the individual with a concrete, tactile reminder of your church's events, along with any relevant information about dates/times of service.


Choose an ideal size. Some churchgoers find that four inches by six inches is big enough to include an image while still being small enough to fit in a pocket or handbag.
Combine images and text. Try using one large image for the invitation's background that will catch a viewer's attention. You may want to use an image of the church, a religious icon, a nature photograph, or even some visual image from contemporary popular culture. The text should be short and to the point, and it should pull someone in who has been drawn to the image.
Hand them out in bundles of two or three. That way the person you give them to can help further distribute your invitations to others., A one-on-one approach is probably best for inviting your friends or family members, but what about strangers? It can be intimidating to approach people you don't know, and it may be difficult to get a stranger to trust you after one short conversation. However, working as part of a team can make it easier to approach strangers, and will increase the chances that if you cannot answer the individual's questions, someone else will.Being in a group can give you confidence, and the person you approach will notice the sense of community and camaraderie between you and your fellow churchgoers.

, If you're interested in really promoting your faith community to non-churchgoers, consider talking to your priest or pastor about encouraging others to invite outsiders. You could suggest organizing a monthly ""invite someone to church"" day, and have your priest/pastor discuss different ways to invite others during church services. If everyone in your congregation brought one non-churchgoer to mass, it would fill the church up with fresh faces and renewed interest.

Be Saved and Born-again.,
Become filled with the Holy Spirit.,
Attain God's Protection.,
Know your Authority.,
Read the Word.,
Don't be afraid.,
Bind the Spirits.,
Find a Church Family.",How to Practice Spiritual Warfare as a Christian," This might go without saying but it’s to important not to treat all readers as a tenderfoot. Before one even thinks about participating in spiritual warfare, it’s imperative that they are saved by being born again and transformed into a new creation. To become saved by Jesus Christ the bearer of all sins and iniquities, you must believe in your heart that he exists in a heavenly dimension and that not only does he exist, but he once died on a cross for all the sins of mankind and was raised to life again by the Father. If you have faith (belief) that this is a true account of Jesus, then you can ask him into your heart by repenting of your sins and accepting to become a new creation.


Pray this petition to help you repent and receive Jesus to rule and reign your new life in him: ""Dear God I know I'm a sinner, I know I am not where I want to be, and I want your forgiveness! I believe that Jesus died on the cross to pay the price for my sins and that you raised him from the dead to reign as a king. Please wash me clean from all sin, shame, and guilt, come into my life today Jesus to be my Lord and Savior. I ask this in Jesus name. Amen!"";
, Written in 1 Corinthians 4:20 from the Bible it states that “For the kingdom of God does not consist in words but in power”. This verse indicates to us that to walk a life dedicated to The Lord, it needs to consist of his unseen power. To obtain the power that the scriptures speak of, one needs to be filled with the Holy Spirit.


Pray this petition as a sample prayer in receiving the in-pouring of the Holy Spirit: “My Heavenly Father, I am a believer. I am your child and you are my Father, Jesus is my Lord. I believe with all my heart your word is true. Your Word says that if I will ask I will receive the Holy Spirit. In the name of Jesus Christ, my Lord, I am asking you to fill me overflowing with your precious Holy Spirit. Jesus Baptize me in the Holy Spirit, Because of Your Word, I believe that I now receive and I thank you for it. I believe that the Holy Spirit is within me and by Faith I accept it. Now Holy Spirit, rise up within me as I praise my God. I fully expect to speak with other tongues as You give me the utterance.""
Thank God and Praise him for Baptizing you in the Holy Spirit. From this Moment on you are a Spirit Filled Baptized Believer.

, Before you start tapping into the war that's been wagged upon all believes, it's important to see that you are not alone. You have the creator of the universe on your side, surveying each step you take. You did not earn God's protection, by faith you have received. Every day you wake, ask God to encamp his warrior angels around you and to usher you to and fro your daily destinations. His Holy Spirit will be your guide and his angels will protect you, as it is written “For he give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways” Psalms 91:11.


God protects you by guiding people along your path so that they might help you through him by praying and initiating a 'covering' over you. A 'covering' is where someone else is praying for you in the spirit, and helping to remove any obstacle that might be standing in your way that you have either informed them about, or they have discerned via the Holy Spirit.

, The whole reason we as Christians proceed with Spiritual Warfare is because God allows us to. We as believers in Christ have inherited the ability to stand in fervent authority against the powers of the enemy, for it is written, “Behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you” Luke 10:19

, By reading the bible and noting various bible verses that declare the truths and promises the Lord has bestowed upon all believers; you are able to use the word to deflect every attack, not just any, or some; every attack that the enemy wages upon you, you will be able to deflect it with the word, just as Jesus did to Satan on the mount of olives in Matthew 4:1-11.


Understand that the enemy knows the word, he knows the bible back to front. He uses scriptures to twist and lead you down paths of distraction and misleads you into false teachings, doctrines and habits that you may have approved via a dodgy concept of scripture. That is why it is imperative that you be baptised and lead by the Holy Spirit so that you can obtain spiritual discernment.
It's important to understand that even a verse of two sentences can have the enemy running for the hills, because you've allowed Jesus Christ and the active power the word emanates to step into the picture.

, It is common for new Christians to fear the enemy and therefore not participate in warfare. They want to believe just the positive things and forget the deflecting of attacks. Being a baby Christian has its own season, once a believer knows the fundamentals of the gospel, they are responsible for battling with the remainder of awake believers in the fight to breakdown the strongholds of the enemy.


You mustn't be afraid but stand firm in Christ and understand that if Jesus died, went down to take the keys of hell and rose again; he is powerful and that is why the enemy, even today, is petrified of Jesus and even with the name of Jesus on your lips will have the enemy fleeing.

, In Matthew 18:19 the verse tells us that “Whatsoever we bind on earth will be bound in heaven”, what that means is that whatever we command to be bound, will be bound in the spiritual realm (or the heavens). Binding is where (in the spirit realm) you are literally wrapping a spiritual being like a demon or spirit in a very powerful hold. You yourself aren't doing it, but you are calling upon Jesus’ power to bind them. By binding the spirit you are stifling them of their activeness and ultimately their power.


You can bind any evil spirit through Jesus. For example; you might have an abusive partner, parent or sibling; you can bind the spirit of anger, aggression and violence in them at the name of Jesus. By saying allowed "" In Jesus name I bind the spirit of aggression that is over ______ and demand you to loosen your hold over them. I bind you from hurting me or them and drive you away from their presence immediately!""
By saying that, it may just sound like words and feel like you are doing something that isn't working, but until you perform it, you may never know what it can actually do. By being a fervent Christian and using what Jesus has given you and that is his holy spirit to bind, cast and remove any unclean spirit or force that is interfering with your family, church, school or yourself, you can and will begin to see changes you once thought would never manifest.

, Whether you are or aren't apart of a church group it doesn't stringently matter. A church will provide you with fellowship, a covering and in most cases teaching that can help you grow spiritually. It's of pivotal importance that your church practices spiritual warfare in all it's forms (e.g Deliverance), believes in the power of speaking in heavenly tongues and conducts praise and worship services that are lead by the Holy Spirit.

, If you are from a prayerbook tradition (such as the Episcopal Church) you will need to follow this closely. Even if you come from a free church tradition, it is best to introduce changes gradually and with lots of interpretation. In most mainline churches the shape of worship will generally include


some kind of gathering
an encounter with scripture
response to the encounter with scripture (e.g. prayers, call to discipleship)
sending out/departing

, Whether before prayer or before the worship service begins, this can allow the congregation a time of transition from their busy lives into the calmness of God's sanctuary.

Identify potential churchgoers.,
Decide when to invite them.,
Pray for guidance.,
Extend an invitation.,
Accept the person's answer.",How to Invite Someone to Church2," The first step to inviting someone to your church is to identify individuals who would be open to attending services but do not currently go. This will most likely be someone you know who is a practicing Christian who attends services at another church, or someone who still identifies as a Christian but has stopped attending services. The easiest people to approach with an invitation will probably be:


family members
friends
coworkers or classmates
neighbors, Before you actually approach someone about attending church, you may want to consider when would be an ideal occasion. Having a firm date in mind will make it easier to invite someone. Instead of a general open invitation, you can name a specific date and ask if that person is free to join you.


Many non-churchgoers prefer to attend church services on a Sunday morning. Weekdays may be difficult, whereas Sundays are often a leisure day for most people who work Monday through Friday.If it's near Christmas time, an Advent or Christmas mass would be an ideal occasion. If it's near Easter, consider a Lent or Easter mass. Religious holidays like Christmas make non-churchgoers more open to attending services., As a practicing Christian, you know that prayer can be an important way to ask for guidance or to request a certain outcome of events. Inviting someone to church should be no exception. As you pray, ask for God's help identifying the right people, as well as the appropriate time to ask - ideally when that person is most open to worship (which only God would know). You should also pray for inspiration and eloquence, so that you can best serve your faith and your community by offering the best invitation you're capable of.You can pray independently for guidance and inspiration, or ask your priest/pastor for his prayers to help you on your mission.

, Once you've identified someone who would be open to attending church and chosen a specific date, you can offer a polite invitation to come with you to church. You should be courteous and respectful, even if the person declines your invitation. It may just be the wrong time, and that individual may be open to joining you in the future if you show a little patience. Remember that you are an ambassador for your faith and your community, and with that role comes great responsibility.


Ask politely and work sequentially to turn a potential ""no"" into a confident ""yes.""
Begin by offering the person you'd like to invite some small personal gift, like a plate of home-made cookies.
Try to establish a stronger friendship/relationship with that individual. Invite that person to social gatherings at your house, and ask her permission to pray for her and her family.
Ask politely if it would be okay to invite that individual's kids to a church function. Tell her you think it would be a great way to meet other kids in the area and have a safe, fun time.
Ask politely and respectfully if that individual would be open to attending church with you some time. If she says yes, invite her for the date you've chosen. If she says no, be respectful of her decision and try to remain a close and loyal friend., If the individual you've asked agrees to attend church with you, then you've obviously approached the right person at the right time. Go with her to church services and introduce her to as many people as you can after mass to make her feel welcome. If the individual says no, that's okay too. You still have an obligation as a person of faith to show that individual love, kindness, and respect.Collect your thoughts before you respond to a ""no."" Put yourself in the other person's shoes. Perhaps it's just not the right time for that individual, or perhaps she's had negative experiences at church in the past. Either way, it is not a reflection on you or your abilities.
Try to keep your emotions in check. Don't get upset if a person rejects your offer. Remember that you have an obligation to be an ambassador of Christian values, and that includes being kind to others without any strings attached.Extend an open invitation, even if the person says no. You can say something respectful and inviting, such as ""That's okay, I respect your decision. Just know that if you ever change your mind, my invitation always stands.""

"
"
Identify those in need of church.,
Recognize life changes.,
Pray for guidance and opportunities.,
Offer an invitation.",How to Invite Someone to Church3," Anyone can be invited to church, but some people are easier to reach out to than others. The people closest to you are probably aware of your faith, and may even be curious about it.For this reason, you may want to think carefully about which people in your life are most likely to be open to attending church.


Family members are the most likely to know about your faith, and may have questions or a sincere desire to share in your weekly worship.Extended family are a good branching out point after you've reached out to your immediate relatives. This may include uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, and cousins. These individuals know and trust you, and may be open to joining you and your family for worship.
Close friends are another good branching out point. You most likely have a close bond of intimacy and trust that can help you invite these individuals to share in your faith.
Neighbors may be ideal people to approach. These individuals know and trust you. They also live in close proximity to you, which means they probably live in close proximity to your place of worship.
Coworkers and classmates are a big jump from family,friends, and neighbors. These individuals may not know you very well, which means you may have to work harder to gain their trust and recognize their needs for faith or community.
Strangers will be very difficult to invite to church. These individuals do not know you or have any kind of relationship with you. You may assume someone you meet is in need of faith or a spiritual community, but it can be hard to appeal to that person's needs if they don't already know you on some level.

, The easiest non-Christians to invite to church are those who have undergone a significant life experience recently. Religion and faith bring people comfort during tumultuous life events, especially in the wake of any kind of loss or change.Some life events that may offer an opportunity to invite someone to church include:


the death of a loved one
a recent relocation/change of residency
a new job or school
a recent marriage
the recent birth of a child
a recent divorce
family problems
a major illness (either for the individual herself or someone she knows), As part of your regular prayers, consider asking for God's guidance as you seek out people to invite to church. You may want to ask that God guide you to individuals who are most in need of faith, or you may simply want to ask for guidance in recognizing and capitalizing on ideal opportunities. You can also pray for inspiration and eloquence, so that God will guide you to offer the best invitation you're capable of.Any social event could be an opportunity. For example, attending your children's sporting events could put you in touch with other parents who might be looking for a good church to take their own kids to.
If you spend a lot of time volunteering somewhere (say, for example, a hospital), you may want to consider inviting people you meet at your volunteer site. Let your selfless volunteer work be an example of the faith principles you live by, and be a positive ambassador for Christ.

, If you're inviting a non-Christian to church, it may be difficult to immediately win that individual over. She may have preconceived notions of what church is supposed to be like (which may be unappealing to her), or she may simply have no initial desire to be a part of a faith group. For this reason, it may be easier to invite a non-churchgoer incrementally by first inviting her to social functions and working your way up to mass.


Try socializing with the individual a little. Invite her to coffee or lunch, and show a sincere interest in whatever is going on in that person's life.
Invite the individual to a church function. If your church has a donation drive, ask if she'd like to be a part of the effort. You might also try inviting the individual to a potluck dinner or a bingo event.
Work your way towards inviting the individual to an actual church service. Try using some special occasion for your invitation, like a holiday service, a mass with a children's choir, or a mass with some type of special music (like a folk choir). This can be a good icebreaker for attending church, as it shows the individual something fun and engaging while also welcoming that individual into the community.Remember to respect the individual's choice. If she does not want to go, or if she goes and does not like church, that's okay. You can take comfort in the fact that you extended an invitation to a non-churchgoer, and you've been a good ambassador for your faith. Just be sure to continue to show that individual respect and love.

Believe God's Word.,
Believe that we are justified by God.,
Believe that the Holy Spirit bears witness with us.,
Believe that it is not God accusing us.",How to Live Without Any Condemnation,"


Rom 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that is was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

Condemnation means in the Strong's Hebrew and Greek dictionary ""to judge against"", thus there is no judgment against them which are in Christ. God condemned our sins once and for all on the cross.
Rom 5:19 For as by one man's disobedience (Adam) many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one (Jesus) shall many be made righteous.

Righteousness means just, blameless, honest, spotless, guiltless, innocent and flawless. Jesus by his death made us righteous (blameless and guiltless), and the law is not for the righteous man.;
,


Rom 8:31 What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His own son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things. Who shall lay anything charge to God's elect? It is God that justifies.

Justifies means to declare free of blame, to free a human of guilt and penalty attached to grievous sin.

,


Rom 8:16-18 The spirit itself bears witness with our Spirit, that we are the children of God. And if children, then heirs of God; and joint heirs with Christ, if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may also be Glorified together.

Bears means to hold up, support. The Holy Spirit supports and hold us up.

,


Rev 12:10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, 'Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.'

Accuser means to charge with a shortcoming or error. Accusation means an allegation that a person is guilty of some offense, fault, crime, imputation. Hallelujah, so it is not God accusing us but Satan. We should not accept the accusation or condemnation, because God justifies us and forgives us for all our sin.
One may receive God's provision in Christ Jesus, who gave Himself freely as redeemer.

Redeemer means one who pays for the debt, mistake or crime of another, or buys one out of slavery, from the Law of Sin and Death.
John 3:17 But ""God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.""

Think about peace: Realize that, while the Gospel of Jesus teaches peace, He also said, ""Blessed are the Peacemakers"" (Matthew 5:9b).,
Lay your life down to gain peace, as the armies are allowed to risk your lives and to protect your fellows, and thus yourself, and protect (love) your neighbor (at risk to yourself) and their families as necessary: logically even with deadly force (as Christ laid down his life for you).,
Obey God: God told the Israelites numerous times to raid enemy cities, destroy them and kill the inhabitants but not to individually enrich yourself by taking personal properties or livestock, etc.,
""Be at peace with all people, as much as it depends on you (as much as possible)!"",
""Love your enemy..."" (Matthew 5:43) also ""Turn the other cheek..."" (Luke 6:29)Yes, Jesus said those commands and many more.,
Explain and proclaim that contrary to popular opinion, God does not change (""He is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow!""),
Realize that while Jesus did not want the church or his apostles and leaders to be warlike, some of Jesus' disciples carried swords:


""When the disciples who were with Jesus saw what was going to happen, they asked, ""Shall we use our swords, Lord?"",
Follow the spirit of the law of God, and take appropriate actions and join up government and its law, to help to do what is right.,
Stand up for rightful war: God does not necessarily hate all war, some being necessary in the world system!,
Support police power.,
Support police powers at all levels: Armies, soldiers, sailors and air forces, etc.,
Recall that Paul and Silas did not try to escape the Roman jail or law officers, but sang and preached at midnight to the Roman soldiers/jailers and went to the Jailer's house from prison; their wounds were doctored, bathed, and they were fed by the soldier and his family and servants!,
But, ""Let the dead bury their dead."",
Remember Jesus himself will come in the end time with ""armies"" to ""wage war"" against those who are against God (Revelation 19:11); and ""will destroy them with the sword of his mouth."",
Know your home is in Heaven!",How to Understand War As a Christian," Yet, many wars are fought to bring peace -- in your land or your allies' lands -- against an invading enemy force which is committing atrocities, killing and pillaging your or your allies' cities and homes, as a famous saying sets the scene,""If you want peace, be prepared for war"". ""Blessed be the LORD my strength, who trains my hands for the battle and my fingers for the war..."" (Psalm 144:1) The peace God's son offers begins with human beings who are at war... not against flesh and blood, but against evil and darkness in high places. And many, also, desperately make war against the knowledge of God Himself. The Hebrew Scriptures speak to the fact that God wants to rain down Love, compassion, beauty and light upon us. But, man's sins and our hardhearted nature as ""rebels"", brings down God's judgment as well as the consequences of our own actions. Isaiah 48:22 “There is no peace for the wicked,” says the Lord. Peace, true peace, comes by the acceptance of Jesus' redemptive death as the innocent victim who died as a willing hostage to and in payment for our sins. No Prince of Peace in the affairs of man -- no peace.;

""Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy."" (Matthew 5:7)

Submit to authority to include all lawful orders: 
""13 Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, 14 or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right."" (1 Peter 2:13-14)

, (Romans 12:18). But, that is and must be ""as much as possible""--not an absolute. Not being a murderer is clear, but God allows obeying the lawful commands of military for killing the enemy in war or in honest police work!


Consider using deadly force as required at all levels: Locally, state or international level to prevent the enemy from killing, or to protect your armed forces and/or come to the aid of others, such as ones allies and the weak.

, He was saying that his followers should not argue and fight like ruffians. Also, Christians read the Bible and see words to the effect of glorify God and:


""Give your shirt to one that asks only for your coat;"" (Luke 6:29)""Give to whomever asks of you and ask nothing in return;"" (Luke 6:30)""If you are only demanded (by authorities and soldiers) to go the one customary mile; go the second mile,"". (Matthew 5:41)

, from the New to Old Testament... God is never-changing in His truth and perfection. Noah, Abraham and Moses all found grace through faith. He is full of grace for those who trust Him--but for those who fight Him, and His, there are reasons to fear eternal judgment and even expect destruction here and now, on this earth.

, (Luke 22:49)""If my Kingdom were of this world then my followers would fight to save me from being handed over to the . But now my Kingdom is not from here."" (John 18:36), This is taught in New Testament! How--


Jesus said, ""Render to Caesar that which is Caesar's..."" (Mark 12:17) which was in answer to being ask about paying taxes, and
Jesus paid taxes with a coin; (Matthew 17:27)
""Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor"", written by Apostle Paul. (Romans 13:7)Generalizing these events: Christians are commanded to obey the law and to ""pay taxes for government's processes."" Rome was a militaristic, conquering nations (to say the least) and Jesus (and the Apostle Paul agreeing) said render (pay) the tax that is due.

, No matter what people may say: No! He hates situations when wars are fought the wrong way, and for the wrong reasons (for greed, mere conquest, unnecessary control...). He had always, in the Old Testament, authorized His people to go into a nation and decimate its people and then to make peace and also to:



Accept outsiders with hospitality,
Entertain strangers and travelers and to allow them to go their way in peace (if they will go peacefully),
Enlarge their tents to accept people who would ally with the nation, believe truth/and God, honor and follow the law, and bring offerings to the House of God (to the storehouse), worship God.

, God does! Do you not believe in having altogether thousands of armed state troopers (highway patrol), state ""rangers,"" city police officers, county sheriff deputies, port authorities, customs agents, corrections officers (prison guards)--plus marshals, constables, and bailiffs as officers of the courts in a city, state or nation:


There is a war on law breaking, though somewhat defensive, often it is offensive: going out to capture and arrest people, usually with force (even deadly force) to prevent the accused from harming others. (Imagine if a sniper was left alone on the street...)
""For the authorities are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you like to live without being afraid of the authorities? Then do what is right, and you will receive their approval."" (Romans 13:3) , are forms of ""international police power"" among nations. Their duty is often largely defensive, but not just that.


""Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, government officials. Believers should obey them and be ready to help with any good work."" (Titus 3:1)

Make sure to have a clear message, as if it's a ""clear trumpet call"". Be clear about what you stand for/believe: For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? (I Corinthians 14:8)

, This man, Cornelius the converted Roman centurion, along with his Roman household, became believers, and ""they received the Holy Spirit like as we, and who can say they should not be baptized"" as the Bible said that they received the witness/mark of the Spirit and received water baptism in the book of Acts (A Roman centurion was an army captain - a commander of a company of 100 soldiers, including lieutenants, sergeants, foot soldiers.)

, (Matthew 8:22) Jesus said, and ""Hate your life..."" (Luke 14:26) Jesus said that meaning to make no excuses, but give your whole life to God, and that is not saying worry a lot about your own life generally.

, , where Christians expect to go... The body is a temple of clay, but also a ""fragile"" vessel of clay and although it is a dwelling place for the Holy Spirit, it is not the ultimate for the Christian. You as a Christian will have a new home and a new body.

Read and study the 23rd Psalm-- and Be mindful of God's still small voice:


The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.,
Take it phrase by phrase.,
Think of the implications to you and your sphere of influence for life, both mountain top and the darkest valley.,
Decide what is most valuable to you:


Is it just: ""What you have"" in your life?,
Be available to God's will to walk in Biblical concepts.

""The Lord is my Shepherd"" -- That involves a one-on-one relationship, as an individual -- not just a number in a flock!
""I shall not want"" -- That's the source for your needs: your Shepherd supplies the way, truth and the life!
""He maketh me to lie down in green pastures"" -- That's splendid contentment -- plenty of rest!
""He leadeth me beside the still waters"" -- That's cool, peaceful refreshment!
""He restoreth my soul"" -- That's provision for revitalization and healing!
""He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness"" -- That's leadership and guidance in following God's will!
""For His namesake"" -- That gives a higher purpose for life!
""Truly, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death"" -- That's about testing in the darkest valley, even through death!
""I will fear no evil"" -- That's knowing you are protected even at your lowest hour!
""For Thou art with me"" -- That's the constant faithfulness of The Shepherd!
""Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me"" -- That's God's protection against the enemies!
""Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies"" -- That's assurance of support and hope in danger!
""Thou annointest my head with oil"" -- That's care, dedication and consecration!
""My cup runneth over"" -- That's His abundance flowing to you and out to others!
""Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life"" -- That's the blessing and power of grace, through faith remembering ""God is Love,"" not just words!
""And I will dwell in the house of the Lord"" -- That's home and security in the Lord's provision/Heaven!
""Forever."" -- That's now and always -- for eternity!

Wait the Coming of Messiah: The Jews waited for the promised Messiah, as a leader and savior who would restore the former glory of Kingdom of Israel.,

Know What to Expect: The Jewish people had been taught and consequently expected a Messiah to restore the kingdom at Jerusalem.,
Decide Whether the Messiah Would Be Like Gideon and take a small force with the backing of God and his angels to confound and defeat the Roman oppressors and make Israel the rightful hub of the world -- if that was what was expected to happen according to their understandings and beliefs.

Know Who to Expect: Another ancient prophet named Isaiah goes into great detail, proofs/scriptures for you to investigate.,
Another Biblical Prophecy concerning the Suffering of the Messiah is Wisdom chapter 2, verses 12 - 21.,
Accept Jesus Christ as the Biblical Messiah: Today, there are many who have accepted Jesus as the Messiah whom they say already came in the flesh and won the victory over sin; they call themselves Christians and Messianic Jews, and there are also Arabic Christians who profess Yasu (Yeshua) as the Messiah.,
Understand this and share it with your friends so they know Christ by the Holy Spirit and get enough Truth to prove God is real for yourself and then you can help bless the whole world with God's Love through His Son.",How to Understand Messianic Prophecies," In the Mosaic Covenant (The Old Testament), you see that God kept His promises, and the Jews expected the fulfillment of the messianic prophecy.


Who was born in Bethlehem who fulfilled this prophecy:
""But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, Yet out of you shall come forth to Me The One to be ruler in Israel, Whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting."" Micah 5:2 (written around 700 B.C.)
Who is this eternal ruler born in Bethlehem and who is from of old, from everlasting -- Messiah who would step forth from Eternity. So the Messiah said to be one called Yeshua was to be born in Bethlehem, as the promised Messiah fulfills all these predictions!;
, Daniel said that the Messiah would come 483 years (Jewish lunar 360 day years) which is 476 years on the Graeco-Roman 365 day calendar, ""365.25 days for leap year"", after the orders would be given to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. So if in fact, 476 years after King Artaxerxes issued the decree to rebuild the temple in 443 B.C. -- and if Jesus actually arrived in 33 A.D. in Jerusalem riding on a donkey -- then was He the Messiah? Daniel said that the Messiah would be ""cut off"" to pay for your sin and to bring you to right standing before God.


""Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion (Israel)! Behold, your King is coming to you; He is just and having salvation, yet He is lowly and riding on a donkey."" Zechariah 9:9 (written around 500 BC)

, There was no printing press and no mass produced Book for the people to read. There were rabbis, the scribes and many Jewish priests who taught the people that the Messiah would overcome the enemies of Israel (Assyrians, Babylonians, Greeks and Romans). Jewish scholars (who had access to scrolls in the synagogues) would know the prophecy pertaining to the Messiah's affliction but made His victories the center of Messianic theology. Most refused to accept Jesus as the Messiah as He did not make war with the sword and conquer the Romans; instead, He conquered our iniquities (sins). Jesus said that His kingdom was not about this earth (and so not for politics), which might not satisfy the theocracy the Jewish people had in mind (a king with Godliness). The original man, Adam, was not under the codified law, but under the original Law of Love and that law was to be instituted by the Messiah (to give right standing with God).

,, Read the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, but here are verses 3—5, ""He was despised and rejected by men... Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed."" So did Jesus fulfill the ancient prophecies concerning the Messiah -- yes!

, Here are some of the verses: ""Let us, therefore, lie in wait for the Just Man, because He is not of our turn, and He is contrary to our doings, and upbraids us with transgressions to the Law, and divulges us with sins of our life. He boasts that He has Knowledge Of God, and calls Himself the Son of God. He has become a censurer of our thoughts. He is grievous unto us, even to behold: for His Life is not like other men's, and we esteemed Him to be different."" Note: Wisdom is a book not in the Hebrew Bible and is a Deuterocanonical book considered canonical by Catholics and Eastern Orthodox (""belonging to the second canon""), but considered non-canonical by most Protestants. , Some more traditional Jews, such as the Orthodox and Hasidic tradition, actually maintain the beliefs taught by the Jewish priests of Jesus' day and still wait for the Messiah. Some other groups of Judaism have not even accepted the original prophecies and do not believe there is any promised Messiah at all.

, Light the corners, taking the light of God's word to the ends of the earth.


Consider whether you believe that Jesus is Messiah, and that eternal life is just a prayer away: ""Lord Jesus, beginning today, I ask you to become the Lord of my life. I believe that you died for my sins and rose again from﻿ the dead. Lord, I confess that I am a sinner and I repent of my sins. Thank you for forgiving me and cleansing me. Come into my life and guide me to live for you from now on. In Jesus Name Amen. Ba Shem Yeshuah Amen.""

John 14:26 says, ""The Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.""
The Holy Spirit's job is to bring to our minds what Jesus said, and also to lead us into all truth about the Bible. He is given to us to increase our wisdom. He is not given to us to make us feel things or for us to listen to our heart, nor to stop our thinking. He is given to us to increase our brain power so that we can understand spiritual truths.
He is given to us to give us eyes to see things in the Bible that we wouldn't be able to really see without him. He is God's spirit, so he is able to teach us everything we might need to know about God the Father. Amen.;
,


Romans 8:26 says, ""Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.""
This verse is not referring to praying in tongues, as so many often misinterpret it as. This is talking about the Holy Spirit praying things for us that we don't even think of. It says that these are ""groaning too deep for words."" No words in any language would be able to express these things. They are silent prayers that the Holy Spirit knows that we want to request, but we do not have the words to ask.
When we are weak and can't communicate to God what we want or need, the Holy Spirit prays for us.

John 16:12-15 says, ""When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.""
This is a tricky passage to understand fully, because the Holy Spirit is God's spirit. However, there seems to be a ranking within the Trinity. God the Father is like the president; Jesus is like the vice president, and the Holy Spirit is like the Secretary General.
Both Jesus and the Holy Spirit are in subjection to God the Father. That is why this says that the Holy Spirit ""will not speak on his own authority."" He has to answer to the authority of God the Father. He has to glorify and exalt God the Father.
This is why, if you are in a church that glorifies, or talks more about, the Holy Spirit more than God the Father, they are getting it wrong. The main star of the show, so to speak, is God the Father. He is and always will be, the most important member of the trinity. They are all one, but they are still different entities.

,


Acts 1:8 says, ""But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.""
The Holy Spirit does not give us power arbitrarily, or for no reason. It has a purpose; to witness to the lost and share the gospel about Jesus. If God does perform a miracle through the Holy Spirit, the intended purpose is to witness to others, not to have a magic show.
We need to not focus on the word power in this verse but rather the part about witnessing. If someone seems to have a lot of Holy Spirit power, but they aren't witnessing, then that power isn't from the Holy Spirit.

,


2 Corinthians 3:17 says, ""Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.""
If you are in a church that is very controlling, the Holy Spirit isn't there, at least not very much. If God's spirit were truly there, there would be total and complete freedom. No one would try to tell other people what to do, etc.
If we are truly full of God's Holy Spirit, we will give other people freedom. We won't try to control other people. A good test to know how much of the Holy Spirit you have is to know how controlling you are.

,


John 16:8 says, ""When he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment.""
The Holy Spirit does not generally make us feel good about ourselves. He convicts us of our sins. He is our conscience. When we do something wrong, he lets us acutely feel it that we did. The Holy Spirit is always pointing out to us ways in which we can improve. Since all Christians struggle with the flesh still, we all have a lot to improve on. This is one of the main roles of the Holy Spirit in our lives.

,


Ezekiel 36:26-27 says, ""And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.""
The Holy Spirit gives freedom, but not so much freedom that we don't follow God's commandments and Jesus' teachings.
There is a popular teaching now in Christianity called ""Grace Teaching."" They teach that we can do almost whatever we want because of God's grace. But on the contrary, the Bible says we will have to give an account for every wrong thing we have done when Jesus comes back, whether we are Christian or not.
Being a Christian doesn't mean that since we are now saved, we can live however we want. No, the true mark of a Christian is whether they are living by God's commandments or not. Jesus said, ""If you love me, you will keep my commandments."" Amen.

Find a person who is willing to have an open minded discussion about water baptism, and who is willing to use The Bible as the only source of information for this discussion topic.,
Set aside some time to go through some scriptures with this person.

,
Explain to the person that water baptism is important for many reasons in The Bible which you will now look at.

,
Show the person that one of the most compelling reasons for water baptism was that in the book of Acts when Christ was preached the people responded by being baptised in water.,
Show the person how, according to The Bible, water baptism leads to Holy Spirit baptism.,
Show the person that even if Holy Spirit baptism comes first water baptism should follow.,
Show the person how Jesus tells his disciples of the importance of baptism at the end of the gospels of Mark and Matthew, in His last words before He ascended into heaven.,
Show the person that Peter repeats this instruction to be baptised at the beginning of the Christian Church.,
Show the person that Paul taught that water baptism was our way of identifying with the death of Jesus Christ.,
Show the person that the stories of Noah and the flood and the opening of the Red sea are Old testament examples of water baptism.,
Show the person that Jesus' baptism was for 2 main reasons to fulfill righteousness before God -- that is it was the right thing to do, and for our example -- that we should follow at an age of understanding.,
Show the person that those who were baptised justified God, ie: agreed/verified that He is right -- and those who rejected baptism rejected God's plan (See Luke 7:29-30):


""And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.,
Show the person the person that baptism is a public symbol of personal repentance toward God.,
Show the person that in The Bible those who gladly received His word were baptised.,
Show the person that baptism is of enough importance that it should be done again, if it was done for the wrong reason (or in the wrong way) the first time.,
Show the person that water baptism in The Bible should be done as soon as possible after a person had repented.,
Show the person that that in The Bible water baptism was always done by full immersion.,
Show the person that believing or repentance should precede baptism so therefore the person needs to be of an age to understand what believing and repentance is.,
Show the person from a Bible dictionary that the word baptism comes from the Greek word ""baptizo"" Click for original meaning.,
Show the person that the words spoken at baptism are less important than what is in their heart because ""People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.” 1 Samuel 16:7.",How to Tell Someone That Water Baptism Is Important for Christianity,";
,,, (See Acts 16:13-15, Acts 16:31-33, Acts 8:12, Acts 8:36, Acts 18:4-8, Acts 2:41) So obviously, in Bible times water baptism was part of the message when preaching Christ.

, (See Acts 2:38, Acts 19:1-6) Also known as ""preparing the way of the Lord"" as John the Baptist's teachings of water baptism unto repentance was referred to like that... (See Matthew 3:3&11, Luke 3:4&16)

, (See Acts 10:46)

, ('have 'See Matthew 28:18, Mark 16:16)

, (See Acts 2:38)

, (See Romans 6:4, Colossians 2:12)

, (See 1 Peter 3:20-21, 1 Corinthians 10:2) symbolizing the removal of the old and the start of a new life.

, (See Matthew 3:13-16, Luke 3:21-22, Mark 1:8-10, 1 Peter 2:21, 1 Thessalonians 1:6)

, But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.""

, (See Acts 2:38, Matthew 3:11, Acts 19:4, 1 Peter 3:21)

, (See Acts 2:41) Then compare to John 1:1-12and see that receiving His word is synonymous with receiving Jesus.#

, (See Acts 19:2-6)

, Faith and baptism are closely tied together. (See Acts 22:16)

, (See Matthew 3:16, John 3:23, Acts 8:38)

, (See Acts 2:38, Mark 16:16, Matthew 28:19)

, which means to dip, to immerse or to submerge; so therefore baptism done in any other way is not the same as Biblical baptism.

, If the persons heart is truly repentant, God will give that person the Holy Spirit as He has promised.

Understand that Jesus was very much like a lamb before and during His crucifixion.,
Recognize that when dealing with the Pharisees, Jesus was very lion-like.,
Know that when Jesus was looking at the crowds of people, He always looked on them with compassion.,
Understand that there are also many accounts where Jesus was a bit feisty.,
Also see that Jesus was very confrontational and direct with people.",How to Understand the Dual Nature of Jesus," ""The high priest stood up and said to Him, 'Do You not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?' But Jesus kept silent."" (Matthew 26). In Jesus' trials, He remained silent for the most part. He let people falsely accuse Him. He let the soldiers beat Him and whip Him. He let people spit on Him. He let them put the crown of thorns on His head and nail spikes in His hands and feet. Isaiah says about Jesus, ""He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so He opened not His mouth."" (Isaiah 53:7). Jesus did nor said anything to stop any of it, when He could have called more than 12,000 angels.


When the men came to ""arrest"" Jesus for trial, ""One of Jesus’ companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. 'Put your sword back in its place,' Jesus said to him, 'for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and He will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?'"" (from Matthew 26). At any point Jesus could have called more than ""twelve legions"" of angels to save Him, but He didn't. Jesus went to the cross as a lamb, because He loved us so much and wanted to pay the penalty for our sins.;
, Matthew 23 is full of a list of ""woes"" that Jesus said against the Pharisees. He was essentially cursing them. Here was one of the ""woes,"" ""Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness."" Those are some very strong words aren't they?


It could be asked, ""Was Jesus loving His enemies in doing this?"" Well that would depend on what your definition of love is. There is mushy love and then there is tough love.
Jesus was trying to warn the Pharisees that they were lost in sin, even though they were so sure that they were saved. They would not listen to plain reason because their hearts were hardened. Therefore, Jesus took more drastic measures to get their attention, such as cursing them and insulting them. Jesus spoke the truth, and love is about speaking the truth. Jesus wasn't afraid to say it like it was.

, Jesus was ironically extremely lion-like when it came to the religious people of His day, the Pharisees, but He was very lamb-like when it came to the common people.


The Bible says in Mt. 9, ""Jesus was going through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. Seeing the people, He felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd."" The people had leaders, the Pharisees, but they were very mean and controlling leaders. Jesus saw that they needed a shepherd, as in someone to care for them and guide them in a loving way.
Jesus healed two blind men. Scripture says, ""They said to Him, 'Lord, we want our eyes to be opened.' Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him."" (Matthew 30). With everyone that Jesus healed, He was very lamb-like and He had compassion on them, as in He felt concern for their suffering, disability or illness.

, When Jesus' mother asked Him to help at the wedding, where His first miracle was performed, He said to her ""Woman, why do you bother me? My time has not yet come."" It is interesting that He called her woman instead of mother. Also, He was trying to dismiss her and let her know that He was not ready to openly reveal Himself/His mission and power.


Also, when Jesus was a child He stayed behind in Jerusalem when His family had gone there. Mary and Joseph were looking for Him ""three"" days before they found Him. Here is the story found in Luke 2, ""After three days they found Him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Everyone who heard Him was amazed at His understanding and His answers. When His parents saw Him, they were astonished. His mother said to Him, “ ‘Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.’ “, but then “ 'Why were you searching for me?' He asked. 'Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?' “ That answer is just classic. He didn't say sorry or anything like that but asked why were they searching for him.

, Here is what Jesus said to the Samaritan woman at the well, ""You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true."" That was matter of fact, and in our modern culture we would say it was a bit rude.


There is also the classic account of Jesus saying to Peter ""get behind me Satan."" In Matthew 16 it says, ""Jesus began to explain to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that He must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. 'Never, Lord!' he said. 'This shall never happen to you!' Jesus turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.' ""
It was quite silly of Peter to try to rebuke Jesus, but it is also a bit shocking that Jesus called Peter, Satan. What Jesus meant was that Satan was in Peter's mind, trying to get Peter to stop Jesus from accomplishing His goal. But that would be pretty intense, to have Jesus call you Satan.

Ask God for blessings and for answers to prayers, then follow through by going forward in being of service to others, who need and want it.,
Accept the blessings and gifts from God, but after you get what you wanted, don't forget to thank Him.

,
Don't overdo it: God doesn't require us to sit in the church all day or on the floor thanking Him, but whenever He blesses with some gift we should say thank you.

,
Work on that habit of asking Him for every blessing and every requirement -- but then forgetting to be thankful.

,
Don't keep your thanks to the Lord always pending (like you'll get around to it someday...) by forgetting to thank Him each moment.

,
Consider that if you don't want to keep your answers pending: that when the Lord satisfies you with any part of what you want or need, then be sure to thank Him immediately, to avoid ""lagging-behind"" in the future.,
Remember when He has blessed you with so many things in your life, such as the air that you and I are breathing, then you should give your thanks.

,
Say three words after your everyday prayer before sleeping: ""Thank you, Lord.""",How to Thank God for Every Blessing He Has Given Us," Think about what you can do for the Lord. The Bible says that everyone should thank and praise the Lord at all times. Remember one thing to do -- and that is:""Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and He will make your paths straight.""(Proverbs 3:5)""Strive to go in at the narrow gate... for narrow is the gate and straight is the way that leads to life, but few find it..."";
,,,,,


Would you ever like God to keep your petitions, your prayers, and your blessings pending?

,, This will not harm you in anyway; in fact it will bring more and more blessings into your life -- so thank God in all things, not just in the best of times. Try to be in a spirit of thanking Him at every turn, on every step, because there's a great gratitude that we can show to our Father who made us -- as our divine creator.

, The day came and the crowd was big and excited about the event. The Man came out with his new wheelbarrow and asked, “How many of you believe that I can make it across the tight rope and back?” The crowd cheered loudly and said, “We believe you can do it.” The man went on his way with patience of steel, made it to the other side and back with the wheelbarrow full of rocks. The crowd thundered with cheers. The man said, “How many of you believe I can push a man or woman in my wheelbarrow across and back?” The crowd got even more excited and cheered to see him take a person across Niagara Falls and back. The man was excited about doing his last event. The man said, “If you believe, raise your hands.” The cheering crowd lifted their hands high and cheered. He started asking for volunteers among them that believed to sit in His wheelbarrow to leave the safety and security of dry ground. Not surprisingly, no one volunteered. Although many believed he could do it, no one volunteered to sit in his wheelbarrow. All the ones that believed and raised their hands said, “You are crazy. I am not getting in that wheelbarrow.” Many say they believe in Christ but few choose to get into His wheelbarrow. When Christ asks you to “Trust me. Rely on me. Submit and depend on me; will you surrender your life to Him?” “Many are called but few are chosen.""

, (James 2:19)


Study this scripture because it shows that believing is not sufficient to get you saved. If Satan and his demons believe and understand that God exists, does that get them into Heaven with God? No, demons do not surrender their lives or their existence to His control and Lordship nor do they have a servant relationship to Him.

, You will find that the Amplified Bible does translate the word “believe” with the true meaning of ""trust and rely"", but do any others?

, Having a faith, reliance and dependence that He will save me is something different than, more than, greater than just believing.

, It is trust, dependence and reliance; a hanging on, persistence. The ability to trust and rely is why Jesus says we must be like little children to enter the Kingdom.

, They have confidence, dependence, faith, and reliance, like saying, ""Feed me, clothe me, and give me what I need.""


And, Receive the Holy Spirit as per The Bible as Jesus told his disciples and all his followers; this is for as many as the Lord shall call. In these last days God is pouring out His spirit upon all flesh, and His Children will receive the blessing.

, What do sheep do? Depend, follow, rely, trust your leader Shepherd, are you getting the picture? There is no value in just believing in God for even the demons from hell believe that Jesus saves and he is The Lord. Read James 2:19

, A person that believes may not enter, but he that relies, trusts, and depends will enter the Kingdom of God by the narrow gate.


Ask God for discernment.This is why the church at large needs to get saved. ""What is that?"" many may ask while reading this. You might be thinking this, as well -- but, ""Yes, the church at large, the person sitting in the pew or chair next to you needs to develop a life of dependence, reliance, and trust on the Lord;"" He is the source of true salvation and of discipleship. Trust and determine to be obedient; it's more than just believing.
Sit in God's wheelbarrow. This would mean to trust, rely and depend on him for your life. Is your answer ""no way!"". Why? It is the fear to let go of control of your life and to put it in the hands of another.

, Do you see the difference? In the same way do you merely believe in Jesus or


Trust, depend and rely in Him and put your life in His hands! Where do you sit with that statement? If you do not fully trust in Jesus, ask him right now: ""Teach me to trust You!"", also Psalms 73:28, 115:10-11, 91:1-16. Make this a continuing process to rely on The Lord.

The Catholic and the Orthodox Churches split in the 10th century, over the Nicene Creed. Originally, the Nicene Creed, when addressing the role of the Holy Spirit, only said that He ""proceeds from the Father."" The Pope added ""and the Son,"" to this statement, which angered the Orthodox Patriarch. To this day, while Catholics say that the Holy Spirit ""proceeds from the Father and the Son,"" the Orthodox say that He ""proceeds from the Father."";
, These are as set out next:


I believe in God, the Father Almighty, the Creator of Heaven and earth. This statement teaches that God is Created us, and is therefore, Our Heavenly Father.
I believe in Jesus Christ, His Only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the Power of the Holy Spirit, and born of the Virgin Mary. This statement teaches that the Lord Jesus is Both the Son of God and the Son of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
He suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended to the dead. On the third day, He rose again. He ascended into Heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the living and the dead. This teaches that Christ is Both our Merciful Saviour and our Just Judge.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen. This teaches that the Holy Spirit Sanctifies both the Church and each and everyone of us individually.

, These are as follows:


We believe in One God, the Father, the Almighty, Maker of Heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen. This teaches us that even things which the human eye which cannot see are Created by Our Heavenly Father.
We believe in One Lord, Jesus Christ, the Only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made, one in Being with the Father. Through Him all things were made. For our sakes and our salvation He came down from Heaven; by the Power of the Holy Spirit he was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake, He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, died, and was buried. On the third day He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures; He ascended into Heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and His kingdom will have no end. This teaches us that Christ Is the One True God Incarnate. It teaches us that He Is Both the Son Of the Holy Spirit and of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and that His Death brings us all Eternal Salvation, and at the end of time He Will Judge us and Bring the righteous into Heaven.
We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of life, Who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son He is worshipped and glorified. He has spoken through the Prophets. This statement teaches that the Holy Spirit Is the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity, and that all Prophets, Apostles, and Saints have received their Messages from God Through Him.
We believe in one Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen. This statement teaches us that we are all one Holy Church. We are all a unity in the Body Of Christ.

"
Understand that God as the creator of the world, is all powerful and perfectly wise.,
Know that God is omnipresent.,
Recognize that God is love.,
Contrary to what many think, know that God really does not want anyone to go to hell.,
Know that God is only good and any good thing is from God.,
Understand that God is loving, patient, kind, good, faithful, gentle, at peace and full of joy.,
Know that God always wants to help us, strengthen us, and protect us.,
Know that God loves every single person in the world.",How to Understand God's Character (Christianity)," Genesis 1:1 says, ""In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."" That is, in the beginning of our time, but God has always existed. Something or some entity had to be there for anything at all to exist. He is not a created being; He simply is. Our life comes from His life, as the moving cause. As God said to Moses, ""I am that I am"" meaning that He always has been; that's sufficient to see the clear logic. But, we don't need man's science to see God. God is above and in all science.


No being alive is as powerful as God. Isaiah 40:28 says, ""The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable.""
God is all wise. No being is more intelligent than God. The Bible says that ""His ways are higher than our ways and his thoughts are higher than our thoughts."" We cannot fully understand why God allows the world to be the way it is, because we do not have his mind. We need to trust Him, even though we don't understand everything.;
, This means that God is everywhere at the same time. God the father is not a body; He is a spirit. He is in every place at the same time. It could be said that God is so big that His spirit takes up the entire universe or universes. He is not only sitting up in heaven, way off at a distance somewhere. God is all around us. His one Spirit is all around us at all times, and has been observable from the beginning of time, but He is beyond our time conscious frame of reference.


David says in Psalm 139:7-8, ""Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there."" God's Spirit is everywhere. You cannot go anywhere that God is not.

, The thing that the Bible says that God is through and through is love. Love is his quintessence; or it is the essence of who and what God is.


1 John 4:8 says, ""Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love."" This is referring to true love. In Greek there are four words for love; one means family love, one is friendship love, one is romantic love, and then there is agape love which is the love that is from God. It is perfect love and it is supreme. This love is unconditional; meaning that no matter what we do, God will still always, always love us. Why? Because we are his creation.
God loves us no matter what, like a parent loves their child no matter what, because they created them, in a sense. Christian or non-Christian, God loves you no matter what you do. Romans 8:38 says, ""I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God."" Amen!

, Satan might feed people the lie that God wants people to go to hell but the Bible says differently, and the Bible is the truth. 2 Peter 3:9 says, ""The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance."" God's wish is that everyone on earth would repent and accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior, but God also gives us free will.


God will not force us to love Him, because he knows that would not be real love. God wants us to come to Him through our own wills. He will not force us to follow him. Like you wouldn't want someone to fall in love because you forced them to, so it is the same with God. We want people to love us of their own choice; so does God.
Those who will go to heaven are those who love God/Jesus and those who don't will be those who don't.

, 1 John 1:5 says, ""God is light/love, and in him is no darkness/treachery at all."" Darkness in the Bible represents evil and light represents good. This is saying that God is perfectly good and there is no evil in him at all. Also, any good thing is from God. James 1:17 says, ""Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights."" This includes our children, good food, comfortable beds, etc. Every good thing that we have in this life is from God. We should be thanking him constantly for all the good things he has given us rather than complaining about the bad things.

, Galatians 5:22 says, ""The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control."" This is the fruit of God's Holy Spirit, because these are the essential qualities of God himself.


God is perfectly loving; no being alive can love us like God can. God is patient with us; He puts up with a lot more from us than he has to. God is kind with us; He sent his son to die for us. God is good; there is nothing evil about God. God is faithful; He follows through on his promises. God is gentle; He cares about us and listens to our prayers. God is at peace; He is fully confident and has nothing to worry about because he is God. God is full of joy; God is not depressed or sad. He is very much alive and well.

, God says in Isaiah 41:10, ""Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."" Satan wants us to fear, but God does not. God wants us to be at peace. If God is with us we have nothing to fear ultimately/not in life or death. The Bible says, ""If God is for us, who can be against us."" People may be against us, but it won't matter, if God is for us. Amen.


God tells us to not be ""dismayed,"" this means do not be depressed. Since God is our God and he is good and he is loving, we should have nothing to be depressed about. God wants to renew our strength so that we can ""soar on wings like eagles.""
God also wants to help us and protect us. Psalm 18:30 says about God, ""He is a shield for all those who take refuge in him."" God protects us from Satan and from evil when we take refuge in Him. When we ask God for help, he will protect us. Psalm 91:11 says, ""He will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways."" When we pray and seek refuge in God, he sends his angels to ""guard us"" in all our ways.

, The most famous verse in the Bible, John 3:16 says, ""God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."" God did not have to send His son to die for us, but he chose to because of how much He loves us. He wants to save us from our sins, if we would believe in Jesus.


God wanted Jesus to die so that we would not have to face the penalty for our sins. Jesus was the perfect sacrifice, because he was absolutely perfect; he never sinned. The next verse, John 3:17 says, ""God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.""
Some say that the belief about Jesus is narrow minded. Some say that it is judgmental or condemning to say that Jesus is the only way. But on the other hand, it is very freeing. In what other religion does the god of that religion offer his people a free gift of salvation? None. In any other religion you have to prove yourself; you have to work your way to heaven. Christianity is the only one that says that God already paid the price and that the only thing we need to do is put our wholehearted being into believing not in works, but in faith in Jesus' free gift of salvation, and then do the good things appointed before time that we should do in Love/Christ.
It is not mean to say that Jesus is the only way, it is very good news. God shows his immense love for us in sending his son for us and making it so easy for us to be saved. However, that is why some don't believe, because it seems too good to be true. It seems too easy. But it is. It really is that simple. Then we are to walk in the straight path placed before us. Keep running the race in grace and pass on whatever you have heard of Christ, into all the Earth...

Start thinking about what you want to pray about.,
Just start talking to God about the issue that vexes you most.

,
Be sincere because God himself is sincere and cares deeply about you.

,
Be thankful for the things you do have and the times that God may have stepped in and miraculously saved you.

,
After your heart and soul has felt like it has exhausted all emotion, end your prayer in Jesus' name.

,
Share your emotions with friends and family and tell that you have been praying about them.,
Always remember that God is all knowing, seeing, and all doing.,
Finally, continue to pray and enjoy the benefits of prayer and the faith that will be given to you.",How to Talk to God Through Prayer,";

Develop a relationship with God.,
Pray to God.,
Study your Bible.,
Give thanks to God.,
Get strength from God.,
Pray with others.,
Pray with your family.",How to Serve God1," To start serving God, you have to discover who God is to you. Is your relationship with God something you fall back on in your time of need? Or is He someone you communicate with every day?


Your relationship with God will help you to serve him through your thoughts and actions.
Think about your own life and what God has given you.;
, You don’t have to be in a church or on your knees to pray; you can just talk to God as a form of prayer. You can find specific prayers for almost any situation in your life, or you can simply ask God to help you with you a problem, pray for guidance, peace, or any number of things that are on your mind.Prayer is a way of serving God that can be very beneficial to you as it’s a way of letting your faith guide you while you learn to focus on what’s happening in your life and address any issues.
Prayer is not a way to ignore what’s happening in your life, nor should it be used as a means to ask God for things, as He’s not a genie who grants wishes.
Serving God through prayer is sort of the first step on the path to serving God through your whole life and through your faith in Him.

, Reading your bible, or whatever text is considered sacred in your religion is another form of prayer and service to God. Reading the text can give you guidance if you are feeling astray, it can inspire you, and even give you some lessons in how to serve God.


Join a bible study where you can learn how to interpret the text with other followers. Once you understand the bible you can help others to do the same.
As you read the Bible, think about how it reflects on your own life.
You don’t have to read your bible from beginning to end, you can just find books or passages that you feel connect you to God.

, Remember to take a moment sometimes and give thanks for what God has given you, or helped you get on your own.


If you are Christian you can do this at church, before a meal, bedtime, or whenever you feel like it. Just take a moment and thank God for what He has given you; whether it's the food on your table or the clothes on your back.
If you practice another religion like Hinduism, the basic practice is to thank God three times a day.The three times are: after you get up in the morning, before your midday meal, and before bed.
Whether it’s before a meal, before bed, or whenever you have a free moment, taking a minute to thank God for giving you the tools you need in your life to succeed.

, There’s a proverb about a single pair of footprints in the sand during the worst points in your life.And the message of the proverb is that when you thought you were on your own during those hardest parts of your life, God carried you through. Serving God can come from letting him give you strength when you need it most by simply putting your faith in him.


Getting strength from God isn't always the easiest concept. After all, how is God going to make you physically stronger? He won't, but you can use your faith in him to find strength in your daily life.
Maybe you are quick to anger. When you feel your blood beginning to boil, take a moment and just pray to God for peace. Ask to find the strength to stay calm and let things roll off your back. Taking a minute to just breathe and pray can help you calm down.
Perhaps you are having a difficult time coping with something in your life, by praying for strength you may find that you have the ability to cope better.
Getting strength from God will a lot of the time come down to faith and the knowledge that you are never walking alone. That He is there to pick you up if you fall.

, Maybe you have a friend who needs some help or is having a hard time, or it’s someone you don’t know very well. Praying with them, if they’re open to it, or even for them can go a long way.


You shouldn’t force anyone to pray with you or condemn them for not serving God in the same way that you do.
If someone isn’t comfortable with prayer or doesn’t believe in God, then you can serve Him by praying to God that this person finds the peace, strength, and faith they need in their life.

, A family that prays together stays together. Serving God isn’t always an individual thing. When you and your family give thanks and all have faith, you are serving God together.

Study and learn about other faiths.,
Research the different faiths or religious denominations.",How to Study and Prepare to Become a Christian1," Before you make your ultimate decision to become Christian, study other faiths to truly determine whether you really want to go through with your decision. Study faiths like Judaism, Islam, Bahaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and other faiths.;
, If you have decided that Christianity is your ultimate choice, study it's various denominations to determine which to join. These include Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, Church of the East, the various Protestant denominations (Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, etc.), or even the Restorationist movement (Mormon, Jehovah Witness, etc.).

Believe in your heart (innermost being) that God sent Jesus to earth, and that Christ gave himself to save you from the punishment for your sins.,
Confess with your mouth that Jesus is your Lord and Savior.,
Avoid Sabotaging Your Prayer Life to God in whatever fashion feels the most comfortable; ask for guidance and not for unnecessary ""things"".

,
Don't concern yourself with only with ""looking out for #1""; take care of others and you will be taken care of.,
Our good works are as filthy rags to Him -- meaning they cannot save us.,
Wisdom is recognizing that none of us knows enough to judge others.,
Recognize that you are never alone, and that there is no hiding from Him.

,
Feel remorse for your sins and ask for forgiveness; turn away from your old ways (repent); try hard not to repeat them.

,
Remember that every sin and failing is already forgiven, past, present, and future: that is if you have repented and accepted Christ Jesus as your personal savior and have been filled with God's Holy Spirit.

,
God can be known, seen in everything, with your logic, but only after you know Him without demanding mere logic.,
Every battle is fought on two fronts; in this case these are the spiritual and the physical.,
God's existence is impossible to prove.,
Live each day as though you might die at any moment.,
Imagine your connection to God as if it could be an AM radio broadcast; those things which allow us to concentrate on the physical body rather than the spirit (i.e.,
We are born knowing God and hearing His voice, but we forget as we ""learn"" from men instead of Him.,
Read your Bible every day so your can faith can Move That Mountain and remain strong enough for the end times.",How to Survive Until the Rapture,";
, Try to be humble for each minute of every day. God resists the proud.

,, A good analogy is that it is like driving a car: be courteous, use your turn signals, and let others merge in front of you, rather than speeding up to block their progress. You might be astonished at the potentially far-reaching ramifications of the decisions we make every day.

, We are supposed to do His good works so they are only expected. Don't concern yourself with pride (or proof) of your accomplishments; God knows the evidence and sum total of your good work. Strive to do good and get better each minute of every day by loving and serving the needy, expecting nothing in return; be charitable.

, So help each other and agree together in the faith, instead of judging. You do not even judge yourself. There is one judge.

,,,, You know Him ""by grace, through faith, not of yourself, not of works; it is the gift of God; so then you will do good work that He has prepared for you to do"". (Ephesians 2:8-10)

, We tell ourselves that we (humans) understand the physical laws of nature, but are skeptical of God when miracles can be explained. Why cannot God operate within and beyond these confines? That is even more awesome, as it continues to preserve the paradigm of faith.

, This is necessary, as faith is the test we are all trying to pass. But in its inability to be proven on the physical level lies the logical proof of His existence on the spiritual one.


Where two or three are gathered in my name: there I am in their midst.

, Be prepared when you meet God; don't leave behind effects that would shame you in life, as they will shame your family in death. Keep your moral and fiscal debts paid and your family needs covered as much as possible.

, ""sins"") cause static, interference and dropouts from this already tenuous signal (wavering faith). Adjust the dial as often as necessary, Increase Christian Faith, but how nice it is when you can sit back and enjoy the music!

, ""Hide God's word in your heart (your core being) that you might not sin against God,"" ie: to avoid failing Him.

,


No, your faith need not be great: Jesus Christ said: ""Oh, you of little faith... with just a little faith you can say to a mountain (of hate, despair, sickness, disbelief)... 'Be moved'..."" and it can be taken out of your way and nothing shall be impossible unto you.(Matthew 17:20)

Learn about the joy of being in God's presence.,
Reflect on how amazing this Psalm about unity is.,
Realize that the counsel of the Lord stands forever.,
Read the following scripture and study it: Psalm 139: 1-24 verses 1.,
Have faith.",How to Stay in the Presence of God," Achieve this through spending time with others; when God's children are united, it is a blessing!


Read Psalm 133:1-3 - Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious oil upon the head, running down on the beard, the beard of Aaron, running down on the edge of his garments. It is like the dew of Herman, descending upon the mountain of Zion; for there the Lord commanded a blessing- life forevermore.
;
, Who would not want a blessing from God for enjoying unity? Keep united in fellowship and in worship that focuses on God.

, This means that no government or people is above the Lord, and if anyone makes laws against Gods laws those laws will be brought to nothing by the Lord! Only God's law will stand.


Read Psalm 33:10-11 - The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; He makes the planes of the people of no effect. The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of His heart to all generations.


, - O lord, you have searched me and known me. This is a beautiful passage of how God knows each of His children and how the knowledge of this is too hard for human comprehension.God’s perfect knowledge of mankind means that He knows us personally!

, People fail, they get tired, and they give up on you when you need them without ever showing remorse when they disappoint you. On the other hand, God is faithful and ever aware of what we need, always willing and able to help us no matter what the need.


Read Psalm 146:1-10 verses 3-5 - does not put your trust in princes, nor in the sons of man, in whom there is no help. His spirit departs, he returns to his earth; in that very day his plans perish. Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God.

Be a mentor.,
Volunteer in your community.,
Give what you don’t need.,
Go out of your way to help someone in need.,
Pay it forward.",How to Serve God2," You can serve God by being a mentor or positive role model to someone who may be younger than you, or even around your age.


Perhaps you have a younger family member who needs guidance, or you could join a Big Brother/Big Sister program.
Putting someone ahead of you and helping others is a great way to serve.

, Volunteering is another great way to serve God and can be done in many ways.


You can volunteer at a local food shelter or soup kitchen.
You can also serve God through cleaning up your neighborhood or being part of a neighborhood watch, and protecting those in your community you love.
Remember that serving God can be as simple as helping out a neighbor with a small task or favor, and doesn’t have to be a big grand gesture.

, If you’ve studied your bible you’ll know that there are countless passages about only taking what you need and helping others by giving what you don’t need.This is a great way to serve God as you can easily look around your home and find things you don’t use or need anymore to give away.
Instead of throwing out old clothes or furniture you can donate them to places like Goodwill.
You can also donate any extra canned food you may have to your local food shelter.

, You can always serve God by being the Good Samaritan. If you see someone in need try to help them.


You don’t have to do something grand as helping someone can be as simple as opening a door picking up something someone may have dropped.

, Remember a time when someone helped you out with something? Well, now it’s your turn. Do the same for someone who could use your help.


Maybe someone let you merge ahead in traffic or in a line at the store. Now it’s your time to do the same for someone else.
Paying it forward is a great way to serve God and doing something good for someone else will make you feel good as well. It’s a win-win

Start going to church.,
Spread the word about God.,
Stay humble about your accomplishments.,
Teach your kids about God.,
Let God inform your actions.,
Forgive those who have wronged you.",How to Serve God3," What better way to serve God? Even if you are unable to go, you could always find a time a couple of times a week to quietly reflect, pray, and read your Bible.


Going to church is one of the most common ways people serve God and even if it’s not your favorite activity try and use that time to forget about any troubles you may have in your life for an hour and focus on your relationship with God.
Church can be a very spiritual and cleansing experience not unlike meditation or exercise. In this case, you’re just exercising your faith.

, Tell other people about Him or invite them to church. Don't be ashamed of God, He's your creator.


However, just as you shouldn’t be ashamed of God, this doesn’t mean that you should Shove him down someone’s throat. Serving God doesn’t mean forcing Him on others.

, Serving God doesn’t mean toting your accomplishments and good fortune. It means thanking Him for what he has blessed you with and remaining humble about it.


Quietly reflect on how your faith has given you fortune and remember that it’s your job to use it to help those in need.
Maybe you got a big promotion at work. Don’t go around bragging about it, instead use your new status to make your workplace better or help your coworkers when they might need guidance.
If you won an award for something or got recognition for an accomplishment, remember that God gave you the tools you needed, and chances are you didn’t accomplish this alone. Serve God by setting an example of humility that others can follow.

, If you’re a parent you know how much your children look up to you and learn from you. And leading by example is never more important than when it pertains to your kids. A great way to serve God is to introduce Him into your children’s life.


Read books to your kids that teach them about spirituality.Show them how God exists in their daily life and teach them how to walk with God in their hearts using examples from the bible or real life., When you are frustrated or in a hurry to be somewhere or accomplish a task it can be easy to lose sight of how to serve God, but pause and think about how He would want you to act.


This can also be a sort of prayer to God. It’s good to pause sometimes and take a moment to ask yourself “How does God want me to act?”
Letting God and your faith in Him help you decide how to act is not only a great way for you to find some inner peace, but it will show others around you your best self. And others will follow your example.

, God is the ultimate forgiver. He forgives us of our sins and transgressions. And while forgiveness isn’t always easy when you’ve been wronged, this is one of the best ways to serve God, and in turn, yourself.


If you’re having a hard time forgiving someone, use the other ways that serve God to help you. Pray, talk to God, go to Church, and even do something good for someone else.
You can write down the good that’s come of out of a bad situation and ask God to give you the strength you need to forgive and focus on those good aspects.

","How to Stay Under God As a Christian, American Patriot"," That means: Be born again, and so believe and say that Christ is your personal Savior, pray and repent to the one, true God for salvation, and be baptized.


Your way to get salvation is explained here: ""8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. 10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."" (Ephesians 2:8-10);
,
~ ""Do not think more highly of yourself than you should.""


Serve God as a patriotic Christian as much as possible and as best you can.
Thank God for and accept His grace and faith (""faith is the gift of God"").
Support high ethical, moral values and consider supporting those who have them.

,


Seek ways to be revived in everyday life, or to revive again:~ Restore America individually, one by one.
~ ""Put on the whole armor of God.""
~ ""Renew your mind.""

Recruit for the sake of Christ into the Godly cause of service to your fellows. Each one bring one, and so your efforts may re-double -- and pray that God may ""revive us again"" as Christian patriots for reviving a higher meaning in America.

,: good for even the very ""least among His children."" Be Blessed by observing the teachings of Jesus and the Gospel -- ""do all things as to the Lord"" -- good is done for Him, but evil is done to Him.


Jesus said, ""Whatever you do to the least of these, my Children, you do to me."" and""Whatever you do not to the least of these, my Children, you do it not to me.""
Jesus said, """"You have heard that it was said, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, 'love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.' ""


, So then, ""individual responsibility to fellow citizens is an inherent component of patriotism."" but some say that ""a person has more moral duties to fellow members of the national community, than to non-members.""

,


Pay taxes. ""Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and to God that which is God's -- and honor to whom honor is due."" Jesus said. Jesus paid taxes in the Bible.

, Examine ways to support the greater ideals of America that align with Godliness in real Christian patriotism;
~ As much as possible support your country and its peoples;
~ Question and seek what is best for the good of the people;
~ Quest for making the country the best it possibly can be ""under God"".


Do more than just identify with one's home and country's potentials and ideals. Try to understand them and to actualize your part in some of those ideals.

, Go beyond the call of duty individually to be of service in times of crucial events, cross roads of faith, hope, love for God, liberty and the pursuit of happiness (such things as against which there is no law).


Help to improve your own and others understandings of the purpose of serving mankind involving your nation's special, fundamental beliefs including to support the Nation even when faced with tough times and provide constructive criticism and/or praise (where it is due) to help improve the situation.
Do extraordinary individual helpful activities to try to assist in rolling back bad ideas and results of non-helpful changes by events in everyday life, work, play, or in public life.

,


Try to improve the concepts, and mood. Consider joining into your community, city, state or nation as an individual in possible team efforts even if the team never communicates, meets or assembles anytime, anywhere, but you may contribute your voice (so to speak).
Consider flying a flag, or to learn the National Anthem, and read up on heroes of your nation that may inspire you and your beliefs.

, Explain that the people work as a team called America, and study up on your home country's system to help support it which is potentially a special honor. This not only gives you basis to be proud of, but also gives children a good knowledge of the nation's uniqueness (for good or evil).

Just like driving, you will know when you are drifting because things will be different when you pass the right or left barrier.

Repent of a sin you commit and make sure to not do it again. If thoughts of guilt come to you trying to make you think you are not forgiven, just simply ignore them and know that God has forgiven you. As long as you are struggling with sin, that means you are trying to resist the sin.

Read your bible and pray daily. Set your heart on God and he will gradually reveal himself to you. He will not ignore a truly repentant, honest, and persistent person seeking Him.

Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; guard it well, for it is your life. Proverbs 4:13 (NIV)
Make a habit of reading the word of God. At first it may be hard or you may face distractions, but make an effort to make it a habit. Once you make yourself do it regularly, you will eventually grow into liking it and the word will become alive to you.

, The Christian life is not to be lived alone but with others so they can strengthen you in hard times.


And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage and warn each other, especially now that the day of his coming back again is drawing near. Hebrews 10:25 (NLT)
Simply going to church and seeing others who are wanting to know God will help you seek God more easily. Church is a good way to make friends too.

, Expect difficult times in your Christian life.


All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. Matthew 10:22 (NIV)
It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. Galatians 5:1 (NIV)
You will struggle, but don't give in. Remember, ""no pain, no gain"". If you aren't struggling, you are probably not doing something you should be doing. The devil doesn't want you to be a Christian and if you aren't butting heads with the devil, you are probably going in the same direction he is.

,


Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress. Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers. 1 Timothy 4:15-17 (NIV)
Stand your ground. Realize that you cannot fail, because if you do, you won't make it to heaven. There really is no option. Heaven or hell, it's up to you. To go to heaven, you will have to work, fight, take pain, insults, and setbacks in your life, and do things you won't necessarily enjoy.

,


Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training ... we do it to get a crown that will last forever. 1 Corinthians 9: 24-25 (NIV)
I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness... 2 Timothy 4:7-8 (NIV)
Stay your course. You are not just running this race for a crown, you are running this race to find true meaning and purpose once this life is over. Once you die, it's over. All you can take with you is your soul and your good deeds and what you did for the Lord. All your degrees, awards, houses, cars, hobbies, and more will be gone forever. Fear not, because you will have new and better and eternal versions of all these things in heaven. All you have to do is make sure you get there.

,


Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you stood your ground in a great contest in the face of suffering. So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised … we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who believe and are saved. Hebrews 10: 32, 35-39 (NIV)
One tactic the enemy loves using is to remind you of your present situation and get you to forget what the Lord has protected you from, saved you from, and provided you with. You are a walking miracle and you don't even realize it. God has great plans for you in the future too.

, Don't think 'I'll just get persecuted.' or 'They'll think I'm weird', etc or you'll never get anywhere! Even if people strongly believe another religion, try to tell them of the word.

, No matter how hard it is to make them believe in Jesus, if you try hard enough and pray hard enough, it will be done.

, Don't tell just a few people of the good news, tell everyone you meet.

, How can you persuade others if you are not armed with righteousness and the sword of the spirit (The Holy Bible)?

, You can use emails, letters, organize parties and tell the guests, at work/school, sleepovers, online gaming chat rooms, websites or anything else you can think of.

, If you raise funds for a charity, give money to children, pick up litter  etc, then people will know that you are a good person and you can tell them that you are representing God. If you really devote yourself 24/7 to the lord, you show people how much you believe.

Jesus begins in the natural realm (v. 7).,
Jesus swung the conversation to the spiritual realm (v. 10).,
Jesus brought conviction using the Law of God (v. 16–18).,
He may confidently say, “I don’t believe in hell."",
He may say that he’s guilty, but that he will go to heaven.,
He may admit that he is guilty and therefore going to hell.,
Jesus spoke to the woman of a new way to come: (John4:23-24) when true worshippers would worship in the Spirit.,
After these things had been done, Jesus revealed Himself to the woman at the well (v. 26).",How to Share the Gospel like Jesus," This woman was unregenerate, and the Bible tells us “the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God,"" (1 Corinthians 2:14). He therefore spoke of something she could relate to—water. Most of us can strike up a conversation with a stranger in the natural realm. It may be a friendly “How are you doing?"" or a warm “Good morning!"" If the person responds with a sense of warmth, we may then ask, “Do you live around here?"" and from there develop a conversation.;
, He simply mentioned the things of God. This will take courage. We may say something like, “Did you go to church on Sunday?"" or “Did you see that Christian TV program last week?"" If the person responds positively, the question “Do you have a Christian background?"" will probe his background. He may answer, “I went to church when I was a child, but I drifted away from it."" Another simple way to swing to the spiritual is to offer the person a gospel tract and ask, “Did you get one of these?"" When he takes it, simply say, “It’s a gospel tract. Do you come from a Christian background?"" If you are comfortable using a particular tract, you can even play off of it: for instance if you are using a million-dollar bill as an icebreaker, you can ask, ""Do you know the million-dollar question? No? What do you think happens after someone dies?""

, Jesus gently spoke to her conscience by alluding to the fact that she had transgressed the Sixth of the Ten Commandments. He used the Law to bring “the knowledge of sin"" (see Romans 3:19,20). We can do the same, “Do you consider yourself to be a good person? Do you think that you have kept the Ten Commandments?"" Most people think they have, so quickly follow with, “Have you ever told a lie?"" This is confrontational, but if it’s asked in a spirit of love and gentleness, there won’t be any offense. Remember that the “work of the Law written in their hearts"" and that the conscience will bear witness (Romans 2:15). Jesus confronted the rich young ruler in Luke 18:18–21 with five of the Ten Commandments and there was no offense. Have confidence that the conscience will do its work and affirm the truth of each Commandment. Don’t be afraid to gently ask, “Have you ever stolen something, even if it’s small?"" Learn how to open up the spirituality of the Law and show how God considers lust to be the same as adultery (Matthew 5:27,28) and hatred the same as murder (1 John 3:15). Make sure you get an admission of guilt. Ask the person, “If God judges you by the Ten Commandments on Judgment Day, do you think you will be innocent or guilty?"" If he says he will be innocent, ask, “Why is that?"" If he admits his guilt, ask, “Do you think you will go to heaven or hell?"" From there the conversation may go one of three ways:

, Gently respond, “That doesn’t matter. You still have to face God on Judgment Day whether you believe in it or not. If I step onto the freeway when a massive truck is heading for me and I say, ‘I don’t believe in trucks,’ my lack of belief isn’t going to change reality.""

, This is usually because he thinks that God is “good"" and that He will, therefore, overlook sin in his case. Point out that if a judge in a criminal case has a guilty murderer standing before him, the judge, if he is a good man, can’t just let him go. He must ensure that the guilty man is punished. If God is good, He must (by nature) punish murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, fornicators, and those who have lived in rebellion to the inner light that God has given to every man. Then tenderly tell him he has already admitted to you that he has lied, stolen, and committed adultery in his heart, and that God gave him a conscience so that he would know right from wrong. His conscience and the conviction of the Holy Spirit will do the rest. That’s why it is essential to draw out an admission of guilt before you mention Judgment Day or the existence of hell.

, Ask him if that concerns him. Speak to him about how much he values his life and how much more therefore he should value the salvation of his soul. Jesus said that a person should count his life as worthless compared to the value of his soul (Matthew 5:29, Mark 9:47).

, This was made possible after Jesus was glorified (John7:37-39) and the Holy Spirit was poured out. (Acts2:4) To be like Jesus we must emphasis that they too must be baptised in the Holy Spirit to be a true worshipper

, Once the Law has humbled the person, he is ready for grace. Remember, the Bible says that God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble (James 4:6). The gospel is for the humble. Only the sick need a physician, and only those who will admit that they have the disease of sin will truly embrace the cure of the gospel by repenting and placing their trust in Christ.

"
Follow, above all, the scriptures and the leading of the Holy Spirit for God's purpose in the lives of your congregation.,
Get a clear idea of what you intend to teach.,
Plan and make an outline for your topic that is something you would like to know more about and can explain and teach to: that does not mean to create a story like literature, or a lecture and not even to write an essay, but you do need to plan it as explained in the Three Part Outline section.,
Be dynamic, with a living phrasing by not merely reading it, so that it is not set in stone, and then you can feel more inspired and alive, and make a more inspiring communication between the teacher/preacher and the class or the congregation.

,
Try ""not"" relying on very detailed notes, but that does not mean that you will be speaking without your plan or without your outline.,
Be direct; get to the point of the message that is intended, but how do you do it?

,
Think of a topic as having three simple parts in the message or lesson like a three part outline.",How to Write a Sermon1," Seek a heartfelt ""anointing"".

, Study and pray to seek The Holy Spirit's guidance: be enthused. Usually the basis of the idea should be backed up with Bible scripture. You never will begin to preach without a direction or purpose, if you follow the steps to get it organized.

,


A lesson or sermon is usually best, if it is spoken without memorizing it all and not even writing it all down in complete sentences, and then you cannot merely read it, but use a meaningful outline. Make your key words larger so that they stand out in your eye and in your mind. That can be like a map to follow. A lesson or sermon should be better when it is not like a speech or oration that a public speaker (such as a politician) might simply read to an audience, unless you are an extremely effective reader.
Each sermon may be a whole new topic or one in a ""series"" of multiple sermons or lessons.

,,


Know the outline and the plan so well that you don't need to look at it or your notes more than an occasional glance, or so that you only need the larger key word to make it click in your mind, but you can have them there, open and available.

,, That three part process is given next.

"
"
Introduce your message topic: tell what you are going to cover and why, or why it's important, or how it is relevant.,
Teach the message by developing it (expanding upon it): give examples and tell who is involved?, when?, where?, how?, why?,
Conclude with issuing a call to action based on the matter in the topic.",How to Write a Sermon2,"


You may give a humorous remark about what it does or does not mean.
Use a starting point related to a scripture or an event that was/is the impetus for the main idea.;
, and alternatives, or what the different events might be.


Since you gave the concept to be developed in the introduction, then you and the class or congregation know what you are talking about, and you know upon what you will make a conclusion.
Develop your main points with examples like a story or two, Biblical parables, part of a song, church events or such that you can weave into the topic.
You may realize that there would be objections in your topic like:

""What do you mean?""
""How did that happen?""
""What if ______________ (name something) happened?""


And so, ask those as ""rhetorical"" questions (not to seek an answer from the audience, unless it's a small group), and answer them like:
""What if _________ (something) happened? Well, then ____________ (this) is what you or someone can do because ___________ (whatever), but then..."" (fill in the blanks beforehand) -- and so you would answer the objections or questions for them. If you do allow answers, wait for it... as in a class room; don't disagree with the answer unless it is important to say why ""Actually, I feel like this is the answer: _______"" (giving your view). Generally, suspend judgment so you neither praise nor ignore comments, and you can nod and say one or a few words in response ""I see."", while nodding agreeably, ""Okay."", ""I see your point."" or ""Thank you."" or such a non-judgmental remark -- and then steer it onto the path it was supposed to be on (without characterizing the comment as right or wrong).

, Perhaps this would be a call to accept Jesus as Savior. This is putting the finish on what you introduced and developed--such as to remember to try the ideas, pray, invite others, or study, etc.


This is like an assignment to do the things that you taught or preached about.

"
"
Rely on other people for advice and all of your ideas: No, not really.,
Talk to other teachers/preachers to get ideas, but that could become a habit, be a crutch and a waste of time for both of you, if the two of you have different needs and objectives.

,
Try to use various collections of sermon outlines from old or new books of sermons, but change it to fit you needs.,
Consider Bible software that has The Bible, commentary, dictionary, cross references which can all be great.,
Pray and read your Bible daily.",How to Write a Sermon3," It is a good idea to have someone to talk ideas over with, if you would not talk and visit all day with various people, and avoid not studying or preparing well -- that won't work very often.

,,


Find sermon outline services on the Internet, completely organize them, to your needs.
They probably can't serve your needs, if you just pick out a sermon outline that sort of sounds okay, but it is something that does not particularly inspire or inform, or about which you wouldn't care to talk/hear yourself.
They won't be in your style, in your order, or right for the way you feel or speak.
Download collections of lessons or sermons:
Some great old-time religion materials should be found out there, for free.
Consider subscribing to preaching outlines perhaps with Power Point presentations, with pictures, and examples--even with a complete order of service, list of verses, cross references, and songs to use.

,


Use free Bible look-up websites accessible for 25 versions and even with different languages such as and ; the two sites totally free and are quite different from each other: see the sources and citations below.

, Give thanks, take notes, think and muse on the scriptures, and so be in the right frame of mind to reach and receive inspirations.

Give.",How to Worship God as a Christian," Psalm 95:1 says ""Come let us sing for joy to the Lord, let us shout aloud to the rock of our salvation!"" Sometimes you won't feel like you are giving God much but try to learn to love to smile and try sing along to religious songs. Try to come away energized because you are devoting your time to Him and solely focused on Worshiping God and Jesus singing from your heart, and as Nehemiah 8:10 says ""The joy of the Lord will be your strength."";
, 2 Chronicles 7:14 says ""If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and forgive them their sin and heal their land."" According to Ephesians 6:18, God loves it when we come to him 'with all kinds of prayers and requests' and pray to him. Heart felt sincere prayers like ""My heart says of you 'seek his face!' Your face Lord I will seek"" (Psalm 27:8) are what God stokes on. God loves it when we worship him in devoted prayer. It's an awesome way to start the day because you find God's Holy Spirit fills you and you can't help but let your light shine to the rest of the world! (Aka the people around you.)

, That is how to worship God, and the Christian sacrifice is by offering bread and wine. In Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican Churches, the priest transubstantiates the Bread and Wine into the Literal Body and Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

, The next time you are praying to Him, have incense for your prayers.

, When praying to Him, have some quiet time, and in a darkened room, light a candle to show your reverence for Him.

, Hebrews 13:16 says ""And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased."" This is a form of worship. It's better to give than to receive. Give God and other people your time, skills, resources, money and love! It's such a great feeling empowering someone/making their day by doing something for them.

Decide why you are writing this prayer.,
Approach your letter with a sincere heart.,
Manage your expectations.,
Jot down some notes.,
Focus on one thing at a time.,
Avoid feeling pressured.,
Begin with gratitude.,
Praise God in your letter.,
Tell God your problems.,
End the letter.,
Send the letter to God.",How to Write a Prayer Letter to God," What is the purpose of your prayer? Are you asking God to forgive you, to praise him, or to thank him for something? Whatever the reason, knowing your motivation will help you know what to include in your prayer letter.


For example, if you are writing your prayer letter to ask God to guide you about a big decision at work, you can focus on that specific request when you have acknowledged that this is your main source of concern.;
, Praying is our way of communicating with the Lord. When you talk to God, you need to pray with your heart and your deepest sincerity.If you have ulterior motives or if you are not fully invested in your prayer, then there is little reason to pray in the first place.

, Praying to God doesn’t mean that you will automatically receive what you ask for. Sometimes God’s plan is bigger than our comprehension and only He can see that what we are asking for isn’t really what we need.God always answers our prayers, but sometimes it is just not in the way we expected.

, Think about what you want to say in your prayer letter and quickly take a few notes. This will help you stay on track while you’re writing your letter to God. Make a short outline regarding the topics you want to cover in your letter.


The act of writing in itself can be very cathartic and cleansing. Keeping your thoughts organized by taking a few notes ahead of time will ensure that you remember to discuss all of the pressing issues in your life.

, When we pray, it can often be easy to lose our train of thought or get sidetracked by some other idea that crosses your mind. When you write a prayer letter to God, you are able to focus on the task at hand and keep your thoughts organized.Think about one prayer item at a time and write about it in your letter. Don’t move on to the next topic until you’ve said what you want to say about each thing.
The Bible tells us that we should pray ceaselessly every day.This means that we should always be talking to God throughout the day. But writing a prayer letter is a great way to spend some focused time on one particular issue rather than thinking about all the things that happen in your life.
Focus on getting clarity on this one issue instead of trying to resolve too many things at once.

, Praying to God is a very personal experience. In this moment, you are free to converse with your Lord however you want to. You can discuss anything you want in any way that you want. Don’t feel pressure to do it a certain way. The important thing is to remember that there isn’t one right way to pray to God. This also applies to writing a prayer letter.

, No matter what is going on in your life, you always have something to be thankful for. Start your prayer letter by acknowledging God for all of the many blessings He has given you in your life.When you are thanking God in your prayer letter, you should start it off as “Dear Lord, I would like to thank you for ____________” and then write down whatever you would like to thank God for.

, The next step in your prayer letter is to praise God and acknowledge his love. You should tell Him that you love and respect Him.


Try writing something such as, “Lord, you are perfect in every way. I will always follow your rules and try to be the best servant to you that I can be.”

, Now is the time to write why you are ultimately praying to God in this letter. Tell him what is troubling you or share your joy with him. Whatever is on your heart, give it to God in this prayer letter.If you are praying to thank God, try writing something like this: “I am thanking you because _________________ and I am grateful, Lord.”
If you are praying to ask for forgiveness, write something like this: “I come to you humbled and subservient, asking for your forgiveness. I am a sinner, but you have saved me by your grace and offered me your love even though I am not worthy.”
If you are praying for guidance, briefly explain the situation that is troubling you and ask for His help. For example: “I am struggling with the decision about whether or not to take this new job offer. It is a great opportunity for me, but I am worried about how it will affect my family. Please guide me to the right path and let me know what is Your will for my life.”

, Once you have completed your purpose for writing the prayer letter and said everything you wanted to say, it is time to close your prayer. Bring the prayer to an end with a simple “Amen.”


You can sign your name at the end of the letter if you want. But it is not necessary since God will know who you are anyways.

, Of course you don’t have to do anything with your letter once you are finished writing it. However, if you want to mail your letter to God, you can send it to him in the mail!


Address the envelope as “To God, Jerusalem” and it will eventually be delivered to the famous Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, the holy site where Christians from around the world go to in order to pray to God."

Pray!",How to Share God's Word with Infants and Toddlers in the Church Nursery," Have everyone lay on the ground and pretend to fall asleep. As soon as you begin singing ""Rise and Shine,"" tots should rise up and sing with you. Play multiple rounds. You can also try a variety of ways to get up such as fast, slow, getting up and jumping, or spinning in circles.
, Place one toddler at a time in a laundry basket. Push them around the room, collecting toys and books in the laundry basket as you go. After you've collected a sufficient amount of toys, ride around and share the toys with others around the room. Talk about how much God likes it when we share., Sing this song to the tune of ""Farmer in the Dell"" as you blow bubbles, pretending that they're raindrops: ""The rain drops fell on me, the raindrops fell on me, the raindrops fell down from the cloud, God made them all you see."", Tape all of the pictures of Jesus on the wall around the room at a toddler's eye level. Encourage toddlers to walk around and find as many pictures of Jesus as they can. Point out that Jesus is with us everywhere., Ask the child ""Who's that?"" and ""Who made (name of child)?"" Point out all of his/her body parts, from hair to toes. Say ""That's your (name of body part). God made your (name of body part)!"", into a way to tell kids about Jesus. Don't just say ""Peekaboo!"" when you uncover your eyes, but instead, say ""Peekaboo! God made you!"" It's that simple, and saying that over and over will stick those words in a child's head., Have all toddlers get in a circle. Place stuffed or plastic animals around the room. Encourage every child to walk away from the circle, go find an animal, and bring it back to you. Once a child comes back to you with an animal, say ""Do you know what that is? God made (name of animal)!"", God made you!"" to reinforce the concept of Jesus rising from the dead. Place a figure of Jesus in a cup. Let all kids look inside. Tell them that Jesus died and was put in a dark cave. Tell everyone to cover their eyes with their hands. While their eyes are covered, pull Jesus out of the cup and set Him behind your back. Shout ""Peekaboo!"" and let everyone open their eyes. Show the empty cup, and then reveal Jesus from behind your back. Say ""Jesus isn't in the tomb--He's alive!"", Grab a stuffed animal bear or other animal from your nursery's collection. Sit in a circle with all the toddlers in your nursery. Give the bear to one child, and encourage that child to pass it on to another child. Point out how nice it is to share with friends. This is also a great game to play when two children are finding over a toy: encourage the child holding onto the toy to ""share"" it with the other child and encourage the other child to ""share"" it back with the person who gave it to his/her., Saying the same things over and over (""God loves you!"" and ""God made you!"") are great ways to instill those words into a child., Saying comforting words to a child who is tired, hurt, or sad helps the child begin to trust and feel comfortable with you. This also helps the child take another step toward trusting Jesus. If a child has just been hurt, try words such as ""It will feel better soon."" or ""Everything will be alright soon."" Words to a tired child might include ""Shhh, I know you're tired, but everything will be alright."", Cradle roll consists of songs and props. Almost every song has a prop or toy that is associated with it. Sometimes, every child gets a prop or toy to hold onto, and sometimes, the teacher just gets to hold something for everyone. Normally, children sit around a crescent-shaped table in seats while the teacher sits on the opposite side of the children. Cradle roll works for both infants and toddlers, although some verses may accommodate a specific age group better., Place all the children in seats or chairs. Have your props organized in boxes beside you. Consider writing songs on notecards and laminating them to have for every class., Sing this to the tune of ""Are You Sleeping?"" while pretending to ""look"" for every child and then finding them while peering through a paper towel tube: ""Where is (child's name)? Where is (child's name)? Did he/she come? Did he/she come? Come to cradle roll class, come to cradle roll class. There he/she is! There he/she is!"", Sing this to the tune of ""If You're Happy and You Know It"": ""Did you come to church in a car? Did you come to church in a car? Did you come to church, did you come to church, did you come to church in a car?"", Sing ""The B-I-B-L-E"" as you let each child gently pat a Bible. Emphasize how special the Bible is and how we must carefully turn the pages and carefully pat it., You don't have to go in order of days, just try the following ideas.

Glue a cotton ball to a popsicle stick. Sing the following to the tune of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" as children feel the ""cloud"": ""Fluffy, fluffy, little clouds; God made you so very proud. Up above the world so high, Like a lamb in the sky. Fluffy, fluffy, little clouds; God made you so very proud.""
Mix a bouquet of fake and real flowers together. Hold them up to each child to smell as you sing this to the tune of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"": ""Thank you God for the flowers that grow; Thank you God for the pretty rose. Thank you God for a daisy that's white; What a very pretty sight. Thank you God for the flowers that grow; Thank you God for the pretty rose.""
Attach glow-in-the-dark stars to the ceilings of your nursery. For infants under six months, glue the same stars that you glued to your ceiling onto a black glove. place the glove on your hand and position it above the infant's head. Encourage everyone older than 6 months to look up at the ceiling as you sing ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" but instead of singing ""How I wonder what you are"" sing ""God has put you where you are.""
Purchase a plastic toy fish for every child. Let them suck on their fish as you sing this song to the tune of ""The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round"": ""God made the fish to swim, swim, swim; swim, swim, swim; swim, swim, swim. God made the fish to swim, swim, swim; swim, swim, swim like this."" Let children place their fish in the water after you're done singing or play with the fish in the water for added fun.
Give children a toy animal that is preferably plastic. Sing this song to the tune of ""The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round"" for every different kind of animal as kids play: ""God made the (animal's name) to (something animal does), (something animal does), (something animal does); (something animal does), (something animal does), (something animal does); (something animal does), (something animal does), (something animal does). God made the (animal's name) to (something animal does), (something animal does), (something animal does); (something animal does), (something animal does), (something animal does) like this.""

, Try out these few ideas:

Give every child a baby doll to hold and rock as you sing this to the tune of ""Rock a Bye Baby"": Rock a Bye baby, God loves you so. He will never, let you go. God made you, and God made me; now go to sleep my dear baby.""
Hold out an unbreakable mirror for all children to see themselves in as you sing this verse to the tune of ""The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round"": You're a pretty little (girl/boy) and God made you; God made you, God made you. You're a pretty little (girl/boy) and God made you; with (a feature of the child such as hair or eye color) too!

, A caring environment can make a lasting impression on both child and parent. Train all workers to smile, be friendly and keep the conversation focused on the child and parent. Play music softly in the background., Cleanliness and safety show whether you care or not. Read How to Keep the Church Nursery Safe and How to Keep the Church Nursery Clean to make sure that you're keeping up with both. Who wants to be in a nursery with a stinky diaper smell or visible dirt and dust? Keep kids and parents coming back so that you can continue to help them grow in God's Word by keeping things both clean and safe.

Keep things looking attractive. An attractive nursery is an awesome nursery in the minds of children and their parents. Follow the below steps to make sure that your nursery is always looking attractive:
Choose how you paint carefully. The wall color could be a common light blue which has a benefit: it's a calming color. Or you could choose a more modern red which would make parents think ""clean!"" and ""updated!"" Consider having an artist paint a mural of Jesus and children, Noah's ark or another work of art on the wall.
Hang ribbons from the ceilings. Ribbons in pale colors add beauty and give newborns something to look at.
Make everything as neat as the first time a couple takes their newborn baby into the baby's room. Everything is perfectly neat and put there with love. Leave your nursery looking like that after every use.
All toys should be updated and modern. Electronic toys, brightly colored toys and toys recently made will catch a child's eye and make parents think of your nursery as an up-to-date place rather than unsafe because it's so outdated.
Neatly group toys on low shelves. Low shelves will be at a child's eyesight making them feel welcomed.
Provide the right equipment: high chairs, cribs, changing tables, a device that plays music, glider rockers, bottle warmers, baby bouncers, activity seats and children's tables are all necessary when caring for children.
Follow the steps in How to Keep the Church Nursery Clean after each use!

, Train all volunteers to properly care for infants and toddlers. Whether you're feeding a child, changing a diaper or even just carrying a toddler, there is a proper way to do it and incorrectly following a procedure may lead to a loss of trust from a child. Read the following articles to gain knowledge of how to properly care for the kids in your nursery:

, Yes, discipline is part of an important nursery ministry. Although it may cause you to think of punishment and crying kids, discipline, especially discipline in a church nursery, shouldn't be any of those things. Your primary goal is to keep all children safe and to help them learn about what God wants us to behave like. Take these steps to help little ones do the right thing and to help your nursery volunteers know how to handle discipline:

Read books to children about Christian behavior. Look for those that emphasize why we are to behave like this and how things turn out better if we do.
Create a short list of clear, concise rules for older toddlers to follow. A list of rules that looks like the following with colored pictures posted at a child's eye level where you can weekly review them is the best: Share with friends. Never hit, bite, kick or punch. Use kind words. Listen to the nursery volunteers(volunteer's names) and do what they say. Tell the truth.
Play games such as ""The Sharing Bear"" that review good behavior.
Prevent bad behavior by having a clean-up song to sing when picking up toys, hanging a mobile over the changing table and keeping activities fun and active.
If children start to fight over a toy, start playing ""The Sharing Bear"" before they explode.
Praise children for their efforts to do the right thing.
Offer alternatives. Say ""You can't bite friends, but you can bite this food"" or ""You can't hit other friends but you can hit this pillow."" Sometimes going into a quiet corner with a child and reading a book for a few minutes to help them calm down is a good idea.
If a child hurts another child, have one volunteer comfort the child that was hurt and have another volunteer take the child who hurt the other child and have a one-minute conversation with them. Say something like ""God doesn't want us to bite our friends. That hurts. You can ask for the toy back and tell me if someone isn't sharing, but you can't bite."" The child who hurt the other child may need to refrain from using that toy for the rest of class as a natural punishment for the wrongdoing.

,
NEVER force a toddler to apologize. They do not understand that concept.

, Collect Christian baby books, children's Christian storybooks, baby Bibles and toddler Bibles. Read to children individually and in groups. If a child looses interest halfway through a book, that's okay! Just try a different book or come back to it later.,, Mobiles can be hung above a changing table, crib or just on the ceiling.

Twist chenille wires into a circle. Use string to hang a balloon with the mouth and eyes of a fish on it and two clear Christmas ornaments as bubbles equally apart from the chenille wire circle. Tie string in all three places where the fish and bubbles are, and connect the strings above the mobile. Use a nail to push all of the string connected together into the ceiling. Say ""God made the fish to swim"" as you gently turn the mobile.
Purchase state-of-the-art mobiles form companies such as Fisher Price. Look for animals or people that you can point out who made them.

, Take a paper plate and use a permanent marker to draw six sections on it. Print out pictures of Jesus, food, water, parents, toys and the Bible. Glue one of each in each section. Point to a picture with the child, and say ""Thank you God for (food)."" Just point to an object and say these words for an infant but try to make things a bit more challenging for a toddler. Ask them to point to something and tell you what it is. Then, ask them who gave that thing to them. Thank God for His blessings., Prayer can be very powerful. Praying for the children in your nursery outside volunteering on Sunday's is very special and important. Praying with children is just as important, though. Pray a short prayer over infants and encourage toddlers to fold their hands and close their eyes with you. Say a short prayer, no longer than a couple sentences. Emphasize that you are talking to god and that He hears you."

Ask yourself which is more important: the specific words, or the meaning behind them.;
, Benedicta tu in mulieribus, et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus. Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen.

, This is a traditional Roman Catholic practice of reciting three Hail Marys in sequence as a petition for purity and other virtues. Say these Hail Marys after waking in the morning; say them before going to bed at night, after examining your conscience.Say the following prayers in succession—each punctuated by one standard Hail Mary—to honor Mary's power, wisdom, and mercy:


Say the following words before the first Hail Mary: Oh, Immaculate Mary, Virgin most Powerful, I beseech you, through that immense Power which you have received from the Eternal Father, obtain for me purity of heart; strength to overcome all the enemies of my soul; and the special favor I implore in my present necessity. (Name the favor). Mother most pure! Forsake me not, despise not my prayer, graciously hear me for God's glory, your honor, and the welfare of my soul. To obtain this favor I honor your Power by reciting: (say the Hail Mary).

Say these words to frame the second Hail Mary: Oh Virgin Mary, My Mother, through that ineffable Wisdom bestowed upon you by the Incarnate Word of God, I humbly beseech you, obtain for me meekness and humility of heart; a perfect knowledge of the divine will; and strength to accomplish it always. Oh Mary, Seat of Wisdom; as a tender Mother, lead me in the path of Christian virtue and perfection; enlighten and enable me to do what is most pleasing to your beloved Son; and obtain my petition. To obtain this grace I honor your Wisdom by reciting: (say the Hail Mary).

Repeat this phrase to preface the third Hail Mary: Oh, Mother of Mercy, Mother of penitent sinners, I stand before you sinful and sorrowful, beseeching you through the immense love given to you by the Holy Spirit for us poor sinners, obtain for me true and perfect contrition for my sins, which I hate and detest with all my heart, because I love God. Mother most merciful, help me in my present necessity. Turn then those eyes of mercy toward us, oh clement, oh loving, oh sweet Virgin Mary! To obtain this precious gift, I honor Your loving mercy by reciting: (say the Hail Mary).


, You can say Hail Marys anywhere, but you may be able to reach a deeper level of reflection if you set aside a peaceful, intentional space for the words. Some people like to say the prayer in a quiet, solitary room; some people prefer to recite a Hail Mary in church or other group prayer sessions. Find a place and time that make you feel peaceful, comfortable, and meditative.

, It is traditional to kneel while reciting a Hail Mary, although you can also say the words while standing. Either way, keep your back straight and your head upright. Face something meaningful: an altar, a picture or statue of Mary, or anything that you feel enhances the power of the words you're about to say.


If you kneel, put your knees on a prayer bench, on a pillow, or directly on the floor. If you stand, try to keep your legs straight, in a solid stance. Either way, try not to focus on your legs – focus on the words and the intention behind them.

, The rosary is a Catholic sequence of prayers that Mary, the Mother of Jesus, asked us to remember; it is a meditation on the mysteries of Jesus' life. The prayers are performed on a string of beads used to count each prayer. You can buy a rosary online, at some churches, or at certain Catholic-serving markets. If you can't find a rosary, try making your own.

, This phrase precedes the Hail Mary, and it serves to set an intention for the prayer. By dedicating your words to the Holy Trinity, you acknowledge that you are not praying to Mother Mary, per se, but rather asking her to pray to God with you., Hold your pressed hands in front of your chest. Point your fingertips up. This is a classic ""prayer pose"". By pressing your hands together, you focus your physical and spiritual energy into one spot so that you can make the Hail Mary as meaningful as possible.

, The Hail Mary prayer—also called the Angelic Salutation—is a traditional Catholic prayer asking for the intercession of the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus. In Roman Catholicism, the prayer forms the basis of the Rosary and the Angelus prayers. In the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, a similar prayer is used in formal liturgies, both in Greek and in translations. It is also used by many other groups within the Catholic tradition of Christianity – including Anglicans, Independent Catholics, and Old Catholics.


Some Protestant denominations, such as Lutherans, also make use of a form of the prayer.

, Many Catholics believe that although Mary was a godly young woman, and greatly blessed to bear the Savior, she was not divine. Mary was not sinless, according to this narrative; as such, you should not worship, venerate, or pray to her. Others, however, place much more reverence upon Our Lady, and assert that devotion to Mary is a way to get closer to God., The text of the Hail Mary prayer incorporates two Bible passages: “Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee"" (Luke 1:28) and “Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb"" (Luke 1:42). The third part of the Hail Mary prayer is not from the Bible; indeed, many believe that it exists in direct contradiction to Scriptural truth: “Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.”


The first passage (Luke 1:28) is the Angel Gabriel’s greeting to Mary. He said these words when he came to inform her that she had been chosen to bear the Messiah.
The second passage (Luke 1:42) cites the greeting that Mary's cousin Elizabeth gave her when Mary came to visit. Elizabeth was also pregnant at the time – with John the Baptist."
"
Realize that all human beings will eventually reap whatever they sow.,
Understand that no one is perfectly good, and so no one deserves a perfectly good life.,
Admit that, ""There is no one righteous, no not one.,
Avoid feeling entitled to only good things, but instead, feel grateful that you get any blessings at all, considering all that you may have done.,
Remember that Satan is, for too many, the people's choice as their ruler in this world playing a game of ""keep away"" and family/and national feuds.,
Realize that Satan hates the pure and good, The Truth and, therefore, likes to make life much harder than it would have been.,
Know that evil is limited: ""Resist the devil and he will flee from you"", from God's power (James 4:7): Use the power of God's Holy Spirit to seek and save the lost for as long as it takes:


""Rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them!,
Realize that people often hurt other people, because we are all born with a sin nature.,
Understand that all humans have a free will.",How to Understand Why God Allows Evil (Christianity)," Paul says, ""Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction."" (Galatians 6:7-8). Pleasing oneself in any sin leads to death and destruction: We have death of a marriage, death of our health, death of your own finances or of national/world economies, death of opportunity/freedom, death of friendship and relationships in all our lives,...


Some area of your life will die or suffer due to any sin that members of a family, ""tribe"" or nation commit. It has a wave or a ripple effect touching all. God lets us learn the hard way about the consequences of sins, just as parents may let their kids learn the hard way, because often times, we do not learn to desire real change unless it is the hard way.;
, People often ask the question, ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" But, first one needs to answer this: ""Is anyone really 'good'?"" If someone were completely good, then one might reap only good things. But, the fact is that there are no perfectly ""good"" people alive. God is the only being that is perfectly good.

,"", as Jesus said. Because God is a just God and He hates sin -- we all, as human beings, deserve punishment for our sins, death and Hell. One way to look at it, is to wonder,


""How can good things ever happen to bad people?"", such as we actually are. The fact that good things ever happen to us should make us unbelievably grateful to God for His grace. Instead of focusing on the bad things in your life, focus on the good, on the blessings.

, In some cases, if bad things happen, people in the family may have caused it, even back to great-grandparents, where the curse of sinful behavior has not been broken. It often has its influence to the second or third generation. None can live in sin and not expect to reap the consequences of sin, such as health issues from food, drug or alcohol abuse or diseases from sexual immorality, etc. naturally passed down as consequences.

, Paul says, ""The god of (the people of this adulterous) age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the Gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God."" (2 Corinthians 4:4). The ""god of this age"" refers to Satan being followed by the masses who do not honor or obey God, but instead many blame God for widespread need, envy and pride.


When man was created, God gave mankind stewardship and dominion over the earth, to care for it and rule over it. But, when Adam and Eve disobeyed God's law and chose to obey pride and lust, they and too many of their descendants gave their choice of allegiance, power and dominion to Satan's way, by default. Now instead of man ruling Earth, man's longstanding enemy, Satan in his evil way rules it, as chosen by our self-centered choices. This is another main reason why there is so much evil and pain in the world. Satan is evil, and so his followers choose evil and spread it over all the world.

, Often times when bad things happen, people get mad at God. But, we all need to realize that a lot of the pain that we suffer is caused by Satan -- because he expects us to disbelieve and blame God.


Satan wants to kill you and destroy you. Jesus said, ""The thief comes only to steal, kill and destroy."" It could be said that he is jealous of human beings, because the Bible says he once had been the apple of God's eye, but now we humans are. Satan knows his fate, of someday being chained in Hell forever, and so he is angry about it. Therefore, he seems to take his anger out on man by interfering with God's plan for redemption of lost human beings.

, But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short."" (Revelation 12:12). Satan was banished from Heaven before man was created, because he tried to overthrow God. He was thrown down to Earth where he's most active in the spirit dimension.
Only God knows why he cast Satan here, to Earth, and not somewhere else, but there are many such things we will never understand fully in this lifetime. Paul said, ""For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known."" (1 Corinthians 13:12). We may not understand in this life why God has done what He has, but in Heaven we will understand it all. Everything will make sense when we get to Heaven.

, Every human being alive is born with an evil sin nature, which was passed down from Adam and Eve.


Paul said, ""Just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous."" (Romans 5:19). Even with Christ making those who believe in Him righteous, all human beings still struggle with the flesh, which is our innate sin nature. God sees Christians as righteous, because they are covered by Jesus' blood, but they won't be completely righteous until Heaven.
Paul says, ""I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it."" (Romans 7). Also he says, ""For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do what you want to."" (Galatians 5:17). Every human being alive struggles with the flesh, our sin nature that we were born with -- since, through Adam, all humans were made sinners.
Now, there is so much evil in the world, partly because of the sins that we ourselves commit against one another. Every time we lie, cheat, gossip, vent anger, etc. we add more evil to the world.

, God could force all human beings to be holy and good, but He does not. God gives all human beings a free will.


The reason why God gives humans a free will is because He wants us to have a choice of whether we want to follow Him or not. Just like we would not want someone to be obligated or forced to love us, neither does God. God does not want us to be robots and to follow Him with no ability to choose; so, He gave Adam and Eve the choice to follow Him or not, and He gives every human being alive that choice. When we don't choose to follow or obey God, we choose to follow the ways of sin instead, and so make the world more evil.
Paul says, ""If by the Spirit you put to death the misdeed of the body, you will live."" And not only will you live, if you do this, but everyone around you will live better too. Our decision to follow God's laws or not greatly affects everyone around us. For example, if someone goes against God's command to not commit adultery and does commit adultery, he or she ruins that marriage and scars the spouse and children for life, as well. So another big reason that there is evil in the world is because, of our own free will, people cause unbelievable amounts of evil to those around us all the time. But, it need not be so.

Check a question behind highly ordered laws of science: that is, why is the universe so orderly?,
Consider that our universe is so orderly as to be based on fixed laws.,
Record data as scientists do with what they observe.,
Observe that there is no logical necessity for the universe to obey fixed rules, let alone abide by the rules of mathematics.,
Imagine an unpredictable universe in which conditions change from instant to instant, or even a universe in which things ""pop in and out"" of existence.,
Study how the universe follows laws in keeping with the rationality and majesty of God the creator.,
Consider that the fundamental constants of physics fall within a scope of combinations that could be discovered by intelligent life, as an indication of the orderliness of the universe.

,
Realize that the Judaeo-Christian God is not the same one as the others or the same as believing in multiple gods, each affecting the universe by their whims and temperaments.,
Check into the concept of the discoverable, well formed, orderly universe that is rational and predictable and that may lead into the worldview of a consistent God.,
Consider such discoveries as Kepler's third law stating that the square of the time of a planet's revolution is proportional to the cube of its mean distance from the sun.,
Research Newton and find what he thought:~ ""Newton and many of his contemporaries believed that in doing science they were uncovering the divine plan for the universe in the form of its underlying mathematical order."",
Examine a list of some leading Christian scientists whose work was in the frame of their faith, e.g., Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Brahe, Descartes, Boyle, Newton, Leibniz, Gassendi, Pascal, Mersenne, Cuvier, Harvey, Dalton, Faraday, Herschel, Joule, Lyell, Lavoisier, Priestley, Kelvin, Ohm, Ampere, Steno, Pasteur, Maxwell, Planck, Mendel.",How to Use Laws of Science to Discover Faith," For the Christian physicists, cosmologists and biologists, who laid much of the foundation of modern science, there was a clear answer: there exists a Creator of everything who is the rational, loving God.;
, How is it that we can identify laws of nature that are not variable?


All of science is based on what author James Trefil calls~ The Principle of Universality -- as he states it: ""It says that the laws of nature we discover here and now in our laboratories are true everywhere in the universe and have been in force for all time.""Cosmologist Sean Carroll comments,~ ""A law of physics is a pattern that nature obeys without exception."", To do so, most often they are not words only. The laws of nature can often be measured and computed in the language of mathematics.

, The speed of light measures the same 186,000 miles (299,000 km) per second, no matter if the light comes from a child's flashlight or a star that's galaxies away. There is a measurable speed of light that doesn't change.


Physicist Eugene Wigner states that
~ the mathematical underpinnings of nature ""is something bordering on the mysterious and there is no rational explanation for it.""Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winner for quantum electrodynamics, said,~ ""Why nature is mathematical is a mystery...The fact that there are rules at all is a kind of miracle."", Instead, scientists cling to their long-held faith in the fundamental rationality of the cosmos. A study confirmed,~ ""One of the most important numbers in physics, the proton-electron mass ratio, is the same in a galaxy six billion light years away as it is here on Earth, according to new research, laying to rest debate about whether the laws of nature vary in different places in the Universe."", Just as God is constant, unchanging, there is a constant nature of science. They believed that God made the universe to operate lawfully, according to divine reason and with glorious beauty.

,, Polytheistic societies believed in gods that were inconsistent, unsearchable and in nature governed by gods who were not knowable by ordinary people. The polytheist's universe was a mystery as were their gods.

, Followers of Jesus Christ believe the God that is rational, wise and willing to be known, seeing him to be self-disclosing in Jesus Christ. Throughout the Bible are statements such as:~ ""For what can be known about God is plain to the people, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made."", How could anyone have figured that out? Kepler did, in large part because he was convinced that there had to be a beautiful mathematical relationship that was hidden and waiting to be discovered--put in place by the orderly God whose intellect is far beyond man's. Today, even the most secular of scientists presumes that nature embodies not only order but simple beauty.

,,


These Christians in science were convinced that God created the universe so that it is mathematically measured, leading to precise and valuable scientific discoveries.

Leave your worldly lifestyle and cry out to God on your knees.,
Seek Jesus in prayer.,
Wait for Jesus to talk to you.,
Repent: of sins.,
Listen and let Jesus show you the truth.,
Be Baptized in the name of Jesus the Messiah and ask for the gift of the Holy Spirit.",How to Seek the Presence of Jesus Christ in your Life," People are living a worldly lifestyle, suiting their own dreams, goals, and desires. Some people also have severe depression, which makes their lives very dark and desperate, but if you are humble and cry out to Jesus, and repent, (which means to turn away from your sins in your heart fully) then he will hear you, speak to you, and help you like he did for me. But you have to put Jesus first in your life, and seek a relationship with him, then you will come to know his voice. You need to be willing to open your heart to the love of Christ.;
, Cry out to him, he will hear you, and answer you if you mean it! Ask Jesus to save you and forgive you of your sins, and wash you whiter than snow, however you must leave all your sins. In prayer to Jesus, you must repent of your ways, and decide to put Jesus first. Jesus will give you peace, a deep peace, and instantly the depression and the darkness will simply disappear, as it did for me.

, Jesus will talk to you, when you draw near to Him. He will show you how you need to abide with him, lay your faith in him, and leave your way. He will show you that to be serious, one has to lay aside their own way, and take up their cross and follow him! He will show you that no sin enters the kingdom of heaven, and that only if we repent and come to him for a personal relationship, which is true faith, can we enter the narrow gate to life!

, Jesus will let you know that he forgives all sins in the past, and if we make mistakes, he forgives them also IF we repent and stop doing them, however we must not go and live in sin again, or we will be lost if we don't repent, and thus end up in Hell if we die in our sins!
, Many people have gone to hell, because they left it too late to repent and get to know him. Many don't want to have a relationship with him, because many people would rather continue living the way of this world, or being religious by studying the Bible and basing a doctrine on certain verses, yet not seeking him for real in prayer and commitment, as Jesus said in John 5:39. You need to seek him like you would a real person, because Jesus is alive and risen from the dead, is in heaven as King, and can hear and speak to us. He will soon return for those who accept him as their King and Saviour, and are faithful. Read Jesus's words in the Bible and obey them, and by your faith, you will be justified, and he will add your name in the Book of Life which is in heaven.
, For God will give you this gift to give you power from heaven to do his will on earth, and to lead you. The most common sign of this gift is to begin speaking in other tongues that the Holy Spirit will give you, among other gifts. Then you can pray in other tongues. This prayer is very powerful, for it is the Spirit of God praying through you. As it is said, ""Today is the day of Salvation.""

Live a good life.",How to Repent," Remember: you can lie to other people and you can lie to yourself, but you cannot lie to God. If you really want to repent, you need to be humble and ready to admit that you don't always do the right thing. Be humble before God and know in your heart that He is right and you should live by His word.;
, You have to believe that God can forgive you and help you to lead a better life. If you do not, you will quickly lose motivation to correct your mistakes. Changing bad habits and righting wrongs is hard and you have to believe that God is there with you or you will falter., Think about all of the sins you have committed and all of the things you have done wrong. Don't limit yourself to the big things like cheating or stealing: all sins are equal in God's eyes. Sometimes writing your sins down can be helpful. You don't have to make your list all at once, either. It's better to take your time and be thorough.

, Before you repent, it's important to think about why what you did was wrong. Blindly following God's word only shows Him that you do not appreciate what you did was wrong. Think about the people that you hurt when you sin and think about what sin does to your soul (hint: it's not good for you!). Think about the bad things that that guilt leads you to do. This is an important step!

, Make sure that when you repent, you do it for the right reasons. If you think that you should repent so that God will grant you some unrelated wish, you're not repenting for the right reasons. Repent because it is good for your soul and will make your life more enjoyable and productive, not because you want worldly possessions, riches, or other things like that from God. That's not what God is for.

, When you go to repent, begin by reading the holy text of your sect (the Bible, the Qur'an, the Torah, etc). Read the passages that deal with repenting but also read more fully of the text, to help God's word enter into your heart and give your guidance. When we sin, we sin because we have lost our way. You need to find God's path so that you can walk it again.


The Christian Bible has many passages that deal with repenting, including Matthew 4:17, and Acts 2:38 and 3:19.
The major passage in the Quran that deals with repentance is At-Tahriim 66:8.
Jews can find passages on repentance in Hosea 14:2-5, Proverbs 28:13, and Leviticus 5:5.

, Your spiritual adviser, such as a pastor, priest, imam, or rabbi will be able to help you to confess and make things right with God. Remember, their job is to help you on your journey with God! They are happy to help and they understand that man is not perfect: they will not judge you! Even if you are not officially in their congregation, you can ask for advice and set up time to meet with them, so don't feel bad talking to an adviser that you don't know.


Don't feel like you have to go to a house of God to repent, however, or that you need to talk to an adviser for God to hear you. God hears just as much from you as a religious leader. You can repent completely on your own if you want to.

, When you repent, the main thing to do is to change your behavior. You have to stop committing the sins for which you wish to repent. This is hard, we know, but you can do it! It will usually take time and a few mistakes, but if you really mean it and you really wish to repent, you will be able to overcome.

, Changing on your own can be really hard. It's okay if you need more that just a love of God in your heart! Admitting you need help will please God, as it shows that you are humble. You can join a support group, consult with a spiritual adviser, join a congregation, or seek doctors and other professionals. Getting help from people outside your church or religion does not displease God: He has helped them to gain the gifts they have for a reason!

, Another important part of repenting is making right the things you did. You can't just say sorry and then never suffer the consequences. If you stole something, you need to tell the person you stole from and pay them back. If you lied and someone got in trouble because of your lie, you need to tell the truth and help that person. If you cheated on a test, you need to tell your teacher and talk to them about what consequences they think are right. Do whatever you have to do to help the people that were hurt by you. This will please God.

, Take lessons from the sins you are trying to correct, to help avoid making similar mistakes in other areas. Make your mistakes mean something by helping you avoid other problems in your life. For example, if you lied about cheating on a test and you want to really make that lesson mean something, make sure you don't lie about other things either.

, Another way to make your sins serve a greater purpose is to help others learn from your mistakes. Sometimes this means going and talking to people about what you did, but you can also actively help solve the problems that led you to sin. For example, if you sinned by doing drugs, consider volunteering with a local drug clinic or supporting legislation that helps combat this problem in your community.

, After you have repented, you should take the opportunity and work as hard as you can to live a life that pleases God. Different religions and denominations have different things to say about what pleases God, but read the text and think about how you feel too. If God is in your heart, he will lead you to the right answer.

, One thing that you can do that will please God and help keep you from returning to sin is to formally enter and be active in your religious community. For example, get baptized if you have not been already (and you are Christian). Go to services regularly, give money to your organization so that they can help others, and talk with the other members in your community about God's path. Help and love your brothers and God will be pleased.

, You should take an active role in protecting your soul in the future. Confess regularly and deal with your sins as often as possible. Watch out for things that you know lead you into temptation and stay away from people who don't have your best interest in mind. Keep reading the holy text and let God's light lead you down the best path for you.

, You are not perfect and you will make mistakes. God knows this. When you know it too, that is when you know that you are humble. Don't lose sleep at night worrying about what you might do to displease God. What matters to Him is that you try to that you make things right when you don't quite make it.

, Sins are mistakes that lead us to hurt others and hurt ourselves. When we live a life free of sin, not only do we please God and preserve our souls for eternity, we also make our lives happier and more fulfilling. This is why it's important to take sin head-on. If you're doing something that makes you unhappy or leads to hurting other people, stop! By bringing your soul the comfort of forgiveness, you'll lead a much happier life.

Listen to the preachers: The first recorded words spoken by John the Baptist ((Matthew3:2) Jesus (Matthew 4:17,Mark 1:15) and the 12 when they were sent out was to repent (Mark 6:12) and was echoed by Peter after Pentecost.,
Find the meaning: Repent in the new testament always means to change your mind in the original Greek, never to merely feel sorry which is a modern non Biblical meaning.,
Change: Repenting involves turning away from the old and toward the new.,

Recognise that you've fallen short: Whether you're young or old or been a ""good"" person or a ""bad"" person, understand that no one matches up to the Glory of God.,
Godly Sorrow: Sorrow can lead to repentance (Deciding to do things God's way) or it can lead to disappointment.,
Be humble: Repenting will involve admitting you are wrong about things concerning God.,
Don't be passive: Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.,
Expect to be rewarded: But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.,
Prepare to be baptised: Baptism is an outward sign that a person is prepared to listen to God's word and do it.,
Ask and Seek and Knock: This is God's will.,
Don't stop seeking God until your repentance has been accepted: The disciples knew that God had granted repentance to Cornelius and his family and friends when they heard them speaking in tongues like they (Peter and his friends) had at the beginning (Acts 11:15-18) (Acts 10:44-46)

,
Keep following Jesus teachings and doings: Once your repentance has been accepted by God then stay humble and do what Jesus said to do which is to love one another (John 13:34-35)and preach the gospel and heal the sick (Matthew 10:7-8)and that you must remain righteous (Matthew 5:20)",How to Repent According to the Bible," (Acts 2:38);

If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?

Consider that when kids were free to pray by, for example, rotating that student activity to various clubs and individuals, for perhaps a minute on the school PA (public address) system during homeroom each day, or while assembled at a school function, so that the Lamb of God was believed by many to hear the prayers (the others, not believing, did not take away the prayer from those that believed; they seemed to coexist just fine, until 1970s):

That was not against any rule before He the Lamb was quashed and scrammed, so to speak, by court rulings.

Show regard for students to express their concepts and to pray: Following to the ""Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment"", realize that the courts have consistently ruled that students' expressions of religious views through prayer or otherwise can not be abridged (shortened or stopped) unless they can be shown to cause substantial disruption in the school.,

, The belt of truth involves two places; our hearts and our minds. Truth keeps us secure in Christ and makes effective all the other pieces of armour. The belt of truth holds our amour in place. Commit yourself daily to walk in the light of God's truth. ""Teach me your ways, O Lord, that I may live according to your truth!"" Psalm 86:11

The shoes God gives propel us onward to proclaim the true peace, which is available in Christ. Prepare yourself to follow the Lord no matter what.

, Ephesians 6:16 - The shield not only defends our whole body but also our armor. The shield of faith has a very specific function, which the Bible makes abundantly clear: quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. Not some but all of them. The shield moves with the attack no matter the direction.

Understand that ""Original Sin"" and ""fall/redemption"" were very minor even to Augustine's theology.,
See that these concepts were seized upon for political reasons.,
Know that Christ died for your sins.,
Embrace the Biblical concept of Original Blessing.",How to Recognize the Fallacy of Death Centric Western Christian Models," This can be verified on the web, since the following quote from Original Blessing is a bit unclear without some study aids. These were postulated based on what is now widely viewed as misinterpretation by him. ""In Paul's Letter to the Romans he says, 'Therefore, as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, so death spread to all men because all men sinned.' And using a faulty Latin translation which left out the word ""death"" he translates as follows: 'Through one man sin entered into the world and through sin, death, and thus spread to all men, in whom all have sinned.' (Contra Julianum)"" Matthew Fox, Original Blessing
It should be clear from this that John did not mean what Augustine said. You are a sinner when you sin, and not before.


It is well known that the Council of Trent insisted on the doctrine of Original Sin; yet the doctrine of Original Blessing is a far more ancient and Biblical doctrine. The Council did not deny this (nor could it); nor did they ever say what Original Sin even means.
Understand how this doctrine disagrees with so much of the rest of the Bible; the 'age of accountability', etc., and see that you are responsible for your sins, and that it isn't possible for a baby to sin.
What does God say? ""...the LORD said in his heart, “I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intention of man’s heart is evil from his youth."" Genesis 8:21
Which may sound like a condemnation to someone unfamiliar with God's condemnation; but the important part of this verse for us at the moment is the from his youth part. You are not ""born a sinner"" in the sense that Western Christianity teaches; and it doesn't matter if you are an atheist or have never been in a church, this founding premise has become baked into your assumptions.;
, An exaggerated doctrine of Original Sin, as used for a starting point for spirituality, plays kindly into the hands of empire builders, slave-masters, etc. It divides (and therefore conquers), pitting your thoughts against your feelings, your body against your spirit, and your country against the world.


""The harm that has been done to souls during the centuries of Christianity, first by the literal interpretation of the story of Adam, and then by the confusion of this myth, treated as history, with later speculations, principally Augustinian, about Original Sin, will never be adequately told.""Paul Ricoeur, The Symbolism of Evil

This is ""dualism"", recognized by sages from Eckhart to Daly as ""the sin behind all sin."" Separation. Subject/object relationships.
""Pleasure"" becomes ""sin"" with this model. Leave it to an Accuser to turn pleasure into sin. An actual (Catholic) test for sin is ""did you enjoy it?""
The U.S. is currently (still) the dominant world power; the professed theology of the U.S. is Christianity, of the Western stripe. The 'center' of this theology is 'Original Sin' and 'fall/redemption,' and you may witness the fruit of Western Christian theology simply by turning on the news. Understand that your 'Christian' leaders are the world's largest arms dealers.
Fall/redemption centricity describes our fascination with skulls.
It's why we like to wear black, v ""~always wearing white~""

""When a man's ways are pleasing to the LORD, he makes even his enemies live at peace with him."" Proverbs 16:7
Does this sound like a proper characterization of the U.S.?


""Throughout Christian history the conviction that man's birthright is sin has encouraged an unrealistic acceptance of remediable social evils, or even a callousness about human suffering. It helps to explain the easy acceptance of slavery and serfdom, and a record of religious atrocity unmatched by any other religion.""Professor Herbert J. Muller

""A spirituality that preaches resignation under official brutalities, servile acquiescence in frustration and sterility, and total submission to organized injustice is one which has lost interest in holiness and remains concerned only with a spurious notion of 'order.'""Thomas Merton Bystander


, This article doesn't seek to negate this, but to restore a proper balance between ""Have life more abundantly"" and this. See that virtually every time you have heard a Christian message in the West it was
""Christ died
Christ died for your
Christ died
Christ died
Christ died for your""
well guess what that only took three days.
You should run screaming from this distortion.
Christ rose, and lives. There is Life after Salvation.


""The fall/redemption spiritual tradition is not nearly as ancient as is the creation~centered one. The former goes back principally to St. Augustine (354-430 AD); to Thomas a' Kempis, who said, 'Every time I go into creation I withdraw from God' (?); to Cardinal Bossuet; Cotton Mather; and Father Tanquerry.
The creation~centered tradition traces its roots to the 9th century BC, with the very first author of the Bible, the Yahwist or J source, to the Psalms, to Wisdom Books of the Bible, to much of the Prophets, to Jesus and much of the New Testament, and to the very first Christian theologian in the west, St. Irenaeus (c. 130-200 AD).
...Luther says, drawing on ancient tradition, that there are three articles of faith: 1)Creation; 2)Redemption; 3)Sanctification. Yet if we skip over creation--which Protestant and Catholic theology has been doing for four centuries--then is not redemption distorted? And sanctification as well?""Original Blessing, Matthew Fox

Ever been quoted to from ""Song of Songs""? Why not, we wonder?
Trust that God delights in your unique way of producing fruit.

, God is our Creator, and we are ""to be like gods"" (Eph 4:24 et al) Imagine a creating god asking you if you brushed for the full 3 minutes...or pointing out that you shouldn't _____; or condemning you for being _____. Is there a time and place for that, from a god? Arguably. Is it a primary place? See that God is not your Accuser.


Is this the Christianity that you are comfortable with? You should be compelled to follow God because you have seen ""Life, more abundantly"" demonstrated to you.
There are many creation-centered churches that understand ""Life, more abundantly,"" or you can start one yourself or with like minded people.
You'll know ""Life, more abundantly"" as soon as you see it, if you have been in a death-centric church unawares.
Hence to Dabhar, the Word of God.
We are going to assume for brevity's sake that you would be comfortable with ""Word of God"" (Hebrew Dabhar) being translated ""Creative Energy of God"", even if you are a Western Christian; God's word ""does not return to (Him) void,"" meaning that when God says it, it is going to happen; His word (and yours!) is literally ""creative energy."" Let's take a look at John 1 through this much more meaningful lens:
""In the beginning was the Creative Energy:
The Creative Energy was with God
and the Creative Energy was God.
It was with God in the beginning.
Through it all things came to be,
not one thing had its being but through it.
All that came to be had life in it
and that life was the light of persons,
a light that shines in the dark,
a light that darkness could not overpower...
The Creative Energy was the true light
that enlightens all people;
and it was coming into the world.
It was in the world
that had its being through it,
and the world did not know it...
But to all who did accept it
it gave power to become children of God...
The Creative Energy was made flesh,
it pitched its tent among us,
and we saw its glory,
the glory that is its as the only Child of the Creator,
full of grace and full of truth.""John 1:1-5,9,10,12,14
Kinda takes on a whole new meaning, doesn't it?
When you can accept this as a Christian Manifesto, where is fall/redemption in this model? ""And the world did not know it,"" that one line, about 3/4 of the way through, and the next, ""but to all who did accept it...""
This is only a partial illumination of the Hebrew word Dabhar; in Hebrew, the word is also used for law and commandments, so a slightly more complete meaning might be Creative Energy, with Law and Commandments; and then you should probably read several books on it, or none, to begin to grasp Dabhar.Dabhar is where it all happens.
When you are busy Dabharing (which includes quite a bit of work, actually, of the joyful kind...when you get really committed, you're prepared to die), and creatively, joyfully playing in God's creation for you, fall/redemption will assume its proper, undistorted place.
Add Proverbs 8:22-31 ""ever at play in His Presence...""
Psalms 104:33 ""...I mean to play for my God as long as I live.""
Psalms 47:7 ""God is King of the whole world; play your best in His honor!""
Even though these might technically refer to the playing of an instrument, they should also be read as alliteration.
""For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death."" Rom 8:2
All good deeds that are prompted by hope of happiness in the next world cease to be moral."" Mahatma Gandhi
(We would have preferred a pithy quote from a Western Christian mystic, but they are all quoting Gandhi)Creation is continuous, and never stops

Find the promises given by Jesus about receiving power from God.,
Notice that the verse in Luke associates power with ""the promise of my (Jesus) Father"" and the one in Acts associates the power with receiving the Holy Spirit.

,
Notice that in Acts 1:4-5 Jesus identified the promise of the Father as the baptism of the Holy Spirit, so that we can now see that the ""power"" comes from the same source: the baptism (or receiving) of the Holy Spirit.,
Seek more information on how to receive this power, the Holy Spirit, go to How to Receive the Holy Spirit as per The Bible.,
Understand that when you receive the Holy Spirit you've entered into something so big it's beyond comprehension.. And I pray that you and all God’s holy people will have the power to understand the greatness of Christ’s love—how wide, how long, how high, and how deep that love is.,
Use the power to heal the sick.,
Use the power to preach God's word.,
Use the power to rejoice in the Spirit.,
Use the power to give witness to Jesus and attract people to God.,
Use the power to give witness of salvation.,
Understand also that this power comes with some conditions.",How to Receive Power from God (Christianity)," They are in Luke 24:49 ""And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high"", and Acts 1:8 ""But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."";
,, In Acts 2:4 The disciples received power when they received the Holy Spirit; they also spoke in tongues. In Acts 2:38 Peter tells us how to receive power by telling us how to receive the Holy Spirit.

,

Then when you have received the power from God you can start using it to glorify God and win people to Him, Christ’s love is greater than anyone can ever know, but I pray that you will be able to know that love. Then you can be filled with everything God has for you. With God’s power working in us, he can do much, much more than anything we can ask or think of. Ephesians 3:18-20

, John 14:12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. Ephesians 3:20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us

, Acts 1:8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. Corinthians 2:4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:

, Romans 15:13 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. Timothy 1:7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.

, John 2:23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. Acts 8:6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. Thessalonians 1:5 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.

, Romans 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. Corinthians 1:18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.

,


This power is not power or authority over other people.(see Matthew 20:25-28)
The power is always to promote and glorify Jesus name, never for personal glory.(John 7:18, 2 Corinthians 10:17-18)
Neither does it make the person more important than other people Jesus said ""he who humbles Himself shall be exalted"".(Luke 14:11)
Receiving power is not an excuse to do wrong rather it gives us strength to do right ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens (empowers) me"".(Philippians 4:13)(see also Philippians 4:8)

"
Know the context of the Lord’s prayer.,
Choose for example to go into your room, close your door and pray to Jesus.,
Keep the recitation of the Lord's prayer concise.,
Meditate on the Lord’s prayer.",How to Pray to Jesus1," This prayer is directed toward God; however, Jesus in John 10:30 says “I and my Father are one”. The Lord’s prayer is found in Matthew 5-7. These passages also contain the Sermon on the Mount and Beatitudes (blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted). The sermon on the mount is about the importance of God’s place in the inner life as opposed to doing religion for appearances.


Jesus condemns the religious officials who have been showing off their righteousness in public.
Jesus says true righteousness belongs to those who are the lowest: those who mourn, those who are poor, those who are meek, even though they do not give the appearance of righteousness. For example, Jesus says in Matthew 6:5 “Whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray while standing in synagogues and on street corners so that people can see them."";
, This is one of Jesus’ instructions in Matthew 6:6 on how to pray. Jesus goes on to say, “And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.” Find a room or a private space where you can be alone, and pray to God there. Feel comforted by the presence of God ""who sees in secret.”


This is not the only place you can pray. You can also “pray without ceasing” (wherever you may be you can be prayerful) as Paul writes in 1 Thessalonians.
Paul also described speaking in tongues as a good way to pray He said "" I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all"" 1 Corinthians 14:18 (See also 1 Corinthians 14:2,4-5, and14-15)

, Jesus in Matthew 6:7 says “When you pray, do not babble repetitiously like the Gentiles, because they think that that by their many words they will be heard.” During this time people may have been praying using certain rituals, recitations, and incantations, but you do not need these to pray to Jesus.


Additionally, you do not need to talk about your problems when you recite the Lord’s prayer. When you pray in general, or at a different time, you can talk to Jesus about your problems.
Jesus follows up the previous verse with this warning in verse 8, “Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.""

, You can read the Lord’s prayer out loud or to yourself. Read it slowly so that the meaning of each verse can sink in. Jesus said in Matthew 6:9-13, Pray, then in this way: Our Father who is in heaven, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. “Our Father who is in heaven, Hallowed be Your name” helps you direct your attention to God who is beyond your ability to see or comprehend.
”Your kingdom come; your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven” helps you form an attitude of willingness toward taking part in what is being done on earth and engaging with the world around you.
”Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors” means that you rely on the goodness of God to provide for you the things you need. You also let go of the things that needy people owe to you, thus you should not demand to receive payment. Not forgiving debts of the poor displeases God, for you were forgiven a debt of sin you could never pay.
“Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil” could mean different things for different people. Not everyone shares the same things they do that they wish they would not do. However, whatever things you struggle with, ask for God’s help to overcome those things.
“For yours is the kingdom and power and glory forever” is not found in early manuscripts; however, it can give closure to your prayer and refocus you on the awe inspiring nature of God.

Talk to Jesus about your anger and difficult emotions.,
Assure yourself that Jesus loves you.,
Understand the difficult things that have happened to you in a new light.,
Concentrate on your connection to Jesus in tough moments.,
Think about how Jesus would handle the situation you are in.It can be helpful to use the model of Jesus and his practices of love and compassionate to help give you the understanding you need to face your life.",How to Pray to Jesus2," You can use your prayers to Jesus to tell Him about the difficult things that are going on in your life. Praying can be helpful for coping with emotions like frustration and pain. If you can let out your anger during prayer rather than in daily life or in your relationships, then it can become an emotional support that you can use to calm you down.When something bad happens to you, for example, you lose your job, you can pray to Jesus to help process your emotions and find relief from your stress. Give your words of frustration, anger or fear over this loss to Him.
You can use the Psalms as guides in how to pray through hard times. For example, in Psalm 4 the Psalmist asks that God to give him relief for his distress. , Remember that God made you in His image, and Jesus loves and His Spirit accompanies you on your journey. He wanted you to choose to repent, to seek to please God and acknowledge Him in all you do, just the way you are: Free to choose to follow His plan to be saved. When you are having a hard time loving yourself, remind yourself that Jesus came to this earth and died, in part, because of His great love for you. His grace passes all understanding.Remember John 15:11-13: These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. This is my commandment,

'That you love one another, as I have loved you, and greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,.



, In your prayers to Jesus you have an opportunity to reconsider why things have happened to you. Perhaps when you reconsider your circumstances you will be better able to understand how God could be using something bad in your life for good.For example, although you have lost your job, you have been able to spend a lot more time with your kids.
Consider the beatitudes. Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:1-12) says that “Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth”.

, Going to Jesus in prayer when you are going through a hard moment can help shield you from the negative emotions that you are experiencing. For example, if someone you love is sick or in surgery, you may need to take a moment and refocus on Jesus and take comfort in his presence and strength.Although you should use Jesus as a support, continue to support others and allow other people you are with to support you as well. Continue to stay present with your loved ones and share with them the routine, the joy and pain of what they or you are experiencing.

, While you pray about the situations in your life, consider the ways Jesus would respond.


If you are having difficulty at work with someone who has interrupted your career by receiving the promotion you desired/deserved, you can think about Jesus-like responses to the situation. For example, in Luke 6:27, Jesus says “But I say to you who hear,Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.”

"
"
Pray daily in a consistent place and at a regular time.,
Take on whatever posture makes you feel comfortable.,
Express gratitude, and talk to God as He is your Father who cares about you.,
Try letting your thumb and each of your fingers of either hand represent an important part of life that needs attention in prayer.,
Experiment with ways to pray that work the best for you.Use objects or play music to help focus you on your prayer.",How to Pray to Jesus3," Find regular times and places where you can take a break, and take time out to pray. Look for a quiet place in your building at work where you can go to pray during your breaks, for example. Or go into nature to pray, and find a place by a great tree in a park. You can mark off a consistent time in your schedule to go to this place. Set a daily alarm to go off in your phone or make a repeating email reminder for yourself.
Go to the place you do your prayers, and sit there until you are ready to pray.

, For instance kneel, fold your arms in front of you, and close your eyes to pray is a suggested posture.Try different postures depending on where you are. For example, if you are praying in a park you might cross your legs, and lay your hands on your knees.

,


Don’t make demands, instead ask for help from your father for guidance, peace, and comfort. End the prayer ""in the name of Jesus"" when you pray to God through Jesus.

, Pray for your family, your teachers, your government officials, the poor, and yourself. The thumb can represent your family and the close relationships that are your supports. It is the most sturdy finger, and that is why it represents the family.
The index finger, as a pointing finger, can be the finger that represents guidance in your life, or it might stand for those who show you the way and help you. For example, this could be bosses, pastors, teachers, mentors, friends, and even those who provide you health care like your doctors and nurses..
The middle finger is the tallest finger on your hand, and it can be used to remind you to pray for the people in power in your country and in the world: government officials, world leaders, politicians, etc.
The ring finger is the weakest finger and therefore may remind you to pray for those who are people who are suffering from poverty and any ailments they do not wish to have.
The last, smallest finger represents yourself. Don't forget to pray for yourself.

, For example, pray while looking at a beautiful painting, if you are a visual person. Or you can read a book on prayer or write in a journal. Don’t try to fit yourself into any container of what you think a prayer should be.


Perhaps you need to be doing something with your hands while you pray. You can use rosary beads and repeat prayers for each bead, or you can doodle flowers in your notebook as you pray. You can also sing your prayers. Singing prayers can be a joyous way to express your feelings in an outward way.

Guard against following a church leader who may just take the label of Christian, and even become a preacher or priest as a way to organize their thinking and to be socially active.,
Decide for yourself about your church leaders teaching the Biblical Gospel truth, as you yourself are accountable whether or not you are honestly taught and are learning that Gospel, and the power of Christ.,
Observe possibly skilled church leaders who may not be called to the ministry as they may or may not be believers in the power of God.,
See whether they believe and teach the Bible, but if they do not teach the Bible then that is a severe problem for the faith because they are disingenuous (not persuaded of the Truth of the Gospel).,
Notice any leaders whose teachings differ from the Bible.,
Leave them and find believers with whom to agree for church meetings, and prayer, etc.,
Read the scriptures that say that such people will get worse and worse deceiving and being deceived themselves possibly by modern ways (not following the Gospel of the Bible) and by Satan.,
Study about rebellion against God, denying Jesus and the Bible.,
Beware of unbelievers who adopt Christianity seemingly to form a special group or a following as described in the Bible by the writer of the Book of Acts as ""wolves"" coming into the church and deceiving members as explained in the Bible:



...after my departing evil ""wolves"" shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock .,
Decide whether some perverse teachings may be taught by wolves ""in sheep's clothing"" or from among your members -- three examples of perverse things: while Biblically and even secularly in modern times (until recently) marriage is only between one-man with just one-woman"" and the immediate family was ""that man and that woman and their children, of course a divorced person , widow or widower still has a family if she or he has children.,
See whether they are teaching the most important points of the Gospel of Salvation which are summarized as salvation is ""...in Jesus Christ: by faith, through grace, not of works, so that no one may boast,... yet you are foreordained by the Father in Heaven to do good works.",How to Recognize Church Leaders Who Deny the Power of Christ," The Gospel is not some interpretations of modern thought formed to fit some ones opinions about the truth, without really believing the essence of it.


This does not imply that any one certain denomination or church is more desirable or more needed, but be sure that they teach the truth without avoiding some important, biblical doctrines, ignoring or denying them.
They may believe that it is good to present the teachings of Christ as ideals (goals) and present in the fatherhood of God or the brotherhood of believers with Christ as nice axioms and patterns for conduct, but do not believe that God is real...

, Of course, this requires that you are able to decide as:


the individual parent being responsible for your children,
or that you have attained the age of responsibility for your own conduct, to and for the Gospel.

, It matters little if they may be virtually untrained and may be natural leaders, or trained teachers, counselors or psychologists; none that is crucial.

,


Do not be surprised if Satan may appear in the guise of an ""angel of light"",(2 Corinthians 11:14) to mislead/lead believers and unbelievers, an impostor (assumes an identity or title for the purpose of deception) with bright ideas that come from misunderstanding or twisting the Bible and teaching a new gospel.
The more skilled they are in training or leadership skills--then the more easily they may just adapt the teachings of the church to be a livelihood, as an occupation, much like teaching or being a helper type without depth of profound belief...

, The Bible says from such ones turn away. So are you aware that some are nominal ""Christians"" (in name only; it is good, but is not Truth to them).


Such people may not be Christians in the sense of believing in salvation and then do not believe in the ""Death and Resurrection of the Jesus"" for example.
One idea is to see whether they believe in being ""born again as Christians."" That is biblical. Jesus said, ""You must be born again."" That is meaning that God gives you a new understanding and a new life as part of the Gospel.
The Bible describes persons who oppose the teachings of the Gospel, as presenting a different Gospel, and the Bible says if they change the Gospel to a lie, then let them be accursed. You don't curse them.;
, A church does not need to be large. Jesus said, ""Where two or three gather in my name and agree then there I will be in their midst.""

, The works of Satan include confusion. Avoid arguments that you can not win at the unsatisfactory church, but find a biblical teaching church.

, Rebellion against the Truth of the Gospel as found in the Bible is described in the Bible as a form of ""witchcraft."" They may use tricks of persuasion, or seemingly special understandings of ideas, to lead people into something other than the Gospel of the Bible. That is rebellion in this sense.


The communal style of life was not practiced in the cities of the early Christian world other than Jerusalem where they decided to stay together to support each other, and to be safe. The early Christians in Jerusalem banded together and had all things in common. The other cities of the Christian world kept a more regular form of existence and met publicly or in secret if necessary...
Some people use the Jerusalem church as a reason and example to preach and establish ""Christian"" communes, and they may end by forming some off-branch or off-shoot off Christianity or a messianic kind of leadership within a cult. Why -- because such leaders don't integrate traditional Christianity with their socialism.

Read about or remember the Jim Jones cult lead by a ""rebellious"" preacher who went so far as to leave the USA to lead his cult. They adopted a communal way of life in which he could and did control their welfare and retirement income. He regulated children, husband and wives. He did not conserve and keep the Gospel simple.

, Also of yourselves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples...(Acts 20:28-30).

, Until recently babies in the womb were known as just that: babies... But church leaders who do not keep traditional family sacred include those e.g.:


redefining the family and in a sense using it as a convenience for promoting their nontraditional interpretations and
redefining the traditional marriage from that which has been recognized for thousands of years, plus
advocating destroying the unborn child as a form of birth control called a woman's right of choice or abortion (killing unborn babies in the womb or even halfway birthed, called partial birth abortion) which may be ""liberal court ordered law, so that they legalize terminating the life of the unborn.""(Roe v. Wade)

, (Hebrews 2:8-10) Also we are instructed to be baptized which is celebration and a symbol of death and your rebirth in Christ, and Christ in you.

Think on what you will pray about.,
Consult with your religious adviser or a trusted friend.,
Find a good place to pray.,
Get any necessary or additional items.,
Plan to pray alone or with others.",How to Pray to God (Beginners)1," Before you begin, think about what you will pray about. What are the things in your life that trouble you? What are you thankful for? How do you want to bring God into your life? What questions do you have? These are things which you may want to pray on. Knowing what to say ahead of time will make you feel more clear and comfortable when you go to pray.;
, After you've thought about some of the things you'd like to talk to God about, consult with your priest, imam, rabbi, or a friend or family member whom you trust. Ask them what they think God might be able to help you with and what they think about your concerns and questions. They may open your eyes to questions and answers which you had never thought of.

, Once you are ready to pray, you will need to find an appropriate place and time to pray to God. This should be a quiet place where you can devote a good amount of time and concentration to your conversation with God, to show him your devotion.


However, if you feel the need to pray quickly and in a less than ideal situation, go right ahead. You do not need to be anywhere special for God to hear you. He will understand your distress and cares only that you love him in your heart and try to follow him.

, You may want to have certain items when you pray, such as candles, a bible, the remains of a loved one, or other items which are significant to you. Have these available and respectfully placed.

, You will want to decide if you feel it is better to pray on your own or with others. Different faiths stress different methods but you should not feel constrained by the normal conventions of your denomination. Do what you feel is right in your heart, whether that means singing your prayers in a church full of people or facing Qibla alone in a corner.

If they still battle with anger or impatience and you have explained to them the fruit of the spirit and to walk in the Holy Spirit, bless them with the opposite behavior. ""Father, I bless my son/daughter with walking in the fruit of the Spirit of joy, and patience and long-suffering."" Continue to bless them and it will change.

, Teach them how important it is to attend to Church, in order to worship God, because of all the good blessings He has bestowed upon them.

,, Pray in front of your children so that they can hear how you speak to your Heavenly Father. You can teach them to pray the Lord’s Prayer. The J.O.Y. way of praying is also easy to remember depending on the age of your child.



Jesus - tell Jesus how you love Him, say thanks to the Lord and praise His wonderful name.

Others - pray for your friends, if they are not saved, or if you are worried about them.

Yourself - ask God for something specific that you need, ask also for forgiveness, if you know you did something wrong.

, Ask them for their opinion after you read a passage out of the Bible and how they will implement the passage in everyday life.

, If you love somebody (a friend), you will spend time with them to get to know them. Teach them to spend time in God’s word to learn God’s character and how He feels about them. Romans 8:1, ""There is therefore no more condemnation to them which are in Christ, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."" God will always forgive them no matter what they did.

, James 4:7 ""Submit yourself therefore to God; resist the devil, and he will flee.""

, Ephesians 6:1-3, ""Children obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honor your father and mother that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.""

, Philippians 2:14-15.

, The righteous are as bold as a lion. Prov 28:1, ""The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion.""

Recognise and eliminate traditions: Traditions are another reason prayer will not be heard.",How to Pray for Healing in Jesus' Name," He came to save the lost by showing people they needed to believe in Him. Healing was one of the methods he used to show people that He had come from God, so that they should listen to Him, believe and do what He said to do.

Nicodemus: ""We all know that God has sent you to teach us. Your miraculous signs are evidence that God is with you."" John 3:2

Others: And many of the people believed on him, and said, 'When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?' John 7:31

Jesus Himself said, But if I do his work, believe in the evidence of the miraculous works I have done, even if you don't believe me. Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father John 10:38

Our mission is the same as Jesus said, as we do the works that we have been sent to do: Heal the sick and preach the gospel Matthew 10:7-8 -- then people will believe that we have the information that they need to begin a relationship with God.;
, And, as you begin to walk in the miraculous, you will see people instantly healed by the power of God when you pray for them, and then your life will change in the most amazing and exciting way. Here are details to increase your likelihood of success. So, overtime, look up all the associated scriptures, but you do not have to know every related scripture to begin following Christ's example.

, This is very important and can't be missed. The Bible says The preparations of the heart (your inner being) belong to man, but the answer of the tongue (the Gospel) is from the Lord (Proverbs 16:1).

, Receive empowerment by receiving the promise of the Father which is the baptism of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:4-5). When you are baptised in the Holy Spirit you will receive power from God (Acts 1:8). This will open up to you the power to be a witness and to do all the miraculous works of the Spirit, including speaking in tongues (Acts 2:4) -- and so open the ability to lay hands on the sick and see them recover by the power of God (Mark 16:17-20).

, The Bible tells us that the effective fervent prayer of a righteous person avails, or achieves, much (James 5:17) -- but God doesn't listen to those who do evil, who live by the flesh (1 Peter 3:12).

, Make a decision that you are going to believe God's promise of healing and that He has empowered you to present the Gospel and heal the sick. Therefore I say unto you, 'What things soever you desire, when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you shall have them' (Mark 11:24).

,


Be kind. Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, outcry and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and tender-hearted to one another, forgiving each other just as in Christ God forgave you. Ephesians 4:32


, Also, prayer was very important to Peter, (Acts 6:4) and Paul makes many references to the importance of prayer (Colossians 4:12) (Romans 12:12).



Build a strong relationship with God through prayer: So you can be confident that He will hear your prayer as you seek to do His will -- and that He will answer The blind man who was given his sight made this true statement about how Jesus had healed him: We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him (John 9:31).
Pray both in your natural language and in your Spiritual language


, We build our faith through the word of God, (Romans 10:17) (Galatians 3-5) especially the gospels and the Book of Acts. Healing was a normal part of a Christian's life in the Bible, and that is the standard we should be looking to, If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done unto you (John 15:7).

, We read that it was through Jesus compassion on the people that He healed them. (Matthew 14:14) We need to show and cultivate in ourselves a genuine love for all, and especially the man and woman we interact with one on one in this world, and so not want to see any suffer. Paul tells us that faith works or is made effective through love, (Galatians 5:6) A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another (John 13:34).

, So you have to build a strong desire to see people healed by the power of God and not give up or back off no matter what happens. And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word, by stretching out Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of Your holy Servant Jesus (Acts 4:29-30).

, Seek out other people who are also on this path, these will be people who will encourage and inspire you. If you can't find anyone in your local community then use your search engine, social media etc. to find like minded people who are active in praying for people and seeing God heal them. Everyone listened quietly as Barnabas and Paul told about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.'' Acts 15:12

, When you get your mind (Romans 12:2) and heart in line with the way Jesus taught. Then you can expect wonderful things to happen.

, Jesus was whipped so God reacted to the Roman's usual cruelty by amazing love, with grace, so all could be healed (Isaiah 53:4-5)(Matthew 8:16-17) God's will is that it should be the same here on earth as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:10). In heaven there is no pain or disease so that is God's will for earth, which is why Jesus healed everyone without exception. He shows no favoritism, (Romans 2:11) and He hasn't changed (Hebrews 13:8) (James 1:17). And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them 'all' (Matthew 12:15).

, Jesus healed with the authority that he got from the Father. The centurion recognised this, and Jesus spoke highly of his faith (Matthew 8:5-10). When you have authority over someone you can tell that person what to do and they have to obey. As disciples we have been given authority over disease so therefore we can tell it what to do (Luke 9:1). If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say unto this mountain,(or pain or sickness) Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you (Matthew 17:20).

, One time Jesus had to pray more than once to see a blind man healed (Mark 8:22-25). We are told we are like Elijah who had to pray 7 times for rain after a 3 and a half year drought (James 5:17-18) (1 Kings 18:41-45). So we must be as persistent as we can be in praying for the sick. Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up (Luke 18:1).

, His faith that is in us through the baptism of the Holy Spirit is going to heal the sick. We have to have faith in Him (that is in His Word, in His promises and in what He has done for us) and the Faith of Jesus which is given to us by the Holy Spirit. In John 5:5-8, Jesus approaches a man asks him if he wants to be healed. The man has no faith that Jesus will heal him and then Jesus heals him anyway (John 5:5-8) . We need to realise what Jesus could do we can do too and pray to feel confident of His power in us. John tells us that as He is, so are we in this world. (1 John 4:17). And Jesus promises Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father (John 14:12).

, Jesus told us If you shall ask anything in my name, I will do it (John 14:14) When we pray for the sick we can be confident that it is a worthy thing to ask, and therefore we can pray using His name or authority. When a police officer says stop in the name of the law, a law abiding citizen will do as they say. There is no magic in the name of the ""law"" It is the authority that the police officer has which makes people obey. It's similar with Jesus, we can use His name because of the authority He has given us. Peter and John demonstrated this by healing the man who had been paralysed since birth in Jesus name, Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength (Acts 3:6-7).

, Healing by Jesus was usually immediate. Although occasionally in the gospels people were healed along the way usually they were healed on the spot, so make this your expectation And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain (Mark 7:35).

, In this section is a simple technique of praying for the sick. It's not the only way of praying, but a good starting point and you can try others as you get more confident of the Lord's power in you., This can be someone you know or someone that you've met anywhere at all. If this is a stranger, introduce yourself and find out his or her name and then: Ask, ""Can I ask you a question?"" If the answer is ""yes"" then ask whether they have any sickness or pain. If ""yes"", tell them that you can pray and God will heal the illness straightaway., If they agree to prayer, then with their permission, place your hand on the person (doesn't have to be on the afflicted part) and pray a short prayer commanding all pain/sickness to go in Jesus name., If there is no difference don't be discouraged and ask to pray again If there is some improvement thank Jesus for what He has done and command that the rest of the pain/sickness leave in Jesus name Continue until all the sickness/pain has gone or until the person wants you to stop. It can be helpful to ask them to rate the pain or sickness with a number out of 10 (1 being very low and 10 the worst) before you pray and ask them what the number is after you've prayed, If they are healed tell them this is because of God's amazing love for them (John 3:16) and talk to them about how God can not only save them from their sins but also empower them to do the same thing.,, This shows those reasons why a person may not receive their healing and help overcome these reasons so that they can be healed., Unbelief is one of the reasons prayer is not answered. Belief is all encompassing. God is all powerful and it is His will to heal. Pray and read and read or watch testimonies until you totally believe that the promise is for here and now and if need be, make changes to your life so that you are walking in the light of God.

The only time in scripture that someone wasn't healed, it was the disciples who had prayed for a boy. Jesus came and healed the boy showing it was God's will for him to be healed. The disciple asked why they couldn't heal him (Matthew 17:14-21) (remembering that they had been successfully healing people since Jesus sent them out in Matthew 10) And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief and 'Howbeit this kind (unbelief) goeth not out but by prayer and fasting' (Matthew 17:20-21).
We read about faith in the Bible which puts the knowledge into our mind, and then prayer accesses the faith in our hearts.

, Jesus said, Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that (Mark 7:13). Traditions are reasons or excuses which people have invented which are not in the Bible, but they believe that they are part of God's plan. When we realise that we have a belief that is not in the word of God we need to get rid of it so that God's power can be effective and heal.

Any belief that contradicts the facts of God's will/plan is a tradition. It is His will to heal the sick, and He has empowered and given authority to believers today to go and do works that Jesus did, just as the believers did in the book of Acts. All traditions need to be eliminated, if we want to see God's healing power.

Beware of commonly believed traditions which nullify the word and power of God:

God wants people to suffer -- no, God is willing (for us to heal), but we must believe and walk in it
Only Christians or those turning towards Christianity can be healed -- no, God loved the world while we were still sinners
Sickness is somehow a benefit to peoples' faith or character -- no, it is part of a curse on the fallen world, not a benefit
Not always God's will to heal -- no, God is not willing that any should perish
Healing died out with the original apostles -- no, Jesus and the gospel are the same yesterday, today and forever
The person you are praying for will only be healed, if he or she has total faith -- no, we mortals don't have total faith without limit, but Jesus who is in disciples by His Spirit does.
The person won't be healed, if they have sin or unforgiveness in their lives -- no, ""if you say you have no sin, you are a liar (a sinner)""
Paul's thorn in the flesh was a sickness and therefore not all sicknesses can be healed -- In the old testament a thorn in the flesh always refers to problems coming from other people (See Numbers33:55-56, Joshua23:11-13 and Judges 2:2-3) This is in line with Jesus telling us that those who do righteousness will suffer persecution (Matthew 5:10)


Making petitions: Begging, repeatedly asking making petitions to God to heal the sick is one of the most common traditions. Jesus never did this. In effect, if we are begging God to heal the sick, it is because we don't believe that He has given us the authority to heal the sick today. If your boss gives you authority to do something, but every time you need to do it you ask Him again to do the work for you, then what would your boss think? We need to believe in the authority He has given us, But as many as received Him, He gave to them authority to be children of God--to those believing in His name (John 1:12).
Yes, the scriptures do say that we should ask but ask has a different meaning in the scriptures than just make a polite request. Consider the following scriptures which all use the same Greek word for ""ask"", when you pray, as in Mark 11:24, above.


But the mob shouted louder and louder, demanding (asking) that Jesus be crucified, and their voices prevailed (Luke 23:23).

And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter” (Mark 6:25).

A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, 'Give me a drink.' the Samaritan woman said to him, 'How is it that you, a Jew, ask' for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria? (John 4:7&9).


Jesus didn't ask God to heal the sick. He simply healed them. Sometimes Jesus rebuked the sickness (Luke 4:39); sometimes He commanded sickness to go (Mark 9:25). Sometimes He laid hands on the sick (Mark 16:15), and sometimes He told people they were healed by their own faith as in Matthew 9:22 (Matthew 9:22).
To test if something is a tradition, the best way is to see whether Jesus did it. If Jesus didn't talk about or do the thing which you are believing, then it is a tradition of people and needs to be gotten rid of so that your faith can grow.
Be encouraged to avoid traditions. Then you will become closer to God and you can see healings too, as a Holy Spirit filled believer!

Show respect.,
Read from the Bible.,
Thank God.,
Ask forgiveness.,
Ask for guidance.,
Pray for others.,
Close your prayer.",How to Pray to God (Beginners)2," Show respect by humbling yourself before God. Dress plainly (if you can), do not show off your prayer pridefully to those nearby, and pray on your knees with head bowed (if you can).

, You may want to begin by reading a passage from the Bible which has significance and meaning to you. This will open your heart to His word and show him your devotion.

, Thank God for all of his blessings. Thank him for the things that make you happy, that make your life better, or that make the world a better place. Understand that these blessings are God showing his love for his people and should be celebrated and appreciated.

, Ask God's forgiveness for the mistakes that you make. Keep your heart open and remember that we all make mistakes: nobody is perfect. Though you may have trouble admitting it or thinking of a mistake you have made, you will find some way that you can be better. Be sincere and you will know in your heart if God forgives you.

, Ask God's guidance. He isn't a genie or some magical granter of wishes...He is merely there to guide you on the path you are meant to follow. Ask him to lead you and show you the right decisions and the ways to better yourself as a person, as well as the world and people around you.

, Pray for those who you feel need prayers. You can pray for your family, for your friends, or for strangers. Ask God to show them His love and to also help them find their way when they are lost. Do not cast judgement on them or their problems: God is the only Judge and He will do what is right.


Remember that people are not the Devil or demons; they are souls, just as you are, and can be led by God. Don't ask for them to be struck down, ask for them to realize their mistakes and seek forgiveness just as you do.

, Close your prayer in whatever way you feel is appropriate. The most common way is to say 'Amen'.

Try to pray in Hebrew.,
Try to pray with others.,
Know each of the prayers for the different rituals.,
Pray individually if you prefer.",How to Pray to God (Beginners)3," Most denominations believe that praying in Hebrew is better, though your god will understand you in whatever tongue you speak. Do your best and He will understand.

, Jews prefer to pray more often and in groups, other than Christian prayer which is more individually focused. Pray with others if you can. This can be at temple, with your family at home, or while you are out with your friends.

, Instead of individually stated prayers said each day, Jews prefer to say blessings for different times of day, events, and times of year. You will want to learn the different prayers and when they should be spoken, as well as the Holy Days which require special prayers.

, If the normal ways of praying are not for you and you feel that you communicate with your god better on your own and in your own way, that is okay. You can pray in the Christian method above and your god will understand. He cares more about your devotion and obedience.

Pray at the right times.,
Orient yourself.,
Sit, stand, and motion correctly.,
Open your prayer.,
Recite the Surahs.,
Perform the appropriate number of rakats.,
Close your prayer.",How to Pray to God (Beginners)4," Muslims pray at specific times of day and you will need to learn and observe these times. You can look them up, ask your imam, or get a handy app or program for your mobile device or computer.

, You will need to face Mecca when you pray. This is an important part of prayer for Muslims. You will need to look up what the proper direction is for the area in which you live. Alternatively, you can get an app or program for your phone or computer which will act as a compass and point you in the right direction no matter where you are.

, There are specific ways that Muslims are supposed to sit, stand, bow, and move their hands and bodies during prayer. These can be rather complicated and you may need to do some research. You can also learn by watching fellow Muslims, either out and about or at your local mosque.

, Begin your prayer in the proper way. Muslim prayer is much more specific and rigid than Christian prayer. The standard opening is to call ""Allah - Wa - Akbar"" and then recite the Isteftah Dua and Surah Al- Fatiha.

, Recite the Surahs appropriate to the time of day or that are being recited by your fellows nearby. If you are alone, you can recite whatever Surahs you believe are appropriate.

, The rakats, or cycles of prayer, are standardized and a different number of cycles is prescribed for each time of day. Know what is the appropriate number and try to perform at least that many.

, End your prayers in the normal way by turning your head to the right and saying, ""As Salam Alaykum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu'."" The angel who records your good deeds is to this side. Then, turn your head to the left and say, ""As Salam Alaykum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu'."" The angel who records your wrongful deeds is to this side. Now your prayers are over.

, If you promised God that you would improve yourself or work harder for something, you should keep your promise. Work as hard as you can, honestly and with humility, and God will understand and be pleased.

, Don't just pray when you have a really big problem. God is not your band-aid. Pray all the time and show Him the respect that He deserves. Get in the habit and with time you will be great at praying.

, As you pray more, you will want to pray with others and bring others to understand how much they can gain from prayer. Bring them to God by helping them, honestly, humbly, and without judgement, and they too may become inspired to come to know Him as you have.

Strand 2: Believing

As a Christian, you are called to rise above the natural circumstances of life, and live by the promises of God. Just as Peter stepped out of the boat and walked on the water when Jesus called him (story in Matt. 14:25-33), you are to walk by faith and not by sight. As you allow the word of God to become your standard for living, you will find the courage you need to step beyond the natural, and do exploits for God.



Strand 3: Confronting

Only Christians have the authority to resist the spiritual forces of darkness. The Bible says, “The Son of God appeared for this purpose, that He might destroy the works of the devil.” (1 John 3:8). Confronting is standing against the enemies of God for the purpose of setting the captives free.

Consider factors such as how the congregation’s style and beliefs fit in with yours, as well as if the size can accommodate the number of people you want to attend.Find a church at least a few months in advance so you can get to know the congregation and it can get to know you.;
, Once you’ve located at least one possible church in which to hold the baptism, schedule a meeting with the priest or minister. She can give you a better idea of any requirements the church may have for baptism or other traditions the congregation celebrates for baptisms.Make a list of any expectations and wishes you have for the baptism. Discuss these with the clergy to see if they are possible at the church.
Ask any questions you may have that arise from the conversation. You may want to ask about any expectation the church has of you or the person being baptized, such as attendance in or helping with services.Ask if there are any classes, examinations, or training you require before you can be baptized. For example, the Catholic Church requires education in the Catholic faith before being baptized as an adult., After successfully deciding on your baptism venue, schedule the baptism with the church and clergy member who you would like to perform the ceremony. Consider special dates such as Easter or Christmas for the baptism, which may make the event more special or could make it easier for out of town guests to attend.Schedule the date at least four weeks in advance.Suggest several different dates to help ensure you get the church and clergy member you want for the baptism.Coordinate dates with loved ones if you absolutely want them to attend, especially godparents or sponsors.

, Some churches require that you choose godparents or sponsors for a baptism, or you may just want to have them to help guide the person being baptized.Choose a godfather and godmother or sponsor from among your family, friends, or other loved ones.In most cases, godparents provide spiritual support and nurturing to a child, while a sponsor can guide a child or an adult being baptized. However, in the Catholic Church, adults can also have one or two godparents.Many churches will require that a godparent or sponsor be baptized and active members of a church.Consider factors such as your relationships to the godparents or sponsors and their potential commitment to guiding the person in the faith or even being there if something should happen to the parents.Make several possible godparent or sponsor choices in case your first choice declines.
Ask the prospective godparents or sponsors if they are willing to act in this capacity. Respect the person’s decision if she chooses to not be a godparent or sponsor.

, You’ll likely want people to attend the ceremony and a celebration afterward. Make a list of definitive and possible guests who you would like to share in the baptism.Discuss the list with your spouse, the godparents, or anyone else taking part in the ceremony.Decide how many people you want to attend, including if it is adult-only or something for children as well.For example, if you decide to include children, you may want child supervisors or activities to keep them busy.
Make sure the number of guests you want to invite can fit into the church and any party venue., Depending on the formality of the baptism, you may want to send out invitations or simply inform guests of the event. Make sure to send out the invitations or information at least three to four weeks in advance of the baptism to ensure that people can put it on or rearrange their schedules.Include RSVP cards so you can get a head count on the ceremony and for any celebration you are hosting, especially if you are serving food.Inform guests of any gift policy you may have. For example, you can write “no gifts, please” on the invitation if you just want people to enjoy the ceremony and celebration.Let your guests know if children may attend and if you’ve included supervisors or activities for young guests.

, Baptisms can be a special time to honor family and faith traditions. Incorporate any elements you may want into the ceremony to help make it more personalized and special.You may want to choose a special christening gown or say a specific prayer.
Discuss incorporating the traditions with your clergy member, who can help you plan where best to use them.

, Depending on the size and formality of the baptism, you may want to hire a photographer, a caterer, or even transportation. These elements may help the day run more smoothly and be more enjoyable for you.Confirm with the church that photos are allowed within it.
Meet with a photographer if you want professional photos. You can also ask a friend or family member to take pictures of the day.

, A few days before the baptism, call the church and any other venues to confirm details and any numbers. This can ensure that everything is ready and in place on baptism day.


Have contingency plans if anything should fall through such as the church or clergy member.

, You may want to host a reception or meal following the baptism to celebrate the day. The church may have facilities or you can book a different venue to celebrate.Consider factors such as how many guests you’re inviting as well as the audience, especially if children are attending. The venue should be able to comfortably accommodate every person.
Find a location near the church so that you and your guests, including the clergy member, can easily and quickly attend the celebration.

, Decide on what type of food and beverage you’d like serve at the celebration. Keep the menu compatible with the formality of the baptism service and age of the baptized person as possible.


Decide on specific foods and if you want to have a buffet or sit-down meal. You may want to consider serving something like lamb, which many Christians associate with Jesus. If children are attending, you may want a mix of adult- and child-friendly foods.
Make sure to have options for children if any are attending. Chicken fingers, burgers, and fries are good options for kids.
Decide if you want to include alcohol in the day’s events or you prefer to keep it an alcohol-free party.
Meet with the restaurant or venue staff, or caterers. Staff members may be able to help you find the best options for the type of celebration you want.
You may want to hire a separate baker to make a special celebratory cake.
Give guests different options for food such as vegetarian, meat, or fish selections.

, You may want to offer your guests transportation between the church and party venue. This can help keep the group together and avoid people getting lost.


Meet with local transportation companies and ask about buses or limousines. Local schools may also be available to hire.
Ask guests to ride with one another or designate certain guests to drive others.

, If your child is being baptized or you’re an adult including children in your baptism, make accommodations for them. You’ll need food that children can eat and may want to come up with some fun activities for them to do doing the service or meal.


Ask the church if you can hire someone to look after children in their nursery.
Speak with the caterer or restaurant about offering foods that children will eat.
Find age appropriate games and activities for your child guests. For example, you could have a treasure hunt or board games and set them up on a table for your guests.
Consider hiring a separate supervisor or babysitter for child guests. This can allow everyone to enjoy the service and celebration without worrying about children causing trouble.

, No matter if you are staying at the church, going home, or meeting at a restaurant, add some embellishments to the venue. Anything from flowers to small trinkets or even party favors can make the day feel more special and help you and your guests remember it.Meet with a florist and discuss options. You may want to have elaborate arrangements or keep it simple. Make sure to ask the church and venue if and what type of decorations they allow.
Buy decorations at party supply stores. You can often find religious-themed murals or trinkets that can help jazz up a table.
Give your guests a favor by which to remember the day. Magnets or a small box of candies with the date are options you may want to consider., At the same time you confirm details for the baptism ceremony, finalize and confirm details with your venues and any distributors such as caterers or transport services. This can help ensure that you don’t encounter any last minute or unexpected glitches or cancellations.


Have a list of venues, caterers, bakers, or transportation services on hand in case of an emergency.
Ask friends or family members to help you out if you need it.

If you want to pray for your friend, do it in private.",How to Persuade an Atheist to Become Christian," Consider how you would respond, if someone were attempting to persuade you to reject your salvation in Christ. It's not just difficult to ""high pressure sale"" anyone about new understandings, especially faith-based ones, probably useless. If a friend is casually interested in talking with you on matters of faith in God and religion, then do it gradually, taking occasions for mutually convenient opportunities to discuss your firm faith and their inquiries in a personable way. Never lecture your views to an unwilling participant, or you'll give your friend the impression that you are rude and your technique is unacceptable. This is avoidable.


Many atheists may not consider their personal disbelief system to be a negotiable part of who they are. They are more concerned with their behavior, with being a reasonable person, than what ""faith"" or system of belief that action stems from.
Always speak from a place of good news and love, not judging. Rather than trying to convert someone to your religious beliefs by winning an argument, Christians believe it's more important to show friendship unconditionally. It's that simple kind of personal, loving regard that can appeal to others. We may think of ""souls"", but they want to admire and be admired/loved like friends and nice family.
Realize that a large percentage of atheists used to believe in God, but was hurt somehow in their faith (at church, by another religious person, church goer, such as a Christian, etc.) and have converted to atheism. This is not true for another large percentage of atheists, of course.;
, The middle of a debate or argument probably isn't a time to have gracious persuasion in matters of Christian faith. Likewise, the workplace, the busy dinner table, or large group is not the right place to discuss your good news or offer of a different life with a nonbeliever. If the topic comes up, set aside another time to discuss some important matters (""oh, interesting stuff, a sort of discussion over coffee or such, about what you and I think about today's issues... ways of seeing success and progress in whatever we do... No. Not selling. Not buying or investing money, no. Let's have a talk and some good discussion, okay? No, not a debate."") in depth and in semi-private (over a home kitchen table, at a sit-down sandwich deli, in a park or coffee shop, or such).


Never blind-side a nonbeliever friend with your views and attempt to override their disclaimers (don't ignore protestations: ""I wasn't ready for this..., not now; hey, what's the idea?""). If it comes up, it comes up. But, don't rush into an inconvenient conversation, or it'll come across as confrontational and unfriendly (a trap).

, Any time you're discussing matters of faith, it's important to have a genuine conversation, not just a list of sins or accusations, argument, or a too preachy/shock-jock approach. If you hope to convince anyone of your point of view, you have to first be ready to calmly take a genuine interest in that person's hopes and point of view about God and Jesus Christ. If you find yourself pushing to talk much more than patiently listening, this is probably not the genuine concern for the person's conversion or not acceptable as friendly concern; so why bother. This can't be a lobbing of rhetorical thought-bombs into enemy territory. This is a conversation with someone you care about enough to discuss your reason for believing.


Be open and honest at all times. You could end up doing irreparable damage to your friendship, if you let intense emotions simmer underneath the surface to direct the conversation. It should always be civil, positive and cordial. Never cut the friend off, accuse him or her of lying, being prejudiced or saying malicious things to make a point. An idea can be edgy, if it's dispassionate and worth talking about. Discriminating tastes in food and in life's issues, for some good stuff, means you have an angle (a stand), a point of view.

, The best way to get someone interested in Christianity is to present faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God in your personal, fulfilling life, following Jesus. Show the Christian life as fulfilling, exciting, attractive to others and they'll be more interested, curious to learn more about the way you live your life as a Christian.


You're not just arguing facts. You're discussing faith based on the truth about God's son. That's the best you can do. The way to do this isn't by trying to badger or prod someone to convert, or by engaging them in a ""tic-for-tat"" of competitive debate about the virtues of Jesus (but you need to be ready to answer how your faith in Him is not about arguing the ""fallacies"" or bad/good points of the world's religions or various past or present civilizations and their deities). It is vital daily life in Christ.

, Explain how your faith in Christ has helped you to live a better life and discuss what Jesus Christ means to you. It may also be useful to tell your friend about people you've met at church and the community that you've built there. Keep the conversation focused on the tools that following God's son gives you.Why do you feel you're better off for being a Christian, in getting through your day-to-day life? In general, it's best to avoid discussing the concept of eternal punishment for non-Christians with an atheist, which will turn into a debate. If someone feels like you're trying to ""save"" them, it can seem condescending and frustrating for your friend.

, When you have a discussion, it is best to speak the same language. This means that you will have to back up and use secular reasoning and vocabulary to establish your theological ideas. It might be helpful to discuss Christianity in terms of morality, practical tools for living, and other more secular

, A discussion between a believer and a non-believer doesn't need to be a debate about science, or creationism, or an intricate dissection of the creation of the world as discussed in Genesis. Discuss faith in terms of your church, writings of Early church and personal experience of it. What does it mean to you, to be a Christian? That's got nothing to do with dinosaur bones and the age of the earth. Avoid these subjects.


Many Christians have very different relationships with the Bible, and you may be quite knowledgeable about Bible study and the history of the document. Conversely, many Christians emphasize a personal relationship with Christ as the fundamental aspect of their being blessed in Christ.
An atheist may want to hear definitive evidence, not a discussion of your life in Christ, but a discussion of Christianity isn't a debate between ""science"", ""intelligent design"" and ""creationism."" Treating this like a debate of science will get you nowhere with a nonbeliever. All you can do is represent Jesus Christ as the one you follow.

, Has your friend always been a nonbeliever? Has something happened to cause this person pain in life, or feel that religious leaders are hypocritical? Or does your friend simply choose to base a belief system on scientific empirical evidence? Whatever the reason is, you need to get to the core of your friend's beliefs and try to understand them.


Do not assume to know the answer to this question. Not all atheists are ""angry"" at God, or are lapsed believers, or are depressed about their lack of belief. Listen when you ask questions and try to understand their key disbelief.

, Your friend may be curious about your beliefs, especially if they weren't raised as a Christian. And if this person feels comfortable with you, this will lead to questioning and challenging you. The less defensive you are, the more reasonable you seem. Be comfortable in your faith in God and remain calm. If you're having fun, the other person will, too.


If your friend constantly wants to discuss Biblical fallacies, or ""Can God make a mountain God can't move?"" types of questions, don't engage in debate. All you need to say is ""That's not possible to know, and I'm comfortable with that. It doesn't make me any less of a believer.""

, If you're going to talk a big game about how great your life as a Christian is, you've got to prove it with your actions. Demonstrate love with your own life.The Bible tells us not to try and entice people with words but to demonstrate the Spirit and power. If they are sick or have pain offer to pray for them and they can be miraculously healed Some atheists are atheists because of their often-justified perception that Christians are hypocritical. But you know they're not all that way. Prove it.

, The best way to introduce atheists to your religion is by treating it like you would any social function. Emphasize the fellowship and the camaraderie, and invite them to a non-service function, like a dinner or a cookout.


If you invite an atheist to a religious function, tell them that it is a religious function. Don't try to trick someone into attending by pretending that it is not. Do this every so often and introduce your friend to other people who attend your church. Make him or her comfortable with the individuals who make up the church and religion.

, See if this person develops any interest in attending your place of worship. You may extend an invitation to attend church with you, but it would be best if your friend comes along due to their own curiosity, feeling comfortable and in control. Don't push too hard. The more your friend has to come to you, the more invested they'll be in the result.

, Show the practicality of Christianity through your own successes and friendships with Christians. If your friend truly sees that being a part of a church is like gaining dozens of new family members who demonstrate love and admiration toward others, then your friend will know where to turn in hard times..


Know when to call it quits. When talking about deeply-held beliefs, people can often get emotional or even angry. If possible, try to talk to them when they seem fairly open and when you are both in a good mood. Some atheists prefer written debates over oral ones. Try that if one or both of you always become overemotional., Ending a contentious conversation by saying ""I will pray for you"" can be seen as rude. Christians believe that it is up to God, ultimately, to convince people to follow. Don't use public prayer as a pious demonstration. If God is going to answer your prayer and convert the atheist, then he would do so whether the atheist hears it or not.

Don't avoid it or just let it meander about.,
Pray effectively when you need to commune with the Lord.,
Be aware of words in a heavenly language that most likely would not be in an earthly dictionary.

,
Test the spirits to see if it's from God--then test it.,
Check to see if it passed the 4 tests!,
Remember there are many false prophets trying to deceive God's elect, to break up the church, saying you should disobey the word of God and to worship idols.",How to Make Glossolalia Work for You," If you are about your business when suddenly, out of the blue, a word or phrase pops into your head--that's common whether it is an ordinary thought or not.



Don't panic if you don't understand it, whether in your own language, or less likely in any other known or even long forgotten tongue--it may be The Holy Spirit urging, nudging or shaking you. God sometimes works in mysterious ways to perform His wonders.;
, If you are a Christian, experiencing a Christian spiritual experience, then check the validity of any surprising idea. The effectual fervent prayer of a Christian has a real impact in your life and others that you pray for.



Ask that God do His will in your understanding and in your life, exactly what He pleases, about the word or phrase.(1 John 5:14-15)

Ask the Lord that if it's some spiritual matter meant for your good, that you would both understand it clearly, and be able to follow through on it.

Ask that if it's not from God, that it would be ""bound"" and go exactly where Jesus would have it sent.
If, after praying, and it feels right and good, remember the words, and look them up. Look in a multilingual dictionary. (Wikipedia is a good place to start). There are many good solid theological references that you can also look into. Take note of the definition as it applies to the event at that moment. Is it relevant? Does it offer insight? Is it a curse? Why is it, and what does it mean?

,, The all-knowing all-powerful God creator of the universe is incapable of being inconsistent. If the words you are experiencing are from God, then there are 4 tests they will pass. If they fail, then its not God. The tests are:


Question if it lines up with what The Bible really says on the subject? If you don't know your Bible, find out, read it, study it.
Ask another Christian. If it is really from God then those who know God will agree it is from Him. Ask someone who is wise, who has many miles on their moccasins, and would know something about this, how to tell if it's from God. God put your church leaders over you and they have a responsibility. If they are wrong, He holds them accountable, not you, for going to them.
Pay attention to your conscience. If your conscience doesn't feel right about it, then it's not right.
If you think God says something is going to happen and it doesn't, it wasn't God. That's the first test of a false prophet from the Old Testament.

, Do you believe it is from God? Follow it. To know a command from God, it will and must line up with: rightly divided scriptures; the church; your conscience; and circumstances. To not obey is dangerous. If you are His and love Him and obey Him, then you are going to behave reflecting God's love.

, Don't be one of those. Be one God's side for change and for understanding...

Take advantage of counseling.",How to Love Your Enemies," This might be a painful set of memories to relive, but it is necessary to consider them in order to change your thinking. What role did you play in your rift? How long have you had bad blood between you?Remembering these things will help you to eventually make peace with your enemies.;
, When you hear the phrase ""love your enemies,"" this doesn't mean you have to love them in the same way you love your friends or family, but you should be able to love them as your equal, in the same way the Bible verse suggests that God gives His goodness equally to everyone.

Understand if you need more time. If your enemy has hurt you very deeply -- such as a friend who had an affair with your spouse or a co-worker who has sabotaged a professional opportunity for you -- then it might take a lot of time before you can try to forgive them., You might believe that in order to truly forgive your enemies, they will have to apologize for their wrongs against you. But this gives your enemy a large amount of power. Realize that forgiveness and loving your enemy is more about benefiting yourself than them.

, When you forgive someone, you can experience things such as lower blood pressure, improved symptoms if you suffer from anxiety or depression, and even a boost in your immune system.

Letting go of bitterness can also have enormous benefits for your mental well being, giving you higher self-esteem and improving your psychological welfare., Every time you feel yourself thinking bitter or resentful thoughts towards your enemy, stop yourself and think about something positive instead. Think about how you have grown from your experiences with your enemy instead of how angry you still are with them.

Remember that when you indulge in resentful thoughts toward your enemy, you keep yourself in the position of a victim. You continue to allow them to have power over your thoughts. If you can't love them at first, then try to at least ignore them or think of them in a neutral light., Although you may have been hurt by them in the past, try to see the world through their perspective. What kinds of past experiences may have shaped their behavior? Are they going through something that you don't know about?, Think of times that you have said something hurtful or inappropriate. Would you want forgiveness in a similar situation?

When have you been forgiven in the past? How did that person express their sense of empathy or compassion toward you?

, If you find yourself becoming resentful, write down your feelings in a journal or meditation book. If you are religious, you might consider praying out loud so you can hear your thoughts clearly.

, If your enemy is someone who you must spend every day with (like a co-worker), then try to view every interaction you have with them as an opportunity to mend the rift between you. Be kind and patient with them and express an interest in the developments in their life.


If you are not interested in reconciling with your enemy, then at least try to look at your interactions as a way to maintain a basic level of respect with them. Be courteous in you interactions with them -- greet them when you see them and congratulate them when they have major milestones., If you have suffered a major trauma, such as the murder of a family member, you might find it easier to find peace by volunteering for a bigger cause, such as victim advocacy groups.


This experience will also connect you to other people who have been hurt in similar ways. It will give you a community you can turn to for support., Sometimes, the best way to love your enemy is to focus your energy on more positive relationships. If there is someone you've wanted to get to know better, ask them out for a cup of coffee or to get a drink after work.

You can also join groups and meet people who share similar interests to you, like hiking groups, photography clubs or writing workshops. Search for groups that meet in your local community centers, libraries or universities.

, If you find yourself having trouble trusting new friends, seeking counseling from a therapist to help you develop trust and learn how to heal from a betrayal.

A therapist can also give you strategies for navigating the process of forgiveness and moving on from the pain of your interactions with your enemy.

""God is not mocked whatever a man 'sows' that shall he also 'reap'."" (Galatians 6:7), Not only believing but doing is part of effectual prayer:

Put hands and feet onto your prayers.",How to Make Prayer a Habit (for Christians)," Challenge yourself to pray for a few minutes every day for thirty days. This is about the time that it takes to develop a habit.;
, Hearing other believers pray will give you ideas on ways to pray, and it will encourage you greatly to see that you are not alone in your endeavor to pray.

, Plan to get together in person or on the phone once a week or more. This will help keep you and your partner on track.

, Pray that they and others will make good choices. This adds another element to your prayer life and will remove distractions.

, Use a space for a prayer request and leave a space for the answer (including ""Yes."", ""No."" or ""Waiting...""). Include dates. This will help you remember what to pray for, and you can see how God is working through you in your prayer life.

, This doesn't mean that you need to go around praying and not paying attention to the rest of your life. You need to keep an attitude of honoring and praising God -- and to make God the first person you contact when you need help, and thank Him for everything, in any case, good or bad, always asking for His best, even in your worst day.

, You are safe in God's will. As the prophet Job said: ""Though God slay me, yet will I trust Him"". Realize that you never know tomorrow -- or one minute ahead -- which means: you have to fight through the consequences for what you and others do or fail to do. So, pray for strength to:



Study twice as long and try to learn twice as much, to earn even a little better grade. It is God's will that you study and practice (sow seed) for years, as say for 5000 hours. And so, work up and earn skill/talent or more money -- because God's will includes:


""You will reap what you sow (plant)."" Sowing for what you will be reaping can center your prayer results...



, After you pray for talents, wishes, needs and hopes -- then work and pray while it is time to work. Look to the ant -- how it works in season, so that it will have provisions laid up for when nothing more is available except what was already prepared; so, ""work out you salvation with fear and trembling"".

Try your hardest not to convert to atheism or agnosticism.,

First, think.,
You don't become right with God by only doing good deeds!,
Put your faith in Jesus Christ.,
Repent of your sins.,

At the end of Romans Chapter 4, read that Jesus died for godly and ungodly people.,
Start eternal life today.,
Try to emulate the Eight Beatitudes.,
Help those that are less fortunate than yourself.",How to Make It to the Christian Vision of Heaven," Atheism is where you don't believe in a God or a supreme deity or being. Agnosticism is if you are unsure if there is a God or supreme deity or being.;
, This can also help a lot. You don't become right with God by only obeying the law! This can be read in the last part of Romans Chapter 3.

, Know that in Romans 3:23 it says ""Everyone has sinned. No one measures up to God's glory."" Know that Christ Jesus paid the price for your sins.

, You must follow God's Law carefully. In Exodus, make sure you have read the Ten Commandments. If you are a Sunday school teacher, tell your students about Romans 3:23 and tell them to study the Ten Commandments. Next ask them to raise their hands if they have ever broken one of the Ten Commandments. If they raise their hands, they just did!

, Christ Jesus was given as a sacrifice to die for our sins.

, It doesn't work when, say, you work out a plan. ""I'll just go blow up a few mailboxes and then ask God for forgiveness."" Repentance is changing your thoughts and actions, to change what you have done. God is the one who sees the heart.

, It asks a tricky question. ""Did Abraham become right with God before circumcision, or after?"" It was before. So even if you are not circumcised, you can still become right with God. The law doesn't help, but it only makes us more aware of our sins.

, If he didn't die, we couldn't become right with God!

, Check out John 17:2-4. This passage talks about having a relationship with Christ. You can do this by reading your bible (BibleGateway.com is a Good site if you don't own a bible), praying, fellowship with other followers of Christ basically just spending time in God.

, These were Sacred Teachings By Christ Himself on how to lead a Blessed life on Earth, until we are called Home to be with Him in Heaven.

, In St. Matthew chapter 25, Christ Said that those on His Right, would be welcomed into the Kingdom for ""helping the least of His brethren, as though they did it unto Him.""

Get yourself into a good Bible believing church.,
Experience God's Love -- for yourself, and be born again.,
Love people... in a positive/proactive way.,
Humble yourself.,
Put yourself aside and focus on other people's needs and wants as much as your own -- such as helping them to be seated first or to have the best/last serving of your favorite food -- rather than putting yourself ahead, and don't insist on winning minor/trivial discussions.

,
Volunteer for Christian charities or non-profit organizations.

,
Pray constantly for others, thanking God for His many blessings.

,
Forgive past offenses, and don't bring them up.

,
Tell others about Jesus.",How to Love Like Christ," Learn all about the good news of Jesus Christ gift of his life for all the people of the world to be saved:You are saved by grace , through faith, and that is not of yourselves; 'it is the gift of God': 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast... we are his work, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, (Ephesians 2:8-10).;
, Each one must repent: turn around, change your mind. You can't give people what you don't have. The Bible tells us we experience God's love when we receive the Holy Spirit ....the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit . (Romans5:5) , When you're sitting at your lunch table, and people are saying bad or less than nice things about other people -- then perhaps you could say something like, ""Have you seen yourself? Do we have any place to judge?"" Or simply change the subject.

, Be a peacemakers: Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. (1 Corinthians 13:4).

,,,,, Telling them about Jesus' love is the best thing that you can do for them. Ask, ""What have you done with Jesus"".

Be glad that some Muslims are tolerant people who want to live peacefully and provide for their families, and you may be able to live among such people safely, while avoiding areas with intolerant people.,
Realize that there is a fraction of less open minded Muslims that will be less tolerant and thus will often verbally or physically attack members of other religions.,
Remaining in or moving into a Muslim country safely will call for consideration of your surroundings.,
Avoid provocations.,
Work for safety together with Christians and other persecuted religious and other good (non-radicalized) people, such as Jews, plus reasonably moderate artists and gays who are not really out.,
Write and speak about your experiences, and let the world know of them.

,
Blend in by appearances; you don't have to go against your faith to do so.,
Give and similar things will be given to you.,
If you bring your dog, be extremely careful.,
Islam includes fairness, as Islam is indeed very close to Christianity, and in fact Christians and Jews may be treated in a special way as they are called ""The people of the book"" and follow very closely some teachings of Islam.

",How to Live Safely in a Muslim Country As a Christian,";
, Be aware that some of this other type of Muslim, also known as ""radical"" Muslim (or Islamist) have captured, held for ransom, killed or tortured a number of Christians primarily because they were not Muslims (the same may happen to non-radicalized Muslims) often without any personal association or knowledge of the character of those targeted. But realize that the Christian church has often grown exponentially during persecution.

, Are there other Christians that are allowed to live there without being bothered? Are they allowed to openly practice their religion without attacks? If so, then go about your business and hope nothing changes, but always be alert for the unexpected at any moment.

, Beware, if you want to remain open about your religion, and take the consequences as they come -- ""Live free."" could then be your motto. So, avoid frustrations by being respectful, tolerant and accepting of the Muslim beliefs. You do have the right of worship and practice of your religion, and Muslims should defend your rights. And if you wish to discuss religious differences, you should encourage the organization of open debates (secret discussions are forbidden) -- but only based upon respectfulness and tolerance for people who are interested to know what each religion offers.

, These people have all been targeted for harassment and murder by the radical Muslim, and there can often be safety in numbers of people who do not draw negative attention by their usual, daily behavior outside of religious considerations which hopefully can be practiced fervently within small and secure circles dictated by the circumstances.

,, Join in on different social and sports groups, if they have any, and make friends with the local people; be friendly -- sincerely accepting their differences and customs -- and tolerant, but not condescending or judgmental. Do not judge others unkindly or with self-centered impatience; be generous and forgiving of failings and weaknesses.

, As you measure accurately (in all kinds of matters), then others will measure back to you in similar ways as honest people of almost any background respond fairly when treated fairly... This does not mean to be open about your beliefs with most of them--but honest in business and not cheating or shrugging off opportunities to assist them. Many of the people in the Middle East, Africa, or Asia live in poverty, so that good or adequate shelter, food and clothing are like luxuries, as they may be supporting large families including the older folks and children who don't have retirement or welfare programs. Go the second mile and expect nothing in return; so that you will not be embittered or judgmental, if they forget or can not respond in kind when you have been helpful.

, Dogs are considered unclean in Muslim religion. You may want to add a tag to your dog's collar that says something along the lines of ""Muslim-friendly dog"" in Arabic letters. Also, try wearing gloves when walking your dog in public. This will help because Muslims believe you have to wash your hands seven times after touching a dog.,"

Recognize what the acts of the sinful nature are: ""Sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; Idolatry and witchcraft; Hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; Drunkenness, orgies, and the like."",
Understand that ""those who live like this will not inherit the Kingdom of God."",
Recognize the Fruit of the Spirit: ""The fruit of the Spirit is Love, Patience, Faithfulness, Joy, Kindness, Gentleness, Peace, Goodness, and Self Control.,
Living by the Spirit will produce the Fruit of the Spirit.",How to Live by the Spirit," (Galatians 5:19,20). Paul groups these sins together because they are the basic fruits of the sinful nature. Paul says ""if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeed of the body, you will live."" If we put to death all of these acts of our sinful nature we will live, but the choice is ours. We can chose to walk in the flesh or in the Spirit as Christians.;
, (Galatians 5:21) Jesus said that ""you shall know them by their fruits."" Also James said ""show me your faith without deed and I will show you my faith by what I do."" If we are true followers of Christ, we will live differently. We will live out the fruit of the spirit rather than the misdeed of our flesh.

, Against such things there is no law."" (Galatians 5:23)

, ""Since we live by the Spirit let us keep in step with the Spirit."" (Galatians 5:25). This means that we should seek to walk in these fruits in all that we do in life and in every situation that we find ourselves in.

Pray: It is our personal relationship with God.,
Live as God called us: Every man is precious in the eyes of the Lord.,
Follow Christ's teachings: The teachings of Christ are brought to us in the Bible and by our churches.,
Honor Our God: Praise, thank and give to our fellowman and so to God.,
Love your neighbors: We love ourselves when (while) we love our neighbors.,
Stick to good and to righteousness: Do good by being good (in Christ's ways), in itself is a great thing.,
Read the Bible: Spend 5 to 10 minutes everyday to understand the life of Jesus and the Love of Jesus in our everyday living.,
Share your gifts: Jesus gave his life for us, a gift of salvation for us.,
Encourage our fellow man: We motivate, we inspire, strengthen and encourage.,
Co-operate with others: What you say may be different to what another may think.",How to Live for Jesus," We may talk to God as to Dad or recite the prayer given to us by Jesus through His disciples. ""Our Father in Heaven, Holy be your name. Your Kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Do not bring us to temptations, but deliver us from all evils.' Please recite, and then follow that as a pattern of one kind of prayer.;
, God always want us to live happily and successfully. Cultivate good habits of reading Christian books, watching spiritual programs and helping each other.

, Attend Sunday services or masses to give thanks to our Lord, for saving us from all troubles and hardships.

, He is all powerful, all knowing and present everywhere including His Spirit being in you. We should thank Him for what we are today. God is Love. He invites us to live at all times in His kingdom life. It is our choice to accept or reject.  Kindly accept His open arms.

, Everyone is a part of oneself, even though each lives in a different physical body: we are together in Christ. God's gift of Love brings happiness, success, patience, harmony, peace, integrity, honesty, friendliness and hope.

, Failing to be righteous asks oneself to be a failure. We shall overcome all unrighteousness through Jesus who strengthens us. Our Lord has already conquered the world forever.

, Meditate on the word of God. Our God lives in us. We should only discover Him in us through Jesus Christ, not by wishing and just by ideas but by His perfect principles.

, We shall share our blessings, wisdom, wealth, out of our little or much -- and so, share your faith in many areas and ways. What we give is what is multiplied unto us, pressed down and running over.

, Do the same, at least to one who is not family or a loved one, but someone who may live close to you, in turn God brings many, even millions, to inspire you.

, What you speak may be different to what you hear. So we should consider and co-operate to understand each others viewpoint to live enthusiastically.

As many evangelical denominations, it is import to make sure that you have a relationship with Jesus.,
Attend a Southern Baptist Church.,
Have true faith.,
After you have chosen to get saved you should get water baptized.,
Remember - there are no ""real"" steps to becoming a better Baptist.",How to Live Like a Baptist," It is a simple and complex task. Being saved means accepting that you are a sinner, and that your sin separates us from being in communion with God. However, God sent his son Jesus (John 3:16) to the earth, in human form, and lived a perfect life, was killed people just like us, and rose on the third day so that we may have life, and life more abundantly with God. We enter in to a relationship with God once we become saved. (If you wanting to get saved please call the nearest Southern Baptist Church and try to get in contact with a pastor or deacon.);
, There are programs that they offer like Sunday School, and Bible studies to help you further your knowledge about God, Jesus, the Bible, and living a holy lifestyle.

, Learn that God is in control of all circumstances. Even when things go bad, pray and believe.

, The significance in this is that we are sinners, but when we get saved and we go below the water, God washes our sins away and we are risen from death (death is the penalty because of our sin) into a new life with Christ.

, Even Baptist believe differently in their churches. The main thing is is to live how Christ lived and try to be like Him. Learn the Word and decide what you believe and why. Grow Strong in God and be fruitful.

Start by making quiet friendships with people outside the church.,
Connect through multiple avenues.,
Just start.,
Find other people who have left and get in touch with them.,
Mull it over.,
Think about what you see for yourself in the future.,
Realize that families can be made by birth or by choice.,
Consider whether you agree with the church's outlook.,
Get professional support.,
Rip off the bandaid.,
Make really cool friends that truly care about you.,
Know that it's okay to choose to be different.,
Know that you will probably experience some grief at the same time as you are elated about your freedom.,
Be prepared for family and friends to treat you differently.,
Consider a move.,
Read the Bible.,
Try visiting another church outside the LLC denomination.,
Think about a break from religion.,
Remember, you can choose to change.",How to Leave the Laestadian Lutheran Church," If you don't have anyone to talk to and you don't have someone to use as a sounding board about the craziness of your feelings/life after you leave, it's going to be really hard to stay gone.;
, Make friends with people at work, at school, maybe in an EFCE group if you're a mom, at the gym, anywhere.

, It can be as easy as asking someone from work to go get lunch with you. You don't want to feel like you're floating out in the middle of nowhere.

, They will probably be happy to hear from you.

, Think long and hard about what you want from life. Soul-seek. Visualize your life without boundaries.

, If it involves anything outside the confines of the religion, leave now and never look back.

, If you need to, choose to make a new family.

, When they say that you have to live by faith, what they really mean is that you have to submit to the rules of the church. It's not about ""faith"". It's about blind submission.

, Get a really good therapist. This will help with your decision and the transition if you do leave the church.

, Come out of the closet with those who need to know. Then, run. Run as fast as you can from the giant vacuum sucking the life out of you. Live! Breathe! Do it on your terms on your timeline.

, And when you're ready to make peace with those who feel ""hurt"" by your decision, then you can. Realize that some of the people who push you the hardest to come back are trying to talk themselves into staying.

, When you change a behavior you've been taught/programmed to do your whole life, you can feel anxious about the change. This is a normal human feeling, not like a burning bush talking to Moses. That lonely, uneasy feeling is easy to misinterpret as God telling you to go back. Relax. He is not.

, You have just orchestrated a massive change in your life, and there are good things about the church that you will miss, like friendships, the camaraderie with people who understand exactly what you are going through, and family relationships. Allow yourself to go through the grieving process at whatever pace feels right for you. And remember that all the comfort and familiarity that you are missing comes hand-in-hand with all the reasons that made you leave. You can't have one without the other.

, They may say they can't trust you anymore, or tell you that you don't understand faith matters anymore, as if you hadn't spent your whole life learning them. Hopefully your family will be more understanding than that, but it happens more often than not.

, If you can time leaving with moving to a different location, it might be easier. You won't have the familiar cues and people drawing you back in from habit.

, It might sound counter-intuitive, but do it. Really read it, and weigh what you read against what you have been taught about the LLC being the ONLY right church. Realize that the Finnish Apostolic Lutheran Church, who split from the LLC around 1973, says the EXACT same thing about the LLC that the LLC thinks about them: that you are heretics and lost and going to hell. It makes you afraid to question, which makes you afraid to doubt, which makes you unable to think clearly about it.

, Listen to what they say about faith and grace. Be surprised. Listen online if you can't bring yourself to physically go or you're afraid someone will see you. You will find that churches come in all different flavors, just like ice cream. Find one you like and just ask questions. People will be happy to talk to you.

, You don't have to go. Take a break from church and just rest. You don't ever have to go if you don't want to. Not everyone will.

, The first thing you change is your mind.

(Hebrews 10:25), According to your faith, be it unto you! Increase faith by the word of God. Remembering, that: Problems to solve are also opportunities (for success/making progress on the Way).""Without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who approaches Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him."" (Hebrews 11:6), As Jesus said people will ask Him:"" 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not take care of You?'... He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me ' . ...

Do personal research.,
Decide how you feel about shunning and the announcement: ""So-and-so is not one of Jehovah's Witnesses."",
If you want to avoid being shunned, continue to live as one of Jehovah's Witnesses while slowly fading.,
If you are not concerned about shunning, simply stop attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall and carry on your life in the manner that reflects your true beliefs.",How to Leave Jehovah's Witnesses,"  You want to be sure you are making the correct decision. Allow yourself the opportunity to research the faith from both Watchtower provided materials as well as reliable third party sources.;
,

,  Fading involves slowly reducing your involvement over many months.  Start by making fewer comments, going out in field service less often, declining parts on the theocratic ministry school, then finally reducing the number of meetings you attend.  Be prepared to explain your reduced involvement to any Witnesses who inquire only in vague terms.  As long as you avoid doing things that would qualify you for disfellowshipping or disassociation by action, many have found they can avoid being subject of a disfellowshipping announcement.

,  You are also welcome to write a brief letter of disassociation.  Send the letter to the ""Body of Elders"" of the congregation you associated with, using the address of the Kingdom Hall.  Once the letter has been received the elders may contact you to confirm your intention.  Once confirmed an announcement will be made, ""So-and-so is not one of Jehovah's Witnesses.""  This announcement carries an implied command to faithful members to begin shunning you, not even saying ""hello"" if they see you.

, You may want to consult a therapist, visit an online community of former members, and join a group based on a hobby or shared ethnic heritage. In time, you may want to join a new faith community.

, Understand that you will feel ambivalent about the church, its members, and its teachings. You are free to question everything. Allow yourself time to develop a new philosophy and don't be tempted by new dogma.

, You were indoctrinated in a rigid belief system, and it will take time to sort out the fact from the fiction, the good from the bad, the love from the fear. Trust that your doubts are there to teach you, not to condemn you.

, The more you know about its past, the more you will see its sociological context. Check out the many resources online about Laestadianism, fundamentalism, and the Sami.

, It may be tempting to make up for lost time in exploring previously forbidden activities, including sports, music, television, dancing, and alcohol. Play safe and don't do anything you wouldn't want to tell your grandchildren about.

, The more of the world you see, the more confident you will be in your decision, and the bigger your social network will be.

, When tempted to be bitter about your past, remember that it could have been a lot worse, and you have the rest of your life to live differently.

, Use your expanded sense of community to reach out to others in need. You will never be happier than when you are using your gifts to help others, and you will be too busy to be bitter.

, If you are male and want to wear a necktie, tattoo or earring, give yourself a year to see if the desire fades.

, This is a universal phenomenon and not unique to Laestadianism. It helps to talk to others who have been there and understand, whether they have left the OALC or some other kind of fundamentalism. Seek them out.

, For anyone leaving a fundamentalist community, pursuing formal and informal education is important step towards self-improvement and expanding your worldview.

Recognize that, according to The Bible, you are a sinner and have fallen short of God's standard.,
You must come to the Biblical understanding that Christ died for you, and that his death on the cross was his paying the penalty for your sins and mine.,
According to Christianity consistent with the Bible you must repent and turn away from your sins once and for all.,
Get yourself a Bible and start reading it.,
Find yourself a church that believes in salvation through repentance and faith in Jesus alone as opposed to an alternative tradition and see which would bring agreement and peace in faith.,

Receive Christ by repentance, confessing your sins to God and pray and ask to receive the Holy Spirit


,
Avoid sabotaging your prayer life so be sure to pray effectually.",How to Know Jesus As Your Personal Saviour," You have broken God's Law (the 10 commandments). You must understand that you are a natural-born-sinner, and deserve God's punishment for your selfish ways. Although, you must also take into consideration that certain groups of Jesus' early followers did not see things this way.;
, He willingly took the punishment for you while you were like a stranger and like an ""enemy.""

, Ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins and surrender your life to Him.

""All things can work out for the good of those who love the Lord and are called according to God's purpose."" You can start to gain ground as a Brother of Jesus, and your ways can be in the light beyond the tunnel.



Confessing with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and agreeing with Jesus means: be born again of water and the Spirit to enter into the kingdom of God. (John 3:5)

, Then follow up that with readings in the Bible, the Holy canon. Come to realize that there have been several books deemed sacred by some that were abandoned in the process of canonization by agreement to the consistency of doctrine and to the historical accuracy.

, You may want to start a Ministry of Holy Spirit for ALL who believe in the second coming of Jesus Christ, believing that all good Churches are one and the word of God is one for ALL generations.

Examine your motives for leaving.,
Gradually phase out your attendance.,
Keep in touch with any friends you've made.,
Make new friends.,
Have a list of reasons for leaving.,
Arrange a discussion with the minister.,
Emphasise what you believe in.,
Find new activities.,
Stay spiritual.",How to Leave an Evangelical Church," What is it about the church that you don't like? Is it a belief you disagree with, policies you don't approve of, or a general dislike of the church? Have you found one you like better? If so, then unite these conflicts as a case for leaving the church.


If beliefs and doctrine are issues, then examine the beliefs that you disapprove of carefully and critically. The main motive should be to help those who don't agree with you understand your point of view, and not to necessarily convert them.
Don't let anyone bully you into believing something.
Be wary of 'repackaging' attempts. This occurs when someone tries to teach you something you don't agree with, but try to make it sound more justifiable in some way.;
, Slowly stop attending the services that the church offers. For example, keep attending Wednesday Bible studies, but stop going to Sunday services. You can do this in reverse. But keep in mind that most churches see their Wednesday meetings as less formal than Sunday services, which means they may not be intrigued by your absence.


This will work well if you have some commitment that takes time away from church. (Work or school, health reasons, etc.)
If you don't have official membership with the church, you can try ending your attendance. You can also end it abruptly if you're a member, but they may be a bit more curious about why you've left.

, This will lessen the chances of your friends at the church taking your departure personally. The next step will help if they do take it personally and end the relationship.

, If the situation becomes bad, and all your friends from your former church do take it personal and cease all contact, having new friends around will ease your pain.

, These can be anything from disagreement with the congregation's or denomination's official policy, to not feeling part of the group to finding a church that you like better. Either way, have your list of reasons with you, either mentally or on paper.

, Here you can request that your official membership within the congregation be revoked, having your contact information removed from church directories, and the end of receiving correspondence from either the church or the denomination through all methods of communication, for example.


If your departure is because of serious disagreements with congregational or denominational policy, write down your arguments on paper and rehearse them. The minister will usually try to argue the point, and try to convince you that your disagreements are invalid. But once they understand (or even agree) with your objections, then they'll probably let your departure go without any problems.

When you speak with the minister, don't make converting them to your point of view your main goal. They might not be open to new ideas because once their denomination knows that they agree with or sympathise with ideas that it doesn't approve of, they might risk everything from being disciplined to losing their employment. They may secretly agree with you, but they simply can't risk their job.



, If you're still Christian, then point this out to the minister and the congregation. This will ease the situation. If you aren't, then bring truly valid objections to the faith of the congregation, so that they may be more understanding. You could lie about your beliefs, but this is not recommended.

, These can range from a new church, arts classes, going to the gym and the various other regular group meetings in your local area. Finding new people will ease any social isolation that you may have from leaving the church.

, Keep developing your beliefs, and if you remain religious, your faith, and everything else related to God (or the Divine, etc.) In the latter event, this proves to your friends from the old church that you're truly committed to being with God, but didn't fit in with the Church.


A great thing to do during this time is to review your belief system, and investigate different ideas. Once you've determined what beliefs to follow, finding a new church will be much easier.

Before you make any decisions pray about it and decide how much you will be tithing to the church.,
After you join, get involved.",How to Join a Christian Church," Before you go off and join a church, pray about it to God. Ask God to help you with your quest. Ask Him to lead you to a church that you can grow in.;
, Look up churches in your local area to find a list of churches. Most churches have websites that will tell you almost everything you will need to know such as their fundamental beliefs, which is a crucial thing:


If the church does not endorse one of your fundamental beliefs, then it may not be the church for you
Always remember that it's the fundamental beliefs that matter. Do not look for a church that ""conforms"" to all your beliefs.
You might find that the suitable church for you is a few more miles away. Remember that it might, and usually is, worth the extra drive.
Look for information about the Bible studies or classes the churches are giving if there are any.

,,


Pray before you visit and ask God to open your heart and mind.

, Many churches have an altar call, in which they will ask for those who need a church home to come forward. At that time, you should proceed to the altar or designated area. Once everyone comes forward, someone will likely escort you to an area where they will explain the next step. They may require you to take a course before you join. Don’t worry. They won’t ask you to sacrifice anything. They just want you to make sure you know everything about them as a church.

, In the bible God asks us to tithe. It may mean that you will just tithe 10% but there’s no verse that says you can’t give more. Giving money won’t get you into the church.

, If you have kids get them involved in the Youth Group. There will be other parents there that you can get to know and before you know it, you and your kids will make friends who will help your spiritual walk with the Lord.

Decide to pray to be saved from the penalty of sin which is the ""second death""--just anywhere, anytime without reservations or any appointment--and in a quiet non-public place, alone or with agreeing believers would be perfect.

,
Say something simple about why you are praying as a sinner to Jesus, and so ask for forgiveness, to be saved, be thankful, mean it and believe it.

,
Pray this prayer now: ""Dear Jesus, Lord, I come before you with my life.,
Receive the Sacraments.,
Instead of placing your trust in your prayer or sincerity, place your trust in Christ.,
If you don't have a new relationship with sin, you don't have a relationship with God in Christ.,
Recognize (""know"") your new life: and fully understand that you will never be the same: ""If any is in Christ, then you are a new creation, for all things have passed away and behold all things are become new.,
""Yet to all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God — children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God."",
Receive the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and Lord.",How to Know That You Are Going to Heaven As a Christian,"""(Hebrews 11:6) Your grasp is not to be ""maybe so!"" No, take hold on the promises of the Bible for salvation, for blessing and trust in the Savior, Christ Jesus.;
, As the Bible says, ""by grace you are saved through faith; and that is not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast (here the Apostle speaks of works of the Old Law, not of works of the moral law). For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them."" (Ephesians 2:8-10) Now you will change your priorities because you are a new creation in Christ Jesus, as ""He lives in you and you in Him.""


God's free gift is ""faith"" offered to you (anyone) to believe that God is and that the Bible--as promised--is True as anything can ever be ""sure"" as your firm determination and knowledge.

,

Romans 10:9-10 in the Bible says, ""That if you confess with your mouth, ""Jesus is Lord,"" and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.""-- The Bible says, ""As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead."" (James 2:26 NIV) This eliminates the idea that faith alone is enough (it is not), but you must receive God's provision, which includes in part the gift of faith from God to those who are receptive of The Gospel (literally: The Good News).

, In this you may place your confidence as in each and every word and promise of God and His Son.

,,, Jesus please save me from the Judgment to come. I want to know and love you. I want you to direct my life. Come into my life. Give me a new heart with new desires, please change me. I believe the bible; that you were crucified for us, and that you rose 3 days later. Jesus, I know that I am a sinner and that I need you and your forgiveness. Please help me to repent, turn from my wrongs and my self-centered ways. I know I broke your Law, your Ten Commandments, and have failed to do what is right. Please help me understand and make this a reality to my heart... I am a wretch, I want to understand this ""amazing grace."" Thank you Lord. In Jesus' Name I pray, Amen.


Come and taste (""know"") for yourself that cool spring of water (like a fountain) that Jesus promises to all of you, within yourselves, as you come to ""accept"" that in knowledge: and ""drink""... None can staunch the flow of joy that you discern within yourself, as your thirst is quenched.

, They are Gifts From Christ to us.

, Christ is the ""parachute"" that saves us from the jump to come, that jump is death and judgment, and all will one day have to face. If you are on a plane and it is crashing, you wouldn't merely believe in the parachute to save you, you'd put it on and trust that it'll do its job. Christ saves us from the judgment we rightly deserve. We broke God's law, and Jesus paid our fine. If Christ is truly now your Lord and Savior, you will desire to read His word and obey what He has commanded. If you're now born again, the old sinful desires you once loved will be replaced with new desires to seek and obey God. You will go from loving sin to loving righteousness.
~ Be converted as a work of God, for it isn't merely based on your decision. Salvation is of the Lord. Instead of trusting in your self, transfer that trust to Jesus Christ. If God has begun a work in you, He will complete it. (Hebrews 12:2 and Philippians 1:6) If you trust in God and have a godly sorrow for your sins -- The Lord will lift you up and give you new life/a new beginning. You can know you have eternal life, if the Holy Spirit dwells in you. A transformed life itself testifies of the saving power of God. Has God done such a work in your life that the sin you once loved you now hate?

, Become a slave (bond servant) to righteousness, and turn from being a slave of sin.

,""(2 Corinthians 5:17)

, (John 1:12-13) It is God who converts the soul and is the One who gives mercy and eternal life.

, He is The Living Word of God, and there is no other Savior apart from Him: our Salvation. He can cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Cry out to Him and don't stop until you know for sure that He has done a good work in you. In Christ, God can legally dismiss your case for breaking His Law because Christ took your load of sins upon Himself, for He cares for you.

Read your Bible, which tells us about the nature of heaven.,
Put your faith in Jesus.,
Be assured that we will be reunited with loved ones who have passed away before us in heaven.,
What will we do in heaven?,
Our bodies will be perfect, strong and ageless in heaven.",How to Know What Heaven Is Like," John 14:2-3 tells us that heaven is a place, where Jesus has gone to prepare homes for those who follow and love him.;
, In heaven, we are with Jesus. But on this earth, we can be with him as well, by simply praying and engaging in a relationship with him. Jesus prayed that his followers would do God's will ""on earth as it is in heaven."" That's a goal of a life of faith.

, In his book ""Heaven Revealed"" Dr. Paul Enns, a pastor and theologian, writes: ""We will excitedly greet one another at that glorious reunion with our believing loved ones. The very moment earth’s door closes and heaven’s door opens—at that very moment—there will be an excited, joyful, and exuberant reunion."" (p. 43)

, Have you ever engaged in work that you love here on earth--something you feel you were ""made to do""? Christians believe that we will have that opportunity in heaven as well. Dr. Enns writes: ""The spiritual gifts we were given at salvation constitute who we are as believers. In continuity with who we are, we will continue to exercise our spiritual gifts. We will be serving, teaching, exhorting, giving, leading and showing mercy according to our giftedness (Rom. 12:7-8)."" (p. 144)

, ""We will have strength, energy, abilities and use of all faculties in an inconceivable dimension."" (Heaven Revealed)

Take denominational differences into account.",How to Keep the Sabbath," Attending a religious service is one of the most important things you can do to remember and keep the Sabbath. While you can and should worship God personally in your day-to-day life, the Sabbath should be a time during which you worship God alongside fellow believers.Worship with other believers helps to fulfill one's spiritual needs. Partaking in the unity of faith can enrich one's relationship with God and his or her fellow Christians.
Church also allows the average Christian to learn and discover more about God from the pastor, the parish, and the other leaders and lay-persons of the church.
For some denominations, like Catholicism, attending public worship provides the individual with the opportunity to take part in holy sacraments, as well.;
, Just as God rested on the seventh day in the story of creation, you, too, should rest on the Sabbath. Take time to relax and heal after the stress and hard work of the proceeding week.


In rest, the Christian has quiet time to turn to God without being distracted by the tasks of everyday life. Ideally, the rest you indulge in on the Sabbath should help you turn to God.The concept of “rest” can vary by person. For some, a long hike in the woods would seem restful, while others would find it to be difficult work. For others, a long bubble bath is a good way to be at rest, but some may find such activities dull, tedious, and distracting. Figure out what puts your spirit in a state of rest and seek to do those types of activities.

, The Sabbath is primarily a time to worship God, but another important aspect of the day is the cultivation of close relationships. Activities that are not focused directly on worshiping God should be centered on nurturing the relationships you have with loved ones.


This is a good time to go on picnics with family and friends or to otherwise sit down and enjoy a good meal together. You can also play games with one another, watch movies together, or do just about any activity that promotes the bond between you.

, The elderly, ill, and poor are among those who are most in need of assistance and service. An excellent way to keep the Sabbath is to mind and attend to the needs of those in your community.


Service does not necessarily need to be hard or stressful work. For instance, you could be a servant to an elderly neighbor who lives alone simply by dropping by, spending time with that person, and easing his or her loneliness. Alternatively, if you know of a friend who has had a hard time lately, you can serve that person by making a phone call or meeting up and listening to his or her woes.

, Even though group worship is important on the Sabbath, you should also try to spend one-on-one time with God that day, too. The exact amount of time you spend is not as important as the quality of time.


Pray, meditate, sing hymns or worship songs, and read the bible. Regardless of what you do, you should try to connect with God in ways that are meaningful to you.

, A general guideline you can use when determining if something should or should not be done on the Sabbath is to ask yourself if the activity glorifies God or otherwise enriches your life or spiritual being. If it does, then the activity is probably fine to include.

, Nowadays, it can be excruciatingly difficult to avoid all the work and activities one would traditionally be expected to avoid on the Sabbath. If there is a task that you must do and it happens to fall on the Sabbath, you can still perform that task.


For example, if a loved one falls ill on the Sabbath, you should run to the store to get medicine or otherwise run to his or her side to care for that individual. Even though this may not be an activity that promotes “rest,” it is important, and the love you show for that individual reflects the love of God.
Similarly, if the only job you can find requires you to work on the Sabbath, you do not need to feel guilty about doing so. Providing for your family is an act of love that, again, reflects the love of God.

, The Sabbath is supposed to be a day of rest. As such, you should try to arrange your work schedule so that you do not need to put any hours in on the Sabbath.


If you are a student, work includes homework as well as any part-time job you might have.
When you are scheduled to work and you have no control over the matter, you can do so. When you do have some control, though, you should do everything in your power to avoid working on the Sabbath. For example, do your homework Friday night instead of waiting until Sunday.

, Large meals should be prepared the day before. Cleaning or household repairs should also be saved for another day.


You can do light cooking or food preparation on the Sabbath, but avoid cooking that keeps you in the kitchen all day. The same applies to other household chores.

, The Sabbath should be a day of healing.Even justified arguments or confrontations can cause pain to all parties involved, so you should work even harder at minding your temper on the Sabbath than you do on the other six days of the week.

, Since life can be so busy, many Christians fall into the trap of using the Sabbath as a day to catch up on tasks that they had no time to complete earlier in the week. Focus on gradually getting more of these activities done before the Sabbath so that the day itself can be left open as a time of joy, worship, and rest.

, Activities that encourage vice are usually discouraged, especially on the Sabbath, even if those activities are not necessarily sinful by themselves.


For example, if shopping often leads you to have greedy or jealous thoughts, you might want to skip doing it on the Sabbath. If, however, it does not promote such attitudes in you, shopping itself is not necessarily a bad thing to do.

, While most of Christianity celebrates the Sabbath on Sunday, the Jewish tradition from which Christianity came celebrated the Sabbath on Saturday, or the seventh day of the week. There are arguments for and against both days.Originally, the Sabbath was issued as a day to remember the blessings of creation as well as the original covenant between God and man during the time of Moses.
Scripture indicates that God rested on the seventh day, which would be Saturday, and that the day itself is holy for that reason: ""For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it"" (Exodus 20:11).
Scripture also explains that the Sabbath should be kept holy as a sign of the covenant God made with His people when they were led out of Egyptian captivity: ""And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day"" (Deuteronomy 5:15).Christ rose from the dead on a Sunday, which is the main reason Christians have for switching the Sabbath day to Sunday. When Christ rose from the dead, a ""new covenant"" was made, and the day marking that covenant's significance is Sunday.

, Another major controversy surrounding the Sabbath is whether or not Christians are still required to keep it. While some view it as a necessity, others insist that the need has been abolished.


While there are many arguments for and against keeping the Sabbath, the underlying controversy seems to be the issue of whether or not that part of the ""old covenant"" was abolished when Christ fulfilled the law and became the ""new covenant.""Those against the Sabbath argue that the command for a Sabbath was part of Mosaic law and the ""old covenant."" Since many other rules of the ""old covenant"" are no longer deemed necessary by Christianity, as evidenced by Paul's argument in Galatians 5 than circumcision is no longer necessary, some Christians also believe that the entire sum of Mosaic law was also negated.
Those in favor of the Sabbath tend to argue that, as one of the Ten Commandments, the need for a Sabbath day remains. This belief holds that the Ten Commandments are laws that must be kept, while other laws that have since fallen to the wayside are those issued as interpretations of the main law rather than the law themselves.

, Within the United States, there was once a time when just about every restaurant and store shut down on Sunday. That certainly is not the case nowadays, but some Christians still believe that things should be that way and may choose to avoid spending money at institutions that are open on Sunday.


Those who choose to support institutions that allow employees to work on Sunday generally argue that the choice to keep the Sabbath is personal, and that one should not shun an institution that makes the choice to remain open.
Those who do not support institutions that are open on Sunday usually argue that keeping the Sabbath is law, and as such, it applies to all mankind even if they do not believe.

, Remember that every denomination can take its own official stance concerning the Sabbath and how to keep it. If you want to avoid breaking the rules or regulations set down by the denomination you have membership with, you should check with a pastor or other religious authority to find out more about your denomination's official stance.

Have a Personal Relationship with God.,
Seek Faith Through God.,
Be Patient and Stand Firm: As Human Beings, we tend to want things in our own time.",How to Have Faith in Jesus," At times God might do things that strengthen your Faith out of his Mercy. If you really want to see the glory of God's Faith, you must get to know God personally and you must be willing to follow him anywhere. Pray and grow with God and over time your Faith will grow as you have more and more experiences with Jesus Christ.;
, The Bible clearly says in John 14:13, ""And I will do whatever you ask in my name , so that Son may bring glory to the Father."" If you come to God and ask him with all your heart for Faith, He will never reject you.

, But as hard as it is, we must have patience and wait for Gods time to bless us. Never give up and never be discouraged. While we wait we must always keep in prayer with the Lord and we must Focus on the Lord at all times. While you wait, believe that God will give you the Faith you asked for. You might start noticing that is what Faith is! Believing.

"
"
Feed your faith: receive a measure of faith from God, through receiving the Word of God -- by studying the Bible.,
Check the Bible where it says Jesus Christ had the faith of God without measure.,
Be born again as a believer by repentance (turning around) and continuing in Christ, so that you will receive within you a measure of faith and the Spirit of God.,
Love your brother.,
Having faith to move problems as mountains is simply trusting God to keep His Word.,
Fellowship with Him and as this develops you will come to agree with those who trust God.,
Cultivate your faith by giving Him the opportunity to reveal Himself to you.,
Act on your faith.,
Think on the Word of God.,
Build your faith by saying one thing and thinking that same thing and acting it out honestly, not by just pretending.,
Edify yourself through faith which is also developed through praying in the language of the spirit (Jude 20).,
Spend time each day, praying and meditating in the Word in your native language and also in other tongues, and you can keep your spirit active instead of being passive.,
Let God inhabit your meditations and praises and grow in your being.,
Refuse to accept doubt.,
Investigate why God inhabits the praises of His people: It was an honor to God, that the tabernacle tent made way for the temple of stone, but now He is within you.So, the tabernacle makes way for the faithful spirit as God's favored dwelling:
But the universe is God's temple; so, what reason then is there for a temple in the human spirit?,
Follow Jesus by faith into the active nature of Christ in the chosen and anointed life, way and the truth: so the redeemed, contrite, faithful human spirit may represent his favored temple that He wants to inhabit.

",How to Increase Christian Faith," According to Romans 10:17, ""So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.""


Faith does not come mainly by praying, begging or fasting or Daniel and Romans 10:17 would only be a suggestion.
The Bible does say ""pray always""; so, an attitude of prayer is essential, but faith comes by hearing and then applying the Word of God.
You must continue to read and study the Word of God (The Bible) so that your faith will grow. II Thessalonians 1:3, ""your faith grows exceedingly."" by living in God's promises in the Bible.;
, He is the living word of God.Faith is called a ""fruit of the Holy Spirit"" that Jesus promised to send after he went to the Father. This may be noticed in the reborn person's spirit even at difficult times; not just on your best days:
~ ""...the fruit of the Holy Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, ..."".

, That means that if you have been born again, then you will have some portion of the nature of God as the Word says. So no one has an excuse: Do not think of yourself more highly than you should, but rather think of yourself soberly, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given to each person. (Romans 12:3)Let faith arise in you, and it can in the area of unseen things that you believe -- within God's will, so then it can be applied to you and actualized by you. You will see results by faith. This is not just a hope; it is the way of God for access to the things of God.

, How can you love God whom you have not seen -- if you cannot love your brother whom you have seen. God will reveal Himself to you through His people, His love, through His son, His Word, and by the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Christ.


Galatians 5:6 says that faith works by love.

, Believe that God cannot lie. You cannot trust God without knowing Him through fellowship of God's presence. This fellowship is quality time spent alone in study, praise and prayer with God, getting to know Him and His life, way and truth (presented in The Bible).


Abraham in Romans 4:19-21 had extremely strong faith by 1) Not concentrating on his circumstances, 2) trusting that God could do what God promised and 3) by Praising God.

,
~ ""Where two or three agree together in my name as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.""(Matthew 18:20), You will know Him as He lives in your life. Fellowship with the invisible God gives birth to your spirit with a measure of the kind of faith that can change things in your visible, physical reality.

, Faith is expressed by actions not just thoughts and words, as you believe then you can receive through that, and then you will seek results like you expect real outcomes as you have expectations of favor with God. God told Joshua that we must be faithful to the scriptures: 
~ ""Never stop meditating on these teachings. You must think about them night and day so that you will faithfully do what is in them.
Only then will you prosper and succeed."" (Joshua 1:8).


Notice in Mark 9:23 that Jesus said that all things are possible to him that believes. ""To believe"" is a verb and requires action. If no action were necessary, Jesus would have said, ""All things are possible to him that has faith."" Faith is a noun. Faith is a gift to us from God.

, That meditation on the Word then reveals how to act upon the Word. Your confessing, testifying of the Word and things of God is part of that prayer and meditation. When you read, digest and speak the Word to yourself, you are meditating on the Word.

, God's Word is already happening but not for you unless you truly believe it. What you meditate upon consists (is formed) of and constitutes (forms) what you believe: 
""Be careful of what you think.
What you think determines what you do.
Be careful what you do with your opportunity.
Those actions determine your faith, identity and character.
Be careful of those aspects of your character, for they determine what occupies your being.
That content occupying your being determines who you are.
So, it is true that: 'We become what we think about.'"" (Based on a common saying.)

, *Praying in other tongues is a kind of spiritual exercising according to the New Testament.

, Scriptures say:
~ ""But ye, beloved, building up yourselves in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost."" (Jude 1:20), Meditating on the Word and agreeing together can cause you to be able to believe God's Word enough to act upon it in faith.

, Begin to praise God when negative thinking comes to your mind then replace that with praising God. If you do believe Him, then you will have plenty of praise for Him. He lives in and through His people who believe Him:~ ""God inhabits the praises of Israel ."" ,
Heaven is his throne, the earth is his footstool; also, none of man's service can profit Him, yet he seeks the faithful to serve him.

Know that Har Megiddo is a spiritual war, for the center.It is a battle for the center of you.,
See that Armageddon is not necessarily going to ever come in the sense that you comprehend it, almost certainly probably.,
Recognize that you cannot see the past, or know the future.,
Witness that people have been looking for 'Armageddon' since the moment Christ began His Ministry.,
Realize that your definition of Armageddon is so untrue, it is a distraction for you.,
Know the Mark of the Beast.",How to Interpret the Battle of Armageddon," Understand that ""Har Megiddo"" may be translated ""Mountain of the Gathering,"" (with some revealing overtones of ""uncertain,"" if you dig further into ""Har"" ), and is not a place, as can be noted in the first lexicon reference, ""Har-Magedon, a mountain of unc. location,"" where ""unc"" means ""uncertain."" Or rather, it is a place, but is given to be interpreted spiritually; it is a spiritual place, the same way that heaven is a spiritual place--or state of being--meaning that there is no ""place"" called heaven, which the Bible is very clear about (Luke 17:20 {et al} “The kingdom of God is not coming with something observable; 21no one will say, ‘Look here! ’ or ‘There! ’ For you see, the kingdom of God is among you.”
Now Megiddo is a real place, , so we'll include the lexicon for it, mostly because you might wish to dig into ""gadad,"" from which Megiddo is derived, mostly because it includes some interesting overtones of self-immolation, or ""you brought this upon yourself,"" pretty much exactly like a father responding to one of their children in the situations that we all experience. So, if you can accept that Jerusalem is the spiritual center, the lexicon informs us that Megiddo was an ancient fortress town, even before David and Solomon.
While the literal stuff of your nightmares may surely come true, to God Armageddon is just the human struggle between the spiritual center, where He balances His ""foot,"" and the forces of the earthly king that God warned us we would be sorry about in 1 Samuel 8. The 'waters' or 'sea' in the Bible represents 'people', and 'mountain' (usually reserved for God) here represents the place that the people who have 'risen up' from the 'waters' (or those seeking God) gather; which is why it is occurring right at the edge of the spiritual center of the universe in The Revelation.
Thus, ""Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon"" in Rev 16:16, can easily be interpreted as ""Then they (the evil spirits) gathered the kings (the people running things) together to the place that is known as the king's fortress--just north of where the 'soldiers' {of God} gather, a spiritual place, derived from the lexicon. For lack of a handier Christian metaphor, The Mahatma's famous quote, “First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, and then you win” may be one perfectly valid reflection of Armageddon, in the context of ""The Revelation of Christ,"" whereas the more literal popular alternative suggests followers of Christ gathering for a violent confrontation, and killing or being killed.
Yes, the blood will flow up to a horse's bridle; signifying the blood of all who died, and likely not just those killed in one epic literal battle.;
, It is a spiritual war for the center (but as a corollary, the culturally accepted definition, or scenario, has happened in the past, at Har Megiddo {we're talking about the plains of Megiddo, now}; strange and terrible wars they would be to us, and not easily comprehended; Genesis 1:2 ""The earth was formless and void"" is better interpreted ""the earth became void, unless we are to believe that God creates void, formlessness, and chaos.
A lexicon of this verse, at the word ""was,"" illuminates this concept, down at ""was, hayah (haw-yaw), to exist, i.e. be or become, come to pass (always emphatic, and not a mere copula or auxiliary)--where we accept ""exist"" or ""be,"" while ""become"" or ""come to pass"" is surely the correct interpretation, and also by following ""tohu"" at the top, clicking on ""8414"" yields ""chaos (1), confusion (1), desolation (1), emptiness (1), empty space (1), formless (2), futile (2), futile things (1), meaningless (2), meaningless arguments (1), nothing (2), waste (3), waste place (2), as well as following ""vavohu, 924,"" so the common interpretation suggests that God made ""confusion, chaos"" etc, which is anathema to God of course. But the point is that there were all kinds of things, giants, etc, present at one time, that seem like fiction to us now.
The war is always at the center of a thing--you don't plot to overturn by raiding an outpost. And furthermore, there is no struggle where God or heaven is concerned. The fight is in you, for the earth. Although the fight spills into the physical plane, it is not a physical fight. There were wars even before man arrived on the scene, in other 'centers,' and not for just the earth; but they do not concern us now.
What is important now is that those ""angels of death"" have always been, and will always be, as long as there is 'free will'; they aren't some satanic horde, except that which is released by man. If you are even reading this, you must care somewhat about discernment; and are surely aware that satan has no power, but what we give him.The Four Horsemen is us (""4"" being the cardinal Directions away from Center),as far from our center as we can get. Think Avarice, Greed, Vanity, etc., and recognize that we are all in this together, regardless of any personal desire to the contrary. In other words, it is easy to personally justify how disconnected from evil you think you are, yet still be in complete slavery to the worldly system. You use petro-dollars, right? Yet tares grow with wheat. It rains on the evil and the good.
As a connected aside, this speaks to what is meant in the Bible by ""witnessing"" -- you are called out of ""the world"" (ego, materialism), while still being an example for the world. ""Witnessing"" is misinterpreted by many Christians to mean that they are to ask people ""Do you know Jesus Christ as your Personal Lord and Savior?"". Recognize that Jesus never cornered anyone in this manner. The Bible admonishes those who would have their ""ship"" in a ""safe harbor."" Proselytizing may be viewed as a sanctimonious and self-serving way to justify fence-sitting, while keeping your ship in harbor.""...let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth."" IJohn3:18
While this is usually done in innocence and caring, it is an affront; you are literally doing ""satan's"" work by using a false representation of Christ to chase people from the coming, new Government (Isa 9:6), especially if you believe that everyone who does not believe exactly like you do is ""lost."" Understand that God is about spiritual ""substance"", or what is ""central"" to you, and it is irrelevant if you call yourself an atheist even, if you then go out and manifest Christ to people. The Parable of the Two Sons reflects this spiritual principle; don't let some guy with a tie tell you it is only about Jews and Gentiles. Read and decide for yourself.

, Except possibly in a very limited sense. The Bible even says ""no one knows where they go when they die."" You don't know where you came, from, or where you are going, and any explanation will amount to words. If either were explained to you, you wouldn't, couldn't fully comprehend; as evidenced by the fact that you would like it explained; and you would cherish a concise explanation above everything you own, probably.
And, there is a Book for this, which can be frustrating to read, because you are looking for proof or facts, while It is full of (apparent) contradictions and questions, and Strong Men have interpreted It for the weaker in such a way that you do not accept, but cannot prove wrong, just as they can not prove that ""Love your neighbor; this fulfills the law"" is all one needs for salvation, the point being that no matter where you come down where Scripture is concerned, you have revealed your heart, which is all God cares about.
Of course, being that man was involved, there was a humongous battle for the Book. The battle for the Book continues to this day, and again, it is your battle to fight, to lose or to win. You have a lexicon available to you, and no new translation can obscure it.
Every possible faction that has a part in the battle for the earth, has an agenda for you in the fight; but, although the battle is for the earth, it has to be fought with the Book. This is because the Book is Truth, and Truth is your only weapon.
Note that you can overcome, and participate in the Kingdom of God without ever reading a Bible; but you are still going to use the principles in It. Truth is also clearly reflected in other books, but this just clouds the issue here. When It was completed, when part II came out, It was locked away for hundreds and hundreds of years, by men, and no one could read It (and they didn't read It, either, of course--they hated It); they would kill you if you did manage to read It, or even if you got caught owning One, these men, and others after them.
And that battle still rages today; now It is no longer kept from you physically, there is no need; It is being kept from you spiritually.
This was all done in the Name, of course, by people who were convinced that they were doing the Right Thing, the Bible calls them ""strongmen.""
Not being able (or, willing) to see the center of something is the same as not knowing it. You can't see the wind, or the ""ether"" (nothing), from where everything comes; we don't know what probably 90% of the species on the planet are, right now, or that ""the earth"" includes all that out there, everything that is physical. To finish, you don't even know where elephants are buried (edit: elephants no longer bury their dead; 40 years ago, this was a mystery, but we've solved it by slaughtering almost all of them); and we probably don't know what Armageddon is, either.
Even one hundred years ago, although we dimly understood the thing ""vacuum"", no scientist on earth could prove how a rocket firing in it would act, or react. There is a point, here, which is to show you, briefly, how much of even the physical plane we, as humans, are ""unaware"" of. Physicists can't find something like 95% of the matter that they know must exist. You are thus hardly compelled to accept the groupthink--or this interpretation, for that matter--where Armageddon is concerned.

, The only thing you can really be certain of is that whatever the herd thinks about a Biblical thing, that is exactly what is not going to happen, by definition. The Bible says that ""even the elect would be deceived, if that were possible,"" and religious people (""Pharisees,"" then) are deemed ""the blind leading the blind."" There is no reason to suspect that today's religious hierarchy are anything other than today's ""Pharisees.""

, It displaces your center in time, toward some imaginary future date...game over! At least until another artifice is needed. Meaning that if you are all plexed up about some coming Apocalypse, you are effectively removed from manifesting Christ.
Just like in the war for the Book, the concept of Armageddon was given to you. There is a description of some of the action, sure; and ""physical"" battles seem to be, and will be, fought. However, Armageddon, for you, will end when you die; your battle is complete, vanquished or Victor.
God does not need to send physical armies for the battle for the earth. Because He could wipe it all off with His foot, and start over, except He can't because He gave it to us. Then we gave it away, too, and, left to our own devices, we wouldn't ever get it back, because look we can't even figure out where elephants are buried. And it's real important that we get it back, too, because the earth is where we go; it is our realm, and we have nowhere else to go.
If you were raised on the belief that you could ""get saved"", get ""baptized"" (by water), then chill 'til you die, and go to Heaven, read this, it's in there somewhere, or even in a Bible, all over the place -- the end of Pr 2, for a start; Is 9:6, all over -- the Bible states explicitly, many times, that the earth is man's realm, and that the Kingdom of God is coming here. You even say it in your prayers; ""on earth as it is in Heaven.""
Luckily for us, despite free will, we have a way to give God permission to act in our realm; prayer. Prayer is the way you make it ok for God to do something in our realm; otherwise, He pretty much won't. We call this ""religious"", but religion is another thing that we have differing definitions of; among ourselves, and between us and God -- and ""religious"" prayers are admonished in the Bible -- they are deemed pointless, and not listened to by God.
Religion is just another distraction. ""Man's attempt to reach God"" is the accepted definition. There you go. It is likely just the other side of the coin of politics, and you can't have one without the other; but don't let that convince you that God is religious, just go and read what Christ had to say about religion.
Funny thing about the Church, though, is you know exactly what it is, or you...sense it; intimate knowledge of it is inside you, you were born with it, and it cannot be removed; although it can be ignored, despised, refuted, denied. It has nothing to do with religion; It is a collection of ""living stones.""
Despite all your concepts about the Church, which were passed down, 'given' to you; despite the desperate attempt to portray the New Government (Is 9:6) as Religion, Usurper, Oppressor, Whore, or Thief; and despite all the war, and the battles for the Book, you know what the Church is. This is because it is your center; it is that vision, that we all had (or have); that you knew intimately when you were a small child, before what you were ""given"" removed it to fable.
A great description for Heaven may just be ""What you thought life would be like when you were a little kid""
""I AM"" is right next to you, right now, to choose, and does not require anything that you don't have with you, right now. Oh, and you can only, ever choose it right now, because that's all you'll ever have; that's why it's ""I AM"", and not ""I will be"", or ""I was"". ""Understand I AM"" means you should understand the concept of I AM, the ""am"" being made emphatic here, not titular, else ""Am"" would do fine.

, This ""mark,"" surely not a physical mark, is placed either on one's ""hand,"" which is what we use to do everything with; or on one's ""forehead,"" which is where we get the idea to do those things (""forehead,"" specifically, is the seat of our self cognizance, but that is another monologue). And so, ""...received the mark of the beast in their hand or forehead"" may be interpreted ""predisposed to evil in everything they think, and everything they do."" And truly, cannot conduct business, or ""buying and selling,"" without this mark; in other words, if you try to make something as well as you are able, and retail it, you are not going to be in business long--you ""must"" be a slave to profit in order to conduct business.

See what the Bible says about ""How would I know that I have faith?"",
Build your faith by hearing God's Word.,
Build your faith so that you can please God.,
Pray expecting your answer.,
Live by faith.",How to Know That You Have Faith," Romans 12:3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you,not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.;
, Romans 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. The Word clearly states that faith comes by the hearing of God's word. Either by reading God's word, listen to other Godly friends testimonies, to listen to the Word of God Sunday mornings/evenings in church or in the children church. To hear the promises of God everyday will surely build your faith. Example of promises Jeremiah 29:11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. and Romans 8: 28 explains that the life of faith works out right:And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose.

, Hebrews 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. A good example is Abraham. In the apostle Paul’s letter to the Romans he says about Abraham that he was not startled by God's promises: He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; And being fully persuaded that: what he had promised, he was able also to perform (Rom 4:19-21).

, Build up your faith by praying in the Holy Spirit: (Jude20, 1Corinthians14:14)

, To know what it means to live by faith, you should know what faith means. Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. To have faith in in God's promises is not based on what you see, but on the fact/evidence that you believe God although you do not see the answer hoped for with your natural eyes yet. You should live by faith and not by sight, for example: If you lose your job, then you should believe that God is helping you find a good job. You should begin thanking God every morning that you are already receiving a new job, although you do not see it yet. When you apply for work, know it is on its way; that confidence will show through. That's faith. Confidence in God's ways. Romans 1:17 says,For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, 'The just shall live by faith'.

Meet a person that you think is not a Christian.,
Give sincere compliments.,
Continue talking and activities to make a friendship as you naturally do!,
Listen and remember the answers (make some notes later -- to be sure to remember) because you asked some interesting questions that gets them going!,
Keep questions light and not prying into very personal matters.,
Try not to imply that you need or want to help this person, just be an interested friend, but be aware of attitudes and ideas about life!

,
Invite your friend after being a friend for a few weeks or several months to go to church with you.,
Talk to your friend about the immediate benefits of becoming a Christian such as being filled with happiness and receiving power from God.

,
Be courageous, so do not feel like being nervous is bad.,

Try to get enough of a show of interest to talk about the story of Jesus.,Encourage your friend to be a Christian by sharing examples and testimonies of how people find God and as He miraculously helped others -- and can also help them being a Christian,
Talk about the idea that ""everyone has sinned (done wrong), and come short of the glory of God."",
Talk about the fact that there is a promise of the miracle of receiving the Holy Spirit available to everyone who asks.

,
Eventually if you can work it in, then talk, discuss, explain about accepting God's plan to be saved from ""the wages of sin and death,"" and read Ephesians 2:8-10.for example it says basically how to receive salvation is:

""... by grace, through faith; not of yourself; it is the gift of God; not by working, because people could boast (or brag) and to be saved to do good things that God has already prepared for us to do them... and to love each other as Christ has first loved us""...""


,
Consider that when/if you feel that it will be accepted, then to ask (but being careful to talk about it first) for your friend to desire to repeat after you in a simple and self explanatory prayer of repentance (willing to change) and asking for salvation - to be saved as a free gift from God.,
Be sure your friend understands the purpose of such a prayer to repent - desire and plan to change, and that one will always continue to ask for help and forgiveness and to confess moral mistakes and failings.,
Encourage them to praise God and even to glorify God like when someone wins a big prize or a big victory.",How to Help Somebody to Be a Christian," It's not unusual by talking and getting some indications that you may socialize and get feelings about beliefs.

, Tell why you said those nice remarks: A sincere compliment can be explained to get someone to warm up to you. But be careful not to say something too personal that may make him or her feel uncomfortable. Be nice, but not gushing with sweetness. Be real...

,


Mention work, school, church (like church activities) as one way to draw out reactions to such topics without aiming straight at spirituality.

, Most people love to talk about themselves--to start it. ""What classes do you like?"" ""Have you seen/heard (Insert-Something-Here)? What did you think of it?""

, Don't ask too many questions and just stop and try another idea to discuss, if he or she is not talking about your topic. Don't seem to teach or lecture...

,, When the service is over, ask whether it was interesting or how s/he liked it.

,, It's great to have butterflies when you try something that seems iffy. What if it is unwelcome; well, just don't push or pull.


If the reaction gets a ""Didn't like it..."", that's not a problem.

, Don't apologize for inviting or asking about a visit to church.

,, Hurray, for you, the missionary who is going into your community, school and in your social life!

,, So, we do not meet the standards of our Holy, Perfect Loving-God.

,,, If you prefer then get a Pastor or Minister to explain and lead the prayer.;
,


Your basic prayer may be something like this:

""Heavenly Father, Dear God, I am sorry for all the wrong things I have done. I know that You really love me, and I come to You without using pride or making any demands. I want to change, but I know I never will deserve Your love, Father, and your free forgiveness. I know that Jesus died and rose from death by your power to save me from being lost. Thank You, Jesus, for helping me to love others and do right for people. Thank You, Lord Jesus, for everything that You are doing in my life, and answering prayer when I ask You unselfishly and if I believe You. Thank You for saving me -- giving me a new life -- and for the gift of your love and the Holy Spirit to guide and help me. I ask all of this in Jesus' name. Amen""



, It is like that and bigger than that...

, You will grow and learn all of what makes a relationship work through studying the path of Christ. Discuss and grow with your partner through church, the word of the gospel and in prayer. Make Christ the foundation of your life.

, All of life's problems and solutions are written about in the New and Old Testament. If something in life is troubling you and your partner, take the time to relate the situation to the teachings of God in the Living Book.

, It is written that anything we ask for in His name, we shall receive if it is not asked wrongly. Take comfort in knowing a solution to a problem is only as far away as remembering the love, respect, compassion and trust that you based your earthly relationships on in the first place. ""Anything worth having is worth working for"". It may become troublesome at times when two individuals are trying to be together, but take solace in the Lord and strength to confront problems and comfort each other with solutions. All things happen for a reason and everyone needs time to learn about the other and accept/help/teach and listen to one another. Remember that we are all members in the same body.

, Read and learn how he dealt with situations and personal dealings. Know that He put love first in anything He did. Mimic Him and follow Him with all your heart and know that if it is just before the eyes of God, no one will interfere. God has a plan for all of us and He wants us to be happy, so, listen to the ""voice behind the voice: because there is the truth and guidance.

, We all have tribulations and trials in our lives which are to lead us to the glorifying of the Father. Jesus Christ went through immeasurable struggles and in the end He was raised up from the dead and ascended into heaven. Use Him as your strength, as your guide, as your master in all struggles and always glorify Him through prayer. When relationship struggle starts, know that it is a test: of faith and of love. Christ in all things used love to show everyone the truth and we should do exactly the same. Let love rule in your heart just as He did and never forget the reason why you started the relationship in the first place.

, We need Him and we need each other. We need Christ to show us the way to heaven. We need each other to keep walking towards Him. We can lean on each other to help strengthen our earthly relationship and we can count on Him to guide us to what is right.

, All in time. The thing here to remember is to be patient and loving, to have understanding and growth knowing that all is revealed in time and to know that the light conquers the darkness. Use the opportunity to grow and learn from your mistakes. To look inside yourself to establish what went wrong and to grow as individuals as well as a team. When trouble arises in a relationship it is important to look to Jesus in all His dealings to guide and correct us. The most important thing He did for us can be summed up in one word ""giving"".

, And please always remember to have Christ in your life. To love Him like no other. Listen to God's will above all. Pray to Him for every answer in good or bad situations because then we will always have a happy and joyful relationship with not only each other but also with the rest of humanity. You know life is hard at times but remember all things are possible with God.

Read and study the Bible as a personal books and letters, all from God to you.,
Trust and believe in God.,
Love God and put His Will before everything else.,
Love thy neighbor as thyself.,
Repent of your sins, ask Him to forgive you of all your sins, and mean it well.,
Be in an attitude of prayer and thankfulness while praising God and blessing others at all times.

Tell others about God.,
Renew your mind as a Christian to do God's will.",How to Have a Personal Relationship With God (Christianity)," To get to know God, you must first listen to what He has to say. Start from the beginning with the book of Genesis and gradually read your way through the end of the book of Revelations. Alternatively, you might start with the book of John to gain understanding of the story of Christ, and how he provided for your life in God. He finished the Plan of Salvation so that no one should be lost or alone, but that all should walk in new life in Christ.;
, Realize that God loves you with all His being, and that He wants to help you walk through life by walking with Him, in everyday life and in your Spirit.

, The greatest commandment in the law is to love God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. (Matthew 22:35-38). To love God is to keep His commandments, and His commandments are not grievous (1 John 5:3). Hereby we do know that we know him: if we keep His commandments. He that saith, ""I know Him"", and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in Him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in Him. He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked (1 John 2:3-6). Moreover, Jesus said, If ye love me, keep my commandments (John 14:15). He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me: and he that loveth Me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him (John 14:21). If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in His love (John 15:10).

, (Lev 19:18) Jesus said that this is the second greatest commandment like unto the first commandment to love God, and upon these two commandments hang all the laws and prophets. (Matthew 22:39-40) To strengthen our relationship with others is to strengthen our relationship with God.


Honour your father and mother, that your days may be long upon the earth. (Ex 20:12)






Do not kill (Ex 20:13)






Do not commit adultery (Ex 20:14)






Leave some fruits of your harvesting for the poor to glean. (Lev 19:10)






Do not steal. (Lev 19:11)






Do not cheat (deal falsely). (Lev 19:11)






Do not lie. (Lev 19:11)






Do not swear falsely, to profane God's name. (Lev 19:12)






Do not curse the deaf or put a stumblingblock before the blind. (Lev 19:14).






Do not judge unrighteously. Neither respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness judge thy neighbour. (Lev 19:15)






Do not gossip or spread rumours. (Lev 19:16)






Do not hate your brother in your heart. (Lev 19:17) According to Jesus, this is the same as murder. (Matt 5:21-22)






Do not avenge or bear grudges against your neighbours. (Lev 19:18)






Do not covet thy neighbour's house, thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's. (Ex 20:17)







, To repent is to feel genuine sorrow for your sins and to desire to sin no more. If you continue to take pleasure in sinful acts, it is not genuine repentance.


""For All Have Sinned and Come Short of the Glory of God"". (Romans 3:23)
According to Christianity Jesus as Savior is considered a gift from God and, he allowed himself to be whipped and to die for you so that you could receive the comforter which is the gift of the Holy Spirit ""Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you."" (John 16:6, see also John 14:26)

,, Be baptized for the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38).

, Know that when you receive the Holy Spirit that you are His child and that you will go and live with Him forever when you leave this earth one day.

, Seek for things to happen in God's way and time, not yours. Get started, be patient to learn and serve, and your faith will grow.

, ""Seek his Kingdom first and everything else will be added!"" Spend time with God, think on Him and the things of Him, and seek His will--to do it. Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. (Matt 5:14)

, (Romans 12:2) You must renew it with the Word of God. Set aside personal time with God to read the Bible every day or at night before you go to bed -- for example, read these verses: II Cor 5:7, Jn 13:34-34, Jn 14:6,23,26,27 Jn 10:10, Phil 4:13,19, Eph 1:3, I John 2:27, Isaiah 24:3 Jn 6:27, Eph 6:10, Hebrews 10:16-17. Meditate and reflect upon God's word and pray regularly for his guidance in your daily life.

"
Be a loving person.,
Have joy.,
Stay at peace.,
Have patience with others.,
Be kind.,
Be a good person overall.,
Be faithful.,
Be gentle.,
Have self-control.",How to Have the Fruit of the Holy Spirit," Paul says in Cor. 13, ""Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."" To see how loving you are, try doing a self-assessment and ask yourself if you are all these things. Are you patient? Are you kind? Do you not envy? etc.


Also one of the greatest commandments is to love others. ""Greater love hath no man that this; that he lay down his life for his friend."" Jesus set the example for us of how to love by dying for us. The Bible says, ""We love because he first loved us."";
, It is impossible to feel perfectly happy everyday. Life is hard sometimes, and it has a way of making us down at times. But joy is different than happiness. Joy is more like a subdued peace or calm. It is a feeling that everything will be ok despite what happens.


The Bible says, ""The joy of the Lord is your strength."" The more that you are able to have joy, and not let yourself be depressed, the more strength you will have to tackle life. Happiness and joy often times are a choice.
We can't control what happens to us, but we can control whether or not we will let things steal our joy. Don't let things steal your joy. Learn to stay relatively happy with life no matter what happens.

, We also can chose to stay at peace no matter what happens. The Bible says that we are not to ""take offense."" We can chose to let things get to us, or we chose to not let them. Don't let people get under your skin. Don't let people affect you so much. Learn to stay at peace no matter what.


Recognize that God will ""work all things together"" for your good. The more you are able to trust God, the more you will be able to stay at peace.
Also there is the verse, ""Do not be anxious for anything but in everything, by prayer and petition present your requests to God and the peace of God that transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."" We are to have peace in Christ. We are to let him ""lead us beside still waters"" and ""restore our soul."" God does not want us to run ourselves ragged. He wants us to rest in Him. To be still and know that He is God.
The main way to truly have peace is to follow God's commandments. The Holy Spirit will convict us when we stray and this will keep us from being able to have peace. So ""fear God and keep his commandments"" and you will have His peace ""that passes all understanding.""

, Don't rush people. Don't demand that they do things quicker etc.


We are to have patience with other people even when they hurt us. We know that God is still working on all of us so this means not having unrealistic expectations of others. We are to have grace and peace with ourselves and others. The more we have patience with ourselves, the more we can with others.
Sometimes we are our own worst enemy. We need to recognize that, even though we are saved, we still battle with the flesh. None of us are perfect. ""If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."" Recognize that you will sin, that it is a fact of life, and you will then be able to have more patience with yourself. Spiritual growth is a process. Also recognize that others will sin against you. It is inevitable. But God will give you the strength to be patient with others and forgive them.

, Be polite. Say please and thank you. Don't interrupt others when they are talking. Really, really listen to people. Don't be loud and obnoxious. Be quiet and humble.


Kindness is the opposite of being rude. It is ""to do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" It is esteeming others as better than yourself. It is respecting others, valuing them, protecting their feelings. It is being gentle with the others and not being quick to judge them.
It is trying to always say things that will build that other person up. ""Let your conversation be always full of grace"" Paul said. Kindness is speaking with grace to others. It is having a soft heart. It is being compassionate with others as Jesus was. Remember to be kind to everyone you interact with today and people will see God in you.
A great quote is, ""Preach the gospel at all times. Use words only when necessary."" How do we preach the gospel at all times? By being kind to others.

, Try to be good. No one can be perfectly good except for God, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't still try. To be good is to follow God's commandments as best as we can. To be good is to be in right standing before God and others. To be good is to be above reproach. To have a good name. To have a good character and reputation.

, Here are some practical ways to be faithful to others: Be dependable. Be on time. Stay committed to your spouse. Be committed to your friendships. Stay in touch with your parents and siblings etc.


Jesus said, ""Let your yes be yes."" We are to do what we say we are going to do. We are to follow through on commitments. We are to say what we mean and mean what we say. We are to not be flaky or halfhearted in our commitments. We are to be like a rock or an oak tree.
The world is generally scattered and can be all over the place, but Christians are called to be firmly planted and rooted in Christ and in His word. We are to be different. We are to be faithful to others and to God.

, Don't be easily angered; be slow to anger, as God is. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Learn to be submissive when you need to. Be gentle with other people's hearts and feelings; treat them the way you would want to be treated.


Gentleness is like how one must interact with a young child. There is a quote, ""In order to treat everyone in your life better, picture them as a young child or an elderly person."" Having this mentality would make us much more gentle with others. It would make us more gracious and kind and humble in our interactions.
To be gentle is to not be proud, to not insist on your own way. It is to be soft with others. To be tenderhearted and kind.

, Don't believe Satan's lies that you can't control yourself. Any Christians with the Holy Spirit has the ability to control themselves.


Self-control is often the one that most Christians struggle with. It can range from our eating habits to the thoughts we allow ourselves to think. It can be related to activities we choose to do etc. The key is to not let ourselves be mastered by anything. Good things can become idols when we do not have self-control with them.
A good way to grow in your ability to have self-control is by fasting. Fasting is the best way to keep your body in check and to learn to say no to your body. It trains you to not give in to every desire that you have. In 1 Cor. 9:27 Paul says, ""I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified."" It is very necessary that we have mastery over ourselves and fasting can be a great way to accomplish this.

"
"
Realize that personal devotions have to be a choice.,
Do devotions as soon as you wake up.,
Have a set place for devotion and certain ideas on how you will ""do"" devotion.

,
Start by listening to God, read the Bible and spend time meditating on it.,
Involve prayer in your meditation; you can pray verses or converse with God while reading the Bible; just make sure you are also listening to what God might be saying.,
Set out to read a passage of Scripture rather than a verse or two, context is important; but if you do find that one verse has a lot to say to you allow yourself the flexibility to meditate it.,
Do not beat yourself up about missing a daily devotion; make sure you complete it later in the day if at all possible, God is not an angry dictator but loves you enough to understand.

,
Keep a devotional journal.,
Go through a few questions before starting, such as: Do I need to forgive anyone?,
Enjoy the relationship.",How to Have a Personal Christian Devotion," If we have a relationship based on a ""have to"" then it is more like a work relationship than a love relationship. Devotions have to be based on love.;
, Here you are still relaxed and setting the tone for the day, spending time reflecting on God’s Word must be beneficial in this.

,, Devotion is not a good time to follow a reading plan, otherwise you will get sucked into a ""have to"" and not spend time listening to God. However a separate Bible reading plan is useful as we need to know what God is saying and know how to place Scripture in context but this is different from a time of devotion.

, A relationship is two way. Meditation should include quiet reflection and an open heart.

, A relationship needs flexibility.

,, It can be a very useful tool for remembering how things touched you and reflecting further or at a later date. A dedicated notebook and pen or pencil are useful for this and should be kept with your devotion Bible.

, Do I have to ask anyone to forgive me? Is anything in my heart blocking me from getting the most from this personal act of devotion? Do I need to confess any sin?

, What a great way to start the day by conversing with God!

,, (Psalm 96:8,9){The word ""fear"" used to mean ""revere"" in Hebrew, but over time the meaning of the word in our language has changed to ""fear"" or, ""a feeling of terror."" A god who wants you to find rest and refuge in him would never want us to fear him (2 Samuel 22:3, Matthew 11:28, Psalm 111:10)}


He is Unmoved: Unchangeable, undefeated Conqueror and Champion of saving souls that are called to repent.

, So, give all honor to the Father, and the Son and to the Holy Spirit in all things good or ill--great or small.

, His eyes are upon them from early to late. His plan for his followers is a good plan never bad.

, Jesus said, ""What you do to the least of these my children, you do to me."" Strengthen one another.

Let your light shine: Follow Jesus example and teach people in the ways of God so that they can follow. ""Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path"". (Psalm 119:105)

Do good works: Jesus example of good works was that He went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him. Jesus has empowered believers to go and do the same thing Believers will lay hands on the sick and they will recover (Mark 16:18)

Glorify God: The result of Jesus example was ""when they saw the dumb speak, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel."" (Matthew 15:31)

Seek the Lord with all your heart: So then you can follow Jesus' example ""And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart."" (Jeremiah 29:13) Then follow Jesus, no longer at a distance.

,


""And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning."" (Acts 10:44-46 Acts2:4) ""Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. In view of the fact that God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ -- then what was I, that I could withstand God? When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, 'Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.' "" (Acts11:15:18)
So believers also should seek to get others (including themselves) baptized with the Holy Spirit as Jesus instructed his followers to do while he was here on earth.

"
"
Do as Jesus said, including stop worrying, ""don't fret"".,
Be sure that you believe, are born again and filled with His Holy Spirit (as your guide and comfort).,
Stop caring what negative people say about you; so, that means you will not be carrying a burden of guilt, shame, disappointment or anger,... People will always have their opinions.,
Forgive yourself, for anything and everything.,
Seek God's best with God.,
Make provision for God's best with others.,
Pray: ""Whenever you praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions.,
Work hard as necessary, but don't do too much.,
Don't expect eastern religious practices such as Yoga bring God's best.,
Set your mind on things of Christ's Spirit, and honestly avoid materialism and its end result:



""For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh/world, but those who live according to the Spirit of Christ, on the things of the Spirit/'Life'."",
Do good to and give to God's children and especially to the poor.,
Spread the Gospel, God's love, The Truth, Life, and Way, for your best life now and that more abundantly, as found in serving God and doing good for the least of God's children, in Jesus Christ.",How to Have God's Best (as a Christian)," Accept life in Christ's way ""I give you peace, not as the world gives"" (real joy/peace). Take no unnecessary thought about tomorrow. There is no point to worrying, but coming up with a game plan -- in work or play, good tactics and strategy (to tackle your short-/medium/-and long-term goals) -- is essential. If you are worrying, think about God's blessings and promises. Let go, and let God lead you in what you can not. Don't try to control things that you really aren't able to control anyway. God is in ultimate control, but you are by no means like a robot.

College and career: Prayerfully fill out applications to colleges or for employment. Get up/Go into action, such as making and sending resumes, filling out applications online, knocking on the right doors, or whatever you need to do to find your needs. Knock on doors, or whatever you should do.
School and/or work day -- ""How can you get going?"" -- by following Christ in the path that God has placed in front on you. Walk in it and live in God's plan (without wavering/wandering). He has the whole world in his hands, so we don't need to worry about world events. Live in the present time... As Jesus said, ""Who of you by worrying can add a single day to your lives?"" You can't. So there is no point in doubt, vague fears or regrets.



 

;
, Follow God's commandments, for example Jesus said: ""A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."" (John: 34,35).

, Don't worry about it. What you think about you (and what God thinks about you) is all that matters, as you do right by others. You can never please everyone, so stop trying so hard to please self-centered people. Paul said in Galatians 1:



""Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ."" You can't please both God and people (the world). Generally you have to pick whether you are going to try to please God or the world (silly fads, immorality, wild-living). And as John said,


""If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father (God) is not in him."" To try to please the world all the time is to love/and-follow the world, so we need to be careful not to do this.



, This includes things you did as an adult and all way back to things you have done at any time since you were born. You can't change the past, so let it go, forgive yourself and move on. You won't really have God's best in general until you make God's best for/with yourself. You need to generally like yourself and get along with yourself, because you will always be there. You can't get away from yourself. Wherever you go, there you are. So become your own friend, then you will have God's best spiritual presence inside of yourself. God, the perfect and holy one, even gives you grace; so give yourself grace. You never have been and never will be perfect. So get over trying to be. Amen

, Confess what you need to (wrongs/sins) and then forget about it. God says he will remove your sins as far as the east is from the west when you confess them and admit you were wrong. He puts them out of his mind and you should too. There is no sense beating yourself up over something that you can't change. Like a famous prayer says about acceptance, ""God help me accept the things I cannot change."" Amen.

, The only thing you can change about the past is the damage you may have done to relationships. You may need to make amends with some people and say ""sorry"". Sometimes it feels like we have unfinished business, if we leave something in a state of tension. Break the ice, admit you were wrong, and then you and the other person can let go of any bitterness and move on. Sometimes God won't let us rest with ourselves and be at God's best place unless we take care of certain things. The Bible says in Matthew 5:



""Therefore if you are presenting your offering ... and remember that your brother has something against you, leave your offering there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your offering."" Another good verse that is related to this is in Mark 11.

, But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions."" -- to avoid consequences! So we need to forgive others and we need to ask for their forgiveness, if we have done them wrong. When Jesus was asked how many times we are to forgive others He said, ""70 times 7"", as in, countless times. Decide as Joyce Meyer says, ""Do yourself a favor and forgive,"" because you will never truly have God's best until you forgive everyone and anyone who has done you wrong., Enjoy what you do, have fun, and find joy in life. Take a Sabbath; one day a week to do nothing much, but worship and meet with fellow believers. Give yourself breaks. Get a massage, if you have aches and pains. Enjoy relaxing at a nearby a river, lake, mountains or a beach. Get outside and walk a park or in the woods. If you don't live by such places, enjoy walking through a market or shopping mall, etc. Get a pet that will make you laugh.

, It is possibly occultic. It seems innocent, but it can open a door to Satan in your life. Avoid this personal experience. Seek for God's best, not things of this world. Amen.

, Sow the best seeds to receive God's best:

""Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life…"" (Galatians 6:8).

, And thus you avoid the possible ""love-of-money"" knowing that ""the love-of-money ""(or anything of economic value to you) ""is the beginning of all evil""


Do right in relationships: ""Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with good blessings, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a greater blessing/reward."" For great is your reward in truly following Christ, in any case -- not so in the world of the flesh, in its bondage and corruption of not following Him closely.

, Whatever Jesus said was not his own words but came from our Father in Heaven. Jesus said:



""Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."" (Matthew 25:40).

""Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to/for one of the least of these, you did not do it to/for me."" (Matthew 25:45).

"
"
Always remember to ""test the spirits."",
Remember to always, always be wise.,
Strive to grow into full maturity in your Christian walk.,
Remember that Jesus said in the last days many false teachers would arise.,
Watch out for teachings that cause division in the body of Christ.,
Renew your mind.,
Be discerning of what a person's fruit is.,
Always, always test what someone teaches by the word of God.",How to Have Christian Discernment," 1 Jn. 4:1 says, ""Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.""


The reality is, one third of ""angels"" are fallen angels. Angels appear to human beings often, but the catch is to know whether it is God's angel or a fallen angel. This is why John warns us to test the spirits.
There is the Holy Spirit, and then there are evil spirits that are set on deceiving people, which can sometimes be in other people.
2 Cor. 11:13-15 says, ""For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. And, no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds."" This is referring to people who call themselves Christian but are actually not. John says a way to ""test the spirits"" is to see whether they acknowledge that Jesus is God. That is the main way.
Also look at the fruit that a spirit produces, in a person, a church, a church leader, etc. Is it the fruit of the Holy Spirit or not? Jesus said, ""You shall know them by their fruit."";
, Jesus said in Mt. 10:16, ""Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves."" Jesus wants us to understand evil without letting it make us evil. We need to be as ""wise as a serpent.""


In the Garden of Eden, Satan was a serpent. The reason Eve was deceived by him was because she was not as wise as Satan. Yes, ""greater is He that is in us, than He that is in the world,"" but if we try to outsmart Satan in our own strength, we won't be able to. He is the master deceiver. We need to give him more credit than we do. He is highly intelligent. So in order to have mastery over him, we need to study the word so that we become more intelligent than he is.
Paul said to Timothy in 2 Tim. 3:15, ""From childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus."" The more we read and study the Bible, the more wise we will become.

, Hebrews 5:14 also says, ""Solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil."" The more we practice being able to tell good from evil, that is the more we judge situations based on what the Bible says, the more mature and wise we become as Christians. Then we will be able to eat solid food, which is the deeper things in the Bible. Then we will be able to see through Satan's schemes and lies, which is our having discernment.


In Eph. 4 Paul says that God has given us teachers, etc. in the church to teach us, ""So that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes."" When we are a ""baby Christian"" we are not as discerning; we cannot see through Satan's schemes as well. But, the more we learn, the more we grow, and we are then able to stand firm in our faith. We are no longer ""tossed to and fro"" by the waves of false teachings. We come to know our Bibles well, and we know the truth, so we cannot be swayed.

, Jesus said in Matthew 24:24, ""For false Christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect."" He was talking about the end times, which we are in now. He said that their signs and wonders would be so convincing that almost even ""the elect"" would be deceived.


Most of the time when the Bible talks about signs and wonders in the last days it is referring to what false teachers will be doing. You can do a study on this, and you will come to see that. If there are churches that have a lot of miracles happening, but they seem chaotic, know that God is not in complete charge there, because Paul says in 1 Corinthians 14:33, ""God is not a God of confusion but of peace."" God's Holy Spirit would not lead to confusion but peace.

, 1 Tim. 6:3 says, ""If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness, he is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions, and constant friction among people.""


Try to focus on teachings that promote unity in God's body. If there are people arguing that some in the body of Christ are better than others, in certain ways, then disagreements can produce quarrels, envy, dissension , friction, etc.

, Romans 12:2 says, ""Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect."" We cannot really have discernment until we allow God to renew our minds. This means cleaning out the old ways of thinking and bringing in new ways of thinking. This means allowing God to control our thoughts and not our selfish motives, and not Satan.


Also, as Christians, we can learn to hear God's voice. In John 10:27 Jesus said, ""My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me."" This is not an audible voice, but a quiet voice in our minds, our renewed minds. We can't hear God's voice, if we are always listening to the world's voice. We have to empty our minds of the world in order to hear God's voice. We have to ""be still and know"" that He is God. We have to meditate and focus on God in order to really hear what He wants to say to us.

, Jesus said in Mt. 7:18-20, ""A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit......Thus you will recognize them by their fruits."" A person may appear to bear good fruit, but you always need to look closer. It could be just an act or a show. Are they genuinely loving others or just pretending to? Do they genuinely have peace, or are they just good at appearing like they do? Are they patient, self-controlled, gentle, joyful, and generally good?

, Don't just take their word for it. See whether what they are teaching is actually Biblical. Learn to read and understand the Bible for yourself. Every Christian has the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is who gives us spiritual eyes to see. So any Christian can see the truth for themselves. You do not need to depend on someone else to explain everything to you, if you truly do have the Holy Spirit inside of you.


There was a group that Paul was teaching called the Bereans, and ""Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so."" (Acts 17:11). The Scripture commended them for testing what Paul said by the Word of God. That is what they were supposed to do, and that is what we are supposed to do.
If a teacher is really teaching the truth, one won't be offended, if you want to test what is said by the Bible. They will encourage it.

Give what you can.,
Set aside your tithe first.,
Find joy in the ability to bless others in God's name.,
Do not wait to tithe.,
Think of other ways to tithe.,
Let it hurt a little.,
Reduce luxuries and give that money to tithe.",How to Tithe on a Budget," It is the person with the least, whose sacrifice to give is greater, whose tithe means the most to God. Mark 12:41-44 tells how people who had money tithed the amount they were supposed to tithe, which ended up being a lot of money. When it came time for a poor widow to tithe, she put in 2 little pennies. Jesus declared her offering of higher value because she gave all she had.;
, Tithe is not meant to come from what is left over. God's instructions are to give the first fruits of our labor. Which is better, to be served a plate of steaming, hot food, right off the grill or to be handed a plate of the same food, cold, picked apart and half-eaten? His people are to want to give to Him. Being on a tight budget, you are in the perfect position to see God's blessings from obedience. Malachi 3:10 says that tithing to God first will result in great blessing. A point He must want His people to understand, God repeats it again in Proverbs 3:9-10.

, According to 2 Corinthians 8:11-12, God is more concerned with obedience and attitude than He is about how much money is being put in the plate. Do not feel bad about what you can or can not give. And do not let others make you feel bad either. God cares about your obedience and motivation, not your bank account.

, If you put off tithing, you will spend that money in other ways. If you wait to give until you can afford it, you might get stuck in a routine of not tithing. Keep it a priority--not out of duty, but of wanting to do what God desires of you.

, In early biblical times, people gave offerings of their produce and livestock. They gave what they had to give. Instead of focusing on your finances right now, which can leave you feeling defeated, give what you have to give. Tithe your time. Tithe your talents and abilities. Volunteer to take care of something the church or community needs to have done. Make something. Fix something. Help someone. Donate things. See a need and take care of it.

, An offering is supposed to be a sacrifice. God's offering was a huge sacrifice--He gave his only son. Tithing is not that demanding of us. However, think back to those early biblical families that gave their first fruits. The first fruits were the best and most cherished of the gathering, a commodity that they surely would have rather kept to themselves, but they gave it to God instead.

, While you are on a tight budget, look for ways to give instead of reasons not to give. Can you sell anything you do not need anymore? Evaluate your television or phone service to see if you are paying for services that you don't use. Are there unnecessary items you can trim off your grocery list, or opt for generic or sale items instead? Could you pick up some side work somewhere? Get the family involved in the effort by collecting cans to turn in for tithe money.

Going to church can be an intimidating experience for a lot of people, so you want to make sure first-timers feel as welcome as possible. For this reason, it's common for churches to have greeters posted out in the parking lot, making sure that new visitors have some idea of where they should be and don't get scared off before they even make it into the building.


Choose especially warm and friendly church members for this job. It can be an excellent way of giving particularly bubbly young members something to do before the service, or letting senior members feel valued.
Make sure the greeters avoid accusatory or unwelcoming language, like, ""What are you doing here?"" or ""What do you need?"" Instead, just assume that everyone's in the right place. Say, ""Hey there! Welcome! How're you doing today?"" Listen and help out.;
, Don't put the pressure on the visitors to introduce themselves and make the first contact. Visitors should be comfortable to relax and to sit back if they want to, or to have conversations and make friends if they're interested. Take the pressure off by introducing yourself and your family, and getting the names of the visitors.


Treat the visitors as people, not as ""visitors."" No one wants to go somewhere looking to be welcomed and instead be made to feel strange or in a separate category. Ask them questions and learn about the visitors to make them feel welcomed. Look for common ground to discuss and help them to feel as if the visitors belong.

, Many church members forget what it's like to visit a church for the first time. Most first-time visitors aren't interested in deep matters of doctrine and the content of the sermons–they're just looking to find out where to park and where to sit and listen. They just want to feel welcome. Slow down and focus on helping visitors get comfortable and make the experience easy and stress-free.


Make sure visitors know where they can park, where to get a quick cup of coffee, and where to hang their coat. Get a pamphlet that outlines the service for the day and be available for any questions.Give a quick tour of the building, if time permits. Show visitors the room where the service will take place and any other attractive facilities, if they seem interested. Some back-story about the history of the congregation can be interesting for new visitors.

, Many churches have different procedures and steps involved in joining the church, and you shouldn't assume that all visitors will know how to sign up, or whether or not they even should ask for information. Make it available to guests, but don't make it mandatory and don't force it.


Ask visitors if they're interested in information by asking questions and finding out what they're looking for. If someone's visiting because they're in town staying with relatives and live out of state, there's not much point in forcing materials on them. Make them feel welcomed, but don't worry about selling them on the church.
This can be a tricky step in welcoming visitors, because you don't want to assume every visitor is interested, but the easiest way to engage is usually to get visitors to sign the guest book so you can have their contact information to follow up later.

, Everyone is different, and some guests might just want to enjoy the sermon and be left alone. If they have an enjoyable experience, they'll come back and you can get to know them a bit more later. Don't assume that standoffish or silent guests are displeased or uncomfortable, they may just be looking to sneak in for a quiet service. Recognize visitors who may tend toward this and back off. Make contact and introduce yourself, so they'll have a name in case they want to ask questions and learn more., Greeters should practice their active listening skills and engage in real, genuine interactions with first-time visitors. Open yourselves up to the new people and help them to feel welcome by showing an interest in where they come from, what they're looking for, and who they are. Learn visitors' names and remember them.

, Perhaps the most effective way to make a new visitor feel welcomed is to help them form bonds with regular members. One of the main reasons why people feel intimidated at a new church is because they don't know anyone. That fear quickly disappears when they've made new relationships with others, so do your best to help that process along.


New visitors to a church should always meet the pastor before they leave, if they're interested. Make an introduction after the sermon. If the visitors aren't interested, don't force it.

, After introducing yourself, invite the new visitors to sit with you and your family, so they'll feel welcome, as if they've already made a friend at the church. Looking at a crowded church auditorium for the first time can be intimidating for new visitors, but if you give them one less thing to stress about, the experience will be much better for guests.

, Many larger churches will have childcare services in place during the service, so it's a good idea to make this available to first-time visitors and help facilitate the process if they're interested and have children. It can be an embarrassing thing to ask, and some visitors may not even be aware of the service.


If visitors are uncomfortable leaving their children in a nursery at a church they've never visited before, that's not unreasonable. Even if it's uncommon, try to accommodate new guests as much as possible.

, Sunday morning Bible study classes and weekly church get togethers are great events to which you should invite new visitors. You can also invite them to upcoming one-time events, such as a weekend picnic or a holiday pageant. Make them feel welcome and informed.


Invite visitors out for a meal, or other after-church gathering. If after-church potlucks or other get-togethers are common at your church, make visitors feel welcome by inviting them and including them in the festivities, as if they were a member. Even informal get-togethers at the buffet down the road can give guests a feel for the congregation and a sense of welcome. It may be just what they're looking for.

, Send a follow-up note to visitors if you collect their contact information from the guest book. You don't need to automatically sign them up for weekly church newsletters and bulletins, but sending a short note expressing how much you enjoyed meeting the visitors would be a wonderful way of inviting them back to the church.

, Even if you find out that visitors are looking for a new church and are considering joining, don't jump the gun by thrusting a bunch of paperwork in their face five minutes after they hung up a coat. Focus on making the experience pleasant and stress-free for the visitors and let them make the decision to become a member or not. Make yourself available for questions and help, but it should be their decision.

, Making a big deal out of new visitors is generally discouraged. No one wants to be made to feel like some kind of zoo animal their first time in church with a bunch of strangers. Don't make it worse by seating them right in the front row for everyone to gawk., Forcing visitors to get up in front of a room full of strangers and talk about themselves is a good way to send them running. Try not to make any visitors stand up and talk for any length of time, even if you're intending to make them feel welcome. If you feel the need to acknowledge it, say something general like, ""It's good to see new faces today!"" But don't draw too much attention to people and make them feel uncomfortable.At the same time, some visitors may be very talkative and have things to share. Encourage them to do so enthusiastically, if they show an interest. Prayer requests and other opportunities to contribute should be available to visitors.

, Some churches will have ushers walk around during the service to take attendance and to note any visitors that may have been missed, as a way of targeting them later, after the service. Try not to make visitors feel like impostors that are having their ID checked by the cops. If visitors just want to sneak in and leave afterward, they should be free to do so.

, Hard to believe, but some churches organize semi-complciated welcoming rituals, involving a welcome song when new visitors attend. Talk about awkward. Avoid this practice.

Come to church prepared for the service.,
Keep reasonably still and quiet.,
Dress comfortably.,
Sit in an inconspicuous location.,
Listen quietly and pay attention to the service.,
Keep your hands to yourself.,
Find or bring a piece of paper to doodle or scribble on to keep yourself busy if you are unable to tolerate the desired behavior.,
Participate as part of the group when the leader of the service asks the congregation to rise for prayer, singing, or other activities.,
Look for alternatives if you just can't manage to behave for the service.",How to Behave in Church (For Kids)," This means, at least for kids old enough to understand, to use the restroom, have a drink of water, and if appropriate, to eat a meal before entering the sanctuary, or not to chew gum during the service. Hungry or thirsty kids may have a hard time enduring the hour or longer service, and going to the bathroom can be a disruption for several people as you make your way between the pews or seats and down the aisles.;
, For most church-goers, the service is a solemn event, and unwanted noise or movements can distract.

, If it is cold outdoors, wear a jacket that can be removed before you are seated so you are not hot and sweaty while you listen to the liturgy or message. For hot weather, especially with no air conditioning, avoid wearing formal attire like a suit jacket and tie unless it is required by your religious faith or beliefs.

, Sitting toward the back or at least near an aisle will decrease the distraction for others if behavior does become a problem.

, If a you are interested in the events going on, you will be less noises.

, Don't tug at persons sitting near you, or bother their belongings if they are within reach.

, You may need to bring a pen or pencil, as well, if there are none available. Never draw or write in the church's publications if they are found in the seats.

, Sing with the adults, if it is appropriate, but don't sing in too loud of voice if you are not familiar with the song, or you simply cannot carry a tune.

, Some churches have children's classes or groups to keep the kids busy while adults worship.

Tell the truth.,
Be on time.,
Work on self-discipline.,
List your values.,
Live for a greater purpose.,
Challenge yourself.,
Be dependable.,
Don't keep enemies.,
Constantly learn.,
Give grace to others.",How to Grow in Character as a Christian," There is no bigger turn-off in any relationship than dishonesty. If you're afraid that being honest will backfire, then don't even get yourself into situations where honesty could be painful. If you make it a point of having no reason to lie, honesty comes naturally.;
, If you say you'll be there at 4:00, be there. If you arrive too early -- or worse, too late! -- it can make the situation very uncomfortable. It's always good to write down appointments, meetings, and get-togethers on a calendar or planner.

, If there is something you need to get done, don't procrastinate. Do it, and do a good job of it. If you keep putting off reading your Bible or calling the dentist to schedule an appointment, don't wait any longer. When you have self-discipline and know you can get things done, it becomes natural. The more you do something (like reading your Bible) the easier it will become and you'll likely come to enjoy it!

, Evaluating your life (honestly!) is a good way to see who you really are. What are your strong points? What do you need to work on? How can you do this better? Asking good questions of yourself can get you thinking.

, Find something you really believe in. Get involved at an animal shelter or food bank. Pray to God daily. Set an example for those around you.

, Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""We are always getting ready to live but never living."" You aren't really living if you don't try new things, set goals, and challenge yourself.

, When you say you'll do something, do it. Be there when someone needs help or is going through a rough time, and you can expect the same from other people.

, Paul, who wrote many of the Bible's books, said, ""Don't let the sun go down while you are still angry."" If you went to far or are in the wrong, apologize sincerely. Don't hold grudges. Forgive. You don't have to entirely trust that person anymore, but forgiveness is necessary or both of you will suffer.

, When a dog learns a new trick, it connects pathways in the brain so he is able to learn harder tricks in a smaller amount of time. In the same way, the more you learn, the more you can learn.

, Don't get mad at every small thing. Chose your arguments wisely. Exercise compassion and mercy.

, If you are busy, you should probably attend the earlier Mass, so you can get back home sooner. If you like to sleep in, you should attend the later Mass. Either way, it's up to you.

, If you are new to the faith, ask someone about the Mass, they will be happy to help you!

, Participating in the Mass will help you grow in the Catholic faith, and will not make you look disrespectful. Everyone else is (and should be) participating, too!

Address the Pope as ""Your Holiness."",
Maintain a respectful tone.,
Conclude the letter politely.,
Know the Vatican mailing address.,
Know the email address and fax number for the Vatican Press Office.",How to Address the Pope1," Another acceptable way to address the Pope in writing would be ""Most Holy Father.""


Note, however, that on the envelope, you should address the Pope as “His Holiness, ________” with the Pope's name in the blank. For instance, if writing to Pope Francis, the envelope would read, “His Holiness, Pope Francis.”;
, Throughout the body of the letter, your tone should be polite and gracious. You do not need to write in flowery language, but your language should be on par with how you would speak or be expected to speak inside a Catholic church.


Avoid swearing, slang, derogatory language, or any other forms of impolite speech.
Write out everything you need or want to say, but keep in mind that the Pope is a busy man. Instead of dragging on and spending extensive space on flattery, it would be better for all parties concerned if you kept the formalities basic and went directly into the purpose of your letter.

, As a Roman Catholic, you should conclude the letter with a sentence along the lines of, ""I have the honor to profess myself with the most profound respect. Your Holiness' most obedient and humble servant,"" before signing your name.If you are not a Catholic, you can change the closing to something along the lines of, ""With every good wish to Your Holiness, I am, Sincerely Yours,"" followed by your signature.
Something as simple as ""With every best wish. Sincerely yours,"" with a signature after it would also work for a non-Catholic writing to the Pope.
Regardless of the exact wording you choose, the level of respect you demonstrate should correspond to the minimum level of respect you should have for someone in the Pope's position, at the very least. Someone who does not follow Catholic teaching or who disagrees with the Pope should still recognize his position of authority and close in a respectful manner. Anyone who does follow Catholic teaching should demonstrate the respect expected from one addressing the leader of his or her faith on Earth.

, If you plan to send your letter by traditional mail, you should write the address on the envelop as: His Holiness, Pope Francis / Apostolic Palace / 00120 Vatican City.


Note that you should separate the address onto separate lines according to the placements of the slashes, /.
Other ways to write the same address include:

His Holiness, Pope Francis PP. / 00120 Via del Pellegrino / Citta del Vaticano
His Holiness Pope Francis / Apostolic Palace / Vatican City
His Holiness Pope Francis / Vatican City State, 00120


Do not write ""Italy"" on the envelop as the country. The Vatican is considered its own independent nation, completely separate from Italy.

, If you would rather send the letter by e-mail or fax, you must go through the Vatican Press Office. The Pope does not have a personal, public e-mail address or fax number.


The e-mail address is: av@pccs.vaThe fax number is: +390669885373
Note that neither form of contact goes directly to the Pope, but correspondence you have for the Pope will get to him eventually when sent through either of these means.

Find local churches in your area.,
Do a little research beforehand to find out what to expect.,

Dress up, a little.,
Go with other people.,

Pay attention and follow the lead of others.,

Don't be afraid to ask questions.,
Consider going to study services or other classes.,
Volunteer your time.,
Consider going on missions or regional trips.",How to Go to Church," You can go about selecting a church in a number of different ways, depending on your history with religion and what's available in your area, but it's important to find a church that's close and convenient so you can feel like part of the community. Most people have some sense of their beliefs, but many people are also interested in exploring what's available locally. You shouldn't have to travel far to go to church.


Start local. If you're an Episcopalian, find out what Episcopal churches there are in your community and attend all of them to pick which one fits you best.
If you weren't raised with any belief system and want to explore your options, find out the variety of different churches and religions practiced in your town and make a few visits. Do some reading about them to find out if they line up with your personal beliefs, then explore them at a service as a visitor.;
, If you live around the corner from an Apostolic church, it may be convenient to attend, but it may also be very different from what you're used to at other Christian churches. On the other hand, it may fit in perfectly with your personal beliefs and needs for a religious practice. Do some reading on the beliefs and practices of the religions before you attend to help you narrow your search for a church community.


You don't need to be an expert about religion to go to church. Most church-goers are excited and friendly, happy to welcome new potential members and visitors to their service. Church is supposed to be a learning experience, so don't let your ignorance of a particular religion keep you from attending. Keep an open mind and open heart.

, In larger towns and increasingly in rural communities, mega-churches with large memberships and parking structures are increasingly common. While these appeal to lots of believers because they are easy to attend, it can also be somewhat difficult to get to know anyone at your church if you're attending a service in a sports arena. Try out smaller churches to see what works.


Give both a shot. If you're a member of a small community church with a broken-down organ, you might try exploring a larger church with bigger production values to see if it helps you engage more. Alternatively, you might be able to get in touch more profoundly at a simple, humble, country church.

, Even if you're fairly settled on your religious preferences and your desires for a church community, try exploring your options as a learning experience. There might be something better out there for you, something that feels right and comforts.


If you know definitively that you’re a Christian, or a Muslim, or a Sufi, it’s still important to explore the different churches within that religion in your area to find one that feels comfortable. Fellowship is just as important a part of worshiping at a church as the tenants of the religion itself.

, ""Going to church"" comes with many connotations for different people. Try to forget about the judgmental old ladies you remember from your youth, or the intimidating incantations from the strangely-dressed man at the front of the room. If you've never been to church, try to check what you may have heard at the door. Go in with an open mind and a curious attitude.


If you used to attend church and haven't attended recently, all the more reason to explore the options available to you and see what else is out there. Try to leave your preconceptions at the door.

, It's generally customary to wear nice clothes when attending churches of all kinds. Some religions have more lenient dress codes, while others are quite formal. If you're curious about the dress code at a particular church, call ahead and ask, or play it safe and wear something nice.


Many churches have no requirement for clothes, but it’s usually still a good idea to put on nice, clean clothes when you’re attending church for the first time. A three-piece suit or a formal gown isn’t necessary, but at least avoid flip-flops and cargo shorts.

, It can be intimidating to go alone, so bring support with you if you'd rather go with others. Make it easy on yourself and ask some friends that are experienced churchgoers to help guide you through the process, or go along with other friends or family members who've never attended before either. Make it a group experience and discuss it afterward., Generally, the members of most churches will be excited to welcome you and will want to talk to you. You don't have to make best friends on your first day, but it's usually a good idea to try to meet a few members, giving yourself an opportunity to ask questions, find out more about the church, and get some sense of the community there. If you want to know something, just ask.If you're going alone, try to find someone to sit with, or chat up your neighbor. At many churches, there's even a brief period of greeting your neighbor built into the service, where everyone should shake hands or embrace their neighbors.

, Different church services will work in different ways. There may be singing, call and response, group prayer, or kneeling. The service may be quite loud and joyful or quite solemn. It's hard to know what you'll get before you attend, but try not to worry too much about doing everything perfectly. Others will help guide you through the process.


Don't do anything that makes you uncomfortable, or that you feel you're not ready for. At some Christian churches, for example, taking communion is a common part of some services, but shouldn't be taken by unbaptized Christians, or visitors. It's perfectly fine to attend these churches, however, and not take part in communion.

, Are you made to feel comforted at this church? Do you feel welcome? Does this seem like the kind of place you'd want to return to worship? If so, you might consider joining the church. If not, don't be discouraged. This doesn't mean that religion isn't right for you, it just means that this church might not be right for you. Continue your search.


Listen closely to the sermon given, or the message in the service. Does it fit in with your own personal conceptions of this religion? Does it challenge your notion of the big questions, or does it validate it? Depending on what you're looking for in a church, you might have a variety of different responses.Don't be afraid to give weight to the little things. Does the dress code fit in with your own personal style? Do the people seem friendly and nice, like the kind of people you want to know? Is the coffee good? Perfectly valid questions when considering churches.

, If you've found a church that you really enjoy attending, go a few times as a visitor, and then consider joining the church. Depending on the religion and the church itself, there may be any number of different tasks required of you, including formally converting religions, but the process will vary from church to church.


Usually, you'll want to get in touch with the pastor, minister, or preacher at the church you're attending and express your interest in joining. You'll likely be asked some questions and given a path toward joining.

, If anything about the experience of going to church confuses or frustrates you, make time to speak about your concerns and ask those questions in private with a member of the staff. Church is social, but it's not just a club for fun. You're likely going in search of answers to big questions you have about the nature of life and existence, so don't be afraid to ask those questions.

, Many churches have separate classes or small-group activities that you should feel free to attend as much as you want. Sometimes, these will meet immediately before or immediately following the service itself, but at some churches these meetings will occur at different points throughout the week. If you're curious about the options, speak with the staff and find out what's available.


If you're not interesting in in-depth study of religious texts, feel no pressure to attend. Attend the services you want and avoid the ones you don't.

, Churches run on the volunteer work of people like you. Passing out pamphlets, collecting donations, running the youth groups: these are all tasks that require volunteers. Even helping people park cars and greeting people at the door requires volunteers. If you feel up to it, after joining a church, consider volunteering for some responsibilities. Give back.


At some churches, it's common to donate some money to the church each month, usually a certain percentage of your paycheck. It's not about amount, it's about giving a little portion of what you have to the church to keep it running smoothly and providing the service that you appreciate.

, Many churches make a priority of taking their message and their practice on the road, organizing mission trips or visits to regional conferences, where many congregations of believers will gather in a certain spot. If you attend a very small church, this can be an excellent way of meeting like-minded believers from far-off places, where you'd be unlikely to meet them otherwise.


If you have a great experience at your church, it's also sometimes a good idea to invite others you think might benefit from visiting your church. Spread the word.

Fold in the right side.,
Bring in the left side.,
Fold up the bottom.,
Bring down the top.,
Press the creases.",How to Fold Altar Linens1," The purificator is the smallest of the small linens, and the post Communion veil is the largest of the small linens. Both can be either square or rectangular, and both have an embroidered cross in the center.The purificator is the linen used to dry the holy vessels during Holy Communion.
The post Communion veil is used to cover the chalice after Holy Communion has concluded.;
, Lay either linen flat with the cross upright but facing down.Smooth out any wrinkles with your hands.

, Fold the right side in toward the left.


The right-most third of the material should be folded over the center third, leaving only the left-most third visible.

, Fold the left side in toward the right.


The edge of this left-most third should meet the bend of your first fold. The bend of this fold should meet the edge of the original right side of the linen.
Crease both folds with your fingers to lightly crease them before continuing.

, Fold the bottom third of the linen up so that it covers the center third of the cloth.

, Fold down the remaining top third of the linen so that it completely covers the material from your previous fold.


If done correctly, the purificator and/or post Communion veil should be folded into nine even square sections.

, Use your fingers to press all the folded edges into firm creases.


Flip the linen over so that the embroidered cross is now on top.
Press the creases with an iron before putting the linen into long-term storage.
This step completes the process. The purificator or post Communion veil should be ready to store.

Refer to the Pope as ""Holy Father.” Other appropriate ways to address the Pope in person include ""Your Holiness"" and ""Most Holy Father.,
Stand and applaud as the Pope enters.,
Genuflect as the Pope approaches.,
Kiss his ring, when appropriate.,
Speak respectfully, clearly, and concisely.,
Stand up as the Pope leaves.",How to Address the Pope2,"""“His Holiness” and “Holy Father” both address the Pope by his title and position in the Church. You should address the Pope only by these titles rather than by his name when speaking to him face-to-face.

, The amount of applause will vary depending on the venue, but you should always stand in respect once the Pope walks into the room you are in.Usually, if the venue is a small room with a small to mid-size crowd, the applause is quiet and polite.
For large venues, however, like a stadium Mass, loud applause and even cheers are appropriate.

, If the Pope approaches you directly, you should kneel with your right knee bent to the floor.


You do not need to make the Sign of the Cross, as you would do while genuflecting to the Eucharist, but you should still bend at the knee. Genuflection is a sign of high respect.

, If you are Catholic and if the Pope offers you his hand, that would be an appropriate time to plant a quick yet respectful kiss on the Piscatory ring, also known as the Ring of the Fisherman, traditionally worn by the Pope.


On the other hand, if the Pope offers you his hand and you are not Catholic, you are not obligated to kiss the ring. You could simply shake his hand, instead.
The Ring of the Fisherman is a symbol and mark of the office. By kissing it, you show both respect and sincere affection for the man who holds that office.

, Plan what to say beforehand so that you do not stumble too much over your words, and maintain a tone that is both clear and respectful the entire time.


Start by introducing yourself. Give your name and say something important or fitting about yourself.
If you came to the Vatican for a specific purpose or desired an audience with the Pope for a specific purpose, you should also state that.
The Pope will guide the conversation, and you should let him do so. Keep your answers direct and brief, and speak in a clear, loud voice so that the Pope can hear you.

, As soon as the Pope stands to leave, you should stand, as well. Wait until he leaves the room before you sit down again or pay attention to anything else.


Applause is not usually necessary at the end of the audience or event, but if you are in a large crowd and the crowd begins to applaud, it is appropriate to join in if you so desire.

Get everything you need ready the night before.,

,
Get dressed!

,
Do your hair.,
Last but not least put on your make up if you want to wear some.,
Grab your coat and make one last stop in the restroom.",How to Get Ready for Church (Girls)," Lay out your clothes, shoes, a bible, and any other items you require to go to church. Nice clothes include a short ( but not overly short) skirt and a shirt, or leggings and a nice shirt.


Make sure your clothing is appropriate for church and the season, e.g. don't wear a strappy dress in the middle of winter or you could get chilly and don't forget your head scarf or hat if your religion requires you keep your head cover ed in church.;
, For example if the service starts at 10:30am there's no need to get up till 8:00am. If it is an evening service you are attending, when you get it isn't so important.

, Don't go to church on an empty stomach. It could be a bit embarrassing if your tummy rumbles whilst the congregation is quietly praying! Some good breakfast ideas include egg on toast, muesli or a bowl of frosties.

, If you took a shower the night before, you can skip this step or take another as you wish. Many religions see cleanliness as virtuous.

, Remember to use a mouthwash.

,,, Remember to keep it simple. Do something like a ponytail or put it in a clip, or even leave it down. if you want to leave it down you may want to straighten it or go over your hair with a curling iron and put a few waves in it.

, Depending on your age, you may like to wear a little makeup, a lot, or none. There's no right or wrong amount of make-up for any age group, or occasion. If you feel comfortable, your makeup or lack of it, is fine. Since most Church services are in the morning, only daytime makeup is needed. Tinted lip gloss (or a light lipstick,) a quick swipe of mascara, some light eye shadow,and a bit of blush are all that is needed. If it is an evening service, a slightly darker lip and eye color can be used -- however, bear in mind that is still Church, and not a dance or a club, so, don't get too dramatic with the makeup, or you will come across as a fake! In my opinion, the lesser the better

, Also keep a small bag handy with your cell phone and other essentials (money, chapstick) in case you need something on your way.

Examine the linen.,
Place the corporal right-side up.,
Fold up the bottom third.,
Fold down the top third.,
Bring the right third in.,
Bring the left third in.,
Crease the folds.",How to Fold Altar Linens2," Corporals are square linens that are a little smaller than the post Communion veil. The cloth should have a decorative embroidered cross along the center bottom.


The corporal is a linen that is spread over the top of the middle of the altar. It reaches to the front edge but does not hang over that edge., Lay the linen out flat, smoothing out any wrinkles with your hands. The cross should face up.


Unlike most other small altar cloths, the corporal is folded inside-out. This is done so that any crumbs from the Eucharist will be caught inside the material instead of falling to the ground. These crumbs can later be shaken off into the piscina (the basin where the Communion vessels are washed).
Folding the corporal inside-out also makes it easier for the priest or deacon to spread it out over the altar.

, Take the bottom-most third of the corporal and fold it up.


This bottom portion should cover a third of the material along the horizontal center of the linen. Only the top third should still be free.

, Bring the top-most third of the linen down, using it to fully cover the bottom and middle thirds previously folded together.


Take a moment to press both folds with your fingers, lightly creasing them. Doing so will help keep the linen smoother for the next set of folds.

, Fold the right-most third of the corporal in toward the left.


The right third should cover the center third of the linen.

, Fold in the remaining left third of the linen, covering both the right and vertical center thirds previously folded together.


If done correctly, the corporal should be folded into nine equal square sections. The cross should be tucked away somewhere inside.

, Drag your finger along each fold of the material to firmly crease them before storing the corporal.


If you intend to keep the linen in long-term storage, consider pressing the creases with an iron.
This step completes the process.

"
"
Look closely at the linen.,
Place the towel right-side down.,
Fold in the right third.,
Bring in the left third.,
Fold the rest in half.,
Crease the folds.",How to Fold Altar Linens3," These towels are almost always rectangular and usually measure around 6 inches by 9 inches (15 cm by 23 cm). An embroidered cross or shell usually decorates the center bottom.


The priest uses the lavabo towel to dry his hands when he has washed them before the Consecration of the Eucharist.
A baptismal towel is used to dry an infant or other individual after being baptized with Holy water.

, Spread out the towel so that the cross or shell faces down.


Use your hands to smooth out any wrinkles or bunches.
The long side of the towel should run vertically and the shorter side should run horizontally.

, Take the right-most third of the towel and fold it in toward the left.


The right third should completely cover a third of the towel at the center. There should be another even third open at the left.

, Fold the left-most third of the towel in toward the right.


This panel should completely cover the right and center thirds that were folded together previously.

, Fold the top of the towel down over the bottom.


When finished, the towel should be folded into six evenly sized rectangles.

, Use your fingers to crease each fold you made. Turn the towel over so that the decorative cross or shell is now on top.


This step should complete the process.

"
"
Lay the linen flat.,
Roll it into a cardboard roller.,
Wrap the roll.",How to Fold Altar Linens4," Spread the cloth out so that lies right-side up in front of you.


Use your hands to smooth out as many wrinkles as possible. If you allow any of the wrinkles or folds to remain, you could end up creating a large crease where one should not be.
Large linens are rolled, not folded. You will roll the linen up so that it faces inside-out when viewed on the roll.

, Place an appropriately sized cardboard roller on one end of the linen. Roll the linen around the cardboard, and continue on until all of the material is on the roll.


You will need to hold the cloth with a bit of tension as you roll it up. Otherwise, wrinkles are more likely to form.
Keep the hems straight and square with each other so that the linen rolls up evenly.

, Protect the linen by wrapping the roll with tissue paper.


It is also recommended that you label the tissue paper with ""Fair Linen,"" ""Credence,"" or another appropriate name. Doing so will make it easier to identify the linen later.
After completing this step, you can place the linen in storage.

"
"
Dress in a modest and mature way.,
Arrive at church five to ten minutes early, bless yourself, and genuflect before sitting quietly in a pew.,
Shake hands with those around you during the greeting.,
Pay attention and participate during the service.,
Don't block people coming in and out of the pew.",How to Act Respectfully in Church," This applies to your clothes, shoes, hair, and (for girls) makeup. Although self-expression is healthy, there is a time and place to wear outlandish clothes. For example, it goes without saying that you are washed and clean - if you have greasy hair or body odor, take a shower. Be mindful of those around you and avoid excessive perfume, cologne, or other aerosol products. Do you think He has more power or right than the President? Would you dress up to meet the President? In that case, dress nicely when you go to church to meet Him as well.


Women, make sure that nothing is revealing. If you are afraid to genuflect because 'something might show', then it is not appropriate. Don't wear shoes that you cannot walk in, don't have a crazy hairdo, too much perfume, or overdone makeup.
Men, please don't wear your belt around your knees, keep cologne to a minimum, and stay away from your ragged yet beloved sneakers.Shave, and keep your hair neat.;
, It is very important to stay quiet. Make sure that you arrive early: Latecomers disrupt the service and interrupt others' thoughts and/or prayers. During the quiet time before mass, volunteers might recite the Rosary, or it might just be some private prayer time. Either way, be sure to stay quiet.

, Unless it is cold/flu season or you have microphobia , please shake hands and greet those around you warmly when appropriate - most places of worship have a time dedicated to this at the beginning of mass.

, Once again, this is a sign of respect both to others and to Him. Although it might get boring, keep your thoughts on God. At the very least, act interested and don't distract others. Be mature if the sermon has to do with sexual activity or another uncomfortable topic. If customary and you feel comfortable, sing during the songs to connect in a special way to Jesus and the congregation.

, This is common knowledge, but people often unintentionally stand on both sides of the pews, blocking entrance and creating some awkward moments. Be mindful of where you sit.

,, This is a Sunday School class that will help a great deal in preparing you for temple attendance. There, you will learn the history of temples all the way back to Adam, the purpose of the temple, and what we do there.

, From classics like Boyd K. Packer's ""The Holy Temple"" to modern works by men and women in the church, reading will help you prepare intellectually and spiritually for the experience.

, This recommend will only allow you to perform proxy roles in baptisms and confirmations for the dead. There are other requirements that must be met in order to receive a full Temple Recommend. Your Bishop can help you make sure your ordinations are in order.


Men should be ordained to the priesthood before planning to attend. When ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood, they can participate as a proxy for Baptisms and confirmations for the Dead. They will need to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood before receiving Their endowment.
It has been recommended by the Church for young women to receive their endowment only when they plan to be married in the Temple or before they go on a Mission. If you are an older woman, you usually must wait a year after being baptized in order to be endowed.

, Ask Heavenly Father to guide your steps and open your heart to the experiences you will have and the words you will hear.

Study your religion.,
Be honest with yourself.,
Be honest with your parents and leaders: If you discover that there’s something about the church that you don’t believe or that really bothers you, let your parents and bishop/branch president know.,
Be honest with friends: If you’ve been honest with yourself, then you should know what you really do believe, and a good friend will respect your beliefs.,
Realize that everyone has beliefs.,
Girls and Modesty: this is hard.,
Be patient with your leaders.,
Be positive.",How to Be a Mormon Teen," It’s hard to emphasize this too much. If you follow your religion just because someone else expect you to, you will always feel conflicted when you are around peers who disagree. Study the scriptures. Ask for help to understand gospel principles. Pay attention during church meetings and seminary. Learn what “being Mormon” is really about. If you don’t start building your own foundation, being a teen will be very rough. Make sure you have your own testimony and that yours is not just based on a parent's testimony. You need to know for yourself if the church is true. If you don't, then work on building up your own testimony through prayer and the study of the scriptures.;
, As you study the gospel, ask yourself if you really believe what you learn. It’s okay not to. If you, personally, really do believe in something, remember that thing. That belief is part of who you are, and you will want to protect it. If you don’t believe something, it’s best to realize that as you reflect in your room, not as you follow your friends on a Friday night. Remember that one of our core beliefs is personal revelation. You can learn anything you really want to know if you put in sincere time and work.

, Most of them have things they struggle with as well (though they might not admit it to everyone), and they would welcome the opportunity to support you if that is what you want. Find someone you trust to confide in. Older siblings can sometimes be a big help.

, You don’t need to broadcast your beliefs, but hiding them will make your life painful. Be quietly confident—you know yourself; you have nothing to prove. If your friends have a problem with the real you, find out early. It can be simple. If you’re invited to a drinking party, you can say “I don’t drink, and it’s not fun for me to be around a bunch of people who are drinking.” If your friends want to know more, be open and tell them whatever they want to know. If they reject you, then you have really insecure friends (secure people are okay with others not being like them). If the language in your group of friends is really bad, say “I think we swear too much.” (You can say “we” even if you don’t swear.) Many people don’t even hear themselves swear, and they’d be glad to know that it makes you uncomfortable.

, Your friends and peers have beliefs just like you do. They aren’t YOUR beliefs, but they are still genuine beliefs. Believing that premarital sex is okay is still a belief; it just isn’t a religious belief. Here’s the point: You hopefully respect the beliefs that your friends have. Expect your friends to do the same. If they give you a hard time, point out that you don’t give them a hard time. This also applies to friends who are members of the church. Final note: DON’T give your friends a hard time for their beliefs. If your friend thinks it’s okay to smoke, you can say you think it’s a really bad idea, but let them know that you will still be their friend.

, It might take a lot of work for you to find clothes that fit your style and cover you. Do your best. If you see someone with an outfit you like, ask them where they got it. Shop around. A lot of the stores that sport modest clothing are quite frumpy, but there are exceptions. Don’t give other girls in the church a hard time for how they look, please. If they look great, wonderful. If they lack style, why should you care? Be a friend. If a girl dresses immodestly, be her friend too.

, Sunday school might be boring. Your parents’ advice might be really out of touch. You might struggle to relate to your bishop. These are normal things. Adults aren’t geniuses, but they are trying to help. Work with them. If they do something that actually is helpful, let them know. Get to know different adults in your ward as much as you can because different people are good at different things. One person might have really good dating advice while another person can help you cope with depression or bullying. Your bishop or Young Men’s/Young Women’s leader might not know how to help, but they might know somebody who can help.

, Think long term.

Dress modestly.,
Be reverent.,
Sing along.,
Know what to expect during the sacrament portion.,
Follow along.,
Be polite.",How to Attend a Mormon Service if You're Not Mormon," Make it a habit to dress in line with LDS dress codes. Women should wear a skirt or dress that is no shorter than two inches above the knee, as well as a top that covers the midriff and shoulders and is not low-cut. Men should wear slacks, a button-up dress shirt and dress shoes; ties and suit jackets are optional, but appropriate.;
, Mormons encourage highly respectful behavior during sacrament meeting. This includes keeping fidgeting and talking at a minimum, as well as folding your arms and bowing your head for prayers.


Be aware that there is no applauding in sacrament meeting, even after a musical performance.

, If you attend a full LDS church service, you'll have several opportunities to sing hymns. Green hymn books are available at intervals in all the pews of the chapel. Follow along if you can. If you're not a confident singer, however, it's OK to simply keep the hymn book open and read along.

, During the sacrament meeting, trays of bread and water will be passed around the chapel. Protocol is that you should hold the tray for the person next to you as he or she partakes of the sacrament, then pass it on.


Don't feel pressured to take the sacrament. Taking sacrament each week is a way for LDS members to renew their covenants (promises) with God when they were baptized. If you haven't been baptized, it is not recommended for you to consume anything from the sacrament. However, no one will reproach you if you choose to take it anyway.

, During sacrament meeting, as well as Sunday school, speakers may quote extensive scriptural passages. You can ask for a set to reference, or share with the person next to you.

, This might seem obvious, but it's important. Speak gently, and try not to swear. Don't bring outside food or drink into the chapel, and avoid pulling out your phone during the service (unless you are using them to read related scriptures or manuals). You may find that members of the ward are eager to introduce themselves to you. Respond with courtesy and offer a firm handshake.

Know what worship actually is.,
Reverence to holy persons play an important role in ALL religions.,
When Protestants call Mary a sinner, point out to them that she is called ""full of grace"" by the angel in Luke chapter 1.,
When they argue against Mary's assumption into Heaven, remind them that both the prophets Elijah and Enoch were both assumed into Heaven too.,
When Protestants claim that the various appearances of Mary in various parts of the world (eg: Lourdes, Fatima, etc) are really tricks of the Devil, remind them that both Elijah and Moses appeared at the Transfiguration.,
Protestants quote Jeremiah chapter 7, verse 13, when he decries the children of Israel worshipping the moon as ""the Queen of Heaven,"" and claim that when we call Mary ""the Queen of Heaven,"" it is the same thing.,
Protestants will quote St. Luke chapter 11, where Christ tells a woman ""Blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it,"" after she cries out ""blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that you nursed."",
Protestants think that Mary and St. Joseph had other children besides Our Lord.,
Devotion to Mary and the saints go back to the earliest times of the Christian Church's history.",How to Defend Devotion to the Virgin Mary," Very few people do, which is why Protestants accuse Catholics and Orthodox of breaking the First Commandment, with our veneration for Mary. Had they all know the difference between actual worship and veneration, they too, would still be honouring our Blessed Mother today. The act of worship is to give sacrifices or offerings. When a Protestant is debating with you, ask him/her to tell what worship is. Then tell them it is the act of giving offerings, etc. The sacrifice of the Mass is offered to God alone. Not Mary nor any other saint. Even if a church is named in honour of Mary or any other saint, the Mass is offered to God only.;
, Note how Muhammad is honoured and revered in Islam, and yet, Muslims do not worship him. The same with Abraham and/or Moses in Judaism, and Guru Nanak and all the subsequent gurus in Sikhism. Point this out to our Protestant brethren.

, That means she had no sin!!! They will cite the following biblical arguments to prove their point: Romans chapter 3, as well as when Mary calls God her saviour in Luke chapter 1, and even when she partook in a purification ceremony in Luke chapter 2. For Romans, explain to our Protestant friends that St. Paul was trying to teach his readers not to pass judgement on others. Mary called God her saviour, because He saved her from falling into sin. Also, challenge our Protestant friends: Since they claim that Mary was a sinner, ask them what was ""this sin"" that she committed. If they say ""that is between her and God,"" tell them that they are the ones making the accusation, and therefore should be able to state what her sin was.

, Why would such an honour given to these 2 Prophets be too good to give to Mary too?

, Tell them that if apparitions of Mary are really from the Devil, then so were Moses and Elijah at the Transfiguration. When they try to claim that is a different issue, reassert firmly, that if appearances of Mary are really the Devil in disguise, then so were the appearances of Elijah and Moses at the Transfiguration.

, Tell them no it is not. They were worshipping (**OFFERING SACRIFICES**) to the moon. Moreover, elsewhere in the Old Testament, in the Psalms, there is a verse which says ""the queen sits at your right hand, arrayed in gold (psalm 45). Give them this quote, every time they quote Jeremiah chapter 7.

, They think that Christ rejected veneration for his mother. In reality, Christ blessed his mother, and not this woman. What this woman cried out would be the equivalent of someone saying today, ""wow!!! Your mother should really be proud!!!"" Tell them that St. Luke chapter 11, endorses devotion to Mary. Not decries it.

, They quote all the times our Lord's ""brothers,"" are mentioned. Tell them that the word for brother and the word for first generation cousin were the same in ancient Greek, and point out to them that James ""the brother of our Lord,"" is called ""the son of Alpheus,"" in the Gospels. Also, referring back to when Christ consecrated Mary as Mother of His church, He did so by giving her into the care of St. John. That meant that there were no other children in the holy family to care for Mary.

, Even the Protestant Reformers, such as Martin Luther venerated Mary. Rather, it has only been within the last few hundred years, that people have become afraid to honour Mary. Ask how can Christians have been so wrong, for well over a thousand years and onward?

Understand the importance of the Church of the Latter Day Saints.,
Keep in mind the retired practice of polygamy in the Mormon faith.,
Understand the differences between fundamentalist LDS believers and LDS believers.",How to Witness to a Mormon," Keep in mind Mormons are taught not to trust the accuracy of the Bible. They have been led to believe many truths have been removed from its pages, and other teachings have been altered or added. So take the time to show that the integrity of the Bible has been carefully preserved over the past centuries.Mormons use the King James Version of the Bible. So use another translation of the Bible and ask the Mormon to follow along in their version so they can note the similarities in the passages.;
, When discussing the Bible, avoid stating: “This is what the Bible says.” Instead, give the passage more weight by stating: “This is what God has testified about Himself.” Ask the Mormon to read the verse out loud and then ask: “What is God telling us about Himself in this verse?”Start the discussion with the book of Isaiah. Based on the credibility of the Dead Sea Scrolls, you can demonstrate that these passages are verified to be complete and unchanged. The Isaiah scroll is dated one hundred or more years BC and is essentially the same as the text we have in our Bibles today. So neither the Catholic Church nor the Jewish rabbis alternated the text. Isaiah is also quotes extensively in the Book of Mormon, so it's a good middle ground to begin the discussion.Focus on several verses that discuss the nature of God in ways that conflict with the Mormon doctrine. For example:Isa. 43:10, 11; 44:6, 8 – There is only one God
Neh. 9:5, 6; Ps. 90:2; Hab. 1:12 – God has existed eternally as God
Num. 23:19; Hos. 11:9; 1 Sam. 15:29 – God is not a man
Ps. 139:8-16 – God is Omnipresent

, Most Mormons don’t view themselves as being lost sinners in need to God’s forgiveness and grace. In fact, Mormons are taught to view themselves as gods in the making, and though they are aware of sin, they are expected to repent and forsake their sin, continually. They are driven by a quest to become perfect, even in the afterlife. But in the teachings of the Bible, man is hopelessly corrupt, steeped in sin and unable to deserve God’s grace and forgiveness. So the goal of attaining a sinless life is humanly impossible and can be very discouraging as you are almost doomed to fail.Help the Mormon to see and feel the weight of their repeated failure to live a perfect life and understand that human perfection is impossible for us in this life. This will show that Mormonism’s intent is to make its followers feel lost so they can then become saved.
Try to explain to the Mormon that he is headed for “outer darkness”, a term used by Mormons to describe hell, because he is not perfect and God requires perfection. Use Jesus’ words in Matthew 5:48: “Be ye therefore perfect, even as you Father which is in heaven is perfect.” This verse is also in the Book of Mormon, so the Mormon will be familiar with it. It is often used by Mormons to show Christians that works are necessary and faith alone is not enough to be worthy to live with the Heavenly Father someday.
Point out that “Be ye therefore perfect” is in the present tense and is not the same as becoming perfect. So, this indicates that it is not possible to become perfect before God. You can also use James 2:10 to show that according to the Bible, if you fail at any point in your life, you have broken the entire law. This is reminiscent of the Mormon scripture D&C 82:7, which states if you repent of a sin and commit it again later, all your previous sins will return. So, this indicates that most people are on the road to “outer darkness” because it cannot be escaped or denied.This also runs counter to the LDS teaching that the only beings that go to the “outer darkness” are Satan, his demons, and temple Mormons who once understood the Mormon gospel and then left the LDS Church.

, When Mormons seek to bring more believers to Mormonism, they will give people the Book of Mormon and ask them to read it and pray about it. Many Mormons will use a “testimony” or a spiritual experience that assured them the Book of Mormon is true and that Joseph Smith is the prophet of God. The Mormon may then ask you to pray about the Book of Mormon.You can respond to this by explaining why praying to determine if a book is true is not the way to determine truth. Use an example like praying to receive a testimony of the truthfulness of a New Age book to show how false this might be.
Unlike in Mormonism, Christians use the scriptures to derive a teaching and put the teaching into action. Christians don’t pray over the teaching to get a feeling of truthfulness.

, Rather than accuse or mock the LDS Church, simply bring up the issues surrounding the Church that have been well documented by the public, the media, and members who have left the Mormon Church.

, Devout Mormons believe that Moroni, an angel from ancient America, appeared to Joseph three times on the night of September 21, 1823. During these visits, Moroni revealed the story of the Book of Mormon and shared knowledge with Joseph that would help him locate and translate the messages on the gold plates.LDS faithful believe Joseph literally saw Moroni with his own eyes, heard him speak, and processed his revelations with an alert, conscious brain.
However, there have been concerns about the circumstances of Moroni’s visitation. On the night of Moroni’s appearances, Joseph lived with his siblings in his parent’s small house. He and his five brothers slept together in a tiny room that contained only two beds, so Joseph shared a bed with at least on brother. If the visitation by the brightly shining Moroni was the literal event as taught by the LDS Church, why did Joseph’s brothers not get woken up when Moroni appeared?

, Members of the LDS Church are taught that the Book of Mormon (BOM) is scripture and the true record of the inhabitants of the Americas from about 2200 BC to 420 AD. Although it’s main purpose is a religious text, it is interpreted as being an actual, historical record of the inhabitants of the ancient Americas.No archaeological, linguistic, DNA or other evidence of Hebrew culture in the Americas has ever been found to support the claims of the BOM. The BOM also contains numerous anachronisms like horse, elephants, wheat, barley, steel, silk, etc, that scientists agree did not exist in the Americas during BOM times.

, The LDS Church claims that the President of the Church speaks directly for God. But many prophecies made by the prophets of Mormonism did not occur or ended up being incorrect. For example:Joseph Smith prophesied that Christ would return in the 1800s if he lived to be 80, which did not occur. The Mormon Church also accepts many Biblical stories as true and real, rather than fables, such as Noah’s Ark, Adam and Eve, and the Tower of Babel, as well as people living to be 900 years old.
Many of the teachings of the prophet Brigham Young, often at the General Conference, are now denied by the LDS Church. So if prophecies can be false and the doctrines given by one prophet can be invalidated by another, how much authority do the LDS prophets have? How can a member of the LDS Church tell which prophecies are true and which are false?, Though the practice was officially banned by the church in 1890, it was practiced in earnest by the leading prophets of the Church, including Joseph Smith, who had 32 wives, and Brigham Young, who had 55 wives. Beyond being a belief of the Church, polygamy is considered immoral and illegal.According to the Church, the Book of Mormon teaches that monogamy is God’s standard for marriage unless He declares otherwise. The Lord sometimes authorizes plural marriage for the parents to have more children, such as with Abraham, Isaac, Moses, etc. So, the Lord revealed polygamy to Joseph Smith.
Polygamous marriages were conducted in secret by Joseph Smith as early as 1832. The church publicly lied many times about the polygamy of its members, and Joseph Smith eventually married 32 women, including seven girls under 18 years of age.
The church currently disavows any practice of polygamy, but the eternal doctrine of plural marriage is still in place. A man may be sealed to multiple, sequential wives, allowing him to have a polygamous family in the celestial kingdom.
The disturbing practice of polygamy still occurs in more fundamental Mormon groups and paints the early prophets of Mormonism in a very negative and troubling light.

, There is a growing number of personal accounts by people who left the Mormon Church and are trying to adapt to life as non-Mormons. It may be worthwhile to discuss these first person accounts with a Mormon to show how and why former Mormons decided to leave the LDS Church., Many Mormons who eventually leave the church do not embrace Christianity or other religions. In fact, many Mormons lose any faith in God they might have had. So if you are witnessing to a Mormon and make a breakthrough, be sure to present them with other spiritual options. #*Rather than try to force a new religion on the Mormon, reinforce that just because the Mormon idea of God and faith may be flawed, this does not mean all ideas of God and faith are flawed.


Keep in mind it takes time for a Mormon to come to terms with disturbing information and realizations about their beliefs. Some Mormons are aware of these issues but find ways to rationalize them. Other Mormons recognize the implications of these facts but stay in the religion for personal reasons, like a close connection to their Mormon family. Fear of going into the “outer darkness” by leaving the church or of losing close family and friends can all make it difficult for a Mormon to leave the Church. So be patient, generous, and open when witnessing a Mormon and give them the space to decide how they feel about the facts of their religion.

, According to the Book of Mormon, as taught by founder Joseph Smith, the Bible has many errors, changes, and omissions. So it must be supplemented and corrected by the Latter Day Saint scriptures. These scriptures include:The Book of Mormon.

The Doctrine & Covenants.

The Pearl of Great Price (including the Book of Abraham).
Joseph Smith’s revisions to the Bible.
The continuing revelation in the teachings of the living prophets of the LDS Church.
As stated in the Articles of Faith: “We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.”
As stated in the Gospel Principles: “The Lord inspired the Prophet Joseph to restore truths to the Bible that had been lost or changed since the original words were written. These inspired corrections are called the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible.”

, In the Mormon doctrine, God the Father was once a man like us, a mortal being, and became God by going through a process that culminated in him becoming exalted to Godhood. He has a physical body and cannot in his own person be omnipresent, or every present. However, as God, he is omniscient (all knowing) and omnipotent (all powerful).As stated in the Gospel Principles: “Joseph Smith taught: ‘It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the Character of God...He was once a man like us...God himself, the Father of us all, dwelt on an earth, the same as Jesus Christ did.”

, Mormon doctrine rejects the classic Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity (one God who exists as three inseparable yet distinct persons: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). Instead, the Mormon doctrine teaches that there are three separate personages who become Gods at different times and have separate bodies.As stated by founder Joseph Smith in Teachings of the Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith: “I have always always declared God to be a distinct personage, Jesus Christ a separate and distinct personage from God the Father, and that the Holy Ghost was a distinct personage and a Spirit: and these three constitute three distinct personages and three Gods.”

, The Mormon doctrine affirms that Jesus Christ died on the cross and rose from the grave, which aligns with Christianity. But, it also teaches that all human beings, including those who reject Jesus Christ in this life, will be raised from the dead with immortal physical bodies. They will then live in one of three glorious kingdoms forever. This is known as general salvation and applies to all people regardless of what they believe or how they behave. Only those who knew and accepted the LDS religion as true and then deliberately rejected it will forfeit automatic salvation.As stated in True to the Faith: “Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, everyone will be redeemed from the effects of the Fall.”
But in the Mormon doctrine, there is a different between immortality, which almost everyone receives whether they are good or bad, and eternal life, which only good people who accept the LDS gospel and keep all of its requirements can obtain. Only those who accept the LDS faith and obey its requirements will be saved to “eternal life” in the presence of the Heavenly Father.
To qualify for the highest of the three eternal kingdoms, known as the “celestial kingdom”, a person must accept the “restored” gospel, fully repent of their signs, and obey all the LDS Church’s laws and commandments. One must also be married in a Mormon temple.
As stated in True to Faith: “Eternal life is to know Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and dwell with Them forever—to inherit a place in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom (see John 17:3; D&C 131:1–4; 132:21–24). To receive this great gift, we must do more than repent of our sins and be baptized and confirmed by appropriate priesthood authority. Men must receive the Melchizedek Priesthood, and all Church members must make and keep sacred covenants in the temple, including eternal marriage.”

, In the Mormon doctrine, faithful Mormons may become gods. So they can become all-powerful beings that make and rule their own worlds. This transformation is called exaltation. Only faithful Mormons who are married for eternity in the Mormon temple, fulfill all their covenants and live obediently, and faithfully, may achieve exaltation and reach the highest degree of the celestial kingdom.According to the Gospel Fundamentals: “To live in the highest part of the celestial kingdom is called exaltation or eternal life. To be able to live in this part of the celestial kingdom, people must have been married in the temple and must have kept the sacred promises they made in the temple. They will receive everything our Father in Heaven has and will become like Him. They will even be able to have spirit children and make new worlds for them to live on, and do all the things our Father in Heaven has done. People who are not married in the temple may live in other parts of the celestial kingdom, but they will not be exalted.”

, According to Mormon doctrine, Joseph Smith is the Prophet of the Restoration, who did more for mankind’s salvation than anyone besides Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith is considered the highly esteemed, honored, and praised man through whom God restored true Christianity to the earth.Keep in mind that though Mormons do not worship Joseph Smith, he is praised in LDS art and music, and has a place in the LDS religion comparable to that of Muhammad in Islam.
Joseph Smith also dictated or wrote nearly all of the LDS scriptures.
As stated in the Doctrine & Covenants: “Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it.”

, According to LDS doctrine, the Latter Day Saints Church is the only true church on earth today. Mormons often refer to the LDS movement as the Restoration, as they believe Christianity fell away between the second century and 1830, the year Joseph Smith organized the LDS Church.As stated in the Doctrine & Covenants: “And after having received the record of the Nephites, yea, even my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., might have power to translate through the mercy of God, by the power of God, the Book of Mormon. And also those to whom these commandments were given, might have power to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth.”

, The LDS Church officially retired the practice of polygamy, or having multiple wives, in 1890. Before then, polygamy was an established Mormon practice, and was practiced by the first prophet of the LDS Church, Joseph Smith. Smith had over thirty “wives” in addition to his legal wife Emma. However, Smith denied being a practicing polygamist as late as a month before he died.Though Mormons may have seen polygamy as an acceptable practice, outside of the faith, it was an illegal practice. Both bigamy and adultery were crimes under state laws where Joseph Smith engaged in the practice.
There is also evidence that after the Manifesto of 1890 banned polygamy from the Mormon faith, the practice did not stop. Only in 1904 did the LDS Church stop authorizing new plural marriages and began excommunicating members who did not comply.

, Groups like the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which was headed by Warren Jeffs, and the Apostolic United Brethren, continue to practice polygamy long after the ban by the Mormon Church.Fundamentalist Mormon groups ascribe to many of the original practices advocated by Joseph Smith and are considered extremist groups by the LDS Mormon Church."

Here are a few examples of inner resistance; see if you can detect these resistive patterns(unconscious or conscious) within yourself :

""Why did I get a bad grade?” It’s not going to change the grade and more likely to make you suffer. It's because you are resisting what is, the reality. So instead have fun with it. For example: My teacher returned my test paper with a McDonald's job application stapled to it. Having fun with what life throws at you is a form of acceptance.
""Why are there so many ups and downs in my life?” Do you think resisting things like this is going to change one bit about it? Ups and downs are part of life. Accept it.


True acceptance comes when you don't ask ""Why is this happening to me?"".
""I am never upset for the reason I think."" Course of miracles.;
, No resistance does not mean to just accept the present and do nothing about it. It means to offer no internal resistance to what is, then the intelligent action comes from deep within you. Non resistance/reaction is perfectly compatible with action. In fact non-reactive action is much more powerful as it is in alignment with the universe, unlike knee-jerk reaction which is short sighted and unintelligent.


""To offer no resistance to life is to be in a state of grace, ease, and lightness."" Eckhart Tolle.

Slow down.,
Reduce your commitments.,
Eliminate extras.,
Declutter your living area.",How to Live a Simple and Peaceful Life1," There are times when you are so used to doing everything in a hurry that you don’t notice how fast-paced your life has become. Simply reading the words, “Slow down,” will allow you to pause for a moment and notice. This step is mentioned first so you will carry the thought with you throughout this article and beyond.


Avoid multi-tasking. It has become popular, if not clichéd, to multi-task. Research indicates that there is a point where the quality of what you are doing declines when you try to focus on too many tasks at once.Just because everyone is doing it doesn’t mean you have to.
Find your threshold of diminishing return on the number of tasks you can work on. Your goal is to do things well so you can feel good about your accomplishments.
Do nothing as if it were something. There is an art to doing nothing. Many people struggle with taking time to pause and regroup. Even if you take a five minute break to do nothing, do it.;
, If you have current commitments to do something, then follow through until the tasks or events are complete. However, from this point forward take on fewer commitments. You may struggle at first, but focus your intent on simplifying your life, which will bring about peace. Allow the eventual goal to motivate you and quiet your feelings of guilt.


Limit the amount of times you say, “Yes” by keeping a tally on your calendar. First, determine your “comfort level” for how many events you can peacefully manage. Second, stick to that number. No one can always be the good guy who says, “Yes.”
When you are asked to participate in an event, do not quickly answer. Pause for a moment to discern if the event will enrich your life. If it won’t you can say, “Thank you for inviting me, but I need to pass.”
Develop an ability to say, “no” by communicating your intent. There are times when some people will not take “no” for an answer. This is your cue to share a bit more information with the person to set your boundary.Consider saying something like, “You are so kind to think of me, but I’m making some changes in my life that are really important to me, my family and my health so I am going to have to decline.” The person will likely support your decision.

, The concept of conspicuous consumption may describe your life. It entails lavish or wasteful spending that attempts to show others your level of social prestige.Simplifying your life will drastically cut into the amount of “extras” you have grown accustom to. The goal is to cut out the extra expenses so you won’t be tied down by financial obligations.


Question if you really need that third ipad or newest electronic gadget, or twice-a-day trip through the coffee retailer drive-thru. Just say “no” to yourself, and “yes” to your desire to live a simpler and more peaceful life. Each time you are faced with a decision, you can make a good decision.
Find fulfillment in the simple things in life by spending time with friends, in nature, or building something with your own two hands. Intrinsic rewards will improve your motivation and overall satisfaction with your life., People create their world around them and fill it with items. If you want to simplify your life, survey your surroundings and get organized. A well-organized home is a healthy home. Eliminating surplus items that you no longer use will help declutter your home, your emotions and your thoughts.When your exterior world is free of clutter, so is your interior world.


Take a minimum of 10 minutes a day to organize your surroundings.
Use the weekend or your days off to take on bigger projects like cleaning closets, drawers and garages.
Sort your items into three categories: Keep; donate; and throw away. Giving away lightly used items to charitable organizations gives others an opportunity to enjoy the items and provides jobs for the workers who process the donations. With each donation you make you are helping the community, which enhances your self-esteem."

Assess what your actual needs are.,
Assess what level of risk you are willing to tolerate.,
Decide how much you need to relate to the rest of society.,
Ask yourself how you value wealth versus money.,
Assess and evaluate your skill set very seriously, as the employment market would do.Assess them not as you might wish things were, but right now -- what are your current skills worth right now?,
List out your skills in detail.Skills can be quite varied: some people perceive well, others heal or care, others administer or teach, some engineer, some organize, some promote, some figure out with math and science in formulas and testing and collating data, some write, some sell products and earn a commission, some teach others to sell and build a marketing structure underneath themselves where each of their subordinates contributes a little to their paychecks, some get paid to study and do research, some study historical data and use it to predict the future, some are economists, some teach swimming, some help Santa, a few play professional sports, some do customer service and handle consumer questions and complaints.,
Cultivate your interpersonal skills.,
Consider what career your skills have been building towards.,

Do more than what is expected of you.",How to Attain Financial Stability to Help You Thrive," Compare these to what the system is trying to force you to want, desire and believe your needs are. As a starting point, research Maslow's Hierarchy.In order to be positive, one must be disciplined, strong, creative, self-assured and effective.;
, Generally, if you're young, quick and healthy, you may be willing to assume more risk than if you're old, slow and more prone to ailments. This kind of consideration makes a big difference when investing your only $10,000; at 20, you have time to earn it again if you lose it, whereas at 80, you likely do not.


Potential rewards are often associated with increased risk; if you are old, you need to minimize risk and if you are young, you want to maximize rewards. You may want to develop your own risk management plan.

, Can you go for long periods happily doing your own thing with minimal contact with the outside world or are you the sort of person who needs social contact and feedback most of the time? Do you need the approval of others or are you self-assured?


No one can answer these questions for you, and for many people, the answers may take some time to answer with a high degree of certainty:

Are you willing to prepare yourself to defend yourself and possibly others against attacks of all sorts?
Are you patriotic and feel a duty to serve your country that supports you?
Are you willing to do what it takes to prepare for worst-case scenarios?
Are you good at self-assessment, really? Is there someone to reliably double-check you?
Do you truly know your actual strengths and weaknesses?



, Real wealth is having what you need when you need it, and doesn't depend on some set monetary amount.


Economic value is directly related to scarcity of supply, per demand, but all scarce things do not have high economic value if demand is lacking.
Much money is spent to promote demand in a consumer economy, making the media and other marketing channels valuable resources.
In order to preserve capital, don't consume or spend it, except on capital assets (like land, buildings, machines) and the necessities of existence.

, You can look up online what various occupations pay in terms of average salary per economic region from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.



What can you do to effect change(s)? Make a list of how you can be an effective agent of change in society given the skill set you possess; be thorough and don't be afraid to be creative!

What can you do to produce goods and/or services? Make a list of how you can actually be employed or employ yourself to produce goods and/or provide service(s) given the skill set you possess. Again, be thorough and don't be afraid to be creative. Some young adults train in less than a year to become paramedics / emergency personnel and make good wages. You can do a lot, from watching children to running tractors to mowing lawns to stenciling house numbers on the curbside in spray paint to raking to modeling to test marketing to personal shopping -- the list is quite long.

,

List the jobs you've had and been paid for and break the job down into each skill required to perform it -- it may be you had to have an eye for photography to properly rake leaves! Be very detailed. Some skills, like using a new microscope or scanner properly to discern lifeforms or clues as a detective, take some years to develop. Some skills require a lot of training and/or education. Some skills are highly specialized, like detecting art forgeries and counterfeiting expertise or accounting for huge and complex corporate mergers. Generally, the more of your body and mind that you use in the employment of a skill, the better it is thought to be for your whole being.

, Be honest and fair, both in your self-assessments and in dealing with other people. If you are a liar or a cheat or both, you may fool a few people for a little while, but you won't get far. Reputation is everything, so be honest, especially with yourself and your immediate support system.

If there's on area everyone can benefit from, it's learning to relate to other people. Today, the emphasis in many developed countries is on the Service Sector rather than the Manufacturing Sector of economic production.

, Are you naturally talented as a musician or is that just something your mother wanted you to be able to do? Most people these days will change their career path several times during their lifetime.


Visiting a local Career Center can help. Being overly specialized can be detrimental when forced to seek new employment sometimes; keep up with the developments in your broader field or discipline and seek to constantly expand your skill set.

, Nature, generally speaking, evolves life to fill all available niches of survival. You want to move yourself from coping to surviving by focusing on finding the right niche for you.


For example, suppose you'd like to start a business without a great deal of start-up capital or operating expenses which will be the ferrying of people from a shore city to various islands; however, several such ferries already exist and they vary from one that carries both cars and people to simple motorboats like yours that seats 4 adults plus 2 children and a standing pilot, yourself. The large ferry that carries cars, people and large luggage charges 10x what the smallest speedboat charges, which also has the advantage of speed of commute. And that is to the closest island, with prices rising per the greater distance to the further islands.

You have to compete with all vessels for business but you also should cooperate with them, in case of emergencies, because you are all served by the same repair shop(s) and because you all must get along on the same waterways. Therefore, you will not charge what the large ferry charges and you will not undercut the price charged by a similar vessel to yours, so long as there is enough business for everyone -- which there is if you have done your market research and truly identified a need not yet being served, i.e. people standing in line for long periods of time waiting to be ferried!
Now, on the weekends, there is less ferry business and there is more sightseeing and fishing business. Being a newcomer, you might not know the best scenic views for photo-taking or viewing and stealing the established fishing zones of established businesses would be frowned upon. So you buy some scuba suits, learn about scuba diving and offer scuba lessons! Soon, your brand new market niche is wildly successful because the area is over-fished anyway and the views are pretty much like coastline anywhere, and the competition is suddenly knocking on your door, asking you questions! That is a good spot to be in, for you can hold paid seminars to teach the competition.


As another example, your father has you taking care of the yard and doing various other chores for an allowance of $150/month. But you find a flyer left at your front door by a Mr. Hopper offering all sorts of home care services including lawn care and you call him up and ask him to come over and give you a free estimate, as that is what his flyer announces he will do. He tells you he will take care of the yard completely for $375/month! So you get a detailed list of exactly what he would do to the yard and you take it to your father and tell him you are thinking of going into business for yourself and would he lease you the lawnmower for $25/month and he agrees.

You have the summer off and you scout around many local neighborhoods for overgrown yards and you talk to the homeowners and you undercut Mr. Ruiz and offer your services for $300 per month for 3 months. You know it will take you about 3 hours to do everything Mr. Ruiz does, so you decide to work a 9 hour day approximately and do 3 lawn and yard care jobs per day. From June 1 to August 31 there are 30+31+31=92 days. 92*3*300=$82,800 you plan to make over your summer ""vacation"" by working so hard (if you signed up 92 people in month #1 that is)! You will have to pay tax on those earnings because they're so high and there will be expenses for the lawnmower leasing, gas, oil, spark plugs, other tools, etc. which are deductible as business expenses.
How can you find about 90 homes to service? Easy! You pay the local teens to scour all the neighborhoods on their bikes and rubber band flyers to people's front doors if their yard needs work. Keep good track of all expenses, including rubber bands -- everything! You may want to lease a light pickup truck to haul your gardening equipment around, or find a partner who has one. When you get a little smarter, you get an army of teens doing the yard work for you all over town and you take a managerial cut off the top.



, Keep in touch with these contacts fairly often -- it pays to do so, in good times and hard times as well. Be a person who can be counted on to hold up your end of the deal.

As the final example, consider changing your family's lawn into what's called a ""truck farm"". Here's the deal: your parents will lend you the tools and fertilizer and water costs and you will sell them back vegetables, at the local Farmer's Market prices (so long as your quality is good), less these start up and ongoing costs. Any surplus vegetables you will sell at the Farmer's Market and split the profits with your parents because it's their land you're using, and they may want to convert it back to lawn again when you're done, which is expensive. But your profits can make this sort of venture very rewarding indeed, and you will have the added benefit of having your own food supply if a disaster occurs, which your parents will be very, very grateful for.

, Consider other jobs that do not require a college degree and that pay more than the average American income of about $47,000. The BLS provides breakdowns of income/wages by occupation and area to help with an idea of what's out there., All people need nutritious and healthy food, clean air, clean water, good sleep and hygiene, shelter, and adequate transportation. In order to survive (and thrive), they also generally need the opportunity to be productivity and contribute to their community, education and training, communications and internet access, social interaction, love and adequate fulfillment of their sex drive, an opportunity to engage in self-defense and sports, devotion to a personal spirituality, religion, or faith, and, for many people, access to fulfilling activities like charity, relaxation and entertainment, hobbies, saving and investing, shopping, etc.


Decide for each category over an average week how much time you should spend, on average, satisfying each need.
Make sure all your needs get met or you will be dissatisfied and unhappy and feel something is missing. It is your life and your responsibility to meet your own needs. It is not your parent's responsibility much anymore or the government's responsibility -- it's yours and it can be very rewarding and satisfying to lead a life of accomplishment on which you can build your self-esteem and self-respect! Then others will also respect and honor you, which will make your life much easier.

,

Learn to grow your own food! A 4' x 4' planter box can produce hundreds of pounds of food per year, even for an apartment dweller.
Write your local legislator to push for bills that help ensure safe and clean air and water -- the fundamentals of life on this planet! You may or may not be a full-fledged environmentalist but no one wants to breathe noxious fumes and drink contaminated, polluted water!
Be active during the day, so that your body tires naturally and seeks sleep naturally.
Be like a cat -- stretch when you wake -- a lot! Really stretch it all out! People who do yoga regularly 15-30 minutes a day have much better muscle tone and are less susceptible to disease and infection because their immune systems work better., You are precious. You are sacred, as is all Life. Never underestimate your own worth and potential. You can do anything you set your mind to and become anything you want to become. All it takes is devotion, practice, and discipline. Lots and lots. You must do rather than merely think about doing. Actions rather than words create real change.


It is important to live up to your word, to do as you say you will do and keep your promises; however, it is even better to avoid ever making promises and just consistently do your best, always seeking to exceed your own expectations and those of others. Words are just a symbol-layer atop reality for our convenience in mentally handling things before we physically handle them. Don't confuse people's words with their actions. Liars can often be caught because their actions do not agree with their bold statements.

, The word ""thrive"" became the words ""thrift"" and ""thrifty"". As this wordplay suggests, it is important to save money as you mature to manage your retirement years and enjoy the fruits of your labor. And what should you save? That which has lasting value., Without it, wealth is hard to come by, and you won't really thrive. Maintain a balanced diet, get plenty of exercise, see your doctor about your health concerns, and take charge of your own wellbeing., Successful people often exceed expectations and thrive despite life's hurdles due to their adequate preparation, effective planning and very positive mental attitude.

, Working as a member of a team is more effective and gets more done than working alone. Usually, people who are both successful and happy (or content) realize this and put it into practice. Compromise does not stop them from putting forward their best effort. Synergy is a state where the product of the whole is greater than the sum of the parts; you can often exceed expectations by working synergistically as a member of a well-coordinated team effort.

, Be conservative and save up for a rainy day and contingencies. Manage risk by planning for it and insuring against it, building against it and defending against it.


Learn basic bookkeeping, accounting and budgeting so that you will know where you've been, how you got where you are, where you're at, what you're made of, where you're going, and how you're going to get there.
Learn basic disaster preparedness and First Aid and invest in both.Insure yourself adequately.
Pay yourself first by saving immediately when you get paid.

, Criticize constructively not foolishly. Be kind, be patient, have some reserve. Preserve hope. Be gracious and help the needy help themselves. Speak from experience rather than from conjecture or whimsy.


Learn to write not only to people of this day and age, but to people of all times, to their hearts and souls. You may write fantasy, poetry, science fiction, works of drama and imagination to your heart's content, but if they do not serve to elucidate the soul, what good are they, truly?
If you paint or do creative work, enjoy the creative force and the act of painting itself. Painting can be important in that it causes people to learn and adopt new patterns; pattern recognition is thought to be a key component of intelligence. People's impressions are individual and cannot be forced. A genius once said that ""Genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration."" It does not take much to turn a comedy into a tragedy and vice versa, so learn to laugh at your own foibles as you learn from your every mistake.

, Many people find joy and fulfillment in serving their country, whether by joining the armed services or by some other means. Many have died for the freedoms your generation enjoys and you have an opportunity to pay it forward. Honor is best bestowed by one's peers. Honors bestowed by one's superiors must carry an additional weight of dignity, better paid in honor to one's true superiors. But that would be a lesser dignity honoring a greater, so it is said: honor is best bestowed by peers. People often do only what they must to ""just get by"" -- thrive instead; exceed expectations and rise through the ranks.

, Consider first if your parents and siblings are provided for adequately. Consider anyone with special needs in your extended family. Consider well and be not selfish. Be humble in service; no one knows the turn of events to come. Charity begins at home., Be a leader. Financial stability and good habits in life are the best start, but you can take these ideas above and beyond, in order truly to thrive.


Learn from the ancient wisdom of the Tao Te Ching, which tells of a long line of people on a long march, following a leader, with the old slow sage at the very end of the line. When people became dissatisfied with where the leader had led them for one reason or another, the line turned around, and the old slow sage then became the new leader. You, too, can learn to lead from behind, especially if you judge the current leadership to be incompetent.

Practice dis-identification with form.,
Dis-identify with your mind.,
Don't limit yourself with words.",How to Live in the Present (Spiritual Way)2," On a deeper level it's all about identification with form. For example: physical appearance, mind (psychological), situation, age, wealth, and the list goes on. None of that is you; you in essence are consciousness.... the spaciousness that's ever present within you.


The very nature of the forms is unstable and fleeting. From your thoughts and emotions to body to buildings to mountains to planets to galaxies; all forms change and dissolve, except the space where these forms come and go. For more depth read Know Your Trueself and Become Mentally Flexible.
""There was something formless and perfect before the universe was born. It is serene. Empty. Solitary. Unchanging. Infinite. Eternally present. It is the mother of the universe."" Tao Te Ching.

, You are not your mind, not your thoughts and not your emotions. Most of your pain and suffering comes from the fact that you are so unconsciously identified with the hypnotic 'voice in your head' (or thoughts) that you take it as the truth. Deeply realize that you are not your thoughts. You are the presence that sees that voice in your head. Read Dissolve the Ego (According to Eckhart Tolle's Teachings) for more depth.


Example: When someone is mean to you and you feel hurt, it's not from the words they said but by the automatic mental interpretation of those words, the extent to which you identify with it. Its true that words have great power to put hypnotic spells on you but its only because you limit yourself with words and don't know your true essence, the consciousness that is you..

, Words offer a limited interpretation of things. It’s like putting labels on things to make them finite in the same way we label ourselves to make us finite. We think about finite things because our mind insists upon making what we experience into something or some form, through conceptualization. For example, if an orange was called 'Sedlak' would it change its taste,color, peel, features, etc? No.


Do you think a few letters of a language can define the timeless and eternal stillness that you are? Its fine to use labels for easier verbalization but deeply realize that they are just labels or signposts.

Understand Ego.,
Accept completely.,
Be grateful.",How to Live in the Present (Spiritual Way)3," Ego is current state of consciousness of humanity; A conglomeration of recurring thoughts and conditioned mental-emotional patterns that are invested with a sense of I, a sense of self. Or we can say, it is identification with mind and form.


To evolve into the next stage of conscious evolution and ensure our survival, we must dissolve the Ego. For more depth read How to Dissolve the Ego.
Just recognizing that Ego is the reason for our distortions and pain, is part of the process to become spiritually enlightened..

, If we look at 'acceptance' closely this shows a spiritual perspective of the clichéd phrase “be yourself.


We have this ambiguous definition of the phrase 'be yourself' but most people don't know what it really means. It means whatever you have, accept it and don't be ashamed about it. For example, if you have a weird laugh then accept it and don't feel embarrassed about it, because if you did then it means you have not truly accepted the present..
This advice can also be misleading as your mind may ask ""So how can I be myself?"" and come up with a mental interpretation or concept. This would become your definition for 'Be yourself'. Concepts or definitions are no more than stepping stones or signposts to be left as quickly as possible. Although its fine to use concepts in the beginning but realize that true interpretation is unconditional and non-conceptual. Read Become Mentally and Spiritually Emancipated and Stay Rooted in Being for more depth.

, Feel genuinely grateful for what you have, especially for the present moment. Acknowledging the good that is already in your life is the foundationof all abundance.

Meditate.,
Understand portals.,
Stay connected to your being.,
Give.",How to Live in the Present (Spiritual Way)4," On a deeper level, meditation is all about staying in the present. Since one can be present, to a degree, without having to dedicate time to meditate. So meditation is not always necessary. Here are a few 'structure-less' meditation practices that don't require you to dedicate time.


Feel your body from the inside. Can you feel the energy field, the sensation inside your body, especially your arms, face, near your heart and legs? This is your ever present beingthat's connected with the universal intelligence. Just focus your awareness on that energy field, it would not only anchor you in the present but also strengthen your immune system.
Be aware of sense perceptions and breathing. Read Stay Rooted in Being for more insight on these meditation practices.

, This term was used by spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle in his book Power of Now. It says unmanifested comes into this reality, or becomes manifested, via portals. It means, when you keep your awareness on these portals, they open and you connect to the universal consciousness that is present in every being. It means 'Consciousness' becoming 'Conscious' of itself. In our essence we are consciousness and the purpose is to connect with it.


Here's a practice: Be aware of sense perceptions, breathing, inner body or awareness of awareness itself. Keeping some attention on one of the these portals while doing anything increases the quality of your actions. Be very aware as 'keeping some attention' may become a mental concept. It is highly recommended to read Surrender to the Present Moment for more depth on this.
Have you noticed that when you try something new, you feel a sensation in your body, an uneasiness? That's pre-verbalized mental reaction which tries to stop you from trying that new thing. This is always there whenever you try to do something new and challenging, or encounter something unpleasant, etc. Just allow it to be, don't fight it and if you can't allow it to be, then allow 'yourself to be uncomfortable' or we can say 'allow that which you can't allow'.

, It is very possible to stay connected to the portals or 'being' throughout your life, How? Whenever you are doing your normal routine work, keep a fraction of your attention within your body, breath or sense perception. This is a very effective practice to become proactive because when you are connected to your being, the reactions get channeled to your body and you feel more non-reactive. Which means more attention and intelligence during challenging situations. Try it out.

, On a universal level 'giving' is the same as 'receiving'. If you feel people are withholding something from you like respect, praise, worthiness, etc you give it to the people. If you don't have it, 'act as if you have it'. If you feel that you already have it you will almost certainly get it.

"
"
Be in the present.,
To know the power of ""no judgement"" or ""no interpretation,"" try this: Stand under a cold shower and focus only on the water touching your body; give it your complete attention without any interpretation.,
Smile.",How to Live in the Present (Spiritual Way)5," The enlightenment lies in the present. When our mind wanders to past and future that's when we feel unproductive and irrational pain. So be in the present moment and make it your best friend. . Have you noticed that when you replace your worries with a productive and/or joyful task, their magnitude reduces drastically? On the other hand when you take your mind off the task at hand, you feel uncertain.


Simply just observe. Just observe things, people, the environment around you, thoughts etc, like a background presence, without adding any interpretation to them. That's when you realize the fleetingness of all things and they lose their seriousness. Read Surrender to the Present Moment for more depth.

, Go deeper into the sensation.


You should notice the water touching your body is just a sensation, and the interpretation of it tells you if it is cold or not.
Similarly go deeper into negative emotions you feel in your body to dissolve them. It's cause negative emotions such as anxiety, despair, grief, etc, are no more than intense pressure, tautness, or discomfort you experience somewhere in your body and that doesn't make you unhappy. It's the mental interpretation of them that makes you unhappy. Situation is usually neutral, When a situation becomes tense, too serious, sad, anxious or fearful, and you feel down, then just smile. Its cause smiling tricks your mind to release feel good chemicals like dopamine. Its like transmuting and channeling the negative energy. Plus it helps you become more aware of sense perceptions.


Although its not an effective practice to always use a negative situation to smile or become present. Instead be aware as much as you can. Being aware doesn't mean not to think; it means even if you are thinking be there as the background witnessing presence. You are that presence.

Identify your values.Think about the things that are important to you that influence the way you act and ultimately the person you are.,
Align your activities with your values.,
Formulate a plan and commit to it.,
Practice living in the present moment.,
Write in a gratitude journal.,
Practice empathy and compassion to create peace.The ability to appreciate someone else’s struggle is an important skill to develop.,
Switch from resentful to grateful to improve relationships.",How to Live a Simple and Peaceful Life2," These are values. They are a guiding force in decision making. Identifying your values can be a challenge, but it is worth the effort.


To identify your values, think about the times in your life when you were the happiest, most proud, most fulfilled and satisfied. Make a list and determine what you valued about those situations. Perhaps you value the creativity, adventure, loyalty and hard work each of these situations provided. Maybe you realize that you value your family the most. These will be a driving force in everything you do.
If you want to live a simple peaceful life, then you might value serenity, resourcefulness, stability, and health.

, Participate in activities that are congruent with your values and desire to simplify your life. You will know if your activities are in line with your values by the way you feel. You will feel satisfied and content. When it comes to activities that conflict with your values, the opposite is true. You will have a strong feeling that something is wrong and you are unhappy.


Decline offers to events that conflict with your intent to live peacefully.
Make a decision to live a value-driven life. It will take discipline and focus, which can be enhanced by things such as a yoga and physical exercise., Following a problem solving model will give you structure for creating change. You have identified your desire to live a simple and peaceful life and now you must determine clear objectives, implement them, make adjustments as needed and monitor your progress.Determine clear objectives. One objective may be that you set a schedule and keep a log of your decluttering efforts. Self-monitoring leads to real change.Pick a start date for your plan and start. Don’t delay the inevitable. Start as soon as possible.
Recognize your growth and reward yourself. If you successfully meet your daily, weekly or monthly objectives, celebrate your accomplishments. Perhaps you could go to a movie, attend a sporting event or plant a tree in honor of someone you admire. Positive reinforcement will motivate you to continue with your plan.
If a strategy isn’t working for you, then stop using it. Find an alternative and plug it into your plan. Don’t look at it as a failure; instead look at it as a correction in the course toward your goal.
Your new behaviors will build over time and become second nature to you. As your behavior becomes more natural, you can lessen your strict adherence to your plan and still maintain positive outcomes., Don’t occupy your thoughts with too much about the past or too much about the future. A wandering mind is an unhappy mind.Simplifying your thoughts involves quieting your mind, and staying focused on what you are doing at that moment.


Use visualization exercises to imagine yourself in a simple, peaceful stress-free environment. This will help quiet your mind.
Engage in conversation or exercise. These are two of the most effective ways to stay in the present moment., The benefits of keeping a gratitude journal include improved sleep, improved health and increased happiness – all factors that create peace in your life. There are things to consider to obtain the highest level of benefit:Start by deciding to become happier and more grateful.
Provide the details about the things you are grateful for rather than stating simple phrases.
Gear your gratitude toward people rather than things.
Consider how your life would be different by removing something you care about. This will inspire you to think of additional aspects of your gratitude.
Remember to include unexpected surprises.
Don’t lose your gumption to write by forcing yourself to write every day. Perhaps once or twice a week would be comfortable routine.

, It comes easy to some people, and not to others. You know how you would like to be treated, so use that as a guide when trying to forgive someone.


If you want to practice empathy and compassion start by reaching out to a family member or friend and offer to help her in some way. Perhaps you could run an errand for her, or do something simple like unload groceries, or water her plants. The point of this exercise is to provide to others the feelings and actions you appreciate when someone does the same for you.

, Much of a person’s internal and external unrest stems from conflicts with others. As they say, holding resentment toward someone is like drinking poison expecting the other person to be harmed. Thoughts of gratitude will help improve your mood and thus, lessen feelings of resentment.When you feel resentful stop yourself and ask the following questions:


Do I feel good when I think about this person?
Are my negative feelings helping me or hurting me?
Do my thoughts aimed at retribution toward this person have any actual impact on the other person?
The obvious answers to the questions are no, no and no. Next, respond with gratitude-filled statements: I feel good that I am letting go of my resentment for this person; My focus on moving forward is helping me feel better; I am focused on improving my life rather than destroying someone else’s.

If you must stay close to where you currently live, then research prospective properties to rent or buy. Using a property manager can be very helpful.
If you are interested in making a big leap, then research areas farther away that offer what you desire. You might feel better and more positive about living near the ocean, in the mountains, or on the top floor of a beautiful skyscraper.

, This small scale version of a house has everything you could want. Designed for the minimalist who enjoys all the comforts of home in an extremely small space. The house can be placed on a piece of property, hooked up to water and sewer and you call it home.


You can forego a large mortgage in exchange for a creatively designed little, peaceful, environmentally conscious home., There are plenty of people who own a high-line car with a payment that is equivalent to a house payment.

Small eco-friendly cars will get you where you want to go and decrease your carbon footprint. Less pollution means a simpler, cleaner existence.
Get a bike and ride it to work. It is great exercise and you will always have a great parking spot.

, There is nothing worse than going to a job every day that you hate. If all your attempts to make it more enjoyable have been unsuccessful, you would benefit from changing jobs and/or careers. If you are spending 80 hours a week cranking out sales quotas that leave you depleted and stressed, it is time for a change toward the simpler life.

Stop making shopping a recreational activity.,
Buy used.,
Limit television.,
Limit web browsing.,
Become more environmentally conscious.,
Declutter.,
Participate in non-material forms of entertainment.",How to Escape Materialism and Find Happiness," Stop thinking of the mall as an entertainment venue. The problem with figuring the mall as an entertainment venue is that the place is shot through with the ideology of materialism. Everything there is for sale. Store owners will do almost anything to get you to buy. And advertising is everywhere. If you define yourself as a “mall shopper,” pretty soon you will feel like you haven’t done your duty unless you leave the place with a bag full of stuff you don’t need. That’s when they have you!


Don’t go to the mall with friends. Go alone, and make it a business trip.
Know exactly what you want before you go to the store, buy it, and leave the premises immediately.
Use a 30-day list. If you decide you really want to buy something, put it on a list. Now tell yourself you cannot buy that item for 30 days. When the 30 days have passed, if you still want the item, go to the store and buy it. This waiting period can help you determine whether or not you really want or need the item.;
, When you get the urge to buy something, try finding it used instead of new. Buying used gets you out of the mall and into another world. Thrift shops, used-clothing stores, and flea markets operate under a different market sensibility. It’s not quite anti-materialistic, but it’s certainly less materialistic than the mall sensibility.


Internet services such as Craigslist and E-Bay make buying used items much easier than before. The direct exchange such services provide can get you out of the cycle of extreme consumerism.
Buying used at thrift stores and flea markets usually means you are dealing with another human being, face-to-face, instead of dealing with a faceless corporation.

, You don’t need to become a television basher, just recognize that TV is dominated by the concerns of advertisers. It’s not just that a higher and higher percentage of TV content is ads, but that even non-advertising content carries the messages and materialistic ideology of advertisers. The actors who play people represented in sitcoms, for example, don’t wear clothing that they pick out themselves. They wear clothing that fits advertising demographics.


Force yourself to shut down all TV viewing for one week as an experiment, and if you can’t handle this, shut it down for three days.
Figure out how many hours of TV you watch per week. Then determine what you would truly miss if you cut out TV viewing altogether. Watch only the shows you would truly miss, and forget about the rest.
Watch TV only with other people, never alone. Figuring TV as a communal activity can reduce some of its materialistic overtones as you interact with your fellow viewers instead of sitting inert and allowing yourself to be bombarded by endless ads.

, Unfortunately, the internet is second only to television for spreading a materialistic ideology. The prevalence of the celebrity culture, incredibility intrusive advertising, and, of course, internet shopping make it hard to avoid the rampant materialism of the internet.


Even more than TV, internet use encourages self absorption and a solitary life style. Instead of becoming a hermit, participate in real social networking—make new, non-virtual, friends—rather than participating in Facebook and Twitter.
Cut out one internet function. Most people use the internet for more than one function. They use it to play games. They use it for getting news. Or, they use it for buying stuff. Cutting out one of these functions is easier than cutting them all out, and it can help you get a handle on your overall internet usage.

, Thinking green is not compatible with thinking stuff, so go green! Most of the serious environmental problems facing us today—including climate change, ever expanding garbage dumps, and air pollution, to name only a few—have been caused by attempting to buy and sell natural processes.


Recognize the connection between environmental degradation and a materialistic way of life. For example, buying bottled water produces millions of plastic bottles that end up bobbing up and down in rivers and lakes, not to mention the oceans.
Make recycling your religion. If you really make recycling a way of life, you will see how foolish it is to assign value to objects based on how much they cost.
Human beings are natural process too, in a sense. Going green can help you reconstitute your identity.

, Go through your closets and other storage areas and start getting rid of stuff you don’t use or want anymore. Most people find it a revelation to discover how much rubbish they accumulate over a period of years. Decluttering is a gratifying process, and helps you realize how costly mindless consumerism can be. You don’t need any of this stuff! You don’t enjoy having it. But what you will enjoy is a less cluttered house or apartment.

, The world provides many interesting activities that are not at all related to TV viewing or internet browsing. Try playing board games, creating art, or hiking in local wilderness areas. Try visiting relatives and other loved ones more often. Try volunteering with a charity.


Read a book instead of a magazine. Magazines stopped making their profit from subscription fees and store purchases a long time ago. It’s all advertising now! Reading a book can provide a respite from being bombarded by magazine ads.
Get to know your neighbors. Get to know them in the way your parents and grandparents used to know them; that is, actually spend some time with them. Have lunch with them, have dinner with them. Find out what bothers them about your neighborhood and what they really like about it.
Attend non-professional sports events. Attending professional sports events has become so expensive as to exclude a large part of the working population, especially families. For a family of four to attend a professional baseball game, for example, you can expect to spend as much as $400.00 or more when you consider tickets, food, souvenirs, and parking. Alternatively, many communities have nearby colleges that play high-quality baseball, and attendance is usually free. The point is to enjoy the game itself, and what does the game have to do with $12.00 cups of beer. For that matter, what’s wrong with attending a Little League game and watching 12-year-olds play out of the love of participation?
Learn that everything in life has to go once - your attachment , be it of value or emotions to an object can make it a part of your life . And concentrating on these things , you forget to live your life without concerning . Where concerned word is bounced , happiness word is erased . So , live happily don't make any kind of greedy , emotional or valued attachment to anything .

, Don't be violent (like the Dauntless). When you see two people fighting, step in and act as a mediator. And, if you're ever involved in a fight, talk it out instead of throwing punches. Amity also thinks that it's okay to lie to maintain peace.

, If you are Amity, you should trust that what you need will be provided for you, instead of arguing about who gets what.

, When someone insults you, don't be changed by it. The insult didn't change who you were on the inside, did it? The opinions of others cannot damage you.

, When someone apologizes to you, forgive them. The wrong is in the past. Let it rest where it lies.

, You shouldn't fight with your enemy. Cruel thoughts lead to cruel words. And cruel words can hurt you as much as they hurt others.

, Amity was formed by the people who blamed conflict and hatred for the wars and problems of the world. And, Amity still believes that conflict and hatred are the reason for the world's problems today!

, Even when Jesus was sent to die a horrible death on the cross, he still felt no hate for anyone. When Musa (A.S.) was sent to visit the Pharaoh, Allah encouraged him to be kind and polite despite the Pharaoh's atrocities. Thus, a major theme in most religions is love.

Not everyone should be a missionary. The hours are not 9 AM - 5 PM, and the living conditions are less than ideal. However, if you feel called to perform this kind of work, you may look past any perceived inconveniences. Missionaries often place a higher value on the purpose of the mission than on the living conditions.;

Catholic, Jewish, or Protestant missions groups will follow certain methods of missionary work, while Buddhist or Hindu organizations will follow different methods. Select the one that is right for your belief system.

These include works by philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzche and Michael Foucault., The Nine Satanic Statements give a framework to the ideology and way of life for Satanists. Remember these statements during your journey as a Satanist in order to act in accord to the Church of Satan’s expectations.


Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence!
Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams!
Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit!
Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates!
Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek!
Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires!
Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his “divine spiritual and intellectual development,” has become the most vicious animal of all!
Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!
Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years!, These rules dictate how a Satanist should live their lives in accordance with the religion. Similar to the Ten Commandments, following these rules are meant to bring prosperity and goodness to you, and those around you. The aim of Satanism is not necessarily spreading good, but living in a way that brings you joy without harming others. The Satanic Rules reflect this. These are the Eleven Satanic Rules!


Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked.
Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them.
When in another’s lair, show him respect or else do not go there.
If a guest in your lair annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy.
Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal.
Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and he cries out to be relieved.
Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained.
Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself.
Do not harm little children.
Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food.
When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him. , The Nine Satanic Sins represent the attributes that Satanists are advised to avoid at all cost. In combination with the Satanic Rules of the Earth, they create a roadmap for the Satanist to live their life honestly and productively. Avoid these sins whenever possible.


Stupidity. The Satanist should endeavor to educate himself in all things.
Pretentiousness. Don’t posture as something greater than you are – this can lead to further sins.
Solipsism. Do not forget that the world includes many more than just yourself. Do unto others as they do unto you.
Self-deceit. Don’t act like something you know you are not.
Herd Conformity. The antithesis of thinking for yourself.
Lack of Perspective. Though independence is important in Satanism, do not let it cloud your judgment.
Forgetfulness of Past Orthodoxies. Move forward with your future, but never forget the past.
Counterproductive Pride. Pride is important for recognizing your worth, but do not let it get you in over your head.
Lack of Aesthetics. Take care of yourself and your body., The Church of Satan espouses independent thinking as one of its greatest traits. For the Church of Satan, “Satan” represents the power of choice. You are free to disagree with others – even other Satanists.


Part of being independent is questioning your own beliefs and assumptions. Satanism is steeped heavily in questioning the things around you.
Make your own decisions. Don’t feel the need to agree with a fellow Satanist just because they are a Satanist. It is expected that you make your own decisions and hold your own opinions to truly be independent., Rituals, also known as “Greater” and “Lesser Magic,” serve as a practice designed to self-actualize one’s desires. Much like meditation or yoga, rituals involve focusing the mind on a particular goal or manner of thinking to achieve that goal.


Rituals need not be performed under candlelight or the dark of the moon. Concentration and the ability to focus are all that is necessary. You can achieve this however works best for you.
Greater Magic is concerned with the self, and changing your own thoughts and feelings.
Lesser Magic is concerned with changing the thoughts and feelings of others through your own efforts., Members of the Church of Satan used to meet in “grottos” to socialize and discuss the church. Though they no longer exist officially, members still gather together, though no official channel for discovering gatherings exist.


Independent channels such as Craigslist or Backpage can be helpful in finding likeminded individuals.
Some social websites exist for finding fellow Satanists, including the Satanic International Networkand The 600 Club.Take care when meeting strangers. Make sure they are official card carrying members of the religion., The biggest holiday for those living as Satanists is the follower’s own birthday. As a self-centered religion, no day is a greater celebration of the self than your birthday. Take it seriously, and throw yourself a tremendous celebration.


Satanists also worship nature, making the changing of seasons, such as the equinox or solstices, a great chance for celebration.
Halloween is celebrated for what it has become. Many Satanists enjoy the idea that, just once a year, the general public is willing to become self-centered.
Christmas is considered a celebration of indulgence after the original Pagan holiday Saturnalia. Thus, despite what Christmas stands for to Christians, Satanists have no issues celebrating this holiday. Buy presents for your friends, drink, and have fun!, If a substance is legal, you may partake in the substance. However, the Church of Satan urges indulgence, not compulsion. Addiction runs against the ideals of the Church of Satan. Survival is among the highest of laws!


Satanists are advised to engage in illegal substances at their own peril. Though independence is important to Satanists, the church does not condone illegal activities."

Love the whole person, flaws and all.,
Drop the fairy tale mentality.,
Keep the passion alive by surprising each other.,
Be willing to put in effort to keep the relationship strong.,
Make sure you're compatible.,
Don't get addicted to the past.,
Don’t depend on a partner for happiness.",How to Live Happily Ever After1," When you make a commitment to someone, you have to be willing to accept their limitations as well as their good qualities. While you might find it irritating that your partner is awkward at parties or doesn’t know how to fry an egg, don’t commit to a relationship expecting these things to change. Maybe they will, maybe they won’t, but if your expectations don’t match reality, you’re likely to end up disappointed.


Trying to change your partner will result in a lot of fighting. You might even end up hurting his or her self esteem.
Realize that love means accepting a person for who he or she is, and getting the same acceptance in return. Instead of focusing on what you wish would change, be grateful you found someone who accepts ‘’your’’ flaws, too.;
, Research shows that people who believe that romantic love resembles the Cinderella story have a harder time facing the reality of relationships.As Eleanor Roosevelt once said, ""Happiness isn't a goal, it's a by-product."" If you expect to find a lover that will fill you with overwhelming ebullience every time you gaze in their eyes, odds are pretty high that you will be disappointed. Talk to your partner about what makes you happy and learn what makes your partner happy as well.


Realize that the Disneyfied version of life is fun to watch in the movies, but it doesn’t bear much resemblance to real life. Real life stretches past the glorious wedding day and into a future filled with stress and hardships to balance out the bliss.
Relationships can feel magical. However, they don't actually operate on magic and serendipity, but on hard work, especially after the first few years.

, That initial flame might die down a little after a few years of washing each other’s dirty dishes, but that doesn’t mean it has to completely go out. Research shows that surprising each other by picking up new hobbies, trying new things together, and just generally embracing newness helps a couple stay interested in one another. When you surprise each other, you get a taste of those butterflies you felt on your first few dates.Having pleasant date night activities is fine, but loses out to activities that are new and different.
Don't despair at the thought that the passion you felt when you first met won't last forever. Many couples find that they appreciate the deepened trust and companionship that's earned only after years of dealing with life's ups and downs as a team more than the excitement of love's first sparks.

, Every couple faces hardships: job loss, the illness and death of family members, the trials of having kids, financial duress. All of these situations can put a lot of stress on a relationship. When your relationship hits hurdles, making an effort to get through them will enable you to emerge stronger than ever. Even if you strongly disagree with your partner, don’t let your underlying love and regard for the person waver.


Research shows that couples who resort to throwing insults during fights end up causing permanent damage to the relationship.Instead, fight in a loving way; argue about the issue at hand, instead of personally attacking your partner’s intelligence or abilities.

, This can be tricky because no relationship is perfect and they all require work, but it is entirely possible that you're in a relationship that would require more work than finding a new partner. It can be hard to take an objective look at something so personal, so use a few objective measures of compatibility:


Faith: It can be extraordinarily difficult to make a relationship work if you don't share the same basic values. This isn't to say that people of divergent faiths can't be happy together, but that they will usually have to work a lot harder at it.
Politics: Our political beliefs are usually an extension of much deeper core values so differences in political beliefs often indicate fundamental differences in the way that we perceive the world.
Social: If one half of the relationship likes to go out every night and the other half would prefer to curl up with a good book, it'll be much harder to find the mutual interests that will sustain your relationship.
Financial: It's said that as many as half of divorces are rooted in arguments that stem from finances. If one half of the relationship is determined to be a multimillionaire while the other would be happy with a modest house and plenty of time to hike, this will likely be a source for conflict later.

, All too often people say things like ""We don't talk like we used to,"" or ""He's just not like the man I married"". In a long relationship, you have to be prepared for your partner to grow and mature. We continue to mature throughout our lives and you can't expect somebody to act the same way they did a decade ago any more than you can realistically expect them to look the same as they did a decade ago. Instead of focusing on the things you did together in the past, examine the people that you've become and focus on the things you will do together in the future.

, Being in a relationship can increase people’s happiness, but it can also be a source of sadness. You can have a happy life as a single person, too. Don’t buy into the idea that the only way to live happily ever after is with a prince or princess, especially if you know deep down that something isn’t right.

Devote yourself to religion.,

Strive to embody your faith in every aspect of your life., Although the basic routine of a monk may be much the same in any order, there are also important differences to consider.


Monks in contemplative orders spend most of their time inside the walls of the monastery praying, while those in active orders leave the monastery to serve others. Some active orders assign monks to work far from a monastery.
In communal orders, the monks spend time with their fellow monks, working, praying and eating together. In eremitic orders, monks are discouraged from interacting with each other and spend most of each day in their cells.
Monastic orders are typically started by important religious figures who devote themselves to maintaining the traditions and working on the causes established by the founder.

, Regardless of the religion or order, nearly every monastic community practices celibacy. Begin walking the path monkhood by taking a personal vow of celibacy. This practice will allow you to gauge if this is a realistic and practical goal for you. Having committed successfully to celibacy will also show the depth of your devotion when you approach a monastery to join., Another aspect of most monastic orders is living in close community with others. This means sharing meals, sharing quarters, and in some cases sharing all worldly belonging with one another. You can begin testing out this lifestyle by joining a communal living situation. Look for community houses in your area with open rooms., Along with living in communion with others, monks across religious orders relinquish their ownership of material possessions. In some cases, monks donate everything they own to the church. You can get a taste of this life and move closer to monkhood but giving away some of what you own and living a simpler life."

Invest in people instead of things.,
Appreciate what you have.,
Don’t hold grudges.,
Surround yourself with people who are happy.,
Make sure your job is working for you.",How to Live Happily Ever After2," Research shows that spending time with loved ones makes people happier than focusing too much energy on acquiring money, power and possessions.When it comes to making big life decisions, consider that arranging your life to be more family-focused may make you feel happier in the long run.


Look for ways to spend more time with friends and family. Schedule it in if you have to so you get in the practice of seeing people more often.
Remember that close friends are just as important as family. If your biological family is dysfunctional or hostile, you can still find happiness by spending time with your best friends.
Giving back to strangers also helps to boost happiness. Find a way to help people each week by volunteering in your community.

, You’ve heard it before, but this is a very important way to increase your happiness. If you're a ""grass is greener"" person, you're hurting your chances at happiness. Think about times when you made the choice to switch jobs or move cities, only to realize that the grass has brown spots no matter where you land. Instead of wishing for something different, focus on loving what you have.


Make a list of things you’re grateful for. Writing it all out can help you realize just how much you have going for you. Post the list in a place where you'll be reminded of the good things in your life every day. If you have trouble finding things to write down, find ways to add more positive elements to your life. Go out of your way to make a new friend, or learn a skill that brings you pleasure. Cultivate the positive and don’t dwell on the negative.

, If you carry anger around with you everywhere you go, realize it’s affecting you much more than it’s affecting the subject of your ire. Even if you have a very good reason to feel angry and bitter, holding a grudge isn't going to make you feel better. If there’s nothing you can change about the situation, let it go, no matter how hard that might be. You’ll be a much happier person for it.


Be a more forgiving and open person.Try to let small things like negative comments roll off your back instead of dwelling on them.
Let go of feelings like envy and jealousy as well. You can’t control other people, but you can control your reactions to situations you face. While the occasional bout of negative feelings is inevitable, keeping them stored up inside you for long periods of time is going to get you down.

, Emotions are infectious. If your friends are dreary and negative, it’s going to be hard to stay happy around them. That’s not to say you should ditch your friends, but it’s important to find people who make you feel light and happy, too.


If there's a person in your life who tends to make you feel bad more often than good, consider having a frank conversation about the problem. If that doesn't work, it's OK to give yourself permission to end the relationship, for the sake of your own health and happiness.

, Not everyone gets to make a living doing what they’re most passionate about, and even those who do have job dissatisfaction sometimes. When it comes to your work, the important thing is that you feel as though you respect your employer, your work is worthwhile and you’re getting adequate credit for your efforts.


Even if it’s not your dream job, you can still be content. Your work, like other areas in your life, is not going to be perfect. Take the negative with the positive and learn what you can live with and what you can’t, and make changes if necessary.
If you’re having trouble finding work that meets your needs, consider seeking career counseling.

Spend time outside.,
Move closer to your job.,
Get better sleep.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Live Happily Ever After3," Studies show that spending time outside, even just 20 minutes a day, increases happiness.The time you spend walking in the park or laying out on the beach is absolutely essential for good mental health, so stop thinking of outside time as a luxury. It's a necessity.


If you’re not used to spending time outside, since you're so busy with other things, make it a priority. Schedule in a walk before or after work or school, or plan to spend the evening outside in the backyard.
Try to find a place to spend time in a natural setting; a city street isn’t going to have the same effect as a park.

, Studies show that people with long commutes are less happy than those who live close to work.The discrepancy is so pronounced that it might be worthwhile to take a job that’s less prestigious and well paying in order to have a shorter trip to work. This is a specific way you can increase your happiness, if you're brave enough to make the leap.


Spending less time commuting gives you more time to do things like hang out with your family, cook a good meal, or go for a walk outside. All of these activities lead to decreased stress and increased happiness.

, When you don’t get adequate sleep at night, you’re more sensitive to negative emotions. A comment you might normally let roll off your back might flare up into a bout of tears or a panic attack. Aim to get seven to eight hours of sleep every night for best results. You'll feel refreshed and better able to tackle whatever issues come your way throughout the day.

, Exercising your body releases endorphins that physically change your mood and make you feel happier. Doing it every day simply increases this effect. If you think you hate exercise, work up to it in small increments. Aim to get 30 minutes to an hour of exercise, even just walking, every day.


Exercise also leads to a boost in self esteem and helps you feel more in touch with your body's capabilities.
Exercise is so effective at increasing happiness that it's an effective treatment for depression."

Visit a monastery.,
Become a novice.,
Become a postulate.,
Take temporary vows.,
Make your final commitment to monastic life.",How to Become a Monk2," If you are interested in becoming a monk, your first step is to visit a monastery. For the most part, monasteries are open to visits from potential devotees. Some will allow you to stay for a few days at a time. On these visits, you will learn about the daily routine at the monastery, as well as what is expected of the monks.Some monasteries offer guesthouse accommodations to outsiders who agree to follow certain rules, such as observing curfews and periods of silence.
You may want to consider a monastic retreat, in which you will take part in the daily routine of the monastery.

, After you have visited a monastery and decided that you’d like to devote yourself to this life, you can express your interest in becoming a novice, and move into the monastery. This is practice, sometimes called an “observership,” is your first step toward becoming a Christian monk. As a novice, you will be taught every aspect of the monkhood. Meanwhile, the monks will observe you to decide if your personality is suitable for monastic life.Depending on the order, there may be more than one level of novicehood.
This process can take up to one year, again depending on the order.

, After you have passed your novicehood, you may be asked to become a postulate, or intended monk. At this stage, you may be given more responsibility at the monastery. Likewise, the expectations set for you will be higher. This stage provides a deeper experience by which you will decide that this vocation is right for you, as well as to prove yourself to the other monks., As a postulate, you will be asked to take “temporary vows,” committing you to the lifestyle and beliefs of monastic life, for as long as you remain within the monastery. These vows will vary depending on the specific order, however they will almost certainly involve a deep devotion to God, a celibate disposition, and the rejection of material belongings., After your time as a postulate, you will eventually be invited to join the monastery for good. You will be ordained as a Christian monk, and you will take permanent monastic vows."

Learn Buddhist teachings.,
Find a teacher.,
Establish a meditation practice.,
Spend time in a monastery.,
Take your life-long vows.,
Stay for five years.",How to Become a Monk3," Before you can approach a teacher with the intention of becoming a monk, you must be quite learned in the Buddhist tradition, well read in Buddhist teachings, and well versed in Buddhist thought. Begin your journey to monkhood by devoting yourself to the study of Buddhism., This step will be difficult if you are not already involved with practicing Buddhists, but in order to become a monk, you will need a teacher who can give you permission to be ordained. Seek out Buddhist temples in your area, or travel to a part of the world where Buddhism is more prevalent. Stay open in your heart and allow it to lead to you the teacher you seek.You may try writing letters or emails to Buddhist teachers in your area and opening a correspondence.

, A crucial component of the Buddhist monastic tradition is a deep and dedicated meditation practice. Some Buddhist orders actually value a strong mediation practice above knowledge of Buddhist teachings. Being able to demonstrate your own practice may be essential to showing that you belong within the monkhood.

, After you have sufficiently educated yourself, and found a teacher to take this education further, you must locate a monastery and spend some time there. If you are good fit, you be welcomed to take your “lay vows,” or the vows of Buddhist devotion and intention made by a lay person. By spending time in a Buddhist monastery, you will be able to make certain that this is the life for you., After spending some time in the monastic community, you may be invited to stay. You will be asked to take the lifelong vows of a Buddhist monk and you will be ordained as such. You will be asked to commit to a celibate lifestyle and relinquish your material goods., When one is ordained to be a Buddhist monk, one traditionally stays with that monastery for five years. Becoming a Buddhist monk means joining a religious community: the Sangha. The purpose of this community is to study and practice the teachings of Buddha, as well as to share them with others. As a Buddhist monk, you will strengthen the bonds of the Sangha over your five (or more) years with that group."

Read, Contemplate, Read, Contemplate, and Read.,
Find out if Gnostic views are for you.,
Spiritual Practice.,
Sacraments.,
Never stop practicing Gnosticism is a constant striving.",How to Become a Gnostic," Although Gnosticism embodies Gnosis which is divine knowledge rather than simple facts, being a Gnostic requires quite a bit of reading. Gnosticism arose in an ancient cultural matrix, involving a different world-view, and a different understanding of the practice of religion. At the bottom of this page there will be links to several excellent sources.;
, Although Gnostic myths are incredibly varied due to the very nature of the tradition, there are some key points that are common. Note, you don't have to accept all of these, but a majority of these represent traditional Gnostic thought, so it's a good idea to use these as a sort of starting point (taken from Stephan A. Hoeller's ""Introduction to Gnosticism""):


There is an original and transcendental spiritual unity from which emanated a vast manifestation of pluralities.
The manifest universe of matter and mind was created not by the original spiritual unity, but by spiritual beings possessing inferior powers.
One of the objectives of these creators is the perpetual separation of humans from the unity (God).
The human being is a composite: the outer aspect is the handiwork of the inferior creatures, while the inner aspect is a fallen spark of the ultimate divine unity.
The sparks of transcendental holiness slumber in their material and mental prison, their self-awareness stupefied by the forces of materiality and the mind.
The slumbering sparks have not been abandoned by the ultimate unity; rather, a constant effort directed toward their awakening and liberation comes forth from this unity.
The awakening of the inmost divine essence in humans comes through salvific knowledge, called ""gnosis"".
Gnosis is not brought about by belief or by the performance of virtuous deeds or by obedience to commandments; these at best serve to prepare one for liberating knowledge.
Among those aiding the slumbering sparks, a particular position of honor and importance belongs to a feminine emanation of the unity, Sophia (Wisdom). She was involved in the creation of the world and ever since has remained the guide of her orphaned human children.
From the earliest times of history, messengers of Light have been sent forth from the ultimate unity for the purpose of advancing gnosis in the souls of humans.
The greatest of these messengers in our historical and geographical matrix was the descended Logos of God manifest in Jesus Christ.
Jesus exercised a twofold ministry: he was a teacher, imparting instruction concerning the way of gnosis; and he was a hierophant, imparting mysteries.
The mysteries imparted by Jesus (which are also known as sacraments) are mighty aids towards gnosis and have been entrusted by him to his apostles and their successors.
Through the spiritual practice of the mysteries (sacraments) and a relentless and uncompromising striving for gnosis, humans can steadily advance toward liberation from all confinement, material and otherwise. The ultimate objective of this process of liberation is the achievement of salvific knowledge and with it, freedom from embodied existence and return to the ultimate unity.

, Amassing facts is not enough, one must also practice to achieve gnosis:


Read Gnostic Scripture Gnostic scripture is a fairly wide category, and includes the Bible, Lost Gospels, Sethian literature, Valentinian literature, Early Syrian Christian literature, Hermetic literature, Mandaean literature, Manichaean literature, Cathar literature, Islamic mystical literature, Jewish mystical literature, and several more.
Pray often Prayer focuses the mind and also calls the attention of the divine unity which can impart grace for gnosis. Regular prayer is as vital for a Gnostic as meditation is for a Buddhist (in fact, meditation can be used in Gnosticism to great effect as well).
Practice and receive the sacraments These will be covered in the next major step.

, Gnostic Christianity often uses the same seven sacraments used in the Orthodoxy, but with different liturgy and different applied meaning. These sacraments are: Baptism, Chrism (Confirmation), Holy Eucharist, Redemption, Bride-Chamber, Extreme Unction, and Healing. Redemption is considered the ultimate form of liberation and should not be undertaken by anyone wishing to incarnate again in a body. Bride-Chamber is a mystery that is usually conferred after death in the spiritual realm, however, it may take on some earthly form at a later time that God ordains. There are two lesser versions of these sacraments, and they may be taken as a form of preparation for these greater sacraments (Redemption and Bride-chamber). These are Penance and Matrimony (marriage). Unlike many churches, most Gnostic Churches allow anyone to partake of the Holy Eucharist. The Eucharist should be received often, and one should receive baptism and chrismation when one feels comfortable to do so. Note: You can contact a nearby Gnostic church for baptism and chrismation without being a member and travel there. These aren't rituals designed to make you a member of a physical church, but rather the body of Gnosis. The Eucharist can be performed solo and there are many ways of practicing it available on various websites and in several books.

, You don't have to be a member of a church, or follow their liturgy to the word. You just have to understand the mysteries, perform them, pray often, and immerse yourself in writings that will assist you on your path to gnosis.

While reading old texts can help you understand where the beliefs come from, you also want to read about how the ancient practices have been adapted for modern times.


Try Eternal Egypt: Ancient Rituals for the Modern World by Richard J. Reidy, Red Land, Black Land by Barbara Mertz, or Temple of the Cosmos: The Ancient Egyptian Experience of the Sacred by Jeremy Naydler.;
, Kemetism involves ritual magic as one of its components; however, it’s not like the magic depicted in movies. You won’t suddenly have powers that you can throw around, and you won’t be making pacts with any evil entities. Instead, it’s more of a spiritual manifestation, like with a miracle.


Ask yourself what magic means to you. Say, “Why is this faith important to me? What do I hope to gain? How does this help my spiritual growth?”

, You can find several websites dedicated to Kemetism, and some even have interactive forums where you can talk to experienced individuals. You can find a lot of information about the modern forms of the religion by looking at websites and blogs. These sites will also provide you a great outlet for discussing your new faith, which might not be available where you live., Some Kemetic temples offer online classes to help you learn about and join the religion. If you like a more organized approach or prefer a traditional path, then that might be right for you. You can find these programs online.Try a site like http://www.netjer.org/.

, If you’re lucky enough to live near a Kemetic shrine or temple, meet with the local priest or a member of the community to talk about the faith and find out if you can attend a service. You may even be able to find a mentor in the community who is willing to share their faith with you.Say, “Hi, I’m interested in being Kemetic. Would it be possible for me to attend a service at your temple?”
Try, “You seem very knowledgeable about your faith. Do you think you would have time to share your experiences with me or answer a few questions?”

, Kemetics look beyond themselves to the needs of the community, so focus your thoughts and goals on achieving what’s best for all. Work to create an unselfish mindset and to be kind to others.


Share your abundance with others.
Wish yourself and others well.
Cooperate with others and work for a common good.
Seek to create positive changes in the community., As part of Kemetism, you will honor the gods and goddesses. Since the Kemetic faith is polytheistic, it features more than one god and goddess, though they all work together. Most Kemetics choose a pair of gods or goddeses to focus on.Reach out to the gods and goddesses. Light a candle and burn some incense, then talk to them. Over time, one or two should emerge as the ones you should choose to honor., Choose a location in your home, such as in a cabinet, on a small table, or on a bookshelf, where you can build a small shrine. Place a statue, icon, or picture of the deity or deities you are honoring in the shrine, as well as an offering plate or bowl. Other items to consider include incense, flowers, herbs, oils, and gems.During your daily practice, add offerings such as bread, water, milk, or rice to the plate or bowl.

, As part of your practice, designate a time every day to perform prayers at your shrine. During this time, communicate with your gods and goddesses. Your daily prayers don’t have to be complicated, but they should be a regular part of your day.Try lighting a candle or incense in your shrine to help you focus on your prayers.
Choose a time of day that will be easy for you most days.

, Family is important in the Kemetic faith, so take steps to improve your family life. Eat meals with your family, speak kindly to the them, and plan time to spend with them. Remember those who have passed on as well, as your ancestors remain part of the family even after death., Kemeticism is about groups rather than individuals. Seeking out a greater community can help you better practice your faith.Bring your communal mindset to your everyday life. Be a good team member at work or school, and try to bring positive things to your community.

, An established group should have a trained priest that is knowledgeable about the ancient practices, which have been well preserved in books and on temple walls. The priest will perform the ancient ceremonies at a community shrine or temple.Use Google to look for temples or shrines in your area.
Try sites like meetup.com or Facebook to look for smaller community groups that may still hold rituals or may travel as a group to a temple in a nearby area.

, Depending on where you live, it may be difficult to locate other Kemetics. If so, try reaching out to online groups and forums to build your community. The internet can quickly connect you to other Kemetics all around the globe., If you can’t find another Kemetic group in your community, reach out to other neopagans to see if they’d be interested in collaborating with you. While your faiths may be different, they will have overlapping features. Having someone to talk to about your faith who is open will at least provide you an outlet to grow spiritually., Because your ancestors have passed on, they are closer to the gods and goddesses than you are, which makes them blessed., Include a photo and/or memento of your ancestors, as well as small gifts like flowers or a candle. If you remember your ancestors, then they live forever.Feature these items on a shelf or on your mantle. You may even designate a wall in your home for photos of your ancestors if you have them.

, In Kemetism, ancestors who are honored look after their descendants from the beyond, so thank them for their blessings. It’s part of the familial bond.As you walk by your ancestor shrine, say, “Thank you for giving me life and always watching out for me.”

Choose a Quaker worship home close to you.,
Write a letter expressing your interest in joining.,
Attend worship services regularly.",How to Be a Quaker2," Seek a Quaker worship center or faith-based community in your area. Be open to suggestions, and feel at liberty to try more than one. Decide whether you want to join a “programmed” Quaker meeting, led by a pastor or a non-pastoral one; one that is group-centered. In the meeting, observe as much as you can about how Quakers pray, meditate and worship.

, State in your letter to the clerk of the Quaker congregation why you made the decision to become a Quaker, as well as what you’re prepared to do to honor the faith. In your letter, ask the clerk about the membership process. Follow up with the clerk after you’ve turned in your letter. Be persistent and friendly, as Quakers are typically reserved, and may not approach you first about your decision to become a Quaker.

, Join in silent waiting during the Quaker worship service by standing in silence with your group of fellow Quakers. Expect that one or more people will feel moved by the Spirit to break the silence and share what they believe has been placed on their heart, or spoken into them. It’s okay not to contribute or feel the need to talk, but do make sure you’re aware and respect the silence.

Get involved in Quaker meetings.,
Sign up for community service.,
Make time for prayer.",How to Be a Quaker3," Participate in once-a-month town hall or business meetings from your Quaker congregation. Start with learning important issues affecting your local Quaker community, including but are not limited to conflicts with human rights, social justice, peace, freedom of conscience and community life. Prepare yourself to voice concerns with fellow Quakers.

, Take on volunteer projects, or mentorship projects that help you to improve your local community. Apply the five core testimonies of being a Quaker; simplicity, integrity, equality, community and peace in your efforts. Focus your volunteer efforts in non-profits for social injustice, education, community involvement and environmental conservations, as these are highly important to the Quaker faith.

, Find a quiet place, either on your own or in a group with Quakers, to pray to God, also known as “the Divine, Light Within, Christ, Spirit, Seed and Inward Teacher”. Listen for the voice of God, and pay attention to anything that is being said. As a Quaker, you will always seek out the “small voice within”. Tip: If you have difficulty starting a conversation with God during prayer, use words and images, or recite a passage from the bible or other spiritual writings to help.

Be kind to others.,
Dress accordingly with Quaker expectations.,
Make God-centered decisions.",How to Be a Quaker4," Practice making others feel valued and respected by “holding a light”. This means giving love, support and prayers to anyone that is sick, struggling spiritually or adjusting to major life changes such as the loss of a loved one, a new move or a new career venture. Be patient with others. Always be truthful, and refrain from judgment.

, Dress and wear clothing that is comfortable, but above all is simple. Steer clear of wearing fancy clothing or flashy jewelry. Be sure not to wear too much make-up, as to look unnatural or disingenuous. Be authentic with the way you look. Opt to wear business casual clothing, at best, when attending Quaker meetings and worship services.

, Seek approval from God in your daily decision-making. Focus on living a life that God and the Quaker community would be pleased with. Pray and meditate before making a life-altering decision, such as when to get married, or whether or not to change careers or relocate. Keep the community up-to-speed with both your personal desires and struggles, as well as anything you feel God has shared with you.

Decide what aspects of your spirituality have not been adequately attended to.,
Get up 20 minutes earlier than your regular time in the morning.,
Break down the time spent on spiritual reflection.,
Begin a faith journal.,
Use prompts to help you throughout the day.,
Include your family in faith time.,
Listen to faith music, messages and talks whenever you have spare moments.",How to Balance Your Spiritual Life with Your Working Life," Perhaps you haven't been going to church, haven't made time for prayer or meditation, or have ceased to read your faith-based tomes. Whatever the source of the lack of spirituality in your life, try to identify it.


Perhaps you feel you've lost intimacy with god or the spiritual form you believe in. It may feel as if the blessings are missing in your life and that success has come at a cost to your inner life.
Listen to your heart, not your head. Is there a lack of spiritual presence, guidance and oneness?
Have you taken time to reflect, pray, think about your faith; or have you set aside time to carry through your faith rituals? Is running to and from your home and job soaking up everything and preventing you from this intimate time with your faith?;
, Use this time for spiritual reflection, prayers, faith reading or simply admiring the wonder of what your life is. This quiet time can be your spiritual haven before the busy routine of the day kicks in.

, For example, perhaps develop a pattern or praying three times a day in short prayers instead of one long prayer that feels as if you're stealing time from work or family. Those three shorter prayers can help sustain you throughout the day and you will feel more focused and happy to pray among your tight schedule. This can also work for meditation, reflection, consideration and reading faith tomes.

, Use this to write down the elements of your faith that resonate with you and bring forth the elements of your faith that guide your life. This might include:


Passages or verses from your faith book or books.
Reflections from authors in the field of your faith, comments and statements they have made that help guide you and make you think.

, Write down promises and guidance emanating from your faith, your god, or your spiritual guide. These can be written both in your journal on small cards which you can carry about in your wallet, bag or purse for instant reminders. You could even download these to your mobile digital devices, allowing you to read them whenever you get break time, allowing you to relax and be reassured by your faith guidance. Reading these at any time throughout the workday will strengthen your faith, especially when you are reminded of the blessings and peace your faith brings you.

, This may be family prayer time, family faith reflection or family faith rituals. This will depend on your faith and the approaches taken to honoring it but there is always room for shared communion and time spent with your loved ones pursuing your shared faith. This is an opportunity for all of you to stop whatever you're doing, pause and reflect and think about the role of spirituality in your lives.


If you live within an inter-faith family or household, this too is fine. Spend time discussing your basic faith tenets together and sharing your thoughts together about spirituality.

, This could be on a CD in your vehicle, on a mobile digital device or through your computer at work or at home. This is a fantastic and very easy way to stay linked to your faith at any time of the day or night.

You probably wouldn't want to be gossiped about. Don't gossip about that person.
If you are feeling a bit sad, you may want to be cheered up. Try to cheer that person up but leave them alone if they want to be left alone. A good joke almost always works to make people laugh and forget about sadness.;
, It is very courteous to make sure that you don't annoy someone. You probably thing it is very fun to annoy people, but nobody said being righteous will be easy, so try your hardest not to annoy people.


If you don't know how you are being annoying, kindly ask the person that is annoyed what it is that is annoying him/her. This will resolve that issue.

, Remember that they will have respect for you. This can be applied in conversation.


Don't cut people off when they are speaking. Don't you hate it when you get cut off by someone and then you forget what you were saying? It is very annoying , and when you follow this step, you are also following the step that says that you shouldn't be annoying.
Try not to get into an argument or fight. That usually leads to anger and hate which makes you and the other person/people sad and angry.

,


You need to inform that person respectfully so that they won't get angry by the way you informed them. Maybe they did it accidentally? If you never inform them you would never know that they did it accidentally and they might not even know that they did something to hurt you.

, Remember that every penny counts. You could save someone's life by giving even a small amount of money.

A great place to take your family would be a national park.

, It will lead to a fight and fights lead to anger and hate.

, It will make you feel that you need something that someone else has.

Try to think of all the things that you have that the other person that you feel jealous of doesn't have. You will probably feel better.
Never brag or boast. That will make people feel jealous of you and then they will be sad that they don't have what you have.

, You will help the environment which will save water. In certain countries, there is a very small amount of water and they need help. Conserving water will save water all over the world meaning there will be more water accessible. Water is what feeds plants and animals. If plants don't get enough water, they will die and that destroys the Food Chain. Certain animals need to eat those plants but instead they'll die because of starvation. Then their predators will starve because they will starve.

, If it is a peaceful argument, it's okay. Be sure not to allow hatred to come in from it., They will hate it especially in school in front of many people. In fact, over 7 percent of High School students attempted suicide as an effect of bullying, and over 14 percent have considered it. If you bully in school you may be the cause of someone's death. "

Consider the First Truth: the Truth of Suffering


""Now what, friends, is the noble truth of stress?,
Consider the Second Truth: the Truth of the Cause of Suffering


""And what, friends, is the noble truth of the origination of stress?,
Consider the Third Truth: The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering


""And what, friends, is the noble truth of the cessation of stress?,
Consider the Fourth Truth : the Truth of the Path to the Cessation of Suffering


""And what, friends, is the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress?",How to Understand the Four Noble Truths," Birth is stressful, aging is stressful, death is stressful; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair are stressful; not getting what is wanted is stressful. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stressful.""
Consider the following ideas and points: It is frequent that people miss the target by handling them without looking deeply at them.

The five clinging aggregates are the five things we collectively use to make up our identity. These are the body, physical feelings, mental fabrications (thoughts and fantasies, feelings, images & cognition etc), perception and consciousness.
In human nature, we value the things we identify with and call our own. No one wants to admit that the things they believe are themselves are stressful. That in itself is a rather important point about how our desires and ignorance plays tricks on the mind. The first question to ask is, does the body get injured, diseased, old, damaged etc? The simple answer is yes, but the more key question is, was this our choice?
The first truth offers pretty basic examples in today's society. With improvements in food, healthcare, technology and education, we live vastly improved and more complex lives from those hundreds if not thousands of years ago. This security can make it more obscure as we have so many avenues of distraction to prevent or ignore unhappiness, despair or other feelings we don't like coming into play.
One of the reasons it seldom makes any break-throughs or obvious changes to our lifestyle and way of thinking is because part of the process is to deeply examine each individual aspect of life and test it. Is it stressful, does it last forever, does give us eternal happiness or satisfaction? Most people never actually ask themselves these questions, preferring simply not to think about it. Some people are lucky enough to float through life, but it does ultimately mean they missed a chance to know themselves.
You can compare it with basic things you know from your personal experience. We may love donuts, but we cannot eat them for long before we are sick of them or become ill because of them. We exist well with moderation. Sometimes like a drug, we need more and more of it for the same result as we desensitize or become tolerant to its effects, so it will never really gives us we we want, or what we need.
The relevance behind the first truth is the scope of ways dis-satisfaction occurs in life. Because everything changes eventually and that nothing lasts forever is that we cannot depend or rely on things and truly call them ""me, mine or what I am"". In the same token they will not give us lasting satisfaction and happiness as the body is biological and so exists in dependence on conditions such as food, air (etc). The same applies to the rest of the aggregates; would we allow ourselves to have unpleasant thoughts, nightmares & feelings, biased and often inaccurate perception and instincts (and so on) if we had the choice? Is it possible for us to exist as we are, moving and experiencing without the impermanent nature of the mind and body?

;
, The craving that makes for further becoming — accompanied by passion & delight, relishing now here & now there — i.e., craving for sensuality, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming""
Consider the following ideas and points: It is just as frequent that people miss the target with the remaining truths by handling them without looking deeply at them.

What the second truth is about here is there are three common formats of desire and cravings and stress arises when we start desiring or becoming attached to things. Proportionate to the amount we are attached to it is proportionate to the amount it hurts when we no longer have it or it becomes something we didn't want.
Craving for sensuality is wanting anything to come to us, to happen, to be etc, such as love, money, fame or power, pleasant feelings, good health etc. Craving for further becoming is wanting our life to be so that things will continue, that we will have an eternal life or afterlife, that there will be life security, quality and meaning. Craving for non-becoming finally is wanting things to go away from us, for annihilation, for things to not happen, to not exist such as poverty, pain, illness, death, other people, our work problems etc. People who desire pleasant things tend to go for the first, people who are not very knowledgeable or aware of what is going on tend to go for the second and those who have been embittered by experiencing much unhappiness tend towards the third.
Consider according to your own experiences. When there is the desire for things to be other than what they are, but when we cannot make them be so is there stress, disappointment and dis-satisfaction?. It is inevitable as our willpower, desires and attachments are impotent against change. For those who hold onto their preferences, possessions, dreams and fantasies etc, forms the attachment that makes the stress come back over and over. Wanting the problem to go away is still wanting, so it too does not let go of stress.
By not knowing the facts of life generally as well as what happens in our minds is ignorance, which to the Buddha was the key problem. This is rather complex because if you don't know the what, why or how things are as they are, it can cause stress as we cannot explain them. But also if they want them to be something else; as they want things to be, then that too is ignorance as the person does not always realise what they have just done - fallen into the trap yet again.
Often we are quick to accept an alternative hypothesis that can prevent us looking at the world as it is, if it offers us hope or something better than we now have, a more sunny outlook, or just a way to prevent us having to see things as they are. But when our preferred concepts of reality don't align to what is actually going on, then this also causes problems as they are not compatible. This leads the first truth to the second truth - the capacity and chances of dis-satisfaction and stress in life is unavoidable and because we aren't prepared to accept it is so, we start wishing things are different and attached to ideas and promises. As our desires, mental and physical powers cannot make them be exactly what we want, they are the foundation of all unhappiness. This leads onto the third.



, The remainder-less fading & cessation, renunciation, relinquishment, release, & letting go of that very craving.""
Again consider the following ideas and points: It is frequent that people miss the target with the remaining truths by handling them without looking deeply at them.

The third truth is quite literal and interesting as it simply flips the original problem over. With cravings for things we cannot get and clinging to things we cannot keep brings us unhappiness, when we let go of the same wanting and clinging, we let go of the problem as it can't survive on its own.
This however is not as straightforward as it always bounces back to ignorance as a central problem. If we don't know what's going on in our minds at the time, how do we know when a problem is there, or that we are indulging in fantasies either positive or negative - how do we know we've fallen into the trap once again? Mindfulness is the solution and that takes practice. There are also times that certain deeper parts of the mind seem attached to the things you may have independently decided you didn't want to get involved in, such as depression, anger, arguments with people etc. By practicing mindfulness you can separate these factors out and see when the mind is attaching itself without your consent.
Letting go of the things that you know will cause you harm is the obvious beginning, however the longer term practice only really gives results when you have seen enough to recognise instantly when your mind has walked into a trap, even to knowing what the traps are so you can avoid them in the first place.
This is also one that can be tested by personal experience. Consider times when you have let something go, or when circumstances changed and that you no longer worry about an issue and so felt like you have put down a heavy burden.
Overall, it is unavoidable that you have to see your mind for yourself, which is why so much emphasis is placed on meditation. By meditating, you can see all the things happening, coming and going and how we act and react. By seeing this change in action is the way to become familiar and dis-enchanted with the things that cause stress. Dis-enchantment is the most effective tool for pulling the mind back into line when it starts diving into anger, depression (etc), because you no longer have an inclination to experience those emotions and the emotional hangover. By focusing more and more, by looking deeper is how you see the more subtle ways the mind is often hoodwinked, or sinking into an indulgence.
The third truth is a practical one so a person needs to test it in their own way to see if it can actually be done. When we start small, letting go is much easier as we become familiar with doing it as we are no longer surprised at the way the mind works and no longer attached to the things that cause problems. Once seen as it really is, ignorance of the facts are destroyed - there are no more mysteries. A simple analogy is when you go to a course to learn how to make bread and learn how the yeast and gluten works, then bread is no longer a mystery as you know what it is, how its made and what the yeast needs to be able to work.
Consequently, one of the places where most people fall short is because its really much easier to make up a story, or to pin our hopes on an idea to explain these problems away so we don't have to deal with them. Quite often they are parallel experiences as a person no longer worries about an issue when they install unquestioning faith in a concept. They then feel happy and free and no longer desire or cling to alternative ideas if it answers enough questions. But if ever the thing that a person puts faith in is something that is contradicted by the way the world is, then they will face problem after problem.
Another aspect where people often fall short of the goal is simply thinking they have done enough by dealing with the worst of the issues. Ultimately its about letting go of the more subtle issues and problematic feelings that cause other problems as well. Learning to recognize this when it happens is an important step as this one of the many manipulations created by the mind that has been running wild for so long.



, Just this very noble eightfold path: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration""
Just like the previous 3 truths, most people miss the target by handling them without looking deeply at them. In this case it applies but it also is when a person does not practice them effectively.


Free Your Mind as an article explores how to use the eightfold path a little more in depth. The Eightfold path encourages you to learn the facts as facts but gives you tools and means to do so. It also helps you train your mind into the habit of recognizing stress and then letting it go, until it becomes automatic.
It is important to remember however the knowledge does not make all problems go away, as the body is still the body, the mind is still the mind, the difference now is you know there are no real excuses left and that the stress and unhappiness we experience is caused by the mind.
Occasionally people who study the eightfold path still don't get any insight or understanding but this is largely because of how the path is followed. Consider this analogy: A cake is made of flour, eggs, sugar, butter and milk. Too much milk and you end up with pancake batter, too little sugar and it is tasteless, too little butter and it is dry, too many eggs and it makes a quiche. If you mix the ingredients in the wrong proportion and in the wrong way it doesn't give as good a result as it could do. Its all about getting the recipe right and in balance to make a good cake. So it is with the noble eightfold path as it needs to be in proportion to get results, by developing virtue, the mind and wisdom and studying the results you can adjust the path for the best result.

Learn the process of dependent origination, be it from a Sutta / Sutra or from a Buddhist commentary.,
Ask yourself questions about each stage and look at each stage independently and collectively.,
Next, examine the four noble truths.",How to Understand Dependent Origination," Once you have read through it, start to look at each levels cause on its own and how it connects with the next.


1. First cause: Ignorance. Ignorance of the four noble truths centrally - This drives the whole thing, plus ignorance of greed, hatred etc as a stressful process, ignorance of change, emptiness & stress and lack of awareness or mindfulness so you are ignorant of what you are doing and feeling now.
2. From ignorance come formations / fabrications. These are Mental fabrications - thoughts, intentions, ideas etc, Verbal fabrication - logically this one is speech and Physical fabrications - actions etc.
3. Dependent on these formations, comes consciousness. This one sounds tricky and it is, central to this is that consciousness is not singular (as in a single entity) but many processes occurring simultaneously. Mindfulness of mental states is very useful to practice to examine this topic.
4. Dependent on consciousness comes mind & matter, also known as mentality & materiality. Mentality is pretty straightforward, but materiality refers not just to the body, but all solids, liquids, temperature & movement/cohesion (etc). Physical things generally. So what does this mean? It actually follows right on from the last one - if there was no awareness of mind and matter etc, would we be aware of anything at all?
5. Dependent of mind and matter comes the sixfold base which is basically the six senses: nose, tongue, ears, eyes, body/touch and intellect.
6. Dependent on the senses comes contact. This one fortunately is straightforward, with the senses and the existence of mind and matter you get contact between three things - ears (1) with sounds (2) and the mental process that perceives and interprets sounds (3), then tongue with tastes etc.
7. Dependent on contact comes feeling. After there is contact you get feelings - these are pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. Think about this: If part of these three is disabled, i.e., the sense of touch anesthetized so you feel nothing, then there is no feeling even if there is contact. Its still dependent on the senses and the mind working.
8. Dependent on feeling, comes craving: with pleasant feelings, we typically crave more of them & that they stay. For unpleasant ones, we crave for less of them or that they go away and for Neutral - we crave they were more pleasant.
9. Dependent on craving comes clinging or attachment. This is often broken down into 4 things: Clinging to pleasant things & feelings, clinging to beliefs or ideas, clinging to techniques, rituals, practices, culture etc & clinging to the idea of me, mine, self, soul etc.
10. Dependent on clinging comes becoming. This is often the trickiest part - becoming of what essentially? It refers to the becoming or the start of a chain of cause and effect.
11. From becoming comes birth. Here it is often easiest to look at the cause and effect part. In Buddhist theory, the whole thing drives in re-birth, because the cause and effect chain doesn't die when you do - the world goes on essentially, but at the same time, so does the balance of kamma / karma. The flow of causes make an effect of being reborn according to the nature of the cause and effects (good, bad or neutral).;
,



Understand cause and effect. This is very important here, because this is how you can see the connection between these two and how it can cause stress.
An example of what to think about: If there was no consciousness or cause to have consciousness, would we be anything but a lump of flesh & bone? There would be no process activity that makes the heart beat etc, so the mind and body is conditional on many things and does not exist independently.
Likewise you can't have feelings about a place you have never been to unless you have seen, heard etc about it or been there, so feelings are conditional too.
If you have no bodily or mental processes, you wouldn't be alive or able to stay alive by eating, breathing etc. If you aren't alive, how can you have senses? If you didn't have a nose to sense with, how could you smell? All these things exist dependent on conditions.
Consider that our parents are a result of cause and effect, likewise their meeting, having children, etc. This is not fate because fate is predetermined, this is anything but that as there is change. If there was no cause for our parents or grandparents to meet etc, or decide not to (or by another cause were unable to) have children we wouldn't be here as an effect.
There isn't total randomness happening here, but neither is there predetermination if we can make choices and are subject to cause and effect.
Consider that from being born, naturally comes aging & death and the things that are dependent on life. Use this to evaluate if all these processes etc is actually a good thing. Is repeated cause and effect stressful or liberating?

, These are central to the whole chain - it makes the whole thing click together as the craving being the cause of stress and features right at the beginning of the chain - ignorance of craving and what it does. It is by not understanding the craving and desires that cause stress, or being aware of them that people blunder on craving more things and creating more and more chains.


Break the whole chain. By not craving or clinging to mind and matter, the cycle process stops here in terms of birth and rebirth.

Learn the five core beliefs: An essential aspect of Jainism is the ascetic lifestyle.,
Perform the six essential duties prescribed for a śrāvaka (householder).,
Know about Jain holy books and monks: The Jain holy books are called 'Jinvani' and has everything about Jainism in it.,
Chant the mantras and do pujas: In Jainism, the most important mantra is 'Navkar' or 'Namokar' mantra.,
Visit temples and holy places.,
Follow some rules of remaining pure.",How to Be a Jain," Jainism /ˈdʒeɪnɪzᵊm/, traditionally known as Jaina dharma, is an Indian religion that prescribes a path of non-violence towards all living beings and emphasises spiritual independence and equality between all forms of life. The essence of Jainism is concern for the welfare of every being in the universe. Practitioners believe that non-violence and self-control are the means by which they can obtain liberation. Currently, Jainism is divided into two major sects - Digambara and Śvetambara. The word Jainism is derived from a Sanskrit verb Jin which means to conquer. It refers to a battle with the passions and bodily pleasures that the Jaina ascetics undertake. Those who win this battle are termed as Jina (conqueror). The term Jaina is thus used to refer to laymen and ascetics of this tradition alike.;
, Monks and nuns undertake the ascetic life full-time and take the ""Five Great Vows"":



Non-violence (Ahimsa) . You can do this by practicing non-violence for every being, including an animal, person or even an ant. They all have soul, and karma to go along with it. To kill that being takes away its chances to rid itself of its karma. Therefore, Jains practice vegetarianism. They do not eat Meat/Seafood/Eggs e.g. chicken, cows, sheep, steak, fish or any food that comes from killing a living being. They don't even eat honey or wear clothes made out of animal skin. It may be hard to follow this if you have eaten meat all your life, but you can take baby steps and start with first, discontinuing seafood. A week later meat then chicken and so on. Jains also do not eat root vegetables (garlic, onions, potatoes, carrots etc) as they kill the entire plant and lots of other lives in the form of micro-organisms on these vegetables. The belief of non-violence should not be only for animals, but it should be extended towards humans as well. Please watch your words. It is said that a wound can heal itself but harsh words are rarely forgotten and can hurt far worse.

Truth (Satya). No matter what, always say the truth also keep in mind that if that truth is going to hurt someone, then remain silent.

Non-stealing (Asteya). If it's not yours, don't take it. Simple as that. Resist temptation.

Celibacy (Brahmacharya). Abstinence from sex. You can contribute to this by at least avoiding masturbation and having non-marital sex. Also avoid drinking alcohol or smoking.

Non-possessiveness (Aparigraha). Try to restrict the objects you need to live. By doing so you will reduce the dependency on those objects and gradually reduce the need to use them for your survival.

, These help one in achieving the principle of ahimsa which is necessary for his/her spiritual upliftment. The six duties are:

Worship of Pañca-Parameṣṭhi (five supreme beings)
Following the preachings of Jain saints.
Study of Jain scriptures

Samayik (Meditation)-Meditation in Jainism aims at realizing the self, attain salvation, take the soul to complete freedom. It aims to reach and to remain in the pure state of soul which is believed to be pure conscious, beyond any attachment or aversion. The practitioner strives to be just a knower-seer.






Following discipline in their daily engagement
Charity (dāna) of four kinds:


Ahara-dāna- donation of food

Ausadha-dāna- donation of medicine

Jnana-dāna- donation of knowledge

Abhaya-dāna- saving the life of a living being or giving of protection to someone under threat



, Remember that this is the oldest religion on Earth, therefore none of it is just wrong. Even what the scientists are finding now was written in these books years ago. Talking about the Jain monks, they are called 'Sadhus' and are really great religion followers. While Svetambara Sadhus wear a single white cotton cloth, Digambara sadhus don't wear anything. They remain barefoot and have no relations with their past families.They don't live in a house and can't take any means of transport.They eat only once in a day, and even this is only if a Jain person invites them at home.

, Jain people follow an exact way of offering different things known as puja. They also offer pure water along with many other pure liquids simultaneously when chanting mantras. These are known as 'Abhishek.'

, You can look for all these places on the wikipedia. But the most important holy place is the 'Shikharji'. This is a very sacred place and any jain will go over there, irrespective of being digambara or svetambara. Moreover, visiting there relaxes minds. Shikharji is a huge mountain and you have to climb up barefoot.

, This is for the girls and women who have their menstrual cycle. During this period, the girls should not touch anyone nor touch any place that is related to god or anything made out of cloth or fabric. Even not going into the kitchen. If someone touches you, that person has to immediately go and have bathe. This should be at least for 3 days, but going in front of god is only once you become clean.

Decide what kind of temple-stay you would like to make.,
If you would like to stay in the temple for spiritual reasons, a different approach is necessary.,
Sometimes temples take a more informal approach to retreats, whereby lay practitioners may stay at the temple at any time and follow the temple schedule and keep certain precepts.,
Ask what you will need/be allowed to bring, and about any specific temple rules.

",How to Stay in a Buddhist Temple," Are you a traveller, simply after basic board and a vegetarian breakfast? Many temples offer very simple accommodation commercially, especially in Japan. These may be found through lists of accommodation, by contacting the temple, or by word of mouth. They will normally charge a small fee.;
, Many temples regularly hold 'retreats', which may last anywhere from a day to several years. They may be free (with optional donation), or a price may be charged, depending on the type of lay support the temple receives. It is best to ask a temple administrator or resident teacher about these. Some retreats can be very intensive.

, Again, ask the appropriate party at the temple.

Find a place for it.,
Place an image of Buddha.,
Have a Buddhist scripture.,
Make Offerings.,
Place the Offerings on the Shrine.",How to Set up a Tibetan Buddhist Shrine," The best place to put the shrine is in a separate room, but if you live in a small house and cannot set aside a separate room, any room will do. The size of the shrine is not important, but it should be in a clean and respectful and higher than the level of your head as you sit facing it. If you put it in your bedroom, it should be placed near the head of your bed, never at the foot, and it should be higher than the bed. The shrine should be placed on a separate table and not be doubled as a coffee table or night-stand.;
, The first object that should be placed on the shrine is an image of Shakyamuni Buddha. You can place images of other Buddhas or Bodhisattvas on the shrine as well but Shakyamuni Buddha should be the central figure. These should be on the top level of the shrine.

, On the next level there should be a Buddhist scripture, representing the speech of the Buddha and there should be a Stupa of Enlightenment (chorten in Tibetan), which represents the mind of the Buddha. You do not have to have a gold stupa, a picture or clay model is perfectly acceptable.

,


All offerings made should be on the level under the Stupa and the Scripture.
In the Tibetan Buddhist Tradition it is custom to offer seven bowls of water, which represent the seven limbs of prayer.
Flowers, candles or butter lamps, and incense are also commonly offered. It is customary to offer a part of every meal on the shrine before eating and a portion of tea before drinking. The things that should be offered should be clean, new and pleasing. . . . only the best part, fresh, and clean -- never old, leftover, or spoiled food.

,


To offer water on your shrine, you should have a minimum of seven bowls. Start with fresh water every day. The bowls should be clean. Pour a little water into each bowl before placing it on the shrine. Place the bowls in a straight line, close together but not touching.
Try not to breathe on the offerings. If you have a butter lamp, you can place it on your shrine between the third and fourth water bowls. Lamps or candles symbolize wisdom, eliminating the darkness of ignorance. In Tibetan monasteries hundreds of lamps are lit as offerings. There is really no limit to the quantity of either water bowls or lamps.
It is also custom to have eight offerings with the bowls of water. They are as follows:

Water to Cleanse the Mouth or Face - This Represents Auspiciousness
Water to Wash the Feet - This Represents Purification (You do not need to add extra water. What is in the seven bowls is enough.)
Flowers - This Represents Generosity
Incense - This Represents Discipline, Moral Ethics
Light - This Represents Patience
Fragrance - This Represents Perseverance (This can be Sandalwood or Saffron)
Delicious Food - This Represents Samadhi (Concentration)
Musical Instruments - Tis Represents Wisdom (You can use guitars, lutes, cymbals, singing bowls, etc.)


After pouring the water, lighting the candles and offering incense, bless the offerings by dipping a piece of kusha grass (or a tree twig) into the water, reciting three times OM AH HUM, and then sprinkling the offerings with water. Visualize that the offerings are blessed.
It is excellent to dedicate the merit of making offerings to the elimination of suffering and its causes from all beings, to their achievement of lasting happiness, and to world peace.
At the end of the day, before or at sunset, empty the bowls one by one, dry them with a clean cloth and stack them upside down or put them away. Never leave empty bowls right side up on the shrine. The water is not simply thrown away but offered to the plants in your house or in the garden.

Food and flowers should also be put in a clean place outside where birds and animals can eat them. Bowls of fruit can be left on the shrine for a few days and can then be eaten when they come down -- there is no need to put them outside.

Hold the rings properly.,
As you recite, move the first ring with the tip of your thumb, one bead at a time.,
After a complete circle of the first ring, move onto the next groove on the second ring and continue reciting.,
After all six beads have been raised you will have completed 30,000 recitations.

Apologize.,
Write down your transgressions.,
Reflect or meditate.,
Be charitable.",How to Reverse Bad Karma1," If you know you have done something wrong, or offended someone, you should directly apologize. Be sincere about your mistakes and what you have learned from them. This will help put you on the right track for good karma. Try some of the following conversations:


”I am very sorry about what I said about your cooking last week; I did not mean to hurt your feelings. Please forgive me.”
”I am sorry for not calling you last week. Why don’t we get coffee on Friday?”
”You were right to be angry about my actions. I will try not to do that again.”
”I didn’t mean what I said last week. I’m sorry I was in such a bad mood. Can you forgive me?”;
, If you feel you have bad karma but are not sure of the direct reasons, a good place to start is to write down what you feel you have done wrong. Think about a specific time in the past, like a day or a week, and list out what you’ve done that may have given you negative karma. This will give you a good starting point on how you can repair your negative karma. Think about:


Did you offend someone by your words?
Did you offend someone by your actions?
Did you neglect or forget to do something you were supposed to?
Did you lie or cheat about something?
Did you break a set rule or law?
Have you been selfish or neglectful?

, You may know what you have done to receive bad karma. However, you must also understand why your actions negatively impacted you and those around you. To do this, you can meditate or reflect on your actions.There are different meditation techniques:


Breathing meditations -- This type of meditation focuses on controlling your breathing.This will calm your mind and promote inner peace. In a quiet place, sit in a comfortable position. Partially close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Become aware of the sensation of breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. Practice this movement until your mind starts to clear and you begin to relax.
Transforming meditations -- This type of meditation is designed to bring peacefulness to your mind by training your body not to worry about mental or physical discomforts. This type of meditation is done by studying and considering the philosophy that drives your morality. You can do this by: reading the works of your religions or religious figures, reading the works of philosophers, or studying science and the construction of the universe.
Loving kindness meditations -- This type of meditation is practiced in four steps: preparation, contemplation, meditation, and dedication. The first step requires you to prepare for meditation by sitting in a comfortable position and breathe deeply. The contemplation stage requires you to think about how all life should be cherished and that happiness comes from your kind actions. Meditation allows you to come up with concrete ways to practice kind actions such as: “I will cherish each day that I am given” or “I will be kinder to myself and others.” Dedication is living up to those promises made in the meditation stage., Mahatma Gandhi famously said: “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.” You can reverse bad karma by practicing positive actions. This may include:


Donating your time to a cause that you believe in (i.e. volunteering at an animal shelter or a soup kitchen)
Giving money to a cause you believe in (i.e. American Diabetes Foundation)
Giving more compliments
Doing kind favors for someone (i.e. Making a dinner for a loved one or doing home repairs for an elderly neighbors.)

"
Consider these basic analogies against your own experiences:


If you disturb the surface of the water in a small vessel it will ripple out and then return back once to the center once it has reached and rebounded against the extremities of the container.,
Consider the implications that an effect can become a cause for a future event.,
Consider the possible implications if you let go of the resulting effect and let it end there.,
Consider how this affects the way human society has been influenced by the cause and effect matrix.,
Consider this analogy if it may help make more sense.,
Understand the process by examining things as they happen and stepping back, so you can see it from a slightly different angle than normal.",How to Understand Cause and Effect (Karma)," The return or effects might be very quick, or it might take a long time. This is why effects happens years or decades after its cause.
Hatred does not end with hatred (or) an eye for an eye and the whole world turns blind.
The relevance behind these old quotes is because that if you continue to hate, or similarly be greedy or ignorant, this energy returns in a variety of different forms. Sometimes as is natural in human nature that other people may return this feeling to you, or it may occur as stress or illness and other such events, or the energy exerted by being angry or bearing grudges can change the shape and functionality of the brain. This means consequently neural pathways change to be more inclined to act or react with the same emotion in future, making it harder for a person to not fall into it and avoid more problems. It doesn't always happen immediately so we cannot always match up the responses to our action over long periods. So the best practical philosophy is hatred shouldn't be met with hatred, because it will just come back again and again. It could be balanced with tolerance or shrugging it off, or modified with goodwill.;
, It may seem logical on one hand, but sometimes it can be considered that after a simple cause and effect process, it ends there after the effect. But this is not the case in evidence as the effect can make a new result depending on the nature of interaction.


A simple example to compare against your own experiences: Once you might have been rude to someone and years later the result comes back to you. You might respond with aggression which has become a new cause for a future negative effect. The chain of events continues...

In a more logical context, if we respond to force (primary) with force (secondary), then the secondary force is a new action which will have a reaction of a new chain of events. But the primary force we experienced may had been a secondary type bouncing back from an earlier event and not truly a primary type after all. Because we handle some events ignorantly by responding with an unbeneficial response, such as anger or hatred, or desire for revenge & compensation, then the effect goes on. This often starts a search for the primary cause, which always seems to be ignorance of the facts of life and ignorance of what is actually happening in the mind at the time.

, Then you have eliminated a future effect from this chain as it’s now dead and defunct. If you had responded from a bad result with a new good action (such as tolerance), then a future good result comes, even if it may take decades.


There have been many thousands of chains of events in action in the past that resolved themselves or are either still reaching into the present and future or have since branched out creating new chains.

, To use common words, good things happen to bad people because they had good effects from the past coming into action now, but the results of all their present harmful actions will affect their future. The reverse also applies why unhappy things happening to good people because somewhere in the chain they had acted in ways that produced their future experiences.


The more good things gives a good future, but any bad actions will still come into play anyway. Bad effects, bad actions and more bad reactions will give a consistently bad future.

, If you have a small glass of water and pour a handful of salt into it, you can taste the salt easily. But put the same amount of salt into a swimming pool worth of water and the unpleasant taste is much harder to detect. Your actions can make the amount of water a lake, or a droplet worth. For some people, they have mountains of salt to go through as a result of old causes, their future is not too hard to predict.


The relevance is that the negative effect can be tempered with a surplus of positive effects to make it seem more mild, but the energy can still respond in its original strength if its not able to be tempered. Just like how salt is dense and can form pools of denser saltier water and less saltier water elsewhere, even in the same container, it still has the same effect. As cause and effects shape our habits and responses as well as how we think, feel, our health (etc) in the past, present and future – this makes the situation very complex to see through.
Action & intention are the cause as our thoughts & intention precede the action. We might do good things out of selfish intention, which does give either watered down good effects, or watered down negative results but still gives a result. Likewise bad things out of good intent. This can sometimes be observed in normal human environments such as when we spend time helping someone, but with the expectation of getting help back. The expectation is based in greed which creates bad effects, or reduces the good effects one might experience later.

, This serves to get an invaluable insight. Eventually you've seen the habit happen so often you can step in and stop that habit before harm is done. ""A stitch in time"" is a good metaphor to remember for this reason. It might take a little time, especially at the beginning but practice really does make perfect. After that, you become so familiar with the nature of the mind, you no longer feel stressed when problems or harmful feelings and thoughts arises at all as its just something else you can let go of.


While frequently told its still a good analogy to consider the lotus. It grows in mud and dirty water, but rises above it all to stand free. Its ultimately all up to you to stop the ways that will create bad effects, but the only way out is to see it, understand it and let it go, without responding with anger or other harmful feelings, but with understanding you can prevent future cause and effect chains or create good ones to make a more happier present and future.

Break the routine.,
Stay positive.,
Take responsibility for your own actions.",How to Reverse Bad Karma2," If you have identified the actions that have led you to bad karma, realize it is time for you to change your actions.


If you find yourself being negative toward a specific person or people, resolve to start a conversation with a compliment next time. Develop this as a new positive habit.
If you find yourself being selfish, resolve to do a charitable action each day even if it is a small one. Try something small like holding a door open for someone. Practice this to develop a new routine of positive actions.

, Life is difficult and frustrating events happen. Thinking positive may not reverse bad events, but it can help you better cope with stress in your life. Try and reflect on the positive things in life to help you reverse bad karma by seeing the good and kindness in life.


Take a moment to enjoy the weather. If the weather is nice, reflect that not everyday will be like this.
Give thanks to your good health.
Enjoy a meal. Sometimes we eat without thinking; take a few moments to savor a well-prepared dish.

, As “karma” means action, you must be accountable for the actions that you take. Try to:


Stop blaming others. This is a bad habit. Really consider the action and try and move on from it. Blaming others only slows down this process.
Practice self-focusing. Worrying about the future will not help you in the present. Focus on the daily tasks that you can control to live a more positive life.
Be accountable. You are the only one responsible for your actions. If, for example, you are in an argument with a loved one, you can control how you respond. Focus on how you respond.

"
"
Be mindful.,
Be kind.,
Practice chanting a mantra.",How to Reverse Bad Karma3," Buddha writes: “Mind precedes all mental states.”This means that you must reflect on your own actions and how they affect other actions around you. Like practicing self-focusing, you should be mindful of your actions and decisions. They reflect on how others respond to you.

, There is an old adage of: “treat others like you want to be treated.” This golden rule can help to reverse bad karma by promoting goodness and kindness. Give compliments to people such as: “What you said about was really intelligent.” or “This dinner is really good. Thanks for cooking for me!”

, Language can be a powerful tool. To create a positive mindset, you can practice a chant or mantra.

Try practicing a self-affirmation in front of a mirror on a daily basis. You can say something like: “I will be a more positive person today” or “I will complain less about my problems.” This will help build up your self-confidence and develop a positive routine.
Chant a mantra related to your spiritualism. For example, Catholicism repeats words on a rosary. Nianfo is an Eastern Asian Buddhist act. Whatever your religion or spirituality is, find if there is a chant or mantra that you can use to feel closer to your faith."
"
Start by examining change which is referred to in Buddhism as ""anicca"".,
The second topic to consider is the subject of emptiness also known as ""anatta"".,
Move on to consider stress as the final of the three, often referred to as ""dukkha"".,
Regularly consider these three characteristics by measuring them next to your personal experiences.","How to Understand Change, Emptiness and Stress"," Change is often called impermanence which is the basic premise that covers two different aspects:
1. That not only everything changes and that those changes also have an effect, but it is the cause and effect behind physics and sciences. Use your own experiences and environment as a way to examine this concept. You can see it everywhere in the real world - changing weather, seasons, growth in plants and animals, erosion and wear in things around us, but most importantly within us. In such a short time things may seem the same but are different, similar to the analogy of being unable to cross the same river twice as it is dynamic and constantly changing. Another one to consider is that Rome wasn't built in a day, like many things have changed over a long period of time to become as we see it today.
2. Nothing lasts forever, this applies to all of our experiences so while pleasant experiences are fun they don't last, but the same applies to unhappy experiences. Things change and we can recover from unhappy times and ultimately train ourselves not to become unhappy or indulge in the the things that cause us to be unhappy.
The relevance is not only expanding your mind to consider that when things go out of our awareness, does not mean they have ceased to exist - like the cars on the road, when they take an exit and you can't see them anymore, they are still moving towards their own destination. But it is also about questioning why we mourn over things lost and become angry or unhappy when things change, when this change or loss was always going to come eventually. Eventually the mind recognizes the changing nature of time and the consumptive nature of decay and so does not become attached to things which allows us to let go of the things that make us unhappy.;
, This is a continuation of the first premise of impermanence, using the logic that because all things change against our will, our desires and plans are effectively impotent. If there is nothing that we can shape, direct, control or have forever asks the question what is there that is really ours or us? Ultimately it is recognizing that what we are as an identity is a collection of individual and impermanent processes, without a soul, self, entity or being - eternal or otherwise. It is often referred to as all things being void.


The premise is made because we change and this change is not always invited or always pleasant and it happens without our consent. We cannot prevent aging, getting injured or ill, or ultimately losing the people we love. When we can neither prevent, intervene or modify the change, the simple question comes as how can we claim ownership or ""me, mine, what I am"" etc in anything? Even when you get down further, we are all made of atoms and atoms not only can be divided until there is nothing but raw dynamic energy. This energy as well is without owner or entity as we notice it being used as electricity and other forms of energy such as kinetic energy and other types within physics.
We as human beings are an excellent source for study here when you break down the body into its components - arm, leg, intestines, brain etc or the physical nature like the parts that are solid or liquid, hot or cold and moving or being moved. Really any mental or physical actions that aren't pleasant by nature. There is virtually no one who has not felt empty which should not be possible.
The relevance is that when change afflicts us, the same question arises about the benefit of mourning over things lost and become angry or unhappy when things change, when this change or loss was always going to come eventually, but now adding in that because they are not ours or ever was ours why do we again feel anger, sorrow, despair and dissatisfaction with life? Because they were not ours, it is simply their nature and inevitable that they would change. A simple analogy is to consider the world we have changed so much, but as we are here such a short time, was it ever ours in the first place? Once there is understanding that nothing was ever ours except our inheritance as karma or properly speaking, more cause and effect.

, This premise also follows on from change and non-self or voidness. When things change without our consent, when they aren't truly ours, what is there that is secure and safe? All things in Buddhism are ultimately dubbed as non-dependable and unreliable are therefore stressful on a very subtle level. The happy events and the things that touch our hearts exist for so short a time, yet the unpleasant things are an unavoidable factor of life. The amount of unhappiness something may cause us is directly proportionate to how attached we are to them and how much we want them to be as we want them.


The relevance is all about accepting things are as they are. It can sound a frightening, pessimist and unhappy viewpoint, perhaps even irresponsible, but the moment you flip that perception over, you can see that is liberating and an endless source of happiness that things are as they are. Its all physics, biology etc at work in the real world. Because they are as they are and ultimately no one that we can plead to or blame, it becomes easier to let them go as becoming attached to them or claiming them as ours suddenly seems nonsensical. We can be happy with things as they are and not be upset when they change, because it was unavoidable, so it offers a solution and tools to improve our well-being.

, Eventually your mind starts to become more tolerant and happy with things as they are, but also more inclined to letting go of the things that can make us unhappy.

While it's highly encouraged to start earlier to get used to fasting, you should begin by the time you hit puberty.The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: “The pens have been lifted from three: from one who has lost his mind until he comes back to his senses, from one who is sleeping until he wakes up, and from a child until he reaches the age of adolescence.” If you don't know if you're ready to fast yet or think it's still too early, talk to your parents about it. They'll discuss whether you're physically capable to fast yet.;
, Before you begin fasting in Ramadan, be sure to discuss whether you'll be fasting this year. This is especially important if you have health problems. Lack of food and water for several hours can be extremely dangerous for some teens, causing dehydration, severe starvation, and fainting spells.If you're not physically capable of fasting yet, you should not fast for your own well-being.


Your parents will let you know if they think you're healthy enough to fast for the month of Ramadan. If needed, talk to a doctor about fasting before attempting to do so, especially if you've had health problems in the past that involved lack of food and water.

, In the Quran, Islam's holy book, it's been ordered for all Muslims to fast during the month of Ramadan. Allah says, ""O you who believe, fasting has been prescribed for you as it has been prescribed to those before you in order that you may attain Taqwa "" .Fasting brings us closer to Allah and reminds us of those who are less fortunate than us. It also helps us practice self-restraint.Fasting is also one of the five pillars of Islam. The pillars are known as the foundation for your Islamic life and are a must to follow. The pillars include believing in Allah alone, performing Salah (prayer), fasting in the month of Ramadan, paying Zakat (charity), and performing Hajj., There are some people who are excused from fasting during Ramadan. These include people who are sick, traveling, pregnant or breastfeeding, people who haven’t reached puberty yet, and people who are senile or senior citizens.For those who are sick or traveling: You do not need to fast until you recover or come back from your trip because Allah says, “... But if anyone is ill or on a journey, the same number should be made up from the other days.” . When Ramadan is over, you’ll need to make up the number of days you missed.For those who are pregnant or breastfeeding: Anas ibn Maalik al-Ka’bi narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: “Allah has relieved the traveler of fasting and half of prayer, and He has relieved the pregnant and breastfeeding woman of fasting.” For the child's well-being, a person does not have to fast if they are pregnant or breastfeeding.For those who are old in age: Allah says, “And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have to feed a Miskeen (poor person) everyday ” Senior citizens who are not able to fast can make up their fasting by feeding a poor person everyday they don't fast., To begin fasting, you'd eat a light meal called Suhoor before dawn. This meal is not essential, but it's highly encouraged to do so in order to gain the blessing of fasting for the day. After eating Suhoor, have the Niyyah (intention) to fast the entire day by telling yourself, ""I intend to observe my fast for today."" When the sun sets, you can break your fast and eat Iftar, the meal that is eaten to end the fast., Eating and drinking intentionally, taking medicine, smoking, taking an injection for nutritional reasons, engaging in sexual intercourse, and beginning your menstrual cycle are all actions that break your fast. If you happen to do one of these actions, you should make up your fast(s) after Ramadan., There are some actions that do not break your fast. This includes brushing your teeth, swallowing things that aren't possible to avoid (e.g. your own saliva), unintentional vomiting, bathing, getting an injection or IV for medical reasons, and eating or drinking by mistake (forgetting you're fasting).It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (SAW) said: “Whoever forgets he is fasting and eats or drinks, let him complete his fast, for it is Allah Who has fed him and given him to drink."", Before Ramadan, keep yourself hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Your body will deal with deprivation better if you start off well-hydrated. You also don't want to be unhealthy and dehydrated when you start fasting, so be sure you're drinking eight glasses of water each day., Cut down on some foods, such as snacks and desserts, and stick to eating three meals each day. You may want to wean yourself off of foods containing sugar and white flour a week or two before you start fasting, so that your body won't be suffering from major cravings on top of hunger pangs.Slowly lessen your meals and keep them light so you can train your body to eat little, making it easier when it's time to fast.

, Strive to wake up a few minutes or hours earlier than you normally do. When Ramadan starts, you'll have to wake up early in order to make and eat Suhoor. By training your body to get used to waking up earlier, you can prepare yourself for the early pre-dawn meals., Your body will be tired the first few days of fasting, especially with your sleep schedule changing. Train yourself ahead of time by taking a few cat naps throughout the day that last no more than thirty minutes.A good napping time is usually during the afternoon. It's the best time to recharge your body for the evening.Avoid taking naps longer than thirty minutes. Sleep inertia leads to disorientation and grogginess, which can last for half an hour. In order to function properly, keep naps thirty minutes or less., Ramadan means a new change of routine for both you and your meals. Make a schedule to indicate the timings of when Suhoor is, when it's time to break your fast, and so forth. You can create one yourself, but many mosque communities create them, too, so you can print one out to follow your community's timing., During Ramadan, having Suhoor and Iftar with the family is a common tradition, and eating as a group brings more blessing to the meal. You may want to start grocery shopping for some foods to prepare big meals for the family.Be sure to buy dates, too. In order to break your fast, you must eat a date or drink water. It's highly encouraged to break your fast with dates, though, so be sure to buy some when grocery shopping.Create a grocery shopping list to keep track of what foods you need to buy for Ramadan. Ask a parent or family member to help you shop and buy the food.

, Before fasting, try to train yourself to eat healthier. Eat a wide variety of vegetables and fruits, such as salads. Be sure to also eat plenty of protein, grains, and dairy. Having nutritional meals before fasting will help make it easier for you to avoid junk food cravings., Create a list of Ramadan goals you want to accomplish during this special month. You might want to make a goal of fasting the whole month of Ramadan, or trying to at least fast for part of it. Having it as a goal will motivate you to fast and encourage you to attempt fasting.


Have the intention (Niyyah) to fast before starting to do so. This is to ensure that you're serious about fasting and will try your best to do it. Have the intention to fast by telling yourself, ""I am going to fast the month of Ramadan with the help of Allah."", Suhoor is a meal eaten before Fajr (the morning prayer), before dawn comes. Eating Suhoor is Sunnah, meaning it's highly encouraged to do so in order to follow the Prophet Muhammad's actions, but there is no sin on you if you skip it. It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Prophet (SAW) said: “Eat Suhoor, for in Suhoor there is blessing.” Suhoor has been known to give you strength throughout the day when fasting. It can minimize thirst, prevent headaches, and avoid making you feel sick when you fast. It's highly encouraged not to miss out this meal before fasting.Try to stick to simple, nutritious meals that have plenty of proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Rice, bread, pasta, salads, dates, fruits, crackers, and soup are all good options.Avoid salty, greasy foods and extremely sweet desserts. This increases thirst and could cause you to feel dehydrated.Drink plenty of water during Suhoor to keep yourself hydrated when fasting.

, After eating Suhoor, have the Niyyah (intention) to fast the entire day by telling yourself, ""I intend to observe my fast for today."" You can also make Dua to Allah so He can help make the fast easy for you, and so that He can accept your worship to Him.The most common Dua said for Suhoor is ""Wa bi-sawmi ghadin nawaytu min shahri Ramadan"" (وَبِصَوْمِ غَدٍ نَوَيْتُ مِنْ شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ) which means in English ""I intend to keep the fast for tomorrow in the month of Ramadan."", Throughout the day, try to participate in different acts of worship. Ramadan is the month known for mercy and forgiveness, so doing acts of worship is an important part of this month. Read the Quran, attend Islamic halaqas (gatherings) for teenagers, listen to Islamic lectures, do Tasbeeh, make Dua, help out around the house, give charity, and pray any extra Salahs.

, When you're asleep, you won't feel hungry, and your body won't be burning as many calories. Try taking a few cat naps throughout the day to help ease off hunger. It's recommended to take naps that are less than thirty minutes to avoid sleep inertia. Taking naps longer can cause you to feel groggy when you wake up.Try taking a nap in the afternoon. It's the best time to recharge your body for the evening.

, When you fast, you don't have as much as energy due to the lack of food and water. Avoid over-working yourself and stay away from hot climates to keep from being dehydrated. Light exercise is okay, but try your best not to use too much energy. You don't want to harm yourself by exercising on an empty stomach.


If you do have to go outside when it's hot, keep yourself safe. Stay under shades whenever possible and keep a fan with you to stay cool.

, Keeping yourself preoccupied will help you from thinking about hunger. Do a hobby, talk to a friend, watch a video, clean up, draw, or do some type of easy-going and relaxing activity that will keep you from thinking about food.


Try to have a busy schedule with plenty of activities to do. Being bored a lot will cause you think about food and make you hungry.

, There are plenty of temptations and triggers that make us think about food. Try to stay away from areas where people eat food and where food is available. You should also try to avoid looking at pictures of food, hearing or watching people eat, and smelling food cooking.


For example, you might go to the library instead of the cafeteria so you won't be tempted to eat.

, Once the sun sets and the Magrib Salah (evening prayer) is announced, it's time to break your fast. Before breaking your fast, make Dua to Allah to accept your fast and pray for other things you desire. During this period of time, all Duas are accepted.When you're ready to break your fast, eat a date or drink water. The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: “When one of you is fasting, he should break his fast with dates; but if he cannot get any, then (he should break his fast) with water, for water is purifying.“Once you've broken your fast, you can eat a bit and take more sips of water. You can choose to eat Iftar right away or pray Magrib first. Praying first is encouraged, however, because after eating Iftar you're usually full and feel too tired to pray.There are many different Duas you can say when breaking your fast, but the most common one is ""Dhahaba al-zama' wa abtalat al-'urooqu wa thabata al-ajr in sha Allah"" (ذَهَبَ الظَّمَأُ وَ ابْتَلَّتِ الْعُرُوقُ، وَ ثَبَتَ الأجْرُ إنْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ), which means in English ""The thirst is gone, the veins are moistened, and the reward is confirmed, if Allah Wills"".

, Try to eat with your family if you can, as it's known to bring Baraka (blessing) while eating. Follow the same rulings you would do when normally eating food. Don't eat too much or too fast, as that could harm your body. This is especially important since you've fasted all day. Giving your stomach too much food to digest after it hasn't been used all day is very unsafe.When eating, eat slowly and use proper table manners, as though you were a guest in someone's house. This will help you avoid eating too quickly, which can cause nausea., Once you've finished eating Iftar, help clean up by clearing the table and/or washing the dishes. Try to help your parents prepare food for Suhoor the next day. Once you've fasted your first day in Ramadan, you'll realize the benefits and blessings of fasting and the beautify of Ramadan as a Muslim teen.


Drink plenty of water during the night before Suhoor to keep from dehydrating yourself the next fast.

Create a comfortable area where you can recite the Nembutsu.,
Purchase a small statue or image of Amida Buddha and place it on the shrine with offerings such as, water, flowers, rice, etc.

,
Nembutsu is made up of three syllables:


Namu: Comes from ""Namah"" originally meaning to worship.,
Recite ""Namu Amida Butsu"" repeatedly but in this type of Nembutsu the ""tsu"" is dropped.,
This style of Nembutsu is usually done in groups.,
Calm your thoughts.

,Focus on the Amida Buddha

,
Intone Naa- Maan- Daa- Buu with a wave a gratefulness welling up inside you.",How to Recite the Nembutsu," It is advisable to set out a separate room for reciting but it is not necessary.;
,, In Jodo Shu Buddhism it means to be mindful of Amida Buddha.
Amida: Amida Buddha's name is made up of two words, originally referring to two different manifestations of Buddha: ""Amitabha"" and ""Amitayus"".
Butsu: From ""Buddha"" originally meaning ""awakened one"".

,


During a group practice the rhythm is kept by hitting a ""mokugyo"", which is a wooden fish.
For this practice it is advisable to use Jodo Shu Juzu to keep track of how many times you recite.

, The usual phrase ""Namu Amida Butsu"" is repeated by the group but each syllable is prolonged.


The rhythm is usually kept by the group leader with ""kaishaku"" (wood blocks).

,,,


This can even be shortened further to ""Namu Amida Butsu"", to what sounds like NaManDaBs when saying your nembutsus.

Fulfill the five pillars of Islam.,
Read scripture.,
Pray above and beyond the requirements.,
Donate time and money to the needy.,
Contribute to your community's fulfillment of fard al-kifaya.,
Stand up for yourself and other Muslims.,
Dress to express your faith.,
Join or start an affinity group.",How to Become a Strong Muslim," Islam's Five Pillars are required for all Muslims. You must comply with them to practice Islam. To be a strong Muslim, do not waver from your observance of the pillars. Fulfill your daily obligations mindfully, and plan your occasional obligations with care. The Five Pillars are:


Testimony of Faith (Shahada). When you become a Muslim, you make a testimony of faith. Say aloud: ""There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger.""
Performance of the five daily prayers (Salah). Pray five times daily in the direction of the holy city of Mecca.

Fasting during the month of Ramadan (Sawm). Ramadan is a holy month. Observe it by praying, fasting, and performing acts of charity.
Almsgiving. Donate 2.5% of your savings to the poor (Zakat).
Making a pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj). If you are able, you must travel to Mecca at least once in your lifetime.;
, Read the Qur'an as often as you can. Seek an understanding of Islam directly from the source. You will strengthen your personal faith if you know the language your faith is based on. Make a practice of reading for a few minutes daily, as well as moments when you feel your faith waver or your focus on Allah falter.Every time you read, recite at least one verse aloud.

, While you must pray five times a day, a strong Muslim may also pray at additional times when moved to do so. You may pray alone, but to strengthen your faith, head to your mosque at prayer times. Collective worship has special merit.While prayer must last at least five minutes, you may lengthen your time praying.
Vary your routine so that you feel conscious of the act of praying, and are not merely going through the motions.

, While almsgiving is required of all Muslims, it is up the individual to determine what they can give beyond the required 2.5% of their income. If you are a high-earner, donate more than 2.5% of your income to good causes represented by trustworthy organizations. If you have extra time, volunteer at charity organizations. If you have special skills that can be helpful for others, such as TESOL training or knowledge of the law, consider donating your skills to non-profits and volunteer organizations that cannot afford to hire professionals., Fard al-kifaya are community obligations. Some of your community must fulfill fard al-kifaya for the benefit of the rest. For instance, if a Muslim dies, some of the Muslims in the community must get together to say funeral prayers. It's not required for every individual Muslims to say the prayers. However, if no one says the funeral prayers, the whole community is at fault.Step forward to fill in gaps when your community is failing to fulfill fard al-kifaya.
Think about the larger meaning of fard al-kifaya for your community. Could the Muslims in your community take on responsibilities toward feeding the hungry, repairing civic infrastructure, or participating in local politics?

, Muslims are often portrayed negatively by various political groups to further their own ends. You don't have to engage whenever you hear an Islamophobic statement, but you should say something if you feel safe and have the energy to do so.If you hear someone conflating Islam with violent extremism, you might say, ""I am a Muslim, and I don't appreciate you assuming all Muslims condone violent actions. That's not based on fact, and saying it as if it were could have dangerous consequences for me and people I love.""
Stand up for other Muslims if you see them being targeted. For instance, if you see a woman in a hijab being harassed, stand between her and her harasser and engage her in friendly conversation to take the power away from the person harassing her.

, Most Muslims dress modestly, but the style of dress varies greatly by school of thought and by region. Consider your circumstances and dress in a way that expresses your religious belief.Even if your family does not dress in this way, you may choose to wear long sleeves or a hijab to more clearly express your identity.
If you do not wear any easily-recognizable symbols of Islam, consider wearing a button or using a bumper sticker with a pro-Islam message.
Take care of yourself. If you live somewhere where you are at physical risk for showing (or failing to show) your faith, make the compromises you need to stay safe.

, Consider joining a youth group, a volunteer collective, or a meet-up group for other Muslims. Check your Mosque to see if there are groups you can join. If you are in school, there are often affinity groups for Muslim students, or inter-faith groups other Muslim students have joined.


Observe holidays together, go to meetings, and organize protests, celebrations, and other events in your community.
Form letter-writing committees to contact your local politicians about legislation that would affect other Muslims, such as refugees from Muslim-majority countries.

Respect Ramadan.,
Know when Ramadan starts.,
Watch how devout believers behave.,
Be aware of other important dates in the Islamic calendar.",How to Behave During Ramadan in Dubai1," Regardless of your belief system, understand why this tradition is so important to devout Muslims. If you're visiting Dubai, try to honor the culture. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, and it is a sacred time for Muslims throughout the world. Indeed, it is the Fourth Pillar of The Muslim Faith: most Muslims believe that the Qur'an was first revealed to the Prophet Mohammed during Ramadan. Thus, this holy month marks the beginning of revelations from God., Ramadan is always the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, but it varies from year to year on the (Western) Gregorian calendar. This is because the Islamic calendar is lunar (in tune with the moon), while the western calendar is solar (with the sun). Find out the first day of Ramadan by running a simple web search: for instance, ""Ramadan 2016"".Note that in the Muslim calendar, a holiday begins on the sunset of the previous day. Thus, if Ramadan falls on the 6th of June, devout believers will begin to observe the month after sundown on the 5th.
With each passing year, Ramadan cycles 10-11 days earlier on the Western calendar. For instance, in 2013, Ramadan began on July 9th; in 2014, it began on June 29th; in 2015, on June 18th., Ramadan is a holy month, and practicing Muslims are must refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, or having sex between dawn and dusk of each day. Many believers take this time as an opportunity to give up bad habits. Some people try to deepen their faith by praying more or reading the Qur'an. The general mood is one of abstinence, penance, and clarity.


As a visitor, you do not need to fast or to show any religious fervor. It is enough to respect and appreciate the culture. Above all, be considerate of Muslims during this time, and do not tempt those who are practicing any sort of abstinence.

, Islam is the primary religion in Dubai, although other religions are allowed. Muslim religious holidays are a big deal in the United Arab Emirates, so it may help to know what else to expect. Important dates in the Islamic calendar include: the Prophet’s ascension (Al Isr’a Wal Mairaj), the Prophet’s birthday (Mawlid Al-Nabi), the start of Ramadan, and the two ""Eid"" (festival) holidays: Eid Al-Fitr and Eid Al-Adha.

Make sure after each prayer that you give thanks for the little or big things you have in your life.,
Every night before you go to sleep, remember Allah (swt) by doing the routinely things which Prophet Mohammad (saw) did, such as praying Witr before sleep.

,
When you wake up, remember Allah and recite the Du'aa for waking up, and give thanks for being alive.

,
Give thanks that you still have your friends and family to support you through thick and thin.,
Say ""masha-Allah"" to any one which is blessed, and know that jealousy is wrong in Islam.,
Thank Allah that you're in good health, wealth, and state of being.,
Feel motivated and set your intention on being grateful.

",How to Become More Grateful to Allah," Say the Masnun supplications which Prophet Mohammad (saw) said after prayer.;
,,, Many around the world would give their lives to hug their mums and dads. Many wish to have friends to spend good time with.

, Don't envy the rich and always think about the less fortunate. There is always something to be grateful for in everyone's life. Whenever you get negative feelings remember this quote below ""I was sad because I had no shoes until I met a man who had no feet"" .

, Use your blessings to please Allah (swt). Thanking Allah (swt) will only increase your blessings. Allah says in the Q'uran : ""If you are grateful, I will certainly give you increase, but if you are ungrateful, My punishment is severe.""' (Surah Ibrahim: 7)

Dress modestly.,
Be considerate of practicing Muslims.,
Be charitable.,
Understand how business hours shift during Ramadan.,
Don't eat or smoke in public places.",How to Behave During Ramadan in Dubai2," Both men and women are expected to dress with an appropriate level of discretion during the month of Ramadan. Show as little skin as possible, within reason. Cover your knees and shoulders, wear only modest makeup, and do not wear revealing necklines. Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing.If you are female, consider covering your head with a scarf or pashmina. The stated purpose of this garb is to reduce the risk of temptation.
It is most important to dress modestly if you enter a mosque or another sacred space. This holds true even when Ramadan is not in effect.

, People will be abstaining from all food and water from dawn to dusk each day, and they will be actively trying to resist worldly temptations. If someone is trying to abstain from a certain habit or practice, avoid doing that thing in front of them. At best, you will offend the locals – and at worst, you may find yourself in trouble with the police. Be modest and respectful, and do your best to keep the peace.


Do not play loud music; in general, do not make a lot of noise in public spaces. Do not swear in public. Ramadan is a time for prayer and spiritual reflection, and loud or vulgar noises may disturb this peace.Fasting can wreak havoc upon a person's eating and sleeping habits, so some locals might be ""hangry"" or more irritable than usual. Understand that this is part of the experience. Try to be patient with everyone that you meet.

, Charity is a huge part of the ethos of Ramadan, and giving money to a good cause can be a great way to get into the holiday spirit. If you want to help an organization, look into the various volunteering and donating options in Dubai. On a simpler level, consider tipping service workers extra., The working hours are two hours shorter than usual during this month. In order to handle their hunger, people tend to stay up very late at night, then nap in the afternoon. All public restaurants and coffee shops are closed from dawn to sunset. Bars, clubs, and live music venues typically close down, so you may need to find another way to keep yourself busy.Be careful on the streets. The roads will be busier, especially when the fast breaks at sundown and people are going out to dinner. Drivers are generally more tired, and the rate of UAE traffic accidents increases dramatically during Ramadan.
Do not worry about finding food. Restaurants at hotels, airports, and other traveler-specific spaces tend to remain open during the day, and food and drinks are freely served in those areas.

, Smoking is prohibited in almost all public areas during the month of Ramadan, and you may even draw attention if you smoke in private spaces. Most importantly, do not smoke around practicing Muslims, some of whom might be trying to abstain from cigarettes for the month. Eating and drinking in front of fasting Muslims is not illegal, but it is usually considered disrespectful."

Consider the unique way that Dubai celebrates Ramadan.,
Enjoy Iftar meals.,
Give Ramadan greetings.,
Go shopping.,
Let loose during the three-day ""Eid"" celebrations after Ramadan.",How to Behave During Ramadan in Dubai3," This city is one of the busiest metropolitan areas in the world, and its people are adopting western customs at an rapid pace. During Ramadan, however, Dubai swirls into a colorful mix of religious tradition and modern culture. Bars and nightclubs close down; public concerts are banned; and the city comes alive inside traditional Iftar tents (majlis and jaimas) that spring up all throughout the streets., Each evening, the people of Dubai gather at Iftar celebrations in traditional Arabian tents. These majili and jaima tents feature fine Persian rugs, colorful cushions, and a rich array of food and drink. Once the daily fast ends at sundown, people come around to socialize, share food, smoke shisha, and play games. These celebrations may be held privately, in a home, or publicly, at a restaurant. In the UAE, large tents in the streets or near mosques hand out free meals to those in need.If you don't know any locals, take your friends or family to a hotel-based Iftar tent in the evening. Drink mint tea, coffee, and Arabic delicacies as you play games, relax, and absorb the culture. This can be a great way to experience Ramadan.If you are invited to an Iftar dinner, do not pass up the opportunity! It is considered rude to come empty-handed, so bring a box of dates or another simple Arabic dessert as a gesture of good faith to your host.

, Tap into the community spirit. Greet Muslims with the phrase ""Ramadan Kareem,"" which means ""Generous Ramadan."" At the end of Ramadan, during the three-day Eid celebrations, greet people with ""Eid Mubarak."" (eye-eed moo-bah-rock). Think of these phrases as something akin to ""Happy Holidays."" Everyone uses these greetings during the month of Ramadan, so you may actually stand out more if you don't use them!

, Practicing Muslims refrain from excessive spending during the days of fast, but they flock to malls and shops after sundown. Indeed, the shopping nights of Ramadan have been compared to the way that U.S. stores burst with activity in the days leading up to Christmas; malls are often open and bustling until well past midnight. Business owners typically entice post-fast spending with a host of deals and promotions. These promotions may extend beyond retail stores and restaurants to realms like flight booking, hotel reservation, and short-stay apartment reservation – which may make it easier for you to plan and finance your stay.


Consider buying a house or signing a lease during Ramadan. This month is a very special period for people in the region, and the burgeoning economy means that skyrocketing housing prices are one of the biggest issues facing the public in Dubai today. Anyone who purchases property or signs a lease during Ramadan can pay the current rent for a full year without worrying about rising rates.

, Ramadan is typically a somber and holy time; indeed, it is essentially a month-long spiritual fast. The breaking of a fast, however, is cause for celebration. The three days that follow Ramadan are much more exciting: celebrations and partying are the order of the day in Dubai, and the city comes alive with wild festivity. As with the month itself, it is best to ""go with the flow"" and follow the lead of the locals. Once everyone starts to party, you can loosen up and have a good time.

Advise the centre about your needs when you book.,
Check the routine.,
Be sure about retreat dates and times, as well as the address.,
Advise family or friends of your absence.,
Pack accordingly.,
Arrive early.,
Be gentle with yourself.,
Now, relax and enjoy!,
Balance your meditation practice.,
Avoid forcing yourself.,
Raise any concerns with the teacher.,
Wind down gently on the last day.",How to Prepare for Your First Weekend Long Buddhist Meditation Retreat," Retreat centres are obliged to make sure of your mental condition and physical fitness is sufficient to ensure they can adequately cater for your needs. For weekend retreats some centres may or may not ask for a referral from your doctor if you are suffering from a physical or mental illness.


Generally, most meditation retreat centres are vegetarian, but some aren't. It's best to check in advance. Likewise, as while they do their best, few meditation centres are sufficiently funded to cater for people with allergies, so it may be necessary to bring your own food.;
, Many retreat centres run off a 5 or 8 precept system for weekends, which, for 8 precepts, means no solid foods after noon. Some centres are rigid about the time you get up, some are more flexible. If you know you are going into a strict centre, it can be wise to practice the routine for a few days in advance, especially if the idea of the routine makes you feel uncertain about going.

, Many retreat centres are out in the quiet of the countryside and can be a long way from the cities. Ask the centre or the retreat manager for the easiest route from where you are coming from and how long it may take - they generally can estimate within 15 minutes or so, or you can use an online mapping service that can give a travel time estimation.


It is important to know where you are going because trying to get there on time as well as fear of getting lost can add a lot of unwanted tension to a weekend that is meant to be about letting go.
The best option is always to volunteer at the retreat centre before you stay, this may be to help around their kitchen or gardens, or to spend a whole weekend as a volunteer. This helps you become familiar with layout of the centre and its schedules, and gives you a taste of retreat life. It also builds merit and a sense of ease at the centre, which greatly improves your meditation.

, Generally a weekend retreat is a short time as opposed to a week, fortnight or month retreat, but it can be useful to let a trusted friend or neighbour know to keep an eye on your home security and collect any mail if necessary.

, Most retreat centres will supply you with bedding, meditation mats and cushions, and the meals. But most, except for very well funded centres may require you to bring your own bath towel, toothbrush and toothpaste. It is also wise to bring a torch, (very few retreat centres have in-suite toilets and bathrooms) and pack enough changes of clothing (even fewer centres have washing machines available for short stay residents), a thick blanket if you are particularly susceptible to the cold, and insect repellent if in a warm climate. Ideally don't bring loud alarm clocks, as most meditation centres have a community bell, or a small alarm inside the room.


It is generally better to pack less than more, as a retreat is about letting go and living with minimal things to free your mind from them. See if you can go a whole weekend without your smart phone or tablet, without an MP3 player on any electronic distraction - challenge yourself as part of the experience.
It is wise for people to pack plain clothing, that is both comfortable as well as protects one's modesty.

, An hour early is ideal. This allows you to settle into your room and get some quiet meditation time or a shower to unwind from your journey. If you wish you can always assist the centre volunteers to find your way around. Volunteers tend to be busy setting up and aren't always available to give you a tour, but are very welcoming to anyone who wishes to lend a hand, even if its simply to sweep around the hall.

, Generally, strictness is left to the routine - and weekend routines are usually not as strict as longer retreats, so your job is to let go, be easy and relax into the retreat. Most retreats tend to have noble silence for retreatants, but very new retreatants may find this difficult, so be compassionate (or use it as grist for the mill!) rather than let something spoil your weekend.

, Most centres typically have a short induction or orienteering course to let you know details such as evacuation procedures or the etiquette in the dining hall. After that, the retreat begins.


It's usually good manners to leave other meditators alone, which has always raised awkward moments of what is polite interaction (such as holding open the door for someone else), or whether a person either interacts too much (such as making excessive eye contact with other meditators) or oppositely act as if other people aren't there. Generally its wise to take nothing that other people do personally, as they may be new as well, and do your best in each situation.

, Constant intense sitting is challenging even for professional monastic meditators, let alone beginners, so it is wise to switch between walking and sitting meditation and, if you need too, take a rest session in your own room in private (as not all teachers will allow this however, so it depends on the tradition).

, This either will stress your mind to extreme states (which lead nowhere), or if they do lead to productive states of mind, are neither repeatable nor sustainable.


If you have access to a collection of suttas / sutras, or access to some MP3 talks, listen to some inspiring talks before you go on retreat to get you into a positive frame of mind.

, This is both about what to do, what you experience and how to act.


People respond differently to meditation and so you may at some stage in your meditation hobby feel intense emotions that seem troubling, although what they are is simply normal emotions that perception has amplified or something that has never properly been able to express itself. The first type certainly won't last and the latter type is often an expression of healing so it certainly is a normal, not unusual experience at one stage or another.

, Ideally do some stretches in your room or go for a private walk to stretch your legs. As you are likely driving back home, or if you are lucky to have someone drive you, you may have work or school the next day. Jumping from serene surroundings of a retreat centre to a busy work world can create a feeling of culture shock for beginners so it is best to adjust back to normal life first.


Many retreat centres request the retreatants to clean their room, shower block, kitchen and/or hall before they leave, so this is an ideal opportunity to adjust back into work life.

Decide how large you want to make your Zen garden.,
Create a mold to contain the sand and/or gravel.,
Nail, screw, or glue together your form.,
Place a weed retainer, such as black plastic, down prior to setting your Zen garden mold.,
Fill the form to the top with sand or gravel.,
Put selected features in your Zen garden to set a visually stimulating theme.,
Rake the sand or gravel in long, curving strokes to represent water ripples.",How to Create a Zen Garden," Assess your available space. Are you going to make a garden that fills up part of your backyard, or are you going to start with a Zen garden to place on your desk? The steps are the same, the scale will just be different.






;
, Sand or gravel generally form the matrix of a Zen garden, and to keep it looking sharp, you need the matrix to be contained. If you are making a large garden, consider using 2"" x 4"" pieces of lumber, old railroad ties, or any other type of wood. If you are making a desktop Zen garden, simply gather and cut enough wood to make a small container.








, After you have completed your form, you can decorate the wood by painting, staining, or varnishing it.








, Zen gardens receive much of their appeal from their cleanliness. Keeping out weeds is a must for outdoor gardens.








, Spread the sand or gravel evenly and as level as possible. For a small desktop garden, you might be able to buy sand in small bags at a local pet shop or aquarium supply store. For larger gardens, call the local rock shop, quarry, or landscaping supply company. This is only needed in an outdoor garden.








, Consider using old, mossy logs, rocks with interesting colors, shapes or textures, or other items. Place them off-center and partially submerged for the best effect. Zen gardens generally include natural items made of wood, rock and vegetation, but don’t be afraid to add statues or other additions. Just don’t clutter your Zen garden. Remember, you want it to be peaceful and simple. Make sure that the feng shui is in check with your karma an dharma before enjoying your zen garden! If it is not balanced properly, there could be some major problems and could possibly send your karma into a yin yang whirlwind (which is NOT good!) * See feng shui and karma for details.








, You can use a number of patterns to accentuate your garden. The nice thing is that you can change it as many times as you like!

Make sure you know what it means to be Muslim.,
Read Islamic scripture.,
Talk with an Imam.,
Say the Shahada.,
To become a legal member of the Muslim community, have witnesses present at your recitation.,
Wash yourself.,
Offer prayer to God.,
Perform Islamic obligations (Fard).,
Observe Muslim etiquette (Adab.),
Understand and embody the five pillars of Islam.,
Believe in the six articles of Faith.,
Continue to read the Qur'an.,
Study Islamic Law and choose a school.,
Above all, be the best person you can be.",How to Become a Muslim," The first and foremost rule of being a Muslim is believing in the one and only Allah. Allah is the only god, the only creator and the Almighty. He is the only one you should be doing your good deeds for and the only who shall be worshipped. There should be nothing stood beside His place. Allah's messenger Muhammad (pbuh) is the messenger who is believed as the last prophet who came down to Earth and there will never be any prophets after that. Islam considers itself to be the natural way of all creation. That is, Islam is the original, perfect state of being. So, when a person ""converts"" to Islam, he/she is actually reverting to their own original nature.


Islam considers anyone who adheres to this state of being to be a Muslim, regardless of when or where she or he lived. For instance, Islam believes that Jesus was a Muslim, though he lived hundreds of years before Islam's historical founding.
Allah, the Arabic word for God, refers to the same God worshipped by Christians and Jews (aka the ""Abrahamic"" God). Thus, Muslims revere the prophets of Christianity and Judaism (including Jesus, Moses, David, Elijah, etc.) and consider the Bible and Torah to be divinely-inspired.;
, The Quran is the central religious book of Islam, believed to be the unadulterated word of God and the culmination of all previous Christian and Jewish scripture.Another very important religious scripture is the Hadith, the sayings and accounts of Muhammad. Hadith collections form the basis for much of Islamic law.Reading these writings will give you an understanding of the stories, laws, and teachings that make up Islamic belief.

, Imams are Islamic religious scholars who conduct religious services inside and outside the mosque (Masjid). Imams are chosen for their knowledge of Islamic scripture and their good character. A good Imam will be able to provide you with advice when deciding whether you're ready to devote yourself to Islam.


Note that the description above applies to imams of the majority Sunni sect of Islam. Imams have somewhat different roles in the minority Shi'a sect., If you're absolutely sure you want to become a Muslim and fully submit to the will of Allah, all you need to do is recite the Shahada, a short oral declaration of faith. Be aware that once you have said the Shahada you are committed to following Islam for life. The words of the Shahada are ""La ilaha illallah, Muhammadun rasulullah "" This translates to ""I testify that there is no other god but Allah, and Muhammad is God's messenger (prophet)."" By saying the Shahada, you become a Muslim.


The first part of the Shahada (""La ilaha illallah"") refers not only to deities from other religions, but also to earthly things which can take the place of Allah in your heart - wealth and power, for example. The second part of the Shahada (""Muhammadun rasulullah"") is a recognition that the word of Muhammad is Allah's messenger. Muslims are required to live by the principles of Muhammad revealed in the Quran - the Shahada is a pledge to follow these principles.
The Shahada must be said with sincerity and understanding to be binding. You can't become a Muslim just by pronouncing the words - the oral recitation is a reflection of belief that's held in the heart.
You will never kill, lie, steal, or anything of the sort. In other words, you will follow the Islamic rules.

, Witnesses are not strictly required to become a Muslim - God knows all things, so a Shahada said alone, with conviction, will make you a Muslim in God's eyes. However, to become legally recognized by the Muslim mosque, you generally must make your Shahada in front of witnesses - two Muslims or an Imam (Islamic religious leader) who is authorized to certify your new faith.

, Immediately upon becoming a Muslim, you should take a shower or bath as a form of purification. This is a symbolic act that signifies the washing away of the past and of emerging from darkness to light.


No one's sins are too grave to prohibit newfound purity. Upon making your Shahada, your past sins are forgiven. You symbolically begin a new life centered around striving to improve your spiritual state through good deeds.

, If you're not sure how to pray as a Muslim, the easiest way to learn is to attend a Mosque for the five daily prayers. Prayer should be a relaxing, enjoyable activity, but be aware that the five daily prayers are obligatory for all Muslims over the age of ten years. Take your time when praying. Rushing the prayer should be avoided in order to gain maximum benefit.


Remember, prayer is a direct spiritual connection between you and the being who keeps your heart beating and who created the universe. It should bring serenity, happiness and peace. This will come with and improve with time. Avoid being excessive or ostentatious with your prayer - pray simply and humbly. Your initial goal is to establish a habit and make it an enjoyable experience.
Structure your day around the five daily prayers. Make sure that you leave plenty of time for supplication (dua) after performing the obligatory prayers, as this is the way Muslims seek help from Allah. Try to adopt the habit of praying all the optional prayers as well.
Pray to Allah for good judgement and success in life. However, keep two points in mind: First, your must perform the duties that Allah has required of you. It is not enough to merely pray for success - you must do what is necessary to achieve it. Second, have faith in Allah in all matters. Your material success is fleeting, but Allah is eternal - keep your devotion in Allah whether you are successful or not.

, Islam requires Muslims to fulfill certain obligations. These obligations are called ""Fard."" There are two kinds of Fard: Fard al-Ayn and Fard al-Kifaya. Fard al-Ayn are individual obligations - things every single Muslim must do if he or she is able, like praying daily and fasting during Ramadan. Fard al-Kifaya are community obligations - things that the community as a whole must do, even if every member doesn't do them. For instance, if a Muslim dies, some of the Muslims in the community must get together to say funeral prayers. It's not required for every individual Muslims to say the prayers. However, if no one says the funeral prayers, the whole community is at fault.


Islamic belief also mandates the observance of Sunnah, lifestyle guidelines based on the life of Muhammad which are recommended but not required for Muslims.

, Muslims are required to live their lives in certain ways, avoiding some behaviors and adopting others. As a Muslim, you will keep the following habits (and others):


Observe halal dietary practices. Muslims abstain from consuming pork, carrion, and alcohol. Additionally, meat must be properly slaughtered by an authorized Muslim, Christian, or Jew.
Say ""Bismillah"" (""In the Name of God"") before meals.
Eat and drink with your right hand, and never with the left.
Practice proper hygiene.
Refrain from non-essential interaction with the opposite gender. Remember that all forms of sexual activity outside the the bounds of marriage are forbidden in Islam.
Married women must abstain from sex during the menstrual cycle.
Study and follow the Islamic dress code, which places great emphasis on modesty.

, Islam's Five Pillars are obligatory actions that Muslims must take. They represent the core of pious Islamic life. The Five Pillars are:



Testimony of Faith (Shahada). You make when you become a Muslim by declaring that there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is their messenger.

Performance the five daily prayers (Salat). Prayers are made throughout the day in the direction of the holy city of Mecca.

Fasting during the month of Ramadan (Sawm). Ramadan is a holy month marked by prayer, fasting, and charity.

Giving 2.5% of your savings to the poor (Zakat). It is a personal responsibility of Muslims to help those less fortunate.

Making a pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj). Those who are able are required to make the journey to Mecca at least once.

, Muslims have faith in Allah and his divine order even though it cannot be perceived by human senses. The six articles of faith mandate that Muslims must believe in:



Allah (God). God is the creator of the universe and the only being worthy of worship.

His angels. Angels are the unquestioning servants of God's divine will.

His revealed scripture. The Quran is the perfect will of God as revealed to Muhammad by through the angel Gabriel (Christian and Jewish scripture is also considered holy, they were given from Allah but some or more of the content has already been changed).

His messengers. God sent prophets (including Jesus, Abraham, and others) to preach his word on earth;

The Day of Judgement. God will eventually raise all life for judgement at a time known only to him.

Fate. God has ordained all things - nothing occurs without his will or pre-knowledge.

, You can learn much from translations of the Qur'an. Some of these translations may be harder to understand than others. Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Pickthall are the two most common Qur'an translations. However, it's even better to seek guidance from people who are trained in the study of the Qur'an rather than simply relying on your own ability to interpret the Qur'an. Your local mosque will likely have people who will be more than willing to guide and assist you in learning more about Islam and many have ""New Muslim"" study circles which are often a good place to start. Be careful, but relaxed, about finding someone who you feel comfortable with and who you are convinced has enough knowledge in order to teach well.


Many Muslims devote much time to memorizing the Qu'ran as it brings great reward. When your Arabic improves, start learning by heart some of your favourite surahs. These can then be recited during prayer or whenever you feel you need a lift.

, In Sunni Islam, religious law is divided into four schools of thought. Look into the different schools and choose the one that appeals most to you. Subscribing to a school will inform your interpretation of Islamic law as revealed in the primal sources of Islam Note that all schools are equally valid. Although the Shariah may seem very strict at first, the laws and punishments are gifts from Allah to ensure a safe and fair society. Do your best to try to implement what you learn in your own life. The officially recognized schools are:


Hanafi. The Hanafi School was founded by Imam Al A'dham Nu'man Abu Hanifa and is the most widely practiced school and has the most information available in English, it ranges from the widely secular Turks to the Ultra-Orthodox Deobandis and Barelvis. Most Hanafis live in the Indo-Pak subcontinent, Turkey, Eastern Iran, parts of Egypt and many Non-Muslim Majority countries
Shafi'i. The Shafi'i school was founded by Imam Abu 'Abdillah Muhammad Al-Shafi'i and is the second most populous school and is the majority in Egypt and East Africa as well as Yemen, Malaysia and Indonesia, The Shafi'i school is known for their complex legal system.
Maliki. The Maliki school was founded by Imam Abu Anas Malik who was a student of Imam Abu Hanifa it is the majority school in North and North West Africa, as well as a reasonable following in Saudi Arabia. Imam Malik took his practices from the people of Madinah one famous Maliki scholar is Hamza Yusuf.
Hanbali. The Hanbali school was founded by Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal and is practiced almost exclusively in Saudi Arabia, with some followers in the West. The Hanbalis place great emphasis on creed and ritual practice and it is considered the most conservative and strict.

, No matter what may anger, sadden or upset you, your duty on earth is to be the best person you can be by serving Allah swt. Muslims believe that Allah created us to have a good life, and to be happy through our service to Him. Use your talents to help others and better your community. Be open-minded. Never do harm to anyone. Make it your mission to tell people about Islam, emphasizing that Islam is a religion of peace.


Like many religions, Islam advocates that its believers follow the ""Golden Rule."" Follow the advice of the prophet in the following Hadith:

""A Bedouin came to the prophet, grabbed the stirrup of his camel and said: O the messenger of God! Teach me something to go to heaven with it. Prophet said: “As you would have people do to you, do to them; and what you dislike to be done to you, don't do to them. Now let the stirrup go! This maxim is enough for you; go and act in accordance with it!”"

Finish the mandala stone with transparent spray paint.",How to Paint Mandala Stones," You can paint mandalas on stones with many different types of paint. The most important factor is viscosity. Try acrylic paint, as it is a readily available and inexpensive. Whatever type of paint you get, you will likely need to water it down in order for the paint to settle into perfectly round dots on your stone.Swing by your local home improvement store and find the paint counter. Ask for a sample of whatever color you want. If you have the choice, go for oil-based paint, as it will be more durable. Latex-based paints, on the other hand, will dry more quickly.These paints will be inexpensive in a sample portion, which is more than enough to paint a handful of rocks. (There may even be some ""oops"" samples to choose from for especially cheap.)
There is no need to use high quality paints available from art suppliers. For one, many of the highest quality paints will be especially thick, and are not ideal for this type of project.
Grab some transparent spray paint as well, to seal the surface of the stone after you paint your mandala.;
, You want it thick enough to avoid dripping off of your brush, but thin enough to expand into a flattened orb once deposited on your stone. Test the viscosity of your paint by depositing a small drop onto a piece of paper with your brush.Keep adding water in small amounts until the drop forms a small rounded circle on the paper. If the paint is entirely absorbed by the paper, it is too wet. In this case, add fresh paint to your mixture.
Get acrylic paint online or from any art supply store.

, You can create multiple shades of one color yourself. This is a great way to create a custom color gradient for your mandala. To do so, select a darkly colored paint that you find especially attractive. For instance, choose a dark purple, maroon, or deep green. Get the same type of paint in white as well. With these two paints alone, you can create a whole gradient with which you can paint a mesmerizing mandala!Pour out a few different equally-sized portions of your dark color. Leaving one portion as it as, add one drop to one portion, two drops to the next, and so on, until you have as many different shades of the color as you want to include in your mandala.

, The type of paintbrush you use is more important than you might expect. Opt for a round, pointed brush that has synthetic bristles. Synthetic bristles are ideal because they are stiff enough to allow you to apply fine details with great control. Usually, synthetic bristles will be yellow or white. Be sure to get a few different sizes, particularly 0, 1, and 2.Synthetic-bristled brushes are designed to be used with acrylic paint.
Avoid using brushes with animal-hair bristles. Their bristles will be too soft or fringy for fine details or small dots.
Inspect the bristles of a brush carefully before purchasing. Do not purchase a brush that has any bristles stuck together.

, High quality paintbrushes can be expensive, and are often not readily available. However, you may already have other tools that are perfect for painting mandalas. For instance, try using a nail art brush. In particular, dotting tools meant for use decorating fingernails can turn you into a dot-applying mandala master in no time., Get used to the size of dots that each of your brushes make when loaded with a certain amount of paint. Softly touch the tip of a brush wet with paint to a practice stone where you want a dot. The paint will transfer from your brush to the stone, settling into a raised, rounded dot of paint.The larger the head of the brush, the larger the corresponding dot. You can also adjust the size of the dot by allowing the brush to soak up a bit more or a bit less paint.

, Go somewhere you know there will be plenty of stones. While a rocky beach is the obvious option, stream beds and rocky trails are also great options. Look for stones that are round and flattened, like thick miniature pancakes. The smoother the better.Rocks found in moving bodies of water may be best, as they are most likely to have smooth surfaces.
You can also buy stones at most art supplies or crafting stores, or online. This approach offers stones that have flawless, artificially smoothed surfaces.
The size of the stone you choose is entirely up to you. As a default, go with a stone that fits comfortably in the palm of your hand. This size is ideal if you're hoping to meditate with your stone.

, Before you begin painting, wash your stones with warm soapy water. Ensure there is no debris or imperfections that might allow paint to sink into the stone or run down a crack or crevice. If you find any small imperfections, switch stones., You may want to apply a layer of clear varnish once the stone is clean and dry. An undercoat of varnish is not vital, though it will make it easier to paint consistent dots on the stone. It’s likely worth it, as adding a layer of varnish can be done quickly and easily., Starting with a dark base layer will help the other colors of your mandala stand out. You can paint a base in whatever shape you choose. A circle may be the easiest, though a circle with a rippled or pointy edge may also look especially good. It’s also up to you how much of the top surface of the stone you cover in a base layer.A good benchmark is about the middle 2/3 of the stone, meaning you’ll leave about 15% of the stone’s surface diameter unpainted all around the base layer.

, Allow the base layer to fully dry before beginning to apply dots. On many mandala stones, this central dot is the largest. Its size is up to you, though a large center dot is likely the easiest way to start a mandala design. If you want a larger central dot, paint a miniature circle in the exact center of the stone, right in the middle of the base layer you’ve already painted.White is a great color for your center dot. You’ll likely want to prominently feature whichever color you have in the middle, in part because it will stand out particularly well.

, Decide on the size of dot you want for the first circle of dots and load the corresponding brush with the same color paint. Touch the tip of the brush to the stone near the edge of the central circle, but not touching it. Apply the next dot on the opposite side of the circle. Then add a dot midway between these dots on either side, so you have four dots equally spaced around the center circle. The goal is applying dots that are the same size, and evenly spaced from one another.Split the distance between dots again. After one or two more rounds of this, you’ll likely simply be filling the only remaining spaces with dots.

, Choose a different color for your second row of dots, perhaps one shade darker of the same color. Place this row of dots outside of the preceding row, but slightly nestled into the indentations made by the earlier row. Leave a bit more space between individual dots in this row.It’s best to start with the lighter colors in your color gradient on the inside of the mandala, using darker colors nearer the edges of the stone.
Make larger, darker dots in each row for a proven pattern. You can vary this approach however you’d like, though this approach is the easiest way to start painting mandalas. Don’t forget to also leave larger gaps between individual dots in each row.

, The final row that fits within the darker base layer should be composed to dots that almost reach the edge of the layer. If you need to add a bit of dark paint, don’t hesitate to do so. Try to maintain the original shape of the base layer, but a bit of fluctuations is alright., Your last row of dots will look best if they are painted half on the base layer and half off of it, covering a small portion of the bare stone. As was the case with all of the previous rows, these dots should nestle into the spaces between but outside of the dots in the preceding row., For each row beside the smallest (which is already white dots) and the largest (with dots straddling the outer edge of the base layer), fill in the empty spaces between dots with tiny white dots. Use your smallest brush to do so., Consider painting dots on top of the colored dots you already have. Use the shade of the previous row for these additional dots on top of the colored rows. This will amplify the aesthetic effect achieved by using a color gradient.Add a drop of paint to each shade if the contrast between shades is hard to see in dots painted on top of one another.

, You can get creative with the exterior edge of the mandala however you’d like. One great option is adding mid-sized white dots between the dots of the final colored row. Then add white dots in decreasing size emanating out from these white dots and down the side of your mandala., Add more dots however you wish. You’re not done until you want to be. You can continue adding smaller and smaller dots on top of dots. Or, add more strips of dots of whatever color that decrease in size from the edge of the mandala down and around the edges of the stone. Once you’re happy with your mandala stone, spray it with transparent spray paint to help maintain your dots."

Prepare yourself for meditation.,
Begin practicing meditation.",How to Meditate As Buddha Taught,"


Sit upright, comfortable and relaxed, with your hands on your knees or thighs, palms up or palms down or resting, one on the other, in your lap.






Turn your eyes slightly downward and close them gently. This removes visual distractions and reduces your brain-wave activity by about seventy-five percent, thus helping to calm the mind.






Your mouth should be closed so all breathing is done through the nose. This, too, aids in quieting the mind. Though your mouth is closed, the jaw muscles should be relaxed so the upper and lower teeth are not clenched or touching one another, but parted.





;
,


Inhale and exhale slowly and deeply three or four times, feeling the inhaling and exhaling breath moving in and out through your nostrils.






Now breathe naturally and with ease, keeping your awareness on the tip of your nose, feeling the breath as it flows in and out of your nostrils. (Some people become more aware of the half-inch or so at the end of the nose, others the very end of the nose, and others remain more aware of the nostrils. Whichever happens naturally is the best for you. So whenever this book says “nosetip” it applies equally to these three areas.)






Do not follow the breath in and out of your body, but just be aware of the breath movement sensation at the tip of your nose.






Keeping your awareness on the tip of your nose, breathe naturally and calmly, fully observing the sensation of the breath moving there throughout all your inhalations and exhalations. This enables you to enter effortlessly into the Witness Consciousness that is your true nature.






Do not let the simplicity of the process fool you. Though deceptively simple, breath meditation done this way is very profound. A Buddhist master said, ""The breath can take you all the way to Nirvana.""







"
"
Start at the beginning and spend a little time considering the meditation format.,
Find a quiet peaceful place and relax into a meditation posture.,
Turn your attention to the mind once you feel more relaxed and note specifically how it is feeling now.,
Take your time and let go of any events that cause you distress.,
Continue to observe the mental states that arise in the mind.,
To develop the mind further, refine and expand the scope of what you are aware of in regards to day to day activities.,
Keep practicing this until you can see the interaction parts easily.,
To develop the meditation further, keep looking for tension in the mind as a primary target, that way you can get to the heart of the matter.",How to Practice Mindfulness of Mental States," This is in order to get some familiarity with what is involved in order to set yourself some guidelines, boundaries or an idea of what your intention is.
In a nutshell, the aim of the meditation is to become familiar with how the mind works as well as being able to identify everything that comes and goes. Once the practitioner is more clear in their mind what they are looking at, they can then investigate the merit of the mental state and whether it should be bulked up or valued (such as a sense of calmness, clarity, happiness or goodwill), or let go of (such as tension, a chattering mind, strong emotions or unhappy memories).;
, The Do Mindful Meditation page looks at the four types, but any are suitable - sitting, standing, walking or lying down.
Focus your attention on something, such as the breath or feelings in order to relax but also to build up the awareness & focus to be mindful. It's typically best for beginner practitioners to be aware of the small, basic and easy parts of the mind, body or breath, or anything that is most evident but is also relaxing to focus on. It may take some time before you are able to do this in day to day circumstances for the more subtle movements, however the more you practice and practice refining your focus it will get easier and quicker that you learn things.
A beginner practitioner may find the experience is easier after practicing a meditation type such as compassion, equanimity or goodwill, as the mind already has a pleasant and peaceful state of mind to begin observing.

, You can use any words in the mind you wish to be able to identify what's going on. There is a host of things you may focus on, such as:


Mental tension, or relaxed feelings, or being focused, or mentally tired.
Thought chains, random thoughts or stream of consciousness thinking.
Reactions to sounds, feelings and other disturbances.
Specific subject thoughts that the mind is solely interested in.
Emotions such feeling happy, bored, frustrated etc.
Desires, intentions, motivations or urges.
The point about this section to observe mental phenomena only once the practitioner is more calm and relaxed is a beginner practitioner may flood themselves with awareness of more thoughts and feelings that they can cope with. At the same time, it reduces the likelihood of seeing many strong or unsettling emotions. Eventually the practitioner builds up experience to deal with more difficult cases, but only after there is some familiarity with the mind generally
At this stage, avoid getting involved with the topic or theme, or judging and commenting on it and instead, study what is going on before you attempt to change it, just like learning the layout of the land before you go exploring it.

, An excellent analogy to consider is a security guard who lets hundred of people pass him every hour but doesn't stop them, but has to be aware for the gatecrashers or dangerous people whom he does stop. The aim of the game is to watch the mind over time, how it changes, how it acts, reacts and moves
Avoid looking for too many details at this stage. There is actually nothing to stop you at all, but you might get information overload or your awareness just will wear out very quickly if you have not much experience in holding an object of focus for a long time (such as more than 10 minutes without distraction). Test your limits and work into expanding them by gently adding a little more awareness each time.

, Move to the more subtle and diverse objects when you feel you are able to, or when they are more apparent. The practitioner often knows for themselves when it doesn't seem difficult anymore to be aware of the basics.
At each stage, still endeavour not to get involved in the thoughts or feelings, but to simply be observant. If something arises that is very strong, then the option is to be aware of it and accept its presence, but still stay detached from it. Often strong emotions make a practitioner get lost in the thought chain, or causes them great unease, so staying detached keeps it in view like seeing a tiger in the bushes.
Once you feel more able to deal with the thought, you can then let go of the thought, or turn your attention to investigating what it is. You can ask yourself ""Can I live without this thought?"" (or whatever it is that is causing you stress), in order to help letting go.

, Whenever you are in or outside of the meditation room, observe whatever mental states are associated to it. There are many examples such as: ""I'm thinking about work and the mind feeling worn out"" or ""I'm driving, I'm late and feeling annoyed at that red light"" or ""the mind has put that thought down now and there is a feeling of relaxing"". Continue to the next activity or change in the mind when you can do that and it seems straightforward and easy.
Examine that the area where the traps are and how to avoid getting trapped by refraining from being drawn into, or distracted by the subject. The trap is when you have become involved and start wanting something to be, to happen, or oppositely not be, or not happen. You have to work harder to get awareness and that sense of detachment back if you get involved.
This monitoring activity in itself is not the goal finished, it's only scratching the surface. Just like how a Doctor has identified a disease, the Doctor now has to prescribe a treatment. What essentially is required to do this is to start looking for how the mind is acting and reacting and letting go of all and any tension that arises and when it arises. Be kind to yourself and let go of the things that cause you distress. Take every chance to let go of tension and relax.

, The point of this is simply to learn which things cause the mind stress and which causes the mind to relax.
When you can note all mental activity, this is where you develop insight. Look for all the times you want something or want something to go away. Ask yourself ""is wanting something making a problem?"". See the Four Noble truths for more on this as these can be applied directly to the heart of the problem.

, Ultimately it allows you to expand the scope of what you can identify as well as decide for yourself what is pleasant and unpleasant to experience so you can deal with them accordingly. By seeing how stress is caused, you no longer feel that you have to get involved, or that the chattering in the mind is really any benefit. It then becomes easy to just let it go.
When you can both note all the things in the mind both in and out of meditation, as well as know what it does, practice wordless awareness. You can ask yourself ""Can I do this without mental noting?"" and just be aware without any other activities.
Eventually the mind both recognises the things that cause stress and just lets go of them and relaxes because it has learnt that letting go is the way to release the stress.
You can also see the benefit of mindfulness so you are happier to do it. Because while there isn't a way to bullet proof the mind from doing stressful things, mindfulness is only a way to primarily learn, then recognise and finally let go of what's there and avoid getting involved with future traps. Then, as the mind becomes thoroughly disenchanted with getting involved in stressful thoughts and feelings, you are free of them.

Identify the guru bead.,
Place the mala in your right hand.,
Hang the mala on your third finger.,
Count with your thumb.",How to Use a Mala1," The guru bead, or mountain bead, generally hangs perpendicular to the counting beads. The guru bead is intended to be used as a place of rest and contemplation during meditations and mantra recitations. Guru beads can be connected to a tassel, made of different material than the counting beads, or have carvings and other ornamentation.The guru bead will be where you begin and end your meditation or mantra recitation.;
, The right hand is the traditional placement for malas as some cultures view the left hand as being impure. However, there are many other cultures and traditions that do not specify in which hand you need to place the mala. Consult the specific tradition you are practicing in if you are unsure of which hand you should place the mala.If you are relatively new to meditation, or do not practice within a specific tradition, use whichever hand is most comfortable.

, Place your mala on your third, or ring, finger before you begin reciting mantras or meditating. The third finger has a symbolic significance in many buddhist traditions. Placing the mala on your third finger will also allow you to efficiently cycle through the mala throughout your meditation and mantra recitations.


Try placing the mala on your middle finger if you have dexterity or flexibility issues in your hands.
Malas, specifically in the Hindu tradition, can be placed on any finger except for the index finger.In Kundalini yogic meditations, each finger corresponds with a particular quality. The index finger is for wisdom, knowledge, and prosperity; the middle finger is for patience; the ring finger is for health, vitality, and strengthening the nervous system; and the little finger is for intelligence and communication., Use your thumb to count each bead throughout your meditation. Your thumb should allow you to easily move through each bead that is held by one of your fingers. Simply use the pad or nail of your thumb to pull each bead toward you and cycle through your mala.Know that although they are called counting beads, you will not necessarily be counting by number. The counting beads are meant to serve as markers of your progress in your mantra or meditation to allow you to further deepen your contemplative practice.

Pray for the happiness and wellbeing of your friends and family.,
Perform simple thankfulness prayers before meals.,
Learn the Metta Prayer.,
Remember that prayer is simply a way to connect to yourself spiritually.",How to Say a Buddhist Prayer1," Before praying, take a deep breath, get comfortable, and close your eyes. Focus on the here and now, centering yourself however feels right. You want to sink into your prayers, not just say them.


Candles, scents, and low lighting can help calm yourself down and bring yourself closer to your prayer.;
, Mantras are simply phrases meant to be repeated over and over again. You do not necessarily need to know their full meanings, as the words themselves, through repetition, lose their ""meaning"" and help you avoid distraction.



Om mani padme hum: Pronounced ohm man-ee pad-mae hoom, this translates to ""Hail to the jewel in the lotus.""

Oṃ Amideva Hrīḥ: Pronounced ""OM Ami-dehva re."" Or, in English, ""To overcome all obstacles & hindrances""

Om A Ra Pa Ca Na Dhih: This chant is believed to help with wisdom, critical thinking, and writing. Emphasise the ""Dhih"" (pronounced Di) when chanting.There are many, many other chants out there to practice, and listening to audio tracks is a great way to learn them quickly.

, This prayer is good, short prayer that can be repeated as a mantra. Remember to focus on yourself and your own spiritual growth, not simply asking for it from Buddha:
I take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha
Until I attain Enlightenment.
By merit accumulations from practicing generosity and the other perfections
May I attain Enlightenment, for the benefit of all sentient beings.
Sangha translates as ""community, group, or assembly."" It usually refers to the community of believers in Buddhist ideals.Dharma is the overall universal truth common to all people. It is the common force, of sorts, that binds and holds the universe together., This prayer is a great way to stay thankful for the people around you, and to recognize their connection.

May I be well, happy, and peaceful.
May my teachers be well, happy, and peaceful.
May my parents be well, happy, and peaceful.
May my relatives be well, happy, and peaceful.
May my friends be well, happy, and peaceful.
May the indifferent persons be well, happy, and peaceful.
May the unfriendly persons be well, happy, and peaceful.
May all meditators be well, happy, and peaceful.
May all beings be well, happy, and peaceful.

, Mealtime is a wonderful time to slow down and show gratitude for earthly blessings. Eating food is a time where you can become close to those around you and respect your physical nature. Try out the following mealtime prayers:


May this food be dedicated to the triple jewel
The precious Buddha
The precious Dharma
The precious Sangha
Bless this food so we may take it as medicine
Free from attachment and desire
So that it may nourish our bodies so we may
Work for the benefit of all sentient beings., The following prayer, adapted from a lecture by The Buddha, is an all-emcompassing and powerful prayer to repeat to yourself:
In order that I may be skilled in discerning what is good, in order that I may understand the path to peace,
Let me be able, upright, and straightforward, of good speech, gentle, and free from pride;
Let me be contented, easily satisfied, having few duties, living simply, of controlled senses, prudent, without pride and without attachment to nation, race, or other groups.
Let me not do the slightest thing for which the wise might rebuke me. Instead let me think:
“May all beings be well and safe, may they be at ease.
Whatever living beings there may be, whether moving or standing still, without exception, whether large, great, middling, or small, whether tiny or substantial,
Whether seen or unseen, whether living near or far,
Born or unborn; may all beings be happy.
Let none deceive or despise another anywhere. Let none wish harm to another, in anger or in hate.”
Just as a mother would guard her child, her only child, with her own life, even so let me cultivate a boundless mind for all beings in the world.
Let me cultivate a boundless love for all beings in the world, above, below, and across, unhindered, without ill will or enmity.
Standing, walking, seated, or lying down, free from torpor, let me as far as possible fix my attention on this recollection. This, they say, is the divine life right here., Buddha is not a creator god, though some practices do see him as divine. That said, prayer is not meant as an offering to Buddha. Rather, it is a way to deepen your own spirituality. If you feel like praying, then you should pray, and worry about the theology later. You can, of course, make up your own specific mantras, and think about your own ways to pray, as there is no wrong way to practice.There are a vast array of prayers, and no right way to pray as a Buddhist. This frees you to practice your prayer and spirituality how you desire it, not how you are told.

Figure out who you want to teach meditation to.,
Determine which style of meditation you want to teach.,
Become a masterful student.,
Talk with meditation teachers.,
Get certified.,
Set aside a meditation space.,
Gather the necessary materials.,
Create business cards and a personal webpage.,
Spread the word.,
Advertise.,
Start with a low number of students and gradually increase.,
Continually improve your own meditative skills.",How to Teach Meditation," You will need to prepare yourself differently if you want to teach meditation at a master level than you would if you only plan on teaching meditation to a room of beginners. Additionally, while most meditation students are adults, some teachers are now expanding their practice to children. Children require a less structured, less formal type of meditation that focuses primarily on relaxation techniques.;
, If there is a certain style you already practice and feel dedicated to, that is likely the best option. If you are not presently dedicated to one style of meditation, however, you should consider practicing a few different types to determine which appeals most to you. There are many types available, but some are more common or easier to teach than others.Transcendental meditation (TM) relies on the use of mantras to achieve a state of ""transcendental consciousness,"" or a settled mind.
Guided visualization is the practice of guiding the mind through a series of images to achieve a balanced state of mind and is especially useful in overcoming stress or fears. It is also one of the easier types of meditation to teach since teachers can guide students through these visualizations.
Zen meditation is the practice of focused seated meditation in order to practice one's connection with the true nature of reality, or emptiness. A great deal of emphasis is placed on posture and technique.
Osho meditation begins with physical activity, like a nature walk, and concludes in silent time.
Taoist meditation relies on quiet stillness and concentration. One usually focuses on breathing techniques in order to achieve a better sense of concentration.

, Before you can become a teacher of meditation, you must first be a student of it. Regularly attend meditation classes of your chosen discipline with a certified meditation teacher. Taking classes with a meditation master is one of the best ways to learn a meditation technique thoroughly, and you will also be able to see, first hand, how a meditation master teaches students. Continue your classes for as long as necessary until you are able to master the discipline without assistance, even if it takes you several months or years.

, Your own mediation teacher is a good person to start with, but you should talk with others about their own experiences teaching meditation. A good way to go about it is by connecting with meditation experts through online forums and blogs, but you can also contact meditation masters in your area and talk with them in person about their experiences as long as you make it clear to them that you will not be hiring them for their services.


Work at establishing long-term relationships with as many meditation teachers as possible. If you build a relationship, you can continually go back to the more experienced teacher for advice and guidance. This also allows you to network with other meditation masters, which makes it easier to stay up-to-date about various practices and ideas.

, Find a legitimate, professional certification program for your chosen meditation style. Both online and in person programs exist, and they can range in both expense and time. Classes can last for several weeks to several years. For best results, look for a program that is, itself, certified or backed by a professional organization, such as the International Meditation Teachers Associationor the American Institute of Health Care Professionals.


Consider applying for membership with one of these meditation associations after completing your certification. Doing so will allow you to network with other meditation teachers and will also make it easier for students to find you.

, The space you need will largely depend on whether you plan on teaching individual students or classes. For individual students, you can set up a space in your home or meet them in theirs. For classes, you will probably need to rent a building or a room large enough to accommodate a 10 to 15 people.

, Some forms of meditation require little more than a mat to sit on, but others require more. Visualization meditation, for instance, can occasionally benefit from the use of guided visualizations on CD, even though these are not always necessary. Materials you can use to create a fitting ambiance, like candles or calming music, can also be beneficial to have.

, These are the basic tools used to advertise any business. The business card should state your name and contact information as well as the type of meditation you teach, your level of certification, and your website address.

, Tell your family, friends, neighbors, and acquaintances about your new meditation classes. They may not be interested, but they might know someone who would be.

, Newspaper ads and digital ads on Internet classifieds can reach a large number of people, but for a more focused advertisement campaign, post ads in mediation newsletters, at New Age stores, or on meditation message boards online.

, This is especially important if you teach meditation on an individual basis. You may have the time to meet with 15 students a day, but that doesn’t mean you should, at least not right away. Start with a small, manageable number of students to get an accurate idea of the demands of teaching. If you get stressed, it make you less balanced and less able to demonstrate to your students the proper way to be balanced.

, A good student never stops learning, and you need to be a good student in order to be a good teacher. Keep yourself updated on the latest news, research, and techniques regarding meditation. Continue to meet with your own meditation teacher or to expand your knowledge of meditation to other techniques.

Start with the guru bead.,
Use your thumb to pull one bead toward you.,
Continue moving one bead per mantra.,
Stop once you reach the guru bead.,
Flip the mala around and continue counting.,
Keep the mala in a special and clean space.",How to Use a Mala2," Find a quiet and comfortable place to sit, and take a moment of silence before beginning your meditation and mantra. Find the guru bead on your mala once you have settled. The guru bead is meant to function as a place of reflection and acknowledgement that will help ground your meditation. Once you have found the guru bead spend time deciding on a mantra.Mantras are often given by spiritual teacher or advisors. However, you can try using a positive affirmation in place of a mantra if you have not been given one by a teacher. Try an affirmation like, “I love myself,” or repeat a word like “Calm.”You do not need to have a mantra in order to use a mala. Malas can also be used in silent meditation.

, Once you have chosen a mantra, and have collected yourself, begin by pulling one counting bead toward you. Use your thumb to pull the bead and let the mala slide over your third finger. Each counting bead you pull should correspond with one recitation of a mantra.If you are not meditating with a mantra, use your mala to count breaths instead.
Although all of the beads on the mala, other than the guru bead, are called counting beads, you will not be counting outloud or in your head. Rather, the beads will be doing the counting for you as you scroll through and “count” with each breath or mantra.

, Continue counting a bead with each breath or mantra you recite. Try to keep your counting as consistent as possible so that you can receive the full effects of your meditation. Part of the intention of the mala is to count your breaths or recitations so that you don’t have to.


Remember, using a mala should be a contemplative process and allow you to relax and concentrate on your meditation.

, The guru bead should not be counted with the other counting beads and it should not be passed over. Instead, take another moment of silence and inner collection once you have reached the guru bead. Then, decide whether you would like to continue counting beads or to end your meditation. If you would like to end your meditation, simply remove the mala and put it in a clean and safe place.Remember, each mantra recitation or meditation should continue until you reach the guru bead.Malas can come in a variety of sizes, from 108 beads to as little as 21. The length of your meditation will depend on the length of your mala.

, If you are reciting your mantra in repetitions, or want a longer meditation, flip the mala around once you reach the guru bead. Take the mala and turn it so the guru bead is just below your thumb. Once repositioned, continue counting each bead as you have done throughout your meditation or mantra recitation.Each mala should be used for only one mantra. If you would like to recite multiple mantras in one meditation, try to have one mala for each mantra., Make sure that your mala is kept somewhere where it will be kept clean and ready for meditation. Malas often have spiritual significance to those that use them, so try and find a sacred space to keep them in. This could be among grounding stones, healing herbs, or other spaces dedicated to meditation and spiritual practice.


Try keeping your mala in a box or jewelry case so that it will stay clean and only be used for meditation.

Grasp a bead with each hand at random.,
Move your hands toward each other by counting in threes.,
Continue until there are no more than three beads between your hands.,
Repeat the grasping and counting three times.,
Consult a divination chart with your results.",How to Use a Mala3," Place the mala in your lap and grasp it with both hands. The goal of divination is to reveal intentions and encounters that are otherwise unknown to you, so grasping at random in essential. Try closing your eyes while you grasp the mala to be sure your selection is as random as possible., Begin counting by three beads at a time once you have a bead in each hand. You should be moving each hand closer to one another as you count. There is no specific form for moving your hands through the mala in divination, so try whatever is most comfortable.The easiest way to count by threes is to use your thumb to move each bead while the mala rests on your index finger for support.

, Continue counting until there are three, two, or one bead in between your hands. Each number has a specific significance in the process of divination. Make a mental note, or a quick note on a piece of paper, of how many beads are in between your fingers., In order to have a complete divinatory practice you will need to repeat the initial grasping and counting three times in total. The number of beads that remain in between your fingers (three, two, or one) will have a specific significance depending on which repetition they were counted., Consulting a divination chart will allow you to read and understand the divination you have just performed. If you are practicing divination within a specific tradition, like Tibetan Mala Divination, use a chart that corresponds to that tradition. Divination results and readings will vary depending on which chart and tradition you consult."
"
Find a quiet, peaceful place and settle into a comfortable posture.,
Consider the ways this meditation can go astray and lose direction.,
Once you have calmed the mind, start to recollect the Buddha.,
To recollect the Dharma (ie, what the Buddha taught), there is a useful line of things to consider and test:


The teachings are of benefit because they are good in the beginning, middle and end.,
To recollect the Sangha (or Buddhist community), consider or bring to mind the members of the community who themselves are:


True to the teaching (ie, practice what they teach and are well familiar with what the Buddha taught).,
Consider some of the following suggestions to develop the meditation further:
If an image or mental image arises during any of the three, spend time examining it without losing track of the theme you were studying.","How to Practice Recollection of the ""Triple Gem"" Meditation"," To choose a type that suits you best, the Do Mindful Meditation looks at the four postures that you can try. Spend a few minutes relaxing the mind and body and use these minutes to build a sense of mindfulness and awareness.


Like most meditations, sincerity is very important. This is no different and in many ways the most important factor. To be sincere means to go the distance and not settle halfway.;
,


Getting lost in doubts and worries. Doubts happen to many and many feel a sense of shame, worry, fear or uneasiness that doubts still remain. but those who have applied the dharma in a simple experimental format in their day to day lives - supposition or hypothesis, then the application and testing then finally the observations, meaning that once you have something you wish to test, the test is done and the results observed.
Being lost in attachment and dreams. This one is subtle, tricky and hard to expose. The main reason is because most Buddhists are deceptively attached to the Buddha, having their own fantasies of what he was like and dreams of meeting him. Most Buddhists are also attached to the dharma (should they be stream enterers, or very devout) and many have attachment to the sangha and monastic community.


The point of this section is to show to the practitioner that faith alone is not the path, but faith can lead to letting go if applied correctly. Strictly speaking, confidence in the Buddha is not the same as faith in the western sense, as the confidence is built on tangible experiences so the element of belief is not present. The Buddha also left us with an analogy for the second challenge, when you use the boat to cross the river, you don't carry the boat around on your head once you reach the other side. It is more common that practitioners do one of the two extremes, abandon the boat too quickly and go overboard, or when the chance to put down the burden finally comes, the practitioner prefers the richness of culture and traditions and consequently stays in the boat, consequently not putting a foot on dry land.

, Some examples of many are to consider:


The virtue of the Buddha.
Characteristics that inspire you and why these characteristics are admirable.
The rarity of Buddha's or ""Awakened Ones"".
The mental prowess of the Buddha in terms of meditation and wisdom Again take note if you are fantasizing about the stories or dreaming of traveling through time and meeting the Buddha (etc). Its far more an objective practice not to grow attached to the Buddha as a person or idea, but to consider if the Buddha is worth listening to and trying what he taught. This is freedom of choice which is quite subtly central and highly important to the whole teaching and practice, because the choice to let go and to cross the river is always has always been up to us.
There is a common misconception in other religions that having a Buddha statue is a form of idol worship. Although no experienced Buddhist actually believes that Buddha is in front of them, interestingly this problem is actually universal in all religions. Although some have statues, icons and symbols and all of them have words, the exact same mental process of what can be called idol-worship can arise in the mind without needing any icon or statue at all. It is a highly deceptive trap and because such attachment and desires arise from the mind, it is best to investigate there first.

, This are consistent and aren't harmful or encourage disharmony or ""leading you up the garden path"".
Can be seen here and now when you investigate and apply them.
Are timeless, so not relevant just to a certain time, culture, person or place, but relevant anywhere.
Inviting you to investigate them. Literally you are encouraged to test any of the principles.
Onward leading. They are not without a purpose or benefit. They lead to your present & future well-being.
Directly experienced by the wise. Those who have let go of clinging to things and grown disenchanted with wanting and rejecting can experience exactly what is going on. This doesn't happen to people who want to continue holding onto things that don't bring release.
Be sincere and measure against your own experiences. Avoid considering any of these things blindly in ""dumb faith"". Evaluate it objectively, deliberately and in context to your life and the world. If you don't evaluate honestly and sincerely, then this recollection gives little benefit or meaning, will seem dull and pointless or even worse, it can make your mind simply unable to investigate and understand the mind and the body which for a practitioner dedicated to the path will be a major obstacle to further progression.
The way measuring can go wrong is when a person measures against another person with a self focus. Sometimes this can be a good thing, as it can inspire a person to strive to improve themselves, but sometimes it can be used to build states of mind which are unhelpful. Measuring is about looking at a past experience either pleasant or unpleasant and asking - what was going on? What factors were or were not in play? You can consider if the situation could have been improved, or what would have made a situation worse.

,
That have not only practiced, but gained the benefit of understanding and release in various or full degrees.
Worthy of the donations of food, clothing (etc) that they receive.
Honorable to give or receive hospitality & lodgings.
Are worthy of visiting, listening to and can explain the teaching both basically and in depth.
The point of this section is looking at the admirable members is simply that they are admirable and inspiring to help you walk your own path. When a practitioner looks to the negative examples - and every society has them - it can really only be of benefit if you are looking in yourself to see if the same problems exist and then act to remove the problem from yourself, so that you can be an admirable member of the community that can help others.

, This can take some practice, but the image often arises because of the theme and goes away when the theme is dropped. If the conditions are right (and this is seldom the case), allow the image to take the whole scope of your awareness as you relax further into it. If the conditions aren't right, try to develop the image each time you meditate.
Practicing compassion, equanimity, appreciation or loving kindness and goodwill type meditations in conjunction with this meditation is useful to develop more applicable or practical use of the triple gem meditation.
Study the three aspects deeper on a more practical level. Why is the Buddha a good role model, why is the Dharma said to be of benefit, why is the community so important? Find practical ways you can incorporate what you learn into your day to day life.

Use the beads to help count your prayers or mantras, not as a rigid amount of prayers you must say.,
Understand the make-up of a mala.,
Perform a prayer for each bead.,
Do not skip over the guru bead once you've completed the first set.,
Store your mala in a clean, high place, or around you neck and hands.",How to Say a Buddhist Prayer2," The prayer beads, also known as Mala, are used to keep track of your prayers, not as some punishment or benchmark. They are a bit like rosaries, but know that they are there to help, not hinder, your spiritual practice.Counting the beads activates your body in the prayer, allowing you to work the body (beads), mind (prayer), and spirit (visualization) at once.
You can use whatever prayers or mantras you desire with your beads.
Prayer beads can be found online, or purchased at many Buddhist temples or Tibetan shops.

, There are, usually 108 beads on a Tibetan Prayer Bead, plus one larger ""head bead."" Whenever you get around the mala, you're considered to have accomplished 100 prayers/mantras, with the other 8 used as spares in case you miscounted or missed a mantra.


Some people believe the head bead has special significance, and it is sometimes called the ""guru bead."" This bead is your teacher, leading you through the prayer cycle., Close your eyes and feel the first bead, often the head bead. Perform your prayer or mantra completely, then move up to the next bead, feeling your way up the mala. Some people use different mantras for the different sized beads, if you have them.


You may use your right or left hand to count on.
Don't worry about getting it all ""perfect."" Focus on visualizing your prayer as you say it, staying completely in the current moment. Ground yourself in the physical world by keeping your hands on your current bead.

, Once you've gone all the way around the beads, flip the chain over and keep going in the same direction you were already going.


This is mostly symbolic, indicating that you would not ""step-over"" your teacher, guru, or head., There is nothing wrong with wearing your mala, keeping it with you so that you can count your prayers anywhere. If you are not carrying it, hang it somewhere out of the way or on your alter, tucked away safely."
"
Choose a quiet, peaceful place to meditate and a comfortable posture.,
Firstly consider the many ways this meditation can go astray.,
Relax the tension and spend another few moments practicing awareness to become perfectly aware of what is going on in the mind.,
Start to develop ways of accepting the fact by measuring against your own experiences.,
Start now to practice ways of improving the well being of your life.",How to Practice Mindfulness of Death Meditation," The Do Mindful Meditation pages looks at the four postures in a little more detail, but any of the four will do for this subject. This meditation shouldn't be attempted by those in distress, in an unbalanced frame of mind, or those inclined to fantasy and should have a firm grounding of mindfulness.


Before starting, the practitioner should recognize that the focus of the meditation is totally objective and scientific, not personalized. Where (eg) loving kindness or goodwill is focused specifically towards individuals and people in mind, this one is not.
As with other meditations sincerity is essential, but the practice of virtue is also highly important in this meditation.;
, Just like many other meditations, this one seldom stays on target and the mind wanders about in a whole scope of ways. The problem is a complicated duality in the mind, part of the mind wants to look into the subject of death, another part wants not only deny it but to stay as far away from the subject as possible. Some examples of many to avoid thinking about are:


The death of yourself in terms of fantasy such as how you'd imagine your funeral, who you would see and what you would like to say to them.
How you will die as it provokes fear and anxiety.
How other people that you love will die, since it will make you sad or anxious
How others will die that you don't like because it will make you feel glad for all the wrong reasons.
Where you and others will go after death. This often causes the most problems as the mind starts to become anxious, or is more likely to become prone to fantasy.
Falling into melancholia, or other emotions such as regret, fear, anger, worry etc. Crudely speaking, if the practitioner feels sad or angry (etc), it is a very clear sign they are not doing it right and so will need to start again.

, If it is still unsettled it is best to relax and focus on some aspect such as the breath a bit further, or to move to a different meditation practice, such as mindfulness. Meditation of death can be very depression. Once you feel that you are relaxed, stable and aware start to consider one of all of the following suggestions, keeping consistent awareness in check.


Consider the event of death as having the appearance of an assassin. No matter when or where you are, you won't escape this appointment.
Consider the indifference of the end of life. No matter how successful you are in your ventures, or how much you plan, beg or negotiate there is nothing that can prevent it.
Expand you scope and compare to all peoples. The famous and wealthy, those who do good things, those who are very strong mentally or physically, had perfect health (etc), those with power, technology (etc), were sages, saints, prophets or wise people. None could prevent death. It's not a matter of ability, or attainments or personal status.
Consider how the body is composite and an ecosystem. Your body is host to bacteria in the gut, viruses, parasites, skin flora etc. Likewise composite in the biological sense of blood, flesh etc. These things can keep you alive (in the normal sense) or make you fatally ill if any part becomes infected.
Observe the conditional nature of life. You need food & water, sleep, air, light, the right temperatures (etc), you need the organs and muscles to be able to breath, pump blood, digest food etc. You need the ability to get food and know safety and danger etc. Can you live without them?
Evaluate it can be natural or unnatural. Death may occur in our sleep, or we may be involved in an accident or other event. It can be at our choosing, or without our choosing.
Consider its unpredictability. We will never really know how long life is, when the time comes, how or where. There's no way to properly define how and when with 100% certainty.
Think about the shortness of life. A long life is 90 to 100 years, few live beyond that or even make it that far. Days soon become weeks, months, years etc.
Look at the shortness of the moment. We are only here now, the past is gone and the future isn't here yet. Tomorrow (technically) never comes, there's only the ""now"", which doesn't stop because people die.
Measure these against you own experiences of people you know that have died. Also expand to understanding that death happens constantly, everywhere on earth something or someone, somewhere is dying right now.


This section is about recognizing that everyone experiences a struggle against death at some point or often in their lives either out of fear, despair, anger and other concerns. Nobody wants death when they live happy lives, but it is important to reflect there are many people who do not live happy lives and become either embittered by unhappiness, or experience so much pain they wish to end their lives. Regardless of our own levels of happiness and aspirations, it comes to us all. Regardless of who we are and what wonderful things we may attain, it too will come to us eventually. The fight against it, as well as the feelings about death and what comes afterwards causes so much distress, sorrow and anger in the world and ourselves. The practitioner should question the wisdom of extreme emotions when we may die in a few seconds, days, months, years or decades. The things we cannot predict may be jut around the corner.

, Have there been times that death has caused you fear or stress? The important aspect to investigate is that did the wanting to know, wanting to prevent or change already occurred deaths (etc) cause you misery? Ultimately what leads us back every time to the four noble truths is the wanting of things to be, or not to be. The question for the practitioner then to investigate, is does the stress, fear, anger (etc) abate, when that desire is released?

, While the facts of life may cause of sorrow and despair, it still doesn't need to be so. Some ways of many to improve your happiness and well being are listed as follows, but the practitioner should reflect again that without sincerity, it will be virtually impossible to come to terms and transcend the issues.


Practice virtue. The innocent really do have nothing to fear.
Practice investigative understanding. The wise likewise have nothing to fear as they know that we can hasten illness, unhappiness and injury by living carelessly.
Practice appreciation. When we are unhappy with what we have, by valuing the many things that touch our hearts we balance out the dissatisfaction and we can build appreciation to make it of greater value.
Practice goodwill or loving kindness. Not just to others but ourselves when we fell angry about how we cannot prevent death, or that there isn't someone we can turn to to do it for us.
Practice equanimity. This pulls us back into balance when we run off into fits of emotion. Equanimity is the great balancer.
Practice compassion. Compassion finally reminds us that all beings are in the same boat, bound to the same wheel of life. Only when we understand how we are bound to it will we ever be free of it.

Select a quiet, restful place and choose a good posture to meditate.,
Learn what the ""elements"" are in order to study them in the classical way.,
Examine the solids or earth group (as per the list found on the body mindfulness meditation page).,
Expand to the next elemental group (liquids) starting with bile.,
Move on to temperature or fire element.,
Continue on to air.,
To develop the meditation further, practice some of the following.",How to Practice Meditation on Elements,"
The Do Mindful Meditation page looks at the four postures more in depth, but sitting meditation is likely to be the most practical and give the best benefits.
It is also very important to read or practice body mindfulness meditation first as this theme actually is very similar, using a memory list from this meditation. Once you have learnt that list you can practice this meditation more easily.
By practicing body mindfulness just before element meditation will also offer the practitioner some increased awareness or concentration advantages as the mind has already relaxed and settled into meditating.;
, These ancient elemental physics are something taught well before the periodical chart we use today. The environment and universe was divided into four symbolic elements or properties, but as they have a slightly more complex physical property, their names can be rather representative.


Earth - anything solid, stiff, dry, brittle etc.
Water - anything liquid or malleable, but also represents cohesion.
Fire - temperature both hot and cold.
Wind - air, gasses, air pockets, voids, pressure changes, farts, movement etc
Part of the meditation requires the practitioner to be familiar with how these properties appear and interact. Earth is anything solid, but as dust is a solid, it needs cohesion (water element) which is the glue that holds it all together or the solids will return to raw separate atoms. As there is no simple glue-like substance that holds atoms together other than nuclear binding energy, this energy comes under the water element. Often energy would sound like it comes under fire, but it can also come under wind if it creates movement. It can always be several things at once such as microwaves creating friction (wind) which generates heat (fire) when heating food.
The subject can be simplified just by looking at ordinary water. If it moves, then it looks to currents and pressure changes in the water which belong to the ""wind"" element, likewise if it is mist or steam. If it has temperature either hot or cold then it is fire, if it is stiff (frozen), that is earth property. Water on its own has no intrinsic defining characteristic apart from liquidity and the cohesion of oxygen and hydrogen atoms, every other characteristic belongs to the other groups. That's what its about, putting physics into symbolic representations and groups.
In a more modern context, if you have knowledge of analytical chemistry, you can also break it down into actual elements, such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, calcium, potassium, phosphorous etc, but it takes exceptionally deep meditation skills to see the individual atomic forms, its fine to practice if you are aware of what (for example) bones are already made of chemically.

,
Focus on a specific part (such as head hair) and consider the following things:
Its basic structure - it's a solid so is earth element.
Its location - It grows out of the scalp. The scalp doesn't know there is hair coming out of it and the hair doesn't know its growing in the scalp. Hair doesn't think, it just is.
Does it change or is it permanent? - it changes by growing longer, falling out in combs or brushes, grows thin with age and so on, without our direct control.
Does it have a self, is it the self? Is this part me, mine, what I am? (etc). As it neither contains ""entity"" or is the ""soul"", it has no intrinsic self nature.
There is effectively no time limit the practitioner should spend examining each component of the body that has the earth characteristic. You can spend as long as you want doing this, a few minutes before moving onto the next part or element or the whole meditation focusing on one body component or one elemental group.

, Ask yourself the same questions, investigating the same way. You can also continue the same as above focusing on just one component, or following through until you have done the entire group.
You may also do a meditation solely on liquid elemental signatures (so not involving earth at all), but for beginners it is usually best to try all aspects to gain a more solid foundation and experience in order to develop this meditation further.

, The list found on the body mindfulness meditation page was already divided into two groups, solids and liquids and does not include wind or fire elements in the repetition, so there are two methods to proceed.
The first method will now need to leave the anatomical list behind to expand into the next groups, but for the second method the list is still very useful as it can be used as a prop. Both methods are valid, just as good as each other and can be used together or separately.
For the first method, look for the raw elemental signature. For fire it will be looking where warmth or coldness is generally, how warmth is generated or obtained - metabolic, chemical, kinetic, external environment (etc).
For the second method, the list can be used to reuse the list looking for its individual wind or fire element in each component such as (eg) lungs are a solid, but also are warm so have fire element, through movement they generate some heat energy. Head hair on the other hand is exposed to air, but does not generate its own metabolic heat, rather it gains warmth from being part of the body and warmth from relative air temperature. You can expand this exploration as much as you like.
Generally speaking, the second method is broken up to consider the first two groups again (solids and liquids) but both methods ask the practitioner to consider these things in relation to them:


Is it something that is warmed. Look at the current temperature of various parts is it heated by something else or generate its own warmth? Much of the body doesn't, which is why it gets cold.
Something that ages. Does the part you are looking at change and grow old?
Something that burns up. Do extremes of heat destroy these parts?
Something that is consumed to generate heat.
Something where it is digested and broken down through the use of heat, or generates metabolic heat - food and other wastes.
Does the heat in the body have a self, is it the self? Does heat or energy think? (etc).
It can be simply expanded that because the entirety of the universe and (ourselves) is divisible into elemental and atomic forms, which are also divisible into energy forms, the question of where does the soul remain still arises. In Buddhism, the soul is an illusion, a deception and sometimes just a general conceptual term we use to describe a person (such as, ""he was a good old soul""). If energy was soul or self it logically follows, we must ask that by burning a candle, or turning on a lightswitch, are we burning ""soul"" or souls? The concept is silly to anyone, so where is the soul when it exists in nothing?
Metaphorically, some thinkers have actually got this far and then pounced that the emptiness must be the soul, God, or some form of divine ""God-ness"", as they were not able to be comfortable with the rather ego-deflating, but also incredibly vast idea that soul is simply a concept and that empty impermanence and constant dynamic change and flux is the ultimate reality of the entire universe.

, For the wind element it is to look for air such as breath or external wind, air pockets such as around the joints, in the bowels etc. It also covers movement with expansion and contraction for breathing, or the heat beat which both count as air element.
You can use either of the two methods are per the fire element. Consider these things about the body:
Look literally at air and wind in the body such as in the lungs, intestines, bowels (and so on).
Look at the small air pockets in the muscles, by bending and stretching small muscles to increase its pressure, does that make more larger scale muscle movement such as walking?
Are gases or movement part of the self, have a self, is it the self? Does movement think?

,
Consider the ""non responsive"" nature to elements. If you dig a hole in the ground, the ground doesn't protest. When you go to the toilet, the water doesn't protest and so on. Does energy or atoms feel individually or collectively or at all? Feeling is merely a process in the brain reacting to physical and mental stimulus, but the body feels through sensory organs and that data is used by the mind to generate sensation. The mind being broader than just the brain or the heart is a revealing part of the nature of the mind and body.
If any part at anytime becomes visible as an image, either the body component you are focusing on or the element becoming symbolic, keep giving attention to that over and over as a way to focus concentration building.
Examine further that if you were to break everything down into atoms, you can see how the elements stay together. This body is dependent on physical processes to prevent it from breaking down and falling to bits. You can also examine how the atoms that make us up also make up other things and they ultimately just change location, without any grand scheme behind it.
Keep practicing until you start to get an understanding of what you are looking at. It will take some time, but its not time wasted if you use it to find out what you really are.

Know the background of Vipassana.,
Try out the most common forms.,
Choose one that feels right for you.",How to Practice Vipassana Meditation1," Knowing the meaning actually makes the practice much easier and cuts through a lot of confusion. Vipassana is a Pali word (Pali is the name given to an ancient Indian dialect) which means ""clear vision"" (passati as the main root verb = to see). It doesn't entirely mean clear awareness, as in mindfulness, which the Pali term used is sampajana.


Its role in the noble eightfold path is an area of debate, but seems to be more aligned with samma ditthi ""right view"", rather than samma samadhi, ""right meditation"", the latter of which is very clearly defined.
Properly speaking, the early Buddhist texts do not have a technique or method of vipassana per se. In the context of the early Buddhist texts that scholars have shown to be from the time of the Buddha, it is always used in conjunction, and more often as a result of samatha or stillness meditations and particularly dhyana / jhana. In the early texts it's often presented as a dual word - samatha-vipassana, which one may translate as ""the insight of stillness"" (if used as a genitive tappurisa compound).
After the Buddha it started to develop into a wide range of schools, particularly in Myanmar. The well known Vipassana movements of today generally date no earlier than the late 19th century to current time.;
, Out of all the various vipassana techniques, mindfulness type meditations are the most common forms that are practiced. Such examples include mental body scanning of the bodily internals such as the skeletal structure, organs and so on; observing physical sensations; observing emotions, thoughts and other mental activities; general awareness of mindfulness and mental noting; observing a specific object, such as the breath, a flower or a candle flame all of which gradually reveal their true characteristics of impermanence, non-ownership and suffering.

, This may take some time to experiment, and ideally you should give each style a good two week trial, but generally the right kind of meditation for you feels right, almost like a coming home. Try different teachers until you find one that feels right for you, but there are three important things to bear in mind so you can get the best results:


Firstly, practice as closely as it is taught. A general rule is that meditation styles that work, bear quick results, but styles that don't work, will never work. Being faithful to the method can ensure results, but also bear in mind some people are more receptive to meditation practices than others.
Read suttas and manuals carefully. There is a great deal written about Buddhist Vipassana meditation and a lot can be confusing or contradictory, particularly modern texts. A good teacher is able to show you how to navigate the various ideas of the late and modern Buddhist texts.
Fundamental to Vipassana, according to the early Buddhist texts, is a letting go, a relinquishing of everything in order to lead into stillness and deep understanding. Trivia, politics, dogmas and guru or personality cults are certainly common in all schools and religions worldwide, yet are obstacles to insight in the present and certainly in the future. They are a powerful firewall that the Buddha recommends to practice of wise abandoning, kindness, compassion and generosity as tools to break through.

"
"
Start by settling your body.,
Be generous with this time to relax.,
Move your awareness around your body to make any needed adjustments.,
Focus gently on your object.,
Continue to observe and explore.,
Let go of more things once the mind settles.,
Allow the meditation to follow its course.,
After the meditation, reflect.",How to Practice Vipassana Meditation2," It is very important to relax and to let the body be at ease. Contrary to many ideas about meditation, 'no pain, no gain' is something the Buddha described in his first discourse (the Dhammacakkapavattana sutta) as a fruitless endeavour, or in Buddhist terminology 'wrong view'. The early Buddhist texts often show that ancient practitioners used chairs, beds, cushions, back rests and leaning boards, so even for experienced meditators these things are useful tools.

, Ideally, practice vipassana meditation on a quiet weekend or self retreat, as it can be too challenging after a long busy day to be effective, except for longstanding practitioners. Far better to take a nap and refresh your senses before meditating.

, When the body feels like it has settled, and this may take a good 15-20 minutes generally (can be more or less depending on the conditions), then move onto the next step. What you are looking for is the mind, the body or whatever you are aware of becoming more present and clear.

, Your style of meditation is essentially going to be your best friend if it is going to bear fruit. Concentration is too harsh and leads to fatigue, so a more gentle awareness is more sustainable and the more you enjoy it, the longer you can stay with your practice. Generally, if nothing is evident, or you are feeling like your object is fading away, expand the size of what you observe.


For example, the breath is typically recommended as watching at the nose, but if that is too difficult to bear in mind, focus on the larger body breath to help settle the mind. If you are tired, your practice will be more productive to rest than to wear yourself out further by forcing.

, The whole point of this structure is to centre your mind and the world gradually fades away, so that you can see your object more clearly.


There is a common objective in modern vipassana that the practitioner must be constantly aware and mindful. This actually reveals a great deal of how the mind and body works, but is generally still too superficial
There is a common objective in modern vipassana that the practitioner must be constantly aware and mindful. This actually reveals a great deal of how the mind and body works, but is generally still too superficial (without its conjoined twin samatha) for the very deep mind to let go and no longer chase after what makes people suffer, with the exception of very rare cases. It is all the same, an amazing intellectual journey.
The Chan/Zen tradition beautifully shows this in the famous story of Hui Neng, the last Zen patriarch. To choose his successor, the former patriarch challenged his students in a poetry contest to reveal who was awakened. The runner up (not awakened) said '...the mind is a mirror, that constantly needs polishing to keep it pure'.

The winner, (who was awakened) wrote; '...there is no mirror, and as the mind is intrinsically void, where is there anywhere for dust to settle?"". This means when you see clearly the reality of the mind and body, there is no more need to constantly be aware, as the mind knows at a very deep level the three characteristics of the world. This is the goal of the practice.



, This is essentially, letting things be, as that way more an more can fade away, this usually makes things much more joyful and blissful.


The early Buddhist teachings explain that it is important to engage the mind on the object, keep it there and then joy develops. If it doesn't and it stays dry, then the skill of the meditator is to start putting a bit of joy or love into what is there. The point of the joy is a mechanism to go even deeper.

, This can require courage as after things really start to fade away, the mind may start to worry that they won't come back - but they do - so it can take a lot of time and gentleness to develop deeply. This actually is a central facet of all types of vipassana, which is to see what faded away and is therefore not what we are.

, This is the starting ground of seeing clearly. As so many imperfections of the mind have fallen away you can reflect and consider much more clearly. Often the big question is, what was there, what wasn't? This will help you develop further and deeper until you have gone so deep and so still, you can see everything as it really is.

Find a quiet and peaceful place to meditate and select a posture that suits you best.,
Start to apply awareness on different aspects of the body.,
Apply the same principles into your normal meditation practice.,
Start to look closely to see how feeling and the body interact.,
Regularly relax and measure against your experiences to see how your progress is coming along.,
Expand the scope again when you can do this to a degree that you feel comfortable with it.,
To develop the practice further, consider or explore some of the following examples.",How to Practice Mindfulness of Body States," The styles of posture are examined more in detail on the Do Mindful Meditation page to help you choose the right one for you. Like all mindfulness meditations, it is applicable to all postures and the more you practice the different styles, the more benefits it gives as you can expand your understanding and skills much quicker.
Start by spending a few moments relaxing with the eyes open or closed and gradually start being aware of what you are doing. Mindfulness of the body states is probably easier than mental states, since the movements and feelings are so much more easy to see and keep track of.;
, There is a host of different ways that this meditation can be applied in different contexts. Here is a basic experiment to start with and practically speaking the mindfulness is not limited, but start with the basics as the wider you can expand your scope, it is easier and quicker to develop the meditation. The aim is to gain a firm familiarity and understanding with the body and its feelings.
You can try it here and now in front of the computer, starting with the most obvious feelings, then move onto more subtle feelings.


Start by being aware of sitting and any feelings that you might feel, such as feeling comfortable or uncomfortable in the chair. Do you have your feet flat on the floor, tucked underneath the chair or sticking out etc. Are your legs shuffling or still? Does your back or neck ache or is it free from tensions? Take a minute to explore your body in this way.
Next, be aware of more environmental aspects and feelings such as the room & body temperature - do parts of you feel hot or cold? Does the chair feel hard or soft?, Do your clothes feel tight or comfortable?, Does the desk and chair affect your posture? etc.
When you are looking at the screen, be aware of looking through the eyes and be aware of the amount of light - too high, too low, or OK? Does the amount of light affect you such as making your eyes strain? Look as well at colours and shapes and be aware of how the mind takes up these images and reacts to them.
Consider your face - is it a smiling, frowning or puzzled look (etc), is it relaxed or tense?
If you move your arm to reach for the mouse, be aware of moving, reaching, touching, gripping, pulling or pushing (etc) of the mouse.
Be aware of breathing, as well as how that influences other body feelings and movements as well as how you can use it to calm the body when it is stressed. How you feel and move here and now generally.

, This meditation can be expanded to everything you possibly can including sitting, walking, standing, lying down, turning, twisting, bending, reaching etc. Really as many movements & feelings as you can possibly take note of. Take advantage of the opportunity to relax any tension that you become aware of and see how the mind and body changes when you relax.
It's always recommended to try to dedicate some time to practice and explore mindfulness. You might spend five minutes or five days and it doesn't really matter in the beginning as something is better than nothing. However the more you are aware and the more practice you give it, the more you can learn and consequently the more insight and understanding can be gained. Long term practice gets the best results as the more subtle insights and realizations are dependent on seeing as many experiences or facets of the body and mind as possible, but also often appear unexpectedly.
Set yourself challenges and try to do it for the entire day from getting up, showering, dressing, cooking, eating, using the toilet, doing housework or whatever duties you do during your day, up until the moment you fall asleep. You can spend a few days or weeks even if time permits.

, You might find most movements are actually in response to feelings of discomfort, such as shuffling a leg if its uncomfortable or if the mind is uneasy or bored, or getting up to get food when hungry etc. Again, take advantage of any chance to relax any tension that arises.
Continue to study all the little subtleties such as how you move in a different ways around friends, people you don't like, or people you feel attracted to (etc) and how the environment influences you.

, Is the awareness becoming easier? Are you developing any understandings of the mind-body dynamic by observing it? Are you relaxing and letting go of more tension, or letting go more often? It is important to regularly ask yourself what benefits you are finding and how you can improve, otherwise it becomes reduced to a ritualized or dumb-practice which gives minimal benefits.
As with all meditations, avoid pushing too hard - if you miss something or have to stop, the world is not going to end. The complication about trying too hard is it creates tension, so it actually would inhibit your ease of practice.
Should you miss something, or get lost in thoughts and feelings, you can always note it after it had happened the moment you are aware that you missed it. The subtle point about this, is it reveals the part of your mind that was aware at the time even when other parts were not and at a later stage it reminded you. This is all part of the complex and divisible nature of the mind.
If you are becoming attached to the mindfulness, then this too should be noted and examined if attachment can cause you stress. Let go of any mental stress and relax any physical tension during this practice.

, Start to look at how the mental states come in and influence your actions. For example, you might feel a need to go to get food, but is there a mental prompting? If you looks closely you may see that the body is simply not able to get food on its own without the mind organising the actions.
The point of this is what seems perfectly logical is not always ""known"" both deeply or consistently. It might make sense that you will feel a mental urgency to go to (eg) the toilet/bathroom, but do you actually know that's what's driving you when you are rushing towards it or heading towards it in autopilot?
The ""wanting"", ""cravings"" or ""intentions"" are the things that drive you, because these desires arise dependent on physical and mental feelings. Because part of your mind experiences unpleasant sensations and pain, it prompts you to act to resolve them as it wants these sensations to stop. As no one wants unpleasant feelings, we act, sometimes even against our will. Many practitioners start focus on this part of the mind as a kind of weak link, hoping that if it can be disabled then they wouldn't experience pain. This is the sign that the practice has lost track. The problem is the mind exists as it is for a good reason - to keep us alive. Its hardwired into the package of survival.
Try to see how feeling is dependent on contact of mind, the body and the sensation. It looks deceptively simple and it is, until you see it in detail as it happens. It's not that obvious as it first looks.
The problem is if you rush into doing or saying something, you don't always know what you are doing and can always do something you regret later. By evaluating the wants behind the actions you can decide if it's worthwhile so you can avoid traps that cause stress.
Look for how thoughts and mental feelings influence how you speak, what you say, what you do and how you do it. When you can intervene or prevent actions that you might later regret, you are developing it to a good use and can effectively avoid doing things that cause stress.

,
1. How each of your actions and speech is conditional on a lot of things, you might think you are doing something, but actions don't do things without an intention, even if you aren't aware of it. You have to know if the intention is going to bring you stress or not.
2. That one action (eg, walking to the fridge) is actually many thousands of little actions. When you can see that its just many mind and body processes, things like change emptiness and stress (or anicca, meaning impermanence, anatta, meaning non-self and dukkha, meaning stress or dissatisfaction ), dependent origination and the four noble truths start to make sense.
3. Practiced in conjunction with body mindfulness which is a very similar, but subtly different meditation will give you a far greater familiarity with the body and building acceptance of what it is.
4. Use the foundation of mindfulness to be aware, or to live in the here and now. Mindfulness helps you pull you back to the present moment, but also to identify you experiences, to observe and to understand, but most importantly, to determine whether the experience is worth holding onto or identifying with. This allows you to be able to start practicing letting go.

Firstly select your posture once you have found a quiet and peaceful place to meditate.,
Settle in comfortably and close your eyes.,
Take a moment now to understand the reason why you wish yourself happiness first.,
Next, wish the people closest to you, your family, your mentors, friends and those you admire the same.,
After each person type, check again your posture and relax any tight spots.,
Next, move on to the people you are acquainted with but don't count as a close friend or member of the previous group.,
Next wish strangers and people you don't know the same happiness as you wished for the above groups.,
Move on to next group, which is sometimes the most challenging - those you don't like.,
After you have wished yourself happiness as well as towards those you know, you can send it in a variety of styles elsewhere, such as:


To all people and beings across the world in the north direction, then the northeast, east etc then those above you such as birds in the sky or worms and insects below in the earth, as well if you live in an apartment complex to send it to your neighbours above and below you.,
Find practical applications for metta in daily life.",How to Practice Loving Kindness Meditation (Metta)," The styles of posture are examined more in detail on the Do Mindful Meditation page to help you choose the right one for you. Loving kindness can be practiced in any posture such as reclining, sitting, standing and walking, although sitting is the default choice. Its best to do what works for you be it sitting on a chair or a cushion, although pacing back and forth is more challenging as you need to stay alert in your walking and at the same time practice the meditation.;
, Spend a few minutes relaxing any tight spots as tension can be a distraction and obstacle to loving kindness. Let go of distractions and thoughts about the day. Being kind to yourself in this way can prepare the mind to relax and be more open. It is very difficult to practice this meditation when the mind or body is tired. You can practice some gentle stretches, looking a peaceful scene such as a garden, enjoying the peace and quiet of the room or other ways you relax. The method is actually flexible so you may choose words that are relevant to you and in fact the results are better if you tailor it to be not only all encompassing, but relevant to your mind. A suggested format is as follows:


Firstly, wish yourself happiness, good health, good success, harmony, the ability to understand stress and let it go and the strength to overcome problems. You might think to yourself: ""May I be happy, may I be free of illness and injury... "" etc
Wish yourself freedom of stress, anger, greed, ill-will and envy. ""May I practice to let go of stress, may I practice to let go of anger..."" etc.
Wish yourself joy, equanimity, compassion and kindness, such as ""May I appreciate what I have experienced. May I be kind to myself, may I let go of my regrets"" etc.
Also wish yourself good progress in your life journey such as: ""May I grow wiser and gain more skills, may I be more kind to myself more often, may I be more patient and less hasty when I am busy"" and so on.

, Many have difficulty wishing themselves happiness. In some cases the practitioner may feel it is better to start with others first, or there are cases where the practitioner still holds some resentment towards themselves. Like a flower, sometimes you have to open up, or allow the heart to open up to see what's inside.


If you cannot be kind to yourself, you are more or less setting yourself up with a new problem, as loving kindness works both ways. If we cannot give it to ourselves, how can we give it to others with sincerity?
It's also much like a candle flame, if you take away the air or the fuel, it simply goes out. Being kind to yourself makes yourself able to continue the meditation without feeling stingy as it acts like fuel. If it is one-sided, it can eventually feel as though the love you send to others is not genuine because you cannot give it everywhere without conditions. It also serves to calm the mind and to be more generous with loving kindness to others.

, You can spend time on each individual person, or as a group if easier and wish them happiness and the same as above. These people you send loving kindness to should be alive, as it can stir up issues in the mind if you send it to the deceased. Much like the previous format directed to ourselves, we then continue by directing the same feelings to others.


""May my relatives be happy. May my relatives have good health, freedom from illness and injury..."" etc.
""May the people I have learned from be happy, may they have good health..."" etc
""May my friends be happy..."" etc

, Keep checking your posture between each group and continue as a practical way to practice kindness to yourself. If a distraction or a resentful thought arises, give yourself time to consider the benefits of such a thought if there are any, as well as observing any potential stressful and non-benevolent characteristics as that way you can learn to recognise them in future. Let go of the thought and if necessary return to your focus with the wish ""May I be peaceful... may I let go of resentment"".

, It might be your neighbours, your local grocer, doctor, co-workers, customers or suppliers of your work etc. Wish them the same happiness that you wished yourself.


Take every opportunity to let go of tension that arises, both in the body and the mind, be gently aware should there be a hardening of the heart if a thought of someone you don't like arises, so you can directly address the issue.

,
You don't have to know them or where they are, but just wish all people happiness. The purpose with this group is to be universal, you may never know who the people you pass in the street or see at the markets are, but if you can remember them, they are ideal subjects to direct feelings of goodwill towards.The practice of metta breaks down a lot of boundaries in the mind so we can be more humane.

, It can be those who have been unkind to you or those you a feel a grudge against. This is hard but breaks down the walls of hatred, rejection and prejudice.


If you try to cannot do it with a certain person (it may even be yourself), then go back and practice compassion by wishing yourself forgiveness, kindness etc because you did try, for that is the point. You can always wish ""may I let go of this resentment, may I be free of this anger"" or whatever feels relevant to you.
Gently work to overcome all individual bias or ill-wills you may experience as they offer no benefit to you or others. This may be to counter the ill-feelings with goodwill, to let them go as they arise, or use them as a basis of understanding, by examining the way the ill-will can overpower goodwill or even insinuate itself into feelings that can appear to be goodwill.

, You can simplify this by sending loving kindness in the forward direction, then to your right hand side, then behind you etc.
After this, you can wish animals and other living things the same happiness and freedom from any suffering.
Wish for people in other countries and continents, wishing for peoples' present and future happiness.

, While it may sound unrealistic in the dog-eat-dog world, but when coupled with common sense and understanding, metta is a very powerful and useful tool.


It is very important to use wisdom in metta, both in its development and its expression as there are aspects where it can make life harder. If you are one sided in your practice, then it will be superficial, but oppositely if you open your heart too much, you can end up feeling like a doormat or exhausted. Metta has to work both ways and in a balanced way.
In all our relationships, such as our relationship with ourselves, with our family, friends, acquaintances, co-workers and our intimate-other, metta can help us gain more patience and insight into our interactions, as well as understand how best to live.

Firstly, make your kasina disc.",How to Practice Kasina Meditation1," It is best to select one of them that feels good to you, or one that you know had been apparent to you at some time or another, even if it seemed coincidental. Some prefer a blue disc over a red one, some prefer the study of light over the study of fire. As it is all relative to each person there is no distinctly right or wrong, there is simply ones that will be effective and ones that won't. All practitioners will vary subtly and in the same way they need to choose the right one for themselves if a qualified instructor cannot recommend one for them. Its recommended to avoid ones which have little appeal as the practitioner will be spending some time observing it. Here's some basic instructions and suggestions to make your own:

For the colours (blue, yellow, red & white) it easiest and cheapest out of a coloured piece of card sourced from a craft store or news agency. It is better to visit a craft store as the range of each colour from darkness to light as well as blended colour tone may seem more preferable to you than another similar tone of the same colour. Use a dinner plate as a template to cut out a round disc. You can also paint a spot on the wall, but a card is simple to obtain and easier to keep tidy.



 


""Earth"" is a light coloured clay disc and in modern times, the most easily sourced equivalent would be a light coloured. unused pizza stone, which may be purchased cheaply from homeware stores.






""Water"" is a bowl of water, but ensure the colour of the container doesn't become the focus as you need to maintain awareness of water. A plain, pattern-free bowl is recommended. Some practitioners focus on a teacup worth, for some it is more apparent when watching the sea. It is important to note that one is not better than the other, as it is relative.






""Light"" is easiest with light shining on the floor, particularly if it is an unpatterned floor such as a white carpet, lino or tile. Another good option is large board with a hole in the centre position very much like a pinhole camera so the light shines through the hole onto the ground or a wall, this image on the ground or wall is the object of focus.






""Fire"" is easiest with a candle, or a glass fronted wood stove. Aim to ensure your eyes do not get tired by heat exposure, or its brightness.






""Wind"" and ""space"" needs nothing at all apart from space in the air, or wind in the trees. This one can be practiced anywhere outside.






The size is also variable. A dinner plate size is OK, but you can make it smaller or larger according to what works for you. Too large may be a distraction, too small may be difficult to focus on.





;
"
"
Position your disc in a place you can sit and see it comfortably without developing any discomfort in the neck, shoulders etc.,
Observe the characteristic of your disc, such as repeating mentally ""water, water"" or ""space, space"" etc.,
Gaze gently at the disc and relax into it, as strong, rigid focus can create strain which can be a hindrance.,
Find yourself a quiet place with minimal disturbances if where you are is no longer suitable.,
Keep observing the new image and noting the characteristic.",How to Practice Kasina Meditation2," You can use a chair and many work better with the use of one, however the height is important, as is how far away the Kasina is. This is relative, but choose a chair that is fairly low and will not strain the neck and the kasina should be close enough to be able to focus firmly on it, so neither too close nor too far.

, You can use any word that appeals or feels relevant, but English only has limited words for things like light, the colours, water etc.


Repeating its characteristic helps focus solely on the subject rather than getting distracted with thoughts.

, Problematically for many is that the image most often appears when we aren't paying it too much attention, such as when in day to day life we're gazing into space a shadow image just happens. People who have been good at hidden picture puzzles or other optical puzzles have a head start as they are already familiar with persistent focus.


Eventually an image will arise from it, it might appear floating in front of the disc, or be the reverse image of it. It might move, or it might be still. This can take some time so it is best not to practice this style of meditation if you cannot dedicate some real time to it. Common history tells the story of a man who spent 40 days in the desert and developed the earth kasina and some monks spend many months on the subject. It might not happen immediately or quickly, so giving fair time is important to find out and to develop what does arise.






Refrain from forcing it to do something, or trying to change it as that becomes the new focus of attention, not the kasina you've been studying. They arise easier if you don't try to make it happen but just relax into it. This is why they happen on their own sometimes in day to day life.







, Select a comfortable posture and the Do Mindful Meditation page has a look at the four styles to help you select one, although sitting, standing or reclining are the best types. Observe the counterpart image once it is visible (sometimes you will need the eyes shut, sometimes you don't). It depends how well you focused on the original to how well it stays. Sometimes the image might last a few seconds, or a minute, or a fair while. If it fades away, go back and focus on the original again until the symbol appears again.
When the image arises, avoid speaking to other people, or using words mentally as that's the easiest way to make the image go away. Its recommended you protect the image as something most precious and to observe it silently with word-less awareness.

, Develop it, enrich it, make it your total focus of attention which does require gentle but consistent and persistent concentration. Some images you can enlarge, some won't - it depends on the type and the person.


Let everything fade away so there is just the image and relax into it. Eventually the mind becomes fully absorbed into the image, which you can then use to develop insight.

To develop it further ensure the mind is calm, bright and aware.",How to Practice Kasina Meditation3," Start examining a subject you wish to study deeply. The mind being more calmed is less likely to distort what you are seeing and the deeper focus means it is easier to investigate things more deeply and quickly. Some good subjects would be:
1. The Four Noble Truths
2. The Noble Eightfold Path,
3. Anicca, anatta and dukkha (known as change & impermanence, emptiness & voidness and ""Dukkha"" standing for stress and dissatisfaction.
4. Cause and effect (Karma)
5. Mindfulness of the mind and body and how they interact with other factors.
6. The application and benefit of letting go and;
7. Application effects of the four Brahma Viharas, also known as goodwill, compassion, appreciative joy and equanimity."
"
Build some groundwork before you start in order to get the best results.,
Select a comfortable posture in a quiet and peaceful place to meditate.,
Turn your mind towards those you have seen or known to have experienced a misfortune.,
Wish them freedom of their sorrow or stress and recovery to a happier, healthier and more successful present & future.,
Practice gentle mindfulness and awareness of just compassion.,
Regularly let go of any other barriers that occur in your mind.,
Explore with the ways true compassion can become false or harmful.,
Consider ways that you can be more compassionate in your day to day life.",How to Practice Compassion Meditation," Unlike other meditations such as loving kindness or appreciative joy, you neither start with yourself, nor direct it to your nearest and dearest in ordinary circumstances. Those who are neutral or disliked also don't get much of a mention, because this meditation doesn't really change your view of them. You have to change it first using goodwill, then turn your mind to these groups.


Ideally practice Loving kindness before practicing compassion as it can help develop the mind to this meditation, like good rich soil develops beautiful flowers and better crops.
As compassion can take time to develop, think about this analogy. Its like trying to light a fire while outside in a storm, you need to protect the match-flame from being blown out and when it has grown enough to burn twigs and leaves, you still need to protect it until the fire can support itself. In this the flame is compassion and for beginners it is very weak until it is strong enough to naturally support itself. The light is so easily lost and blown out if there is not enough fuel to build it up with.

Most important in this meditation is sincerity. The problem is if the practitioner is not sincere in their compassion it becomes shallow and harder to express, but also that it very easily becomes false compassion. For beginner practitioners it is recommended to focus only on those that you can be sincere about in the beginning, then as experience grows expand it more and more broadly until it is limitless. The level of true compassion you have to yourself is proportionate to the true compassion you can direct to another person.
True compassion is most often spontaneous, but more frequently independent as it can exist without any background or support emotion or idea apart from itself and empathy. Ultimately compassion means caring enough to do the difficult tasks that we'd normally like to avoid and the most difficult compassion is to accept the facts of life and our own limitations and to let go.;
, The styles of posture are examined more in detail on the Do Mindful Meditation page. Compassion can be practiced in any posture such as reclining, sitting, standing and walking, although sitting is the default choice. Its best to do what works for you be it sitting on a chair or a cushion.


Give some time being aware of the mind and body, relaxing any muscle or mental tension that arises. This not only builds mindfulness and focus, but compassion works both ways. Being kind to yourself is equally important as to another because if you limit one, you limit the other.

, Who they are is not really the focus at this stage. There isn't really a hierarchy, but the ones you feel the most empathy for will likely appear first in the mind. It can be any case such as they might have had a difficult day at work or school, had an accident and was injured, they may have lost a loved one very recently, became ill themselves or whatever the case might be, they all can be the subject of true compassion.


At this stage focus only on those you can be sincere about. It may be difficult to be sincere about strangers and harder still to those who you do not like, or have done harmful things.

,


You can use words if you wish, such as ""May their health improve soon"" or ""May they have success and happiness at school"" if it helps to develop compassion. The larger goal is to practice entirely without words, simply directing compassion towards the subject/s.
If you feel resentment or sorrow, or if compassion does not arise let go of these feelings and judgments. You haven't failed at this meditation at all by feeling these, you can actually use these feelings as a basis to develop compassion and forgiveness to yourself, as well as for insight purposes as how the mind functions.

, This is so that your mind does not wander, or start to become attached or too involved in any issues. Continue directing compassion to any cases you may be aware of.


You may focus on just one case for the entire time you give to the meditation, or many depending on your level of practice. The goal however is give them the time to let the heart and mind become peaceful, forgiving and develop equanimity towards the subject of compassion.
Expand your compassion once you are more steady. With care you may start to direct compassion towards someone who has done harmful things.

, Such examples are any sorrow, frustrations, desires, resentments, hostility and coldness you may feel. These emotions may have been towards yourself, those who are close to you, those who you are acquainted with and finally people you feel hostile to or know are hostile to you. This breaking down of the barriers while developing peace, forgiveness and understanding is just one of the many benefits of practicing compassion meditation.


To develop this meditation further, measure against your own experiences. Consider the necessity of virtue to be able to be sincere, the wisdom to be compassionate without becoming trapped and the strength of character and skill to act when needed even when it is hard, while accepting the realities of what comes to us and others of what we cannot cure.

, The traps are numerous in this meditation because on one level it seems like compassion but has no benefit and could even cause harm. On the flipside, if you experience these types you have an instant opportunity to examine and investigate them to understand them. The most frequent traps are -


Often called the ""bleeding heart"" type. This can lead practitioners to sorrow and despair because of a range of complications such as the limits of our powers, that there is never enough love or virtue in the world and so on.
The idea that we are obliged, or that we must do something to help all people, because there really is so much unhappiness in the world. Happiness and unhappiness are all common denominators. This is the most cruel kind, as it is solely based in craving and desire to change the way the world is. It does seem noble, but the practitioner must ask how does this lead to freedom or wisdom.
The compassion where we indulge in pity. Practitioners of this type often imagine they are a saint or saviour sacrificing themselves for others. Likewise is the idea we should convert others to our way of thinking for their benefit, as it is still linked to a self indulgent feeling. This one can be very subtle and often the most dangerous kind.
Sometimes the practitioner downgrades the person experiencing troubles as a lessor person or not as wise or as good as the practitioner is, or even that the subject-person deserves what they got. This is often a clear sign of insincerity starting to take hold.
Wishing someone compassion in order to gain merit for ourselves.
That the compassion becomes tainted with the far enemy which is ill-will or anger.

, Some suggestions are to compare the advantages of true compassion and the difference it makes in your life. By practicing compassion, we reshape our mental habits and our brain to be more tolerant and forgiving, but we also can see the ways that it can do more harm than good so we become wise and more prudent in our actions. The lesson of the lotus is that it grows in mud and dirty water, but transcends it all to stand free. Beautiful to all who see it.

Do not meditate when hungry or on a very full stomach.",How to Practice Breath Meditation (Anapanasati)," Look for a quiet place that inspires a contemplative attitude. The practice of breath meditation focuses on the subtle movement of the breath, so it is easily disrupted by stray noises. Buddhist instructional sutras (or suttas in Pali) recommend using abandoned buildings, deep forests, or the foot of a tree for an extended period of practice. For those of us without access to places like that, a quiet and peaceful room is a good choice. Try to use the same place daily until you become advanced enough that it is easy to enter a meditative state., The Buddha's instructions indicate that sitting with a straight back is the best position for anapanasati.Given that this practice is all about body relaxation, inner feelings of pleasure, and a still mind, the more comfortable your posture, the better.The usual choice is the lotus position, seated cross-legged with the right foot tucked on top of the left thigh, and the left foot on top of the right thigh. If your body cannot accommodate this, use a comfortable cross-legged posture, or sit on a chair.
Sit upright, with your spine straight and your head well-supported. If required, feel free to gently and mindfully lay your back against a chair, wall, or tree trunk. Tilt your head slightly downward if it is more comfortable.
Place your hands anywhere that feels comfortable. A common choice is to place them on your lap, with both palms upward, the left cradling the right.

, Once you have chosen your posture, spend some time on conscious relaxation, while breathing through your nose. Observe any tension in your body and let go of it. The more mindful you are of this pleasant relaxation, the more quickly it will occur. Noticing this positive feedback will help incline your mind and heart to further presence, mindfulness and stillness.


You can expect your eyes to naturally and gradually close during relaxation. You may softly close them before you begin if it helps.

, Once the mind has stilled and settled, start focusing on a point around the body where it is easiest to sense and concentrate on your breath. The tip of your nose or your upper lip is a good choice, since these are small points where you can feel the air pass.Some people may prefer the inner nose airways, the back of the mouth, the chest, or the belly.

, This optional step is especially helpful for beginners, as it helps prevent your mind from wandering. Maintain your focus on the point of breathing you have chosen, such as the tip of your nose. Count the breaths as follows: 1 (inhale), 1 (exhale), then 2 (inhale), 2 (exhale), and so on up to 10. Then restart the count.There are several methods of counting used in meditation. Some count to five or eight instead, and some complete the count during each breath, with the final number landing at the end of the breath., Once your mind is focused entirely on your breathing, stop counting. Without consciously altering your breath, follow the changes in its patterns and characteristics. If you take a long breath, note that it is long. If it is a short breath, do the same. Notice and experience all of the breath characteristics (such as length, speed, and pressure), and track each breath from beginning to end.The purpose of this step is to train you to become aware of the natural transition and relaxation of the breath during meditation. This encourages what the Buddha described as ""experiencing the whole body"".Maintain your focus on one point of your body. Track the beginning, middle, and end of your breaths by the changes in air flow at that point, not by attempting to follow the movement of air through your body.Although the description is simple, you can spend years on this stage, improving your focus. There is no schedule for attaining each stage.

, As you maintain the mindfulness of breathing, your breath will become fine and delicate, and your body should feel more and more at ease. Your breath may become difficult to detect, which can cause alarm or distraction. Through practice, learn to maintain contact with your breath in a more subtle way. This usually happens by remaining aware of the faint contact of air where your breath touches your nostrils or lip. If successful, this stage frees your mind of hindrances, leaving you calm and joyful., During the contact stage, a mental image or sign may arise, such as a bright light, mist, or wheel. At first, this is a ""learning sign,"" unsteady and wavering. Once you notice this sign, you may fix your attention on it as breathing goes on. At first, the sign may be appear vague or unsteady, but as you continue to focus on it, it may become clearer.This is a stage of deep concentration, which can last hours for an experienced meditator.Attempting to shift focus from your breath to the image will often cause it to disappear. If you successfully remain in contact with your breath, you may find that the image stabilizes and that your mind focuses on it without conscious choice.These are subtle steps with natural, overlapping transitions. Both ""contact"" and ""fixing"" are techniques that assist you in what the Buddha called ""calming the bodily formation""., At this difficult-to-attain stage, you are opening up to a deeper and usually unexplored aspect of yourself. In Buddha's instructions this is composed of three aspects: ""experiencing rapture"" (piti), ""experiencing bliss"" (sukha), and ""experiencing the mind"".The cultivation of the previous steps will have brought you to a mental state open to inner rapture and happiness. There are many teachings and writings about the states of mind (jhana) possible at this stage.Here are a few ways you may observe yourself during this stage:


Become aware of how inner feelings of rapture and pleasure cause a gladdening of the mind, which in turn leads to stillness and peace.
Notice how the stillness born of the inner happiness gives a different taste to your mind: a taste of freedom and sufficiency.

, Step back from greed, conceit, and other emotions that hinder your progress (called ""defilements"" in Buddhist tradition) .This technique, along with the insightful stillness of heart you have obtained, will help you in the four final stages of anapanasati:


Contemplate impermanence. Understand the deepest implication of impermanence in our experience of suffering.
Contemplate fading away.
Contemplate cessation.
Contemplate relinquishment. Realize that relinquishing the usual habits of seeking pleasure and happiness will lead to more powerful and secure inner experiences.

, By continuing to contemplate these topics, you can replace your negative emotions with positive virtues. One of the most important is detachment (viraga), emptying your mind of worries and thoughts of the past and future.


Keep in mind that these stages do not come quickly or easily -- it requires deep and constant practice to be able to make it to the level of purification., If you have gone through all stages of anapanasati, complete the meditation by recollecting how it has led to the loss of negative emotions and the gain of new insights. Consider how the the breath-driven gradual stilling of the body, feelings, thoughts and mind achieved so far are only possible due to the universal characteristic of impermanence (anicca).

, When you become focused, keep focusing on the object or image in your head to build concentration. As you advance in meditation, you can do different exercises to help you focus on your breathing and its various aspects. Some thought exercises that might help bring your breathing to a higher level are:The flow of the entirety of the breath as observed from a fixed point. A good analogy to consider is a saw - when sawing through a log, you keep 100% of your attention at the point the saw makes contact with the wood while it goes back and forth, but you don't follow the saw as it comes and goes as you wouldn't know how far you have cut into the wood.
The flow of energy that the breath creates and uses. A more experienced meditator can use the energy to flow around the body to soothe pain and refresh the body, eventually creating a sense of pleasure.
The use of breath to relax both the mind and the body and increase awareness as it becomes more subtle.
Your experiences of how the breath is formed in relation to the state of the mind. If the mind is tense, the breath is often tense. The state of the mind is often reflected in the breath. By adjusting the mind, such as considering thoughts of goodwill when angry, or appreciation when unhappy, you can adjust the breath to be more gentle and calm, which helps relax the body and mind.
Your experiences of how your state of mind forms in relation to the breath and your nose. We seldom breathe through both nostrils at the same time, as one is usually closed.
The mental intention that drives the in-breath and out-breath process in terms of voidness or emptiness (anatta). The mental process and body processes of breathing do not stop when we cease paying attention to them.
The impermanent, changing nature of the mind and body. Not only is each breath different from the other, so you never have two breaths the same, the meditation practice is always different, so you never have two meditation periods the same.
How the breath changes when we fix on a different object such a distraction, a thought or feeling, or sensations in the body.

, When you get into a meditative state, you want to enter the same state each time – neither more nor less intense. Work on getting yourself into the same level of focus every time. A simple analogy to consider is sound and the aim is to create an even, middle pitch. Too much effort is like turning up the volume, too little is like turning the volume down. When too much effort is applied the mind aches or the breath becomes unsettled, and with too little effort the breath and focus keeps dropping off., As you practice, you may find the breath getting more and more subtle as the calmed body requires less oxygen. Eventually there may be a time where the breath seems to disappear. In practice, it's best to keep focus at the same point as the breath will return soon, but it may break concentration if you move away from that point.For concentration to develop further, maintain applied focus until it becomes evident to you in some form and a sense of pleasure is present. This is often called rapture. If there is no sense of this rapture, it is unlikely the mind will enter much deeper into concentration.
The form it appears in is different to each person. It may be a change in physical sensation, a mental image, a symbolic sense of movement or another form. This is not a thing the majority of practitioners experience often or sometimes at all. It is highly conditional on the temperament of the practitioner, experience and skills in meditation, location and potential distractions or other priorities that may be in the mind. Should it arise, you should focus all attention on that without analyzing its color, characteristics etc. It can be easily lost when you don't give balanced and even attention to it. Mindfulness of breathing is difficult to develop so it requires practice to do well.

, Do it often and regularly in your day to day life. Consider practicing yoga, which incorporates many of the same breathing techniques and ideas. This may be part of an exercise routine or an active lifestyle, but the spine should be comfortable and straight, dropping and relaxing the tailbone area and stomach. You also want to be able to sit in lotus position rather than just cross-legged for meditation., Do it the same way every time -- think about even sitting in the same place. This trains and familiarizes the mind with keeping a firm applied focus. To begin, some experts recommended spending up to a week or more practicing for several hours a day without duties, so a meditation retreat is ideal. It can take several days and, for some, weeks or months before the mind has relaxed and let go sufficiently for a person to put down the mental hindrances and their mind to become bright., The body needs energy to meditate, but food eaten recently also promotes sleepiness or distraction. You need to be alert and focused, not thinking about food.

Understand why you are meditating.",How to Practice Buddhist Meditation1," Many people find it helps to meditate first thing in the morning in order to start the day fresh and with a clear mind. Others like to meditate in the evening to help them relax and clear their mind before bed, or to meditate in the middle of the day in order to manage work stress. Any time is a good time to mediate. Pick the time that works for you., Meditating requires concentration and focus. If you're tired, it will be much more difficult. This is another reason why many people prefer to meditate in the morning., The goal of meditation is to calm your mind and to transcend negative emotions. Loose, comfortable clothing will help to ensure you are distracted as little as possible by physical discomfort., You will want to find a room where no loud noises or sudden interruptions will disturb your meditation.


The room should be a comfortable temperature.
Tibetan monks begin meditation by cleaning the room. You can make the room more relaxing and conducive to meditation by keeping it free of clutter., Turn off your cell phone or pager. If you have a landline, turn off the ringer. Ask your family not to interrupt you during your session.

, The classic mediation pose is with the legs crossed before you, hands folded in your lap, but it does not matter you sit does not matter so long as you are comfortable and your back is straight to allow you breathe deeply and fully.You may choose to sit on a pillow for comfort.
You can also sit in a chair if you find that more comfortable or if you need back support.

, Adopting the proper pose can help you to remain comfortable and relaxed as you meditate. Keep your head slightly bent forward, your teeth slightly apart, and your shoulders relaxed. It is best to keep your eyes half-closed, but if that is too distracting, you may close them.Put your tongue on the roof of your mouth and swallow. This will create a slight vacuum that will reduce saliva and the need to swallow., Start with 15 minutes. Use a timer; you don't want to be glancing at the clock repeatedly. Try to last the entire time you have allotted, but if you get tired or too distracted, it's ok to stop., You may have particular reasons you are meditating: to help you move past negative actions – e.g. fighting with your wife – or to deal with stress. Meditation can help by calming your mind and helping you to set aside negative emotions, particularly if you focus on one emotion at a time. In addition to considering your own reasons for meditation, you might consider starting your session with one of prayers that Buddhists use to remind them why they are meditating:Generating Bodhicitta:

By virtue of giving and so forth,

may I become a Buddha for the benefit of all sentient beings. (3x)


The Four Immeasurables:


May all sentient beings have equanimity, free from attachment, aggression and prejudice.May they be happy, and have the causes for happiness.
May they be free from suffering and causes for suffering.

May they never be separated from the happiness that is free from suffering. (3x)


The Seven-Limbed Prayer

Respectfully I prostrate with body, speech and mind;
I present clouds of every type of offerings, actual and imagined;
I declare all the negative actions I have done since beginningless time,
and rejoice in the merit of all Aryas and ordinary beings.
Please teacher, remain until cyclic existence ends
and turn the wheel of Dharma for all sentient beings.
I dedicate the virtues of myself and others to the great Enlightenment.

For a formal sitting pick a length of time to sit.,
In the formal sitting: assume a relaxed and upright posture.,
Initially select a place to sit where you will not be interrupted for your selected time period.,
When you sit down, rest your hands on your thighs; so that your fingers come right up to your knees.,
First: complete relaxation is critical.,
Rest your gaze directly in front of you.,
As you have settled into your posture you then begin the practice by resting your attention on the breath.,
As you sit with your attention resting on the breath, your mind will wander.,
It helps to have a pattern you can follow from your ""Ding!"",
In between the out breaths you can explore all the other ways you are resting in the formal meditation setting.,
End significantly.",How to Formally Sit in Shamatha Meditation," Five minutes is a great time to introduce yourself to this formal practice. Its recommended to formally sit around ten minutes a day.;
, Sitting in a chair is best for a beginner. Sit so that your feet are flat on the floor with your spine upright without overly slouching or sitting too rigid. If possible do not rest back of the chair. Knees should be the level of the hips or lower.

, In a city there is rarely a sound free place to sit. Quiet isn't necessary for Shamatha, but you won't want to play music.

, In an upright posture your shoulder will rest naturally down, but if you pull your hands too far back it raises your shoulders. Work to find a relaxed place to put your hands where you won't develop back pain.

, Continuous monitoring of relaxation by introspection is the sine qua non. Any time your mind wanders or you lose complete relaxation, relax more deeply. A wandering mind is agitated, relax more deeply.

, Because this meditation is about being present you can have your eyes open. You will see thee things in front of you and you will blink and your eyes will move. You do not focus on a spot, but simply rest your gaze. Naturally you will focus and unfocus. Come back to a resting gaze.

, The breath will be the primary point of attention which you come back to for the select length of time. You are not going to focus on the breath, but rest your attention on it. There are many ways, you will find, to understand when you are resting on the breath and when you are focusing on the breath. That comes later. For now, your attention should notice the breath going in and going out.

, Thoughts and ideas and feelings will come up. Most noticeably will be a narrative of what you are doing. When you notice this you can say to yourself ""thinking"" and then return your attention back to the breath.


""Thinking"" is just a neutral label. You might just say ""Ding!"" It is a way to signify to yourself that you have wandered from your object of attention,

, to getting back to the breath. For example: you see you are off your point and you say to yourself ""Ding!"" Then you check your posture - is it still upright? Then you can come to your gaze - am I staring a hole into a speck of lint on the floor? Then you come back to the breath. To start, rest the attention on the breath as it comes in and out of the mouth and nostrils. Then more specifically rest your attention on the out breath as it goes out from you in a whoosh. Then relax and wait for another outward whoosh. Without concentration, without focus, just being present and aware of how the breath goes out.

, Do a sweep of gaze and body and environment, all seeking to relax into resting rather than focusing or spacing out.

, At the end of five minutes or whatever period of time - you can bow to yourself or ring a bell or take a large breath. Something to signify the end of your formal setting. I recommend a quote that you can personalize. ""By this may everyone be happy.""

Focus on your breathing.,
Allow thoughts to come and go.,
Learn to deal with common distractions.,
Increase the length of your meditation.",How to Practice Buddhist Meditation2," Breathe through your nose.Concentrate on each inhalation and exhalation. Feel the rise and fall of your abdomen. Do not control your breath, simply be mindful of it. Clear your mind of everything but this focus on your breathing. The goal is to achieve peace and stillness of mind.You can count your breaths to ten to help focus.If you lose count, start over at one.

, Thoughts will inevitably pop into your head, particularly when you are new to meditation. Don't be upset if they do. ""Do not try to stop thoughts, allow them to arise, but recognize their arising and do not pursue them. The goal is not to have no thoughts but for thoughts to arise and yet be rendered powerless"" (Garchen Ripoche).Let them leave your mind of their own accord.

, Pain from sitting so long, sleepiness, desire and more can make it hard to meditate. Don't worry. Everyone experiences these things. The more you meditate, the better you will become at moving past distractions.Pain – If you feel discomfort, do not move. Study yourself and your pain. Allow time to explore the feeling. Imagine your body as empty, a vessel with you standing outside of it. If the pain is too intense, take a break by standing up.
Sensual desire – It can be hard to put aside thoughts of a lover or even a desired object. Realize that desires are transient; fulfilling one will only lead to another. Remember the reality of the desired object: bodies are just skin and bones and flesh.Restlessness and worry – Notice these feelings, but do not pursue them. Return your attention to your breathing and movement of your abdomen. If a thought persists, you may write a short note to remind yourself to deal with it later.
Drowsiness – Remember why you are meditating. Focus on a white light between your eyebrows to increase wakefulness. If you still find yourself nodding off, take a rest and return to mediation when you are refreshed.

, Begin by meditating for 15 minutes at a time, once a day. 15 minutes might seem long at first, but as you get better at relaxing and clearing your mind, it will get easier. Try to extend the length of your mediation by 5 minutes each week until you are able to mediate for 45 minutes."

Use meditation to train your mind to be kinder.,
Begin this meditation after practicing mindfulness of breathing.,
Arouse feeling of loving-kindness.,
Focus on the feeling.,
Radiate feeling of love.",How to Practice Buddhist Meditation3," The goal of this type of mindfulness meditation is to train your mind in kindness and compassion.You will try to develop feeling of loving kindness towards:Yourself
A respected, beloved person – i.e. a spiritual teacher
A dearly beloved (it is easiest to start with someone you are not sexually attracted to)
A neutral person who you have no special feeling towards
A difficult person

, Once you are in a focused, contemplative state, you will work on sending feelings of love and happiness first to yourself, then to each of the other four people in turn.

, There are three main techniques to inspire the proper emotions within you:Mantras – As you think of yourself, then the other four people, repeat an internalized phrase or mantra, such as: ""May I be well and happy. May I be peaceful and calm. May I be protected from dangers. May my mind be free from hatred. May my heart be filled with love. May I be well and happy."" Visualization - Create a mental image of yourself or the person you are considering. See them smiling joyously.
Reflection – Think of the good qualities or actions of the person you are considering.

, The emotion is the key, not the device you use to evoke it. When the feeling of loving-kindness arises, concentrate on that feeling. However, if the feeling fades, you may return to the device you used to evoke it., Project your feelings of loving-kindness to the four points of the compass. It may help to think of people you know in cities in each direction that you can direct your love towards. The ultimate goal is to not have to direct your love in this way, but rather to simply radiate feelings of unconditional universal love in all directions.It may help to use a mantra to direct you love outwards, such as:

May all beings be safe, happy, healthy, live joyously…..
May all living beings be safe, happy, healthy, live joyously…..
May all breathing beings be safe, happy, healthy, live joyously…..
May all individuals be safe, happy, healthy, live joyously…..
May all beings in existence be safe, happy, healthy, live joyously…

This meditation can be practiced with eyes open or closed, but select the style according to which is relevant to your case. To develop it deeply the eyes should be closed to reduce visual distractions, but with the eyes closed the mind can wander off. A beginner is best to stick with the eyes gently open until they have experience in staying with the present moment.;
, The central focus of letting go is not denying or suppressing the issue or trying to run away, but accepting that things are as they are, forgiving them, then letting go of them & the need to fight or flight.
Letting go, as well as understanding it becomes easier when you examine the practice of letting go next to your own experiences. It is very useful to consider that letting go is both an act of release, like after serving time in a prison to finally get outside. It is also a kindness as holding onto unhappy events and feelings can afflict a person for their whole life, like a poison poured into a lake.
A beginner ideally should practice this meditation when some existing meditation practice such as in loving kindness, appreciation or compassion is developed. Just like these other three, Equanimity relies on the practice of virtue, investigation, wisdom and mental training to be developed and used, so it does not come easily without time and understanding. Just the same as in the other three, this meditation only works when the practitioner is sincere about what they intend to do.

, Equanimity can fail if the practitioner chooses a subject that strongly overpowers them and/or that they feel strong feelings about, as unless they already have experience and strength to let go of all feelings, then the meditation can go astray. The classical enemies of equanimity that are related to wanting something and a few of many examples to consider are:


Wanting to fix or remove an existing problem.
Wanting to prevent problems from ever occurring.
Wanting some method to just make the feelings go away.
Wanting justice or compensation for unpleasant experiences.


Keep any eye out for the other enemies as you go. They can be very volatile feelings, or very heavy feelings such as depression or despair. Ultimately for equanimity to be developed further, it is necessary to let go of these feelings and thoughts as they are all baited hooks for the mind. Once bitten, we are caught like a fish, but by understanding how we are caught, we avoid biting that hook and can move onto the next stage.

, It might be a problem currently experienced, or something else that is effecting your well being. Examine the subject experience remotely and objectively, again by comparing it from your experiences. At this stage, consider the nature of this experience but without getting involved into the past event. It may be useful to imagine it as a film projected on a screen in order to separate yourself and examine it objectively. Some examples to consider are:


How long ago it happened. Is it a recent or an old event?
What emotion do you experience at recalling that subject experience? Regret, frustration, embarrassment, impotence, sorrow, anger or other emotions are all relevant. The practitioner should likewise keep these emotions at arms length.
What does the mind want to do with the subject? Change it, run away from it, forget it, destroy it?
Are other people involved in the subject? Some experiences happen while we are on our own, but sometimes we are with, or the subject is about other people.
Do the emotions felt as a result of the event affect your life? How?
Can the experience be avoided in future? Some feelings are ways of telling us we still haven't learn the lesson that there is a cause and an effect, so some things can be avoided by practicing wisdom, but some events are part of life and are unavoidable.


The purpose of this section meets a hidden range of needs. Firstly we need to be able to see the ""frog in the cave"" which is a modern metaphor as some frogs' croak becomes a booming roar in the echo of the cavern, making it seem bigger than it really is. This means we have to see what the problem that lurks in our mind is all about, as often the mind tries to hide from memories and that can make them more powerful and frightening than they really are. Secondly and crucially, only once we have been able to examine it can we question why we are letting it haunt us.

, To be able to look into the heart of the subject issue, there is a host of things to consider, however it is important to continue to be objective and to bear in mind the ways the equanimity can be turned into something harmful. A practitioner who is not objective will often fall into feelings of despair, impotence, loneliness and sorrow. There are many examples you can use with only a few listed, so choose one that is most relevant for your mind.


That there really is a lot of things that happen or can happen in life that are unpleasant. We cannot predict these events, prevent unpleasant ones or make them go away on a wish when they do come.
Good times and pleasant experiences in life do happen just as do bad times, but neither will last forever.
We are human and continue to exist dependent on many external conditions. We do not have powers to make life be what we want.
We cannot turn and beg to someone or try to negotiate to fix the problem for us. If there was, there wouldn't be any problems left for anyone as we would all be doing it.


This section may seem at first glance very depressing, but the purpose is threefold: firstly to question the wisdom of being haunted and/or feeling sorrow or frustration at things we can neither avoid, prevent or change. Secondly, only once the practitioner has sincerely accepted that the facts of life are the facts of life, will they be less susceptible to them in future. Finally, sincerity is essential to balance out the sorrow and despair with whichever emotion is most relevant to your mind - these being equanimity, goodwill, appreciation and compassion. If the practitioner is not sincere, then the entire practice does not give any benefits.
Therefore, its always down to using the right tool to the need as sometimes just being aware that things change is enough to resolve the problem and to be at rest. Sometimes it needs to balance out the sorrow with remembering to appreciate the beauty and richness that exists within us all.

, If you wander off, it can be a bit like walking into quicksand. The more you struggle, the quicker you drown.
The point is that, a little fire can become a big fire with adequate fuel. The fuel is wanting or craving things to be different. The only solution is to let go of the fuel and the fire will burn out. If you keep feeding it, it will keep flaring and even small small flames can become a raging inferno.
Putting the fire out means not only to douse the flames, but to know how to prevent fires by removing the fuel source. We can douse our anger with goodwill and we can remove the fuel source by becoming familiar with the mind and developing it.

, Now start to develop the equanimity.
Start by examining the benefit of a cooler, more gentle and balanced mind, as opposed to being in the turmoil at the heart of the issue. Do this for as long and as often as you feel you can.
Apply this meditation or your experiences from this meditation toward any times that feel stressful or unhappy. Eventually it gets much easier to let go of the aches and pains of life, you can face them without fear and let them go in a heartbeat without any regret or insecurity.

Open your eyes slowly.",How to Do Yoga Meditation," The location you select should not be cluttered or loud. You should feel at ease before starting yoga meditation. If the location is noisy, an advanced yoga practitioner may be able to deal with external influences, but beginners will find it distracting.


Ideal locations are either free from technology and machinery, or otherwise block the sounds our mind must make effort to filter out.
Somewhere with a lot of natural light through windows is preferred over flickering electrical lighting.;
, Aside from the sounds they produce being a distraction, the machines that produce our heating and cooling are not as naturally pleasing to the body as a cool breeze or the warm sun. If yoga meditation in the outdoors is not a viable option, choose somewhere with radiant heat like a wood fire or hydronic heat. Create a cross-flow by opening a door or a window, so fresh oxygen is pumped into the location.


Accentuate the location by selecting a location with minimal synthetic material. Wood floors with natural oils and waxes have less static electricity, and are conducive to yoga meditation.
If you live in a high pollution area, performing yoga meditation inside may actually be preferable.
Studios where large classes practice yoga can become stuffy, building up carbon dioxide and lessening the available oxygen.
A yoga mat can be used for added comfort.

, If you have a full stomach, you could relax so much you’ll feel drowsy. And if you time it too close to meal time, the hunger pains could be too distracting. Attempt to schedule your meditation when you are comfortable, perhaps a few hours after a meal.An alternative would be to eat a light snack before mealtime and then meditate.

, With a brief warm-up, your body will be more limber, relaxed, and able to better focus on meditation. You’ll also likely be able to sit for longer periods of time if you’re more limber.Focus on your core and back for just a few minutes, with various, light twists and bends.A few of the following Sukshma Yoga exercises can also be very beneficial:


Use two fingers to lightly squeeze the eyebrow several times.
Roll your eyes in circles several times.
Rub your temples and jawline.
Grab your ears and pull downward softly., You can sit anywhere that allows good posture, like the floor or a chair. Try not to be too rigid. Crossing legs like you see in many pictures about yoga meditation is not necessary, but if you sit that way, alternate which leg is on top each time you meditate.Being comfortable is critical when trying to focus on meditation.
Pull your chin slightly back to aid in the spine alignment.

, Breathing deeply is a great way to prepare for a meditation session. Focusing on breathing helps ease the body and mind, as well as improve focus. One particular breathing method called the Nadi Shodhan Pranayama – a subtle breathing technique – involves alternating nostrils in the manner below:Place the index and middle finger of your right hand between your eyes, and the remaining fingers around your nose. The thumb will be on your right nostril.
Breathe deeply into the left nostril while closing the right nostril.
Alternate pressure, and exhale out of the right nostril., The Samasthiti is a pose that is similar to the traditionally military standing at attention. It's about being attentive to your own balance, your own steadiness. From there, place your palms together - also called Anjali Mudra - in what many recognize as praying. Breathe in while raising your hands over your head, and exhale as you return them back to your chest.Perform this step for a minute or two in order to really settle yourself.

, Get on your hands and knees, with your palms under your shoulders for weight support. Inhale deeply as you raise your head and upper body. Simultaneously lower your spine towards the floor. It should feel like your spine is getting closer to your stomach as this pose is being done. Complete the pose by returning back to an aligned back while exhaling., In a sitting position, place your hands on your sides and bring your left foot up to contact your left buttock. Repeat the process with the right foot. At this point you'll be in a squatting position, and you'll be easily able to lean forward and shift your weight to your knees. Sit back on the space between your heels. Breathe normally for a few minutes in this position.At the end of this position, your toes should be touching.
Be sure to keep your core tightened to promote the good posture.
An upright posture is easier with the vajrasana because the pose promotes straightness with minimal effort.

, The Ujjayi breath is long and smooth. It is good for both giving you energy and making you feel calm.

Sit cross-legged on the floor.
Try to relax. Imagine that you are taking long, slow breaths inward through a straw.
Exhale slowly, as though through the same straw.
Make the breath as long and as smooth as possible., Your everyday life has several distractions and worries. For the first part of your yoga meditation, allow yourself to embrace the various things going on in your life. Acknowledge your own personal chaos. By recognizing the many distractions in your life, it allows you to more easily remove yourself of exterior distractions when you begin to focus., Direct your attention inside, to the base of your spine. Slowly, pull your attention up through the center of your body along the spinal column, and move through each part of the body. Take inventory of each body part as you move along.


Be aware of your various senses (i.e. taste, smell, sight).
Acknowledge thoughts, emotions, and your progression towards acceptance.
Think about how your various body parts are functioning with one another.
Notice if you have any tension or pain.

, In order to attain a higher level of concentration while meditating, the mind must gradually become silenced during reflection. The ability to set your mind at ease is not possible if the body and breath are not focused. To help become aware of your mind, follow what is called the “Four Functions of Mind”:


Observe your mind and its impressions, ego, judgments, and discriminations.
Accept the various observations for what they are, whether positive or negative.
Understand how your train of thought flows from one thing to the next.
Train your mind to choose the object of focus, rather than allowing consciousness to flow between items., The point is to embrace the current moment. If you’re beginning, your attention will falter. Redirect your attention as best you can back to the object, and you’ll be able to ignore more distractions as you get better at meditating. Try focusing on something like one of the following items:


A dot on a sheet of paper.
The center point of tile.
The design in a floorboard.

, At the end of your meditation, bring your attention back to your body by making a small movement while opening your eyes. Become aware of any change you may feel inside your body, or any shift in your attention.Try one of the following techniques to help end the yoga meditation sessions:


Lightly ball your fists a few times.
Flex your calf muscles.
Smiling is a good way to focus muscles, and it has the added benefit of enhancing meditation."

For this type of meditation sitting is perhaps the best type, be it on a cushion or on a chair, but all formats are applicable.
Walking meditation is another good choice as it helps apply the practice in day to day life. Close your eyes and relax any tension both mentally and physically. Spend a few minutes to observe the body and mind and relax any tension you feel. This helps to build a degree of trust with yourself and also builds the awareness and focus that you can use to develop and maintain the practice.
If you have time, practice goodwill or loving kindness meditation first as it makes gladness and appreciation all the more genuine, allows more depth of expression and gives more lasting benefit.
This is a meditation that can be practiced either with the eyes gently closed or with the eyes open there is an object that inspires gladness and peace in front of you - such as a flower, a sunset, or any simple image that makes you feel happy. If you wish to practice this meditation for longer than a few minutes, it is recommended to use an object that is still and not moving.;
, Examine ways you can be happy with the good things presently in your life. It is sometimes easier to start with the basics; consider, e.g., your good health, your family, the food you have to eat, your job, your home, etc. Then take a moment to express appreciation and gladness that this is the case, as any of these things can be lost all too easily.


Express appreciation for these things not necessarily by directing to some person or being (unless that person helped you directly). For example, if your neighbour helped you with a jump, think perhaps along the lines of, ""Thank you for helping me mend the car, I am very fortunate to be a person who experienced the generosity of others"".
It is important to practice sincerity --- otherwise these gestures will become meaningless. The potential development of the negative aspect that hollows out the words, ""thank you"" becomes easy if thought without sincerity. Over time, the words become empty and it is far harder (if not impossible) to actually value anything at all. In this case, a beginner should consider only the things they know they do appreciate and then expand more broadly once some groundwork and experience is developed. This meditation can be very difficult to practice if the practitioner does not have some prowess in handling their mind states.

, You may easily find appreciation that your life is not in immediate peril. Or that you aren't in chronic pain or illness, being unlawfully imprisoned, in a war zone, or starving. That you aren't in the grip of plagues or famine that may cause suffering to many, or have mistrust or separation in your family.


If your life does actually experience these or other misfortunes, try to find something in your life that is worth being appreciative of. Even if you experience all the tragedies of life, at the end of the day, if you consider that you are practicing kindness to yourself and wishing no harm to others even for just this little while is something to find joy in. That, after all, is something that is wonderful in itself and is in truth the quintessential compassionate act.

, Frequently measure the practice against your experiences by considering if part of the mind or body feels a sense of gladness and so has improved your well being. It may be a sense of tranquility and gratitude, it may be a gentle softness in your breathing or relaxation in your body.


Should your mind dwell on the sad or unfortunate parts of your life, then let go of these and return to your primary awareness of kindness and appreciative joy. If they seem too strong, practice compassion & equanimity meditation or simply observe the feeling from a detached position. At this stage its better to let all thoughts not related to appreciation or gladness go if you are able to do so, as it has effectively changed the direction you are heading. You will need to get back on track and regain focus.

, Review members of your family & friends who are happy, healthy and successful. Express joy at their good fortune. It might be (e.g.) ""my younger sister is doing well in school and is enjoying life - how excellent for her, how lucky she really is"". Continue to focus on the aspects of your life and those you care about that inspire gladness and appreciation. Again, sincerity is an utmost importance.
Should your nearest and dearest be having a terrible time at the moment in cases they cannot help - as there are many in the world who are struggling and live in challenging times - then express gladness and appreciation for the good times they have had and wish them good health and happiness for the present and future. There is a lot of happy and unhappy things that happen or can happen in life. We cannot predict these events, prevent them or make them go away on a wish when they do come. This is simply about being glad for the things you have and for people you know, as well as being a way to understand that good times change and bad times won't last forever. A disaster could be right around the corner so this meditation will help you to appreciate every good moment.

, Keep an eye out for the externally-oriented enemies of this meditation: envy, ill-will, wishing for others not to have success, or regret that they have had success. There is also the internally-oriented enemy: selfish pride at your (and/or other peoples') success and happiness. These are the traps which you should endeavour to let go of at the earliest chance as the meditation is no longer about being happy at someone else's success and happiness, but now something that will disrupt your short and long term well-being.


Avoid wandering off into memories of good times, since while you might feel some joy for those good times, the danger is you are now trying to re-live them, rather than express happiness and appreciation that they had been. Let the past stay past. Let go as when you come back to the here and now you could feel sadness or depression if you are not familiar with your mind. Stay in the present moment and keep focus on gratitude and appreciation for the good times that have been.

, They might be co-workers, your grocers, doctors, neighbours, friendly acquaintances etc. Express gladness if you are aware they have had success or some good fortune recently and express gratitude that they are well and happy, or like with your close relatives and friends, if they are having difficulties wish them success in the future and express joy for the good times that they have had.

,


Here is where the hard work comes in. The goal is to be able to be happy for their successes, without your personal feelings coming in. You will have to transcend your feelings. Practicing loving kindness first softens the barriers which can make this practice easier.
The difference between appreciation and goodwill or Loving kindness however, is you can't really get this to work on strangers very effectively as it is very hard to direct. You can however be glad that a country is successful and that its population is not in war etc, so it can be expanded broadly.
Take this one a step at a time. If it feels impossible to be happy for someone you don't like to have success, go back and practice loving kindness to yourself and the other person. This section is not easy and its not really meant to be - you have to be strong enough to transcend any grudges you have and overcome ill will.
How do grudges, sorrow or greed help you after all to have a happy and peaceful life?

,
Do you feel more humane, more happy and that life is richer? If so, how did you get there? If not, why not?
The latter question can open the door to gaining an understanding into how your mind works which can help to really develop appreciation and other meditations. You can close the meditation by expanding and expressing a final extension of appreciative joy and wish for the present and future wellbeing of yourself and others.
Appreciation is a skill to develop as most of our unhappiness arises firstly when we don't have any goodwill or compassion, but also when we don't appreciate the many wonderful things we have and that we aren't experiencing some of the many hard experiences of life.

Stay focused on your bodily movements.,
Be mindful of your surroundings.,
Schedule time for walking meditation.,
Make the meditation your own.",How to Practice Buddhist Walking Meditation1," Walking meditation is about being aware of your environment, especially the movement of your own body. Some people find it easier to stay focused on your body during walking meditation than sitting meditation, since your body is more actively engaged during walking meditation.Scan your body from your head to your feet. Since you start walking with your feet, it may be a good place to start your focus on how you’re moving.
As you continue to scan your body, notice how each body part is moving to help you walk. For the time being, don’t focus on your surroundings, but start just thinking about your bodily movement and comfort.;
, Walking meditation requires that you are aware of the external world. This is because you are out in the world while walking, but it can also make you wonder and appreciate the natural world.Walking meditation works best in natural environments. If possible, take your walk out in nature where you can appreciate its beauty.
Being out in nature is good for walking meditation, but don’t let it be a distraction. Walking in nature somewhere that you’re familiar with may be better than a new environment that may sidetrack you from your meditative purpose.

, It’s important to not be mentally hurried or distracted during walking meditation. If you have a busy schedule, set aside 20 minutes or so to do some walking meditation.You’ll want to be relatively undisturbed when you first try walking meditation. Go to a park or another environment that is free from your own schedule and demands.
When you’ve got the hang of walking meditation, you can try to do shorter sessions. Walking to your car from work or from the grocery store can be small moments of walking meditation.

, Once you’ve gotten the hang of walking meditation, you can begin to change it to suit your needs. There’s no one right way to do walking meditation, so it can be utilized in a variety of ways.Adjust walking meditation to other physical activities. You may try being mindful of your body and environment while running, playing sports, or biking.
You may also want to include a mantra or focus your energies on different aspects of walking meditation. Change the walking meditation to suit what feels best for you and what you want out of it.

Execute the Lotus Pose.,
Consider modifications.,
Staying aware of the present moment.",How to Do the Lotus Position," Select a time during the day that you can routinely practice yoga without distraction or interruption. Make an attempt to practice yoga around the same time every day. As with any exercise, practicing yoga in the morning will keep your energy levels high throughout the day.
Try not to make excuses to skip your exercise. You only need to do practice yoga 15-20 minutes a day and, therefore, you can do it in the morning before work, during lunch, or when you return home from work.;
, Tranquil settings are best and can be inside or outside, just try to avoid interaction with people, pets, or objects. Wherever peace and quiet exists, however, is suitable enough. Make sure your mediation space is clean, ventilated, and enough space to roll out your yoga mat.
Keep the temperature moderate and comfortable.
Consider lighting aromatherapy candles to further relax your mind and body.

, Keep your yoga clothing as simple as possible. Because yoga is a stretching exercise, wear loose, comfortable clothing that gives your body the freedom to stretch and bend. Avoid wearing tight clothing that restricts movement.
Take off jewelry and accessories as they will become a nuisance during exercise.
Other equipment, such as mats, balls, and other props can usually be bought at local sporting goods stores, online, or at yoga retail stores.

, Make yoga practice a part of your daily schedule and lifestyle. Consistency will lead to greater results over time. Otherwise, it will be difficult to achieve the full lotus position.
Keeping a consistent routine is important to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

, The lotus position requires flexibility. In this case, there are several less demanding yoga positions – the bound angle, hero pose, Half Lord of the Fishes pose – you can practice before trying the full lotus position. Sit cross-legged with your knees close to the ground to warm-up your lower body.
Try moving your legs so that your knees are bent while your feet touch together, then pull your feet towards you while you bring your knees up and down for two minutes.
Do a couple of cat stretches: get on your hands and knees with your hands at shoulder width apart. Arch your back (like a cat) and hold while taking deep breathes for two or three minutes.
Do a few minutes of the baby pose: sit back on your knees with the top of your feet flat on the ground. Spread your knees apart and lay down so that your head is resting on the ground. Place your hands either straight above your head with palms facing down, or straight, next to your feet with palms facing up.

, If you already have an injured knee, ankle, hip, or any other chronic injury to the lower body it is best to probably avoid the lotus pose. This pose has a high risk of injury because of the demanding flexibility requirements. If you are a beginner, it is not a good idea to try this position on your own. Get a personal trainer or attend a class until you have mastered it.
If you lack flexibility, try an easier pose like the half lotus or easy pose until you become more limber.
Warming up is essential or risk straining your muscles. Always do a few body stretches to bring flexibility before moving into complicated yoga positions.
Always respect your body and understand your limitations. Try to avoid moving too fast into a position or going beyond what your body can handle. This will only result in pain and suffering.

, The half lotus is a good start to mastering the full lotus pose. The half lotus pose is considered an intermediate yoga exercise. Start by sitting on the floor with head and spine erect with your shoulders back and your chest forward. Your legs should be straight out in front of you, then, with both hands, carefully bend your right leg at the knee and lift the right foot up and place it on your left thigh. Keep the bottom of your foot facing up while the other leg remains straight.
Keep your balance as you follow the same procedure for your other leg but place your left leg under your right leg. The bottom of your left foot should be under your right thigh.
Breathe deeply. Then, bring your arms to rest on your knees with palms facing up. Touch your thumb to the index finger to form the letter “o” while keeping the remaining three fingers straight. Try to keep your forearms straight.
While in this position, try to let your entire body relax for at least one or two minutes if you can tolerate it.
Finally, switch legs and do it again.

, Depending on your age and ability, consult with a doctor to address any medical concerns before performing high-level, difficult yoga poses. The lotus pose is considered an expert pose so make sure you stay within your own range of limits and abilities.Sitting on the floor with your legs extended out, keep your spine straight with your arms resting at your side.
Bend your right knee towards your chest and begin to rotate it outward from the hip so that the bottom of your right foot faces up. The top of your foot should rest where your hip bends.
Now, bend your left knee so that you can cross your left ankle over the top of your right shin. The bottom of your left foot should also face towards the sky. The top of your foot and ankle should rest where your hip bends.
Bring your knees together as closely as possible. Push your midsection toward the floor and sit up straight. Press the outer edges of your feet down onto your thighs, lifting the outer ankles. This will ease pressure between your shins.
Rest your hands on your knees with your palms facing up. Bring your hands into Gyan Mudra (Wisdom Seal) by joining the index finger and thumb on each hand. Extend the other fingers, but keep them together. This will calm you while you pause for a few meditating breaths.
Once you are ready to finish, release the full lotus pose very carefully and slowly by gently extending both legs along the floor. As you maneuver out of the lotus position, pause at each step for a few minutes to meditate.

, If the full lotus pose causes you discomfort or you are just new to this then think about modifications that are still effective but safer until you become a master. A blanket is a good substitute between body parts and the floor. Fold a firm blanket and place it under each knee until you gain greater flexibility.
If you find that even the half lotus difficult to hold for long periods of meditation, try the easy pose, or Sukhasana, first.
On the other hand, for a greater challenge that requires additional strength try the scale pose, or Tolasana, by pressing your palms into the floor alongside your hips. Lift your buttocks and legs off the floor and allow your body to swing slightly.
The bound lotus pose, or Baddha Padmasana, provides a deep stretch to the upper body which requires great flexibility. From the full expression of lotus pose, reach both arms behind your back, clasping your toes with your fingers. To deepen the stretch even further, fold forward.
Other poses such as the headstand (Sirsasana), Fish Pose (Matsyasana), and Shoulderstand (Salamba Sarvangasana) can be done with your legs while in the lotus pose.

, If you are serious about yoga, the lotus pose will most likely be one of your main goals to achieve. It will take time to achieve this perfection, but remember that the goal is not to achieve the full expression of the lotus pose. Instead, the goal of yoga is staying aware of the present moment. Yoga is a patient practice and you must accept your boundaries as you progress. "

Start with your physical body.,
Be aware of your feelings.,
Observe your mental and emotional well-being.,
Consider the objects of consciousness.,
Balance your inner and outer experience.",How to Practice Buddhist Walking Meditation2," Walking meditation starts with your body. Start your meditation in a standing position so you’re aware of your body before you start walking.Stand quietly while feeling your body from your feet to your head. Resist boredom during this time and try to stay mentally alert.Begin your bodily awareness with the parts of you that touch the ground. Slowly relax parts of your body as you feel them move.Focus on experiencing your body rather than analyzing those experiences. You may note how your body is feeling and moving, but don’t move beyond that experience for the time being.

, In Buddhism, feelings, or vendana, means your most basic responses in terms of liking or not liking something. This can be physical stimuli or just the initial responses to the world around you.Feelings are different than emotions. Emotions are more well-reasoned or thought out, whereas feelings are your more immediate sensations or perceptions.
Recognize your feelings, but don’t try to grasp onto them or reject them. Instead, take them as they come and recognize them without clinging to them.

, Your mental and emotional state, or citta, often changes during walking meditation. During walking meditation, you want to try to be mindful and focused on the specific moment.


Allow each thing you encounter in the world to reach your citta. You may be worried by an upcoming log or feel peacefulness from the sunlight hitting the trees.
Try not to worry about other things during walking meditation. If you find your mind drifting towards external worries, center yourself so you are focused only on the present.

, Objects of consciousness, or dharma, is when you are able to classify your mental and emotional states. By doing so, you can begin to recognize and eventually reject states that do not lead to relaxation.Classifying your emotional states begins with recognizing them as they appear. Eventually, you will able to choose which states you wish to experience.

, In Buddhism, you become more aware of the outer world the more you are aware of your inner world. Calming your inner world will allow you to not be distracted and notice the external world.Balancing your experience is the last step of Buddhist Walking Meditation. Make sure that you have gone through all the stages first before you attempt to balance your inner and outer experience.
Ideally, you should not have to change how much you are paying attention to your inner or outer experience. Instead, you should be able to pay attention to both in a state of quiet awareness.

Remove attachment and craving.,
Develop spiritual understanding.,
Reduce depression.,
Gain physical benefits.",How to Practice Buddhist Walking Meditation3," One of the goals of Buddhism is to cease desire for things of this world, since that leads to misery. Walking meditation helps you to stay present in the moment, rather than attaching yourself to the future or the past.Walking meditation is particularly useful for getting rid of attachment to the world. Even though you are out in the world, you are forced to stay in the moment, since you are actively engaged in the world by the act of walking.

, Walking meditation can help you to develop your spirituality by allowing you to commune with your inner experience and the outside world. You can gain deeper spiritual insight through ridding yourself of unnecessary worries. Meditation of any type helps to get rid of unhealthy mental and emotional habits.

, Walking meditation can help to make you feel less depressed. Instead of feeling distracting while walking, you can reduce stress and depression through being mindful of how you feel in the moment.Depression and stress often come from being worried about the past or present. Through walking meditation, the emphasis on the present moment can help you to rid yourself of these worries.

, Walking has many physical benefits for your cardiovascular health. Walking meditation can be even more beneficial since it works to quiet your mind as well."

Meditate on Love.",How to Chant Mantras," We all use words to express ourselves and meet our needs, speaking about 15,000 words out loud a day. A mantra is a sound, syllable, word or phrase that you may use for multiples reasons. Some use mantras to maintain focus during mediation, allow meanings to reach their subconscious, have a spiritual experience, achieve a goal or help change themselves for the better.;
, You will want to start out in a place with few distractions. A bedroom where you can shut the door and windows works fine. Minimize distractions, such as phone calls, notifications and television by shutting electronic devices off so you can focus on your mantra.


You can add incense or candles to your meditation spot to help you get into the mood and focus.
Set aside time every day to practice your mantra. You will want at least 30 minutes of uninterrupted time for this.

, Intentions are the thoughts and emotional drives that initiate every action we take. Whether we decide to go to the store, wave to a friend, say a word or go to work, it all starts with an intention. Think about the reason you want to perform a mantra—for peace, health, success or a spiritual connection? Determine the purpose for your mantra session and focus on that.

, Most people choose a sitting position but you can adopt whatever position you find comfortable. If you are flexible and used to the position, you may want to use the lotus position. Since your comfort level will determine your ability to relax and focus on your mantra, don’t force yourself to take on a pose that will be distracting or uncomfortable.


It is important to keep your back naturally straight but not rigid. Do not slouch.
Many people choose a cross-legged meditation position. If this is a difficult position to maintain, you can make it easier with your back against a wall or use a rolled blanket or towel under your ankles.
Sitting upright in a chair is another option. To do this, keep your feet directly under your knees, press your thighs against the chair and make sure your feet have good contact with the ground. Keep your spine straight and your chest raised.

, Clear your mind, and don’t worry about the past or the future. Focus on what is happening at the moment. Concentrate on your feet, legs, back, arms, hands, neck, face and scalp, and notice any tension. Loosen your muscles as if you are floating under water. You could also imagine that you are in a place that makes you happy, like a beach, an old memory or an imaginary place.

, Proper breathing is important when chanting because it gives you more control over the quality of the sound and helps you maintain a rhythm. The goal is to sit quietly, close your eyes and focus on your breathing. During deep breathing, your abdomen should rise as you inhale and slowly drop as you exhale.


Inhale slowly through your nose. Count to 10 in your head, and hold your breath for 10 more seconds. Then exhale for 10 seconds. Continue doing this for 3 minutes, at the least. This will prepare you for your mantra chant.

, A session filled with multiple people speaking a mantra aloud can be very powerful and moving. An instructor can guide you with proper breathing, pronunciation and help you attain the right state of mind. Singing, dancing, using instruments, drumming, hand-clapping or rattles can all be used to help your mantra practice.

, Think about your intention, and what you want to get out of practicing your mantra. Consider questions, such as, how do you conceive of God or the divine? You may want to deepen your spiritual connection or achieve a goal. The type of mantra you choose should reflect your purpose and how you relate to God.

, Many religions have a name for God that you can use to create a mantra with. Hebrew mystics, for example, chant the secret names Yahweh, Adonai and Elohim. Hindu yogis may use the names of Siva, Vishnu, Brahma or others. Some Christians sects chant or sing Jesus’s or Maria’s name.


Singing devotional songs or mantras could be truly a mystical and a mysterious experience. We sing devotional songs with deep feelings, and full faith, letting the transcendental beauty, and qualities represented within the words enter our souls.
Singing words of mantras, prayers or devotional songs we become the transcendental vibration of the sound that we repeat, and we become pure love and joy.

, If you are not a native speaker of the language you will use for your mantra, then practice pronouncing the words prior to your mantra chanting session. That way you won’t let pronunciation issues distract you during your mantra practice. However, know that your pronunciation does not have to be perfect because what is in your heart matters most.

, A holy item, such as japa mala (a string of 108 wooden beads) or rosary beads (necklace in the Catholic Christian faith), can help focus your thoughts and add closure for each completed mantra. Each time a mantra is spoken, the speaker rubs a thumb across a japa mala bead, while Catholics repeat prayers holding a rosary.


Do not let other people handle your holy item. It is for you alone.

, There are many Hindu or Sanskrit mantras that are often used for this purpose. The most well-known mantra is the use of the sound, OM. This sound represents the original vibration of the universe, and is often used at the start a mantra practice.


Om Namah Shivaya is a mantra about bowing to the the supreme deity of transformation, Lord Shiva, and the highest self. This mantra can help you obtain a higher spiritual connection and build self-confidence.
The mantra, Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu, is one dedicated to the happiness and freedom for all beings. Saying this can help your thoughts, words and actions contribute, promote non-harm and assist you in being of service to the greater good.
This chant: Shanti Mantra , Om Saha Naavavatu, Saha Nau Bhunaktu, Saha Veeryam Karava Vahai, Tejasvi Aavadheetamastu Maa Vidvishaavahai Om, is a mantra that translates to: May the Lord protect and bless us, may he nourish us, giving us strength to work together for the good of humanity, may our learning be brilliant and purposeful, may we never turn against one another.
Om Gan Ganapatayei Namah is a mantra to Lord Ganesh, god of wisdom and success and destroyer of obstacles, for blessings and protection.
The Hare Krishna mantra is meant to enhance consciousness, free one from the birth and death cycle and bring total self-fulfillment. It goes: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.
The mantra, Baba Nam Kevalam, is used by Anansa Marga, meaning of infinite love, filling you with happiness, peace and love.
Om Mani Padme Hum is a popular Buddhist mantra that can lead one to enlightenment.
For those of you more comfortable with a feminine deity, Om Shree Matre Namah, is a mantra to the Divine Mother.
If you desire world peace, then Om Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu is a good mantra for wishing peace to all beings.

, You should always use a mantra that you are comfortable with and that will be meaningful to you. If you are not comfortable with Sanskrit or the Hindu language or gods, insert a familiar deity or choose another mantra that fits your spiritual beliefs. If English works better for you, then speak your mantra in English.


For example: the Lyrics of 'I love you Lord we sing and pray' are very inspiring. Try singing: 'You are my Mother you are my Father. You're the beginning, you are the center, you are beyond the end. You are the colors of the rainbow...'
Om Christave Namah is a mantra to Jesus Christ and may be one you choose if you are more comfortable with the Judeo-Christian religion.

, Take a moment to picture your idea of God. This can be a specific deity in any religion you feel comfortable with. You may choose to do research on the deity and see examples of images and statues devoted to that god or goddess to help you. You may also imagine your chosen spiritual entity however you please and in a way that makes the most sense to you.

, Repeat Om 3 times. Focus on the sound and the vibrations in your throat. Breathe out slowly. Be sure that you are relaxed and comfortable.

, You may wish to pray the rosary. If you are using a japa mala, then hold the beads in your right hand between your thumb and middle finger. If your item has a large bead or a tassel, move your fingers to the left of it. Every time you repeat your mantra, you will move your finger and thumb to the left of the current bead.


You will come back to the large bead or tassel again after 108 repetitions. You may then turn the beads around and continue moving across the beads in the opposite direction so you don't pass the large bead or tassel.

, Speak the sound slowly and clearly in a confident voice. Try to feel your breath and voice coming from your navel instead of just your head. If you are using your japa mala, then you will want to repeat your mantra at least 108 times. If not, repeat your mantra as many times as you want or until you feel like it has had the maximum positive effect for that session.

, If you are nervous, your voice may shake while you chant. Pay attention to see if your voice is very quiet or too loud. You may need to center and calm yourself to gain control of your emotions and your voice through better breathing. If your throat is tight or you are tensed, then you will need to relax further.

, After repeating your mantra, sit quietly and focus on your breath. Let thoughts come and go, gently bringing your mind back to your breathing each time. Know that your thoughts are just distractions and are meaningless in themselves, so don’t allow yourself to react emotionally to them. This is your time to be calm and still after practicing your mantra.

, Chanting mantras, praise worship songs, Bhakti songs, Hindi devotional songs, are all the ways to praise and worship the Divine. Powerful mantras, Maha mantra, and devotional songs, from all over the world, all have the same goal: increasing Love within our hearts and on Earth. Feel free to sing your mantras throughout each day.

More esoteric kinds include Sufi Whirling - which is a fantastic style to learn from a trained instructor - which are hard to find; self-manifest Qi Gong and other more advanced forms of Qi Gong and Yoga.;
, Ideally this place should be quiet, empty and full of space and fresh air. It doesn't have to be fancy and many people can and do enter into meditation in ordinary places at home - such as on their home gym equipment like the bike or rowing machine and even in the kitchen, such as stirring a pot of soup or porridge.


This may seem strange, but does offer opportunities that any calming, repetitive motion can become a meditation. Consider the serene tea ceremonies of Japan as how a simple thing can become a meditation. You can find opportunities to relax in vacuuming, ironing, sweeping, cooking, lawn mowing, raking leaves or earth (consider the famous Zen monastery gravel gardens), painting and washing windows and washing dishes.

, The principles that you use in sitting meditation are the same as moving; relaxing, not interfering with the movement, observing and letting go. Ideally you should have a sense of kindness when you practice, as this makes any meditation more effective.


Like in sitting meditation, what makes moving meditation work is that you let go, almost always this is by being occupied with something else that is calming and clarifying.

, Although taken for granted in sitting meditation, moving meditation requires free movement so loose or elastic type clothing that breathe well are the recommendation as tight clothing can be limiting and therefore distracting.

, Generally moving meditations can create more thinking - especially walking meditation, because for most of their life walking has been a common time people would think about issues - its a natural thing people do, so the mind will readily use an old pattern. Likewise rapid movement like aerobics can get the blood pumping and can stir up energy and excitement or tension.

, You may walk in a large circle, clockwise or anti-clockwise is a matter of personal preference; or in back and forth in a line. Hallways, verandas and long balconies are ideal for the latter.

, Move at a speed that is comfortable for you. Your speed is also very telling to an experienced observer so this can be useful to learn and reflect on what your state of mind is, as deliberate slowness shows a controlling mind (which won't let go easily), too fast shows agitation or worry, too random shows a lack of central calmness and focus, too sloppy can show fatigue - in which case a rest is recommended.

, What you are aware of varies from practice to practice, Some people may focus on the movement of the body, the sensation of touching the floor, the visual stimulus of each end of the room, its a very personal thing so there is no right or wrong, but in essence there should be a relaxed engagement with what you are doing.

, If you are walking in a circle, you can, at a certain stage, simply let go of where you are in the room and keep walking - it happens naturally because you are so relaxed into the pattern that you won't walk into anything, but for beginners or when starting it is ideal to keep fairly clear idea where you are in the room; and walls and furniture are useful guides.


For back and forth in a line, when you reach the end on the room, allow yourself to stop. Take a deep breath of fresh air filling the whole lungs, then breathe out and slowly turn around, collect your awareness and then continue. When you reach the other end, stop for a few seconds, then turn and take another deep refreshing breath. Breathe naturally the rest of the time. Back and forth styles are generally slower to get into a peaceful state but tends to be more stable.

, This essentially is letting them fade away on their own, which they do when you have shifted focus back to your movement.

, There is no fixed length of time, but generally you will know when it has finished. Walking meditation, if practiced for a long time such a few hours, it can feel as if you are floating, so you tend not to be too worried about time as you are enjoying yourself so much.

, Your feet should be a shoulder width apart and as parallel as comfortable. Allow your hands to hang comfortably and gently in front of your stomach area, with your elbows pointing outwards and the palms facing you. Take a minute or so to settle into your body's centre of gravity (often called the dan tian) and settle the weight into your feet as if strong roots are growing into the ground.

, Your breath should be gentle, natural, slow and deep, and allow the air to fill up your lungs. Ideally you should do this meditation where there is ample fresh air, rather than old stale air.

, As you breathe in, gently allow the hands and arms to expand outwards and upwards, as if expanding around a big ball, or more accurately, as if your energy space is expanding. As you breathe out, allow them to sink back down as if the ball is shrinking to the size of a basketball (or whatever size feels right for you). Repeat for each breath.

, As you breathe in, rock slightly forward onto the front half of your feet, and as you breathe out, rock back slightly. This is a very gentle, natural movement and generally happens all on its own.

, As you breathe in, stand up or expand slightly, as you breathe out, you may relax inwards - as if sitting down on a high chair.


All movements should essentially follow the flow of the breath as a natural expression of expansion and contraction. It should feel each time you breathe as if a wave of energy is coursing through you.
Movements should feel comfortable and relaxed to you, if you feel tension or over-exertion, this can for beginners simply be using muscles that have not been used in a while, but can also be a sign of forcing the meditation, in which case the meditator should stop and rest until they feel more calm. Force and meditation don't work well together.

, Imagine the energy is flowing in you like waves in the ocean, each time you breathe in and out the energy flows in and out like a wave. Let the energy flow outwards taking any muscle tension, tiredness and inner toxins, so that the in-breath soothes, cleanses and refreshes your entire body. You may do this as long as you wish.

, This means at the start of each meditation, each time you should keep to small, gentle waves. As your body and mind lets go more, it naturally wants to expand more and breathe more. When your arms expand out just above shoulder height, that is about the extent you should go for. Any more than that can potentially make you feel tired as it can be too much of a work-out for the arms and lungs.

, When you feel ready, allow the waves to slowly shrink back where your arms move only a few inches in front of your abdomen, palms facing inwards.

, Allow the energy to flow through you as you settle into your feet. You may like to stand observing this for a few minutes, or to sit or lie down to observe.

, I take the suffering in my life. I consistently walk my way of health and healing.""

, Rub your hands in front of the heart chakra and think, ""Om Buddha of Healing. Om inner wisdom. Please guide and help me on my way.""

, What is the way of your healing? What do you have to do? What triggers your problem? Think so long until you are satisfied with the result. When you hear no answer, you are either blocked inside (you don't want to see the real causes of the problem), or you have a bad contact to your inner voice. The best way then is slowly to get into thinking about your problem.

, My problem is ... The way of healing is ...""

, Stop all other thoughts. Feel calmness, serenity and peace in you. Stop a minute every thought and move gently our feet. Focus on your feet and move on, until your mind comes completely to rest. Then linger in a slight meditation. All thoughts and feelings may come and go as they please. Relax.

Realize that life is suffering:


To live is to suffer.,
Realize that the origin of suffering is attachment:


The origin of suffering is attachment to transient things and temporary pleasures.,
Understand that the cessation of suffering is attainable:


The cessation of suffering can be attained through the elimination of unwholesome sensual craving and attachment.,
Understand that there is a path to the cessation of suffering:


There is a path to the end of suffering.",How to Achieve Happiness According to the Dalai Lama1," The human nature is not perfect and neither is the world we live in. We have to endure suffering such as sickness, old age, and death; we have to endure psychological suffering too like sadness, fear, frustration, disappointment, and depression.
However, there are positive experiences too that we perceive as the opposite of suffering, such as comfort and happiness. Life is imperfect and incomplete, because our world is subject to impermanence. This means we are never able to keep what we strive for, and just as happy moments pass by; our loved ones and we ourselves will pass away too.;
, Transient things do not only include the physical objects that surround us, but also ideas. Ignorance is the lack of understanding of how our mind is attached to impermanence.
The reasons for suffering are; unwholesome desire, lust, pursuit of wealth and prestige, striving for fame and popularity. Because the objects of our attachment are transient, their loss is inevitable, thus suffering will follow.
Objects of attachment also include the idea of a ""self"" which is a delusion, because there is no self. What we call ""self"" is just an imprint we make on the body we occupy.

, Suffering can be overcome through human activity simply by removing the cause of suffering. Eliminating negative thoughts, deeds and unwholesome sensual desire is the process that results in the state of Nirvana. Nirvana means psychological freedom from worries, fears and harmful desires that cause of our suffering.

, It is a path of self improvement which is described in more detail in the eightfold path. It is the middle way between the two extremes of self indulgence and self denial. It is also a gradual method of self improvement.

"
"
Consider what the thoughts and mental tension is about.,
Focus on and let go of what you are wanting.,
Relax and change the focus.,
Practice quality over quantity and be selective when and where you meditate.",How to Do Basic Troubleshooting for Meditation1," Is it about a topic, such as a nagging feeling you haven't finished something? You may also be feeling about an experience or memory that keeps running through your mind. It is very important to be able to find out whether there is a central topic to your thoughts and feelings as you can then start to consider that topic in ways to resolve it creatively, or to let it go.


A chattering mind can be a number of things. It might also be a result of pain the body is feeling as the mind is essentially distracting itself using thought chains like a pacifier. Alternatively, you may be bored, frightened or unfamiliar with meditation and the mind is looking for distraction into something more familiar. There is a number of different causes, so the best method overall is to find out the cause of the problem. If your meditation is like the below image, then you should stop meditation to be able to find out what is going on.;
, Your mind might be wanting something to go away (pain or thoughts), or something to happen (deep concentration, lovely feelings, a magic pill to make all the problems go away) etc.


Consider your relationship to the experience, is the experience causing your tension, or is it your relationship to the experience and the tension that is causing more problems?

, Ideally you should be meditating on a subject, such as the breath. If your mind is capable, return your focus to your breathing and spend a few seconds relaxing and letting go. If your mind refuses to settle, change the focus subtly to relaxing using the breath as a medium, or any muscle relaxation exercises you may know. Alternatively, focus on compassion or kindness to yourself, counting or a word or mantra that helps you relax.


For beginners - if it is unbearable, get up and walk around and take some space. Avoid forcing the mind if you are a complete beginner, the odds are not stacked in your favour as you don't have as much familiarity and awareness - thoughts and feelings can be like phantoms in the night, but you need to shine a light of awareness on them so you can see that they are all things that, with experience, you can handle for the best outcome.

, Meditating in a noisy area will distract and annoy all but the most experienced meditators, but for optimum results, a quiet peaceful place is the best. Meditating after work or school can be good for relaxation, but not ideal for focusing as the mind can be too tired - the early hours of the morning can be a good time, providing that you normally get up early anyway and so won't be falling asleep. A pleasant 10 minutes a day is better than half an hour where you end up fighting a war with yourself. Aim to find out what makes quality and what ruins quality.

, Buddha distinguishes three types of right intentions: 1. The intention of renunciation of unwholesome desire. 2. The intention of good will and eliminating feelings of anger and wishing bad will on others. 3. Not thinking or acting cruelly, violently, or aggressively towards others and developing compassion and kindness.

, Buddha explained right speech as follows: 1. Abstaining from false speech, especially not telling deliberate lies and not to speak deceitfully. 2. Abstaining from insulting speech and not to use words cruelly against others. 3. Refraining from using harsh words that offend or hurt others. 4. Abstaining from gossiping. What this means is to tell the truth, to speak friendly, warm, and gently.

, Unwholesome actions lead to unsound states of mind, while wholesome actions lead to sound states of mind.
Again, the principle is explained in terms of abstinence:
1. Abstaining from harming people, especially taking life (including suicide) and doing harm intentionally or delinquently to others.
2. Abstaining from stealing, fraud, deceitfulness, and dishonesty.
3. Abstaining from sexual misconduct.
Right action means to act kindly and compassionately, to be honest, to respect the belongings of others, and to keep sexual relationships harmless to others.

,, Without effort, which is in itself an act of will, nothing can be achieved. Misguided effort distracts the mind from its task, and confusion will be the consequence.
Mental energy is the force behind right effort; it can occur in either wholesome or unwholesome states. The same type of energy that fuels desire, envy, aggression, and violence can on the other side fuel self-discipline, honesty, compassion, and kindness.
Right effort is detailed in four types:
1. To prevent the arising of unwholesome states;
2. To abandon unwholesome states that have already arisen;
3. To arouse wholesome states that have not yet arisen;
4. To maintain and perfect wholesome states.

, It is the mental ability to see things as they truly are, with clear consciousness. Instead, we almost always conceptualize, sense impressions and form thoughts immediately. We interpret actions and relate them to other thoughts and experiences. The mind then weaves those constructs into complex interpretative schemes.
Right mindfulness is clear perception and it penetrates impressions without getting carried away. It enables us to be aware of the process of conceptualization in a way that we actively observe and control our thoughts.

, This concentration is described as a single point of mind, a state where all mental faculties are unified and directed onto one particular object.
Right concentration for the purpose of the eightfold path means wholesome concentration, the concentration on wholesome thoughts and actions. The Buddhist method of choice to develop right concentration is through the practice of meditation. The meditating mind focuses on a selected object. It first directs itself onto it, then sustains concentration, and finally intensifies concentration step by step. Through this practice it becomes natural to apply elevated levels of concentration in everyday situations.

Exercise.,
Never force the body, but do push it a little.,
Experiment with changing the posture.",How to Do Basic Troubleshooting for Meditation2," It might be that you are simply not flexible or strong enough for your posture (if you choose sitting for example). Look into doing muscle stretches, or gentle exercises such as pilates, tai chi or yoga. If you make these exercises a meditation or concentration exercise at the same time, you win two ways. Look to see if you are holding onto something or deliberately tensing part of the body. That's also attachment at play because it's mentally driven.


Generally, it's best to know how long you sit and how often. If you can only sit 10 minutes anyway and practice maybe once a week, then you are very likely to get problems beyond that time because the body hasn't had much practice for longer sitting.
If the shoulders are painful, that is usually where the tension is, so it's best to either focus on stretching and relaxing, as well as dropping the shoulders and upper spine to straighten the neck and relax the upper torso.
If the legs are painful, then consider your seating posture. People with nerve or knee damage will simply have pain and very little will help it so ""lion"" or ""sleeping"" postures, standing, walking or sitting in a chair will be a better posture.
If the lower spine is painful, then like the shoulders this is where tension is often stored. Squats are a good type of exercise should the body relax and drop gently into the squat (without loading the knees, much like you would slowly drop into a chair), with the arms softly held out in front to balance. The aerobic style where the legs do all the work is good for the legs, but isn't helping where it's needed. This loosens and strengthen the lower spine and by using mindfulness or focus exercises, you can (with much practice) locate the tension and relax or stretch the spine while in meditation.
If the chest or breathing is painful, this is more often associated to the spine alignment and muscle strength. By relaxing the upper shoulders it can open the chest which can take pressure off the lungs and the diaphragm.
For numbness and tingling, this is often a circulation problem, more likely to plague older and less fit people, or anyone who sits in a posture where the flesh can be pressed or cramped. Exercise can fix some problems, but for most it is a sign to change the posture, change the pillow or mat you are using or change the clothing.

, If it is painful, beyond what you can bear to look at, stop the practice and go and walk or relax. If it's an ache, bear with it until you can be more patient with it and understand what's causing it, as well as build up tolerance.


You are going to get aches, itches, numbness and other distractions when you start out. This is largely because you don't normally spend much time examining them. Just like when you sit at a desk, your attention is completely elsewhere (such as reading, thinking or typing), but you still shuffle about without noticing it when you have an ache or feel uncomfortable. This is the perfect opportunity to look at the relationship you have with your body as well as your bodies natural needs, as for most people their awareness is limited.

, It might be easier to sit in a chair, or you might find walking a better method.


Take your time. Remember that blaming yourself or wanting things to be perfect is the wanting or craving that causes stress. You are what you are, trying to change what you cannot change is ultimately pointless. Be kind to yourself for that reason.

If you find yourself falling asleep or nodding during meditation, this can be down to several things or a mix of them.,
If these don't work, stop and try again another time.",How to Do Basic Troubleshooting for Meditation3,"


The most likely is your concentration has dropped off (start counting or noting something more obvious). If you have relaxed sufficiently, yet there is no object of focus to keep the mind engaged, it naturally inclines towards sleeping.
You could simply just be tired mentally or physically (for either of these, go and stretch your legs or take a nap). This can also be common if you practice meditation in a marathon style, then don't do any for the rest of the week, or meditating early in the morning when you are not used to it and are normally fast asleep.
Or you have eaten too much or too recently.
Or your spine is not straight or your chest is not open enough. A closed or caved in chest restricts breathing which encourages the sleepy kind of relaxation.

, As always your body has it's own needs, trying to ignore those is asking for trouble. Changing the posture to walking can help, but lying down sets the bodies sleep process into action, so while you will at least have a decent nap to refresh you, it trains the mind to sleep rather than meditate.

"
"
Firstly run through the checklist starting with the environment, it needs to be comfortable and virtually 100% free of any distractions.,
Check your mind, to develop deep concentration actually takes several weeks or months of continuous practice free of duties and work.,
Discuss with other experienced meditators often.,
Practice a different concentration type if you can find someone who can teach you, such as the Kasinas or focused mindfulness to see if this improves things.",How to Do Basic Troubleshooting for Meditation4," The mind has be able to trust the environment is safe, so it doesn't run after distractions. Concentration is hard to build and easily lost.

, If you come home from a busy day and have ideas, media & music going all the time, you're likely to feel too tired for concentration. Take a long break from work and dedicate some proper time. A retreat may be a good option to build some more experience.

, A lot of benefit can come from discussing your problems.

, Some subjects are easier than others, which is why there is so many types of meditation available.

"
"
Stick reminder cards at your desk or on places to remind you to be aware and mindful.,
Look for more details when you feel you are aware of the basics.,
Look deeper.",How to Do Basic Troubleshooting for Meditation5," Practicing daily mindfulness really does help dramatically in meditation as you see that what you experience with your eyes shut, is much the same as with your eyes open in your daily life. The more you observe during the day, the more you can observe in meditation.


However, accept that no one practices it perfectly from the beginning. It is just like being an athlete, no one becomes a champion without lots of training and practice.

, Relax, the world is not going to end if you miss something or feel tired. There are reasons why kindness and compassion are central to Buddhism.

, This is a very deep and complex subject and it's proportional to your depth of examination and application as to the depth of insight you will reach. Cursory examination will result in virtually nothing deeper even if you do it all the time because you aren't probing into anything in order to see deeper.


The whole aim of looking at these things is to see everything as it happens without your interference or judging, so it happens on it's own. That way you can see what really happens and can act to make the best quality experience.

"
"
Be brave.,
Look carefully for insight values.,
Use mindfulness as an anchor, support or point of reference to steady the mind, continue to evaluate the feelings and let go of them.",How to Do Basic Troubleshooting for Meditation6," Take it slowly as there is many layers you have to peel back, but it's something that you'll have to do eventually, because you can run away forever, or stop running now.


Often the mind wants to frighten you away and it can be incredibly effective at this. No one knows your weaknesses better than you do. This can be a big progress marker when your mind frightens you away as it can show that your desires have been ruling you for some time and that should you observe them, they won't have the same power. To maintain their hold, desires use all kinds of tricks.
If you feel terrible about having unpleasant thoughts or having your chatterbox brain not responding to what you want, it is wise to reflect that's how the mind is. Often, some strive to reach an inner goodness, but end up finding inner ""badness"" everywhere they look and so feel like they have hit a wall. This is a reflection that the mind is what we make it and that natural goodness comes only from letting go of troubles and by encouraging virtues. It is an art of balance and training until you reach a stage where you can decide for yourself how you wish your mind to be.
Be firm. You might be horrified to see the whole ""life"" thing as unreliable and conditional on so many things, but that is exactly what it is and always has been.

, Are you in effect sinking or indulging in these feelings? A hard question to ask in hard times, but see if you are feeling depressed, sad, angry or whatever because you want to be.


If you feel lost, try to compare what it was like when you didn't. Feeling lost is often because there is an awareness of change, or that an idea or belief we thought was real and were happy with became exposed as just an idea. The problem then is then the mind often starts stressing, which is a separate process. The only way to overcome this is to study it and let the stressful processes go.
Practice loving kindness, appreciation, compassion and equanimity. These are excellent for finding stability and form a good foundation to start overcoming your problems. In essence, a positive and a negative can balance each other but when you have balance, you can start developing a habit of being more gentle and generous.

, Compassion and wisdom need to work together, otherwise it's like rowing a boat with one oar - it simply goes around in circles.

"
Organise the Meditation space.,
Address any obstacles to meditation.,
Vary the duration and style.,
Ease gently into the meditation routine.,
Ensure there is enough space.,
Consider some of the following styles for teaching.,
Close the meditation by inviting reflection.",How to Teach Kids Relaxation Meditation," Find a nice peaceful place away from the hustle and bustle, this is important for any group size, but it should be a place that the kids can associate with as a peaceful and safe place. Large echoing halls such as the school gym, or busy places like the classroom or kitchen at home will be too distracting as it becomes difficult to associate the place as somewhere to relax. In a school environment, empty classrooms with a good carpet are usually the best option. The outside environment, such as a park or playground works far better for children than adults, but only when it's a suitable time.;
, Introduce a name for the meditation if necessary. In some instances, children don't know what meditation is, or have an idea based on cultural media and may feel meditation is strange or frightening, or they feel that they are somehow different if they meditate. This often can be an obstacle, regardless of a persons' age, so success often has been found in giving it another name, such as ""chill out time"", ""creative thinking"" or whatever the context suits.


Generally, children are very good meditators when they are adept at letting go, but also the hardest to teach. Adults often take up meditation as a personal choice, or on recommendation by their health care professional. Children tend not to see the benefits until they are much older.
The best option in this case is music based relaxations. Provide the child with some peaceful tracks on an MP3, or similar format, which is discreet and can be used at any time.

, Generally kids do best in guided meditation formats until they have had enough familiarity, or confidence, to be independent. It can often be impractical for children to stay with a meditation object - such as breath awareness - without assistance to keep them on track, as even for adults distractions are never too far away. In practice variety is the spice of life that can build this confidence.


Likewise, the duration is important. Quality is much more important than quantity because if meditation seems like a chore then it is unlikely to be of any benefit, or taken up and practiced in the future as a relaxation skill or personal development. 5 to 10 minutes is ideal for beginners, but again be flexible.

, While kids do well at ""sleeping"" posture meditations, they can be so tired, especially when they have exams at school, that they end up falling asleep. This usually is a sign they are in need of actual rest, but short sleep times have been known to affect nighttime sleep patterns, as well as training the mind to sleep rather than meditate. A chair, sitting comfortably on a cushion, or an exercise mat are the best choices for beginners.


Meditation, unless it is used specifically as a means to fall asleep, requires a steady balance of relaxation, awareness (or mental engagement) and sufficient, but not excessive energy.

, Ideally children should not be in arms reach of each other, or next to their friends or disliked class mates, likewise siblings in a home environment. This is logically so the opportunity to be distracted and disturb others is reduced. This may mean you or your partner should sit between them if necessary at home. This is all to ensure the best environment is available.


Few things are as counterproductive to meditation as giggling or playing around, so strategic thinking is important in a class context. Meditation and trust have a very close relationship.

, There is a huge resource online so there is an endless variety, but the following examples are similar to most styles.


Building a peaceful ""mind palace"". This method is ideal for tension or anxiety type stress. Invite the meditator to imagine themselves in front of a closed door, to which they hold the key in their hand. On the other side of this door is a place they can feel safe and can unwind. Ask them to describe the door to themselves and, once they go through their door, what it is like on the other side. Ask them to observe and explore this special place. Many meditators see different things, such as a warm cosy room with rugs and a big chair, some imagine a park, the beach or a space in the clouds. This space should be respected as their private place that only they should know, as it serves as a place of personal retreat. Instruct them to imagine a comfortable chair in which once they sit, is fully relaxing and eases away any pain and stress. After some time - 5 minutes is good for a beginner, they can imagine getting up, full of energy and happiness and they can come out of the meditation but walking to the door and through it.
Imagine resting in a beautiful field, and then floating up into the sky where one can fly free like a bird. The meditator can soar over the flowers and dance amongst the clouds. This style is useful for low energy and morale.
Imagine a forest stream, with the sounds of flowing water and birds. This is useful for general relaxation.
Body Relaxation. Start at the feet and ask them to tense their feet for a second or two, then as they breath out, they relax their feet. This can be expanded next to their legs, then their lower middle body, then their upper middle, then their arms and finally their head and necks. This should be done slowly over the course of ten minutes and ask them to be aware of each relaxation and the difference between the two stages.
Breath meditation. This one has plenty of variations, one can imagine breathing in colours, light or breathing out with the notion of relaxing and being at ease.
Incorporate meditation as an activity, such as floating in the water (while supervised), painting or drawing, or as an improvised dance form, which is popular with young children under 10.

, This specifically trains the meditator to recognise what works best for them.

"
"
Know when your meditation practices turns into a search for something.,
If you are wanting to destroy things, then keep testing that things simply are what they are and they aren't ours to change.,
Develop insight.",How to Do Basic Troubleshooting for Meditation7," There often comes to a stage where people can get addicted to pleasant experiences and/or afraid of unpleasant ones. The searching makes the meditation unpleasant and, being a desire, that search compounds itself into more and more misery and depression.


Generally there is deficit of understanding or kindness that forces you to desire to look for something better, so it is the addiction that needs to be addressed, as well as the fear of unpleasant experiences.

, Aim to understand and be amiable with life as it is.

, Ultimately it is very important to understand that happiness is found when you stop looking for it. It is the desires that propel us to search, but never lead us to it as desires and addictions are self perpetuating.

"
"
Avoid extremes.,
Be cautious about the idea that understanding is a mere process, method or technique.,
Ask for advice.,
Remember the parable of the Lotus.",How to Do Basic Troubleshooting for Meditation8," There are actually many obstacles one may experience, but they are often extremes such as trying to make the meditation be something, or trying to prevent it from being something, as well as other variations of this theme.


For example, culture is an attractive idea that you belong to, or are a member of a society or tradition connected to an ancient lineage of great teachers. The problem with lineage is while such a community is a fantastic source of knowledge and meditation skills (which is good), but misunderstandings and different views and dogmas are passed on the same way. There is also the possibility that if you are too attached to the society then it will become a hindrance. It's best to remember that such traditions are good things, they follow the same rule as everything else that if misused, they can cause harm.
Consider this useful parable from Buddhist traditions. The Buddha gave a neat parable that directly proportionate to the emotional attachment, identity or investment placed in anything, is equal to the stress it will give when it changes. For this reason, test everything and let go of the things that are unskillful.

, Everyone gets insights of various qualities regardless of religion, age and outlook, it's all down to looking into what's happening at the time to gain an ""inward-sight"", then using that to develop understanding and build skills to deal with problems.


There is another good parable from the Buddhist tradition. The Buddha described himself as an explorer who rediscovered an old path through the jungle. For people following the same path, regardless who they are or what society they belong to, they will find that it still leads to the way out. This is essentially to show that anyone, anywhere who follows the same path to the end (even by chance) will still find their way out even in the future when the path has become overgrown and lost again.

, Respectfully ask why often and do your homework. Often an instructor may say do something, but if you don't know that there is a good reason, you miss an opportunity to develop skills and to understand how the advice can improve your practice. Sincerity plays an important role in meditation. Doing your homework helps you avoid unscrupulous instructors.

, Sometimes the old metaphors are the best ones. Ancient philosophy tells us to rise above our troubles like the lotus rises above the mud that it grows in. That way it can grow free and beautiful.

Imagine what a restful garden would look like to you.,
Do the basic groundwork first.,
Look at examples of gardens in different parts of the world for inspiration.,
Start a plan.,
Use structures and tree lines as sanctuary creators.,
Think about the surfaces.,
Invest in objects that will increase the sense of serenity in the garden.,
Choose plants that inspire you.,
Use eco-friendly garden solutions and products.,
Keep updating and changing your meditation garden to suit your needs.,
When meditating, select an area that is cool, calm and preferably quiet.",How to Make a Meditation Garden," Think about what you love about being in the garden in terms of relaxing and offloading your stress. Take those memories and feelings and translate them into practical ideas of how you would like to see a personal garden aimed totally at relaxation and peace. If any ideas occur, (for example, a blue and yellow theme would be attractive to you, or a wooden park bench), incorporate those things into your imagined garden. If you are going to share this garden with family or others, get their ideas and input too. And always remember that this is your garden; it's your intent that counts when creating a meditation garden. There is no right or wrong way to make a meditation garden; the whole goal is to make a garden that both calms and inspires you and when you open your eyes, inspires you even more.


Try to see this garden as an ""outdoor room"".It's a place where you'll go to relax, rest, and recline, so it will need to have features in it that you find comfortable, comforting, and secure from prying eyes.
It's best to start your imagination with conditions like ""it has to fit in my budget"" so you know not to go wild in pursuing expensive, and therefore unobtainable, dreams.
Look through garden books with pictures of other people's gardens. What elements in those gardens appeal to you as peaceful and serene ideas that you could incorporate into your own space?;
, There are some basics that you'll need to consider initially in order to make the most of the garden space you have available and to stay within budget and the realms of what can actually be achieved. For example:



Size of the garden: Work out how large your garden is so that you can work according to its size. And, unless you live alone, your garden will be used by other people, so it's a good idea to also plan how you will divide your meditation or serenity garden from the regular hustle bustle of the rest of the garden. Think about how you will make obvious divisions using such items as potted plants in rows, hedgerows, large palms, benches, fencing, and so forth.Sound levels in the garden: Consider how silent it is already or whether you might need to create buffers using fences, hedges, embankments, or other sound-muffling structures. Your garden doesn't have to be large, but if you are in a reliably quiet neighbourhood you probably have a natural advantage. Sound can be an annoying hindrance or an object of focus for meditation.

Terrain: Is the garden sloped, hilly, flat, grassy, solely soil, etc. All of these will create particular needs and issues of their own that you'll need to work with to create a sense of peace and comfort.

Views: What views exist in your garden that you might wish to make use of as a feature point and find ways to ""frame"". The view might be the horizon, or a lovely group of trees, or anything else that inspires you. If you have none of these, consider a green bamboo hedge (clumping forms) to hide a lack of view, or the mundane everyday things like the compost bin, neighbour's wall or an ugly fence.

, You might find really good inspiration in traditional gardens from other parts of the world. While there is no need to follow a theme, having one can instill a sense of calmness through orderliness and focus. There are several ways to find out what types of gardens are grown elsewhere: borrow library books showing the gardens in pictures, look online for images, visit open gardens that feature specific garden examples, or visit your local Botanical Gardens or specialized public gardens for inspiration. Think about the elements in these gardens that inspire feelings of peace and happy solitude in you. Some gardens to consider include:


A Japanese garden – this could incorporate sand or fine gravel patterns, Zen elements, cherry blossom, the Japanese maple tree, and geometric simplicity.
A Chinese garden – this could incorporate a fish pond, overhanging trees, little bridges, tiny pagodas, natural stone sculptures (ie: non-carved stone) and pathways.
A southwestern USA desert garden – this could incorporate simplicity, cacti, water-hardy plants(great for a garden in an area low in water), and a shady tree.
A traditional English garden – think about a walled garden in a university town like Oxford, Cambridge, or Durham as an example.
An Australian native garden – this could include gum trees, Australian natives (look for the fragrant plants to awaken your senses), and lots of shaded areas to cut out the heat of the sun. Eucalyptus trees are great for listening to the sound of the breeze as well as for their scent.
A North American garden – this could be filled with carved wooden items; maple, fir, birch, and oak trees; lots of deciduous colors in the fall; plenty of plants and feeders for the birds to feed on, and so forth.
Other minimalist type garden plans including ""Middle Eastern"" or ""Islamic"" gardens and many other different variations are ideal formats.

, Incorporate all the pluses of your existing garden (for example, you might already have a pleasant quiet area or a fish pond that you can work around), and begin planning for the desired features that you haven't yet got. On a large piece of paper, draw an outline of how you perceive your garden, including the features you intend to add. This plan can be updated and changed as you proceed, but it's a good idea to begin with a basic idea to work from.


Keep the plan in a folder or binder. This way, you can also slip in magazine cuttings, photos, and pamphlets for ideas, products, and services that you'd like to incorporate into your meditation garden over time.

, Throughout history, people have used small garden buildings such as summerhouses, loggia, pergolas, and tree-lined areas and entrances to create little havens of peace or to calm the eye when viewed. In adding such structures (both living and inanimate), you create beauty and functionality at once:


Plant a ""grove"" area. This is basically a small secluded little patch of trees lined up either at the end of a lawn, down a pathway, or in some other formation that works well within the garden space. A grove is a lovely place to relax in or to view, and can often avert the eyes from any major distractions like the house, your neighbour's sunbathing, or any messy areas, etc.
Vine arbors and pergolas are a cross between the garden space and indoor space. They can provide shelter from sun, wind, and rain, as well as adding incredible depth and beauty to a garden space.
Consider a courtyard. This semi-enclosed environment might be ideal for marking out your sanctuary with clarity and for creating barriers against external movement and sounds. Courtyards allow you to consider a rooftop garden, a lane way garden, and even a garden squashed into a small space between walls as other options for placing your meditation garden.
Add a summerhouse, loggia, or an enclosed pavilion. Places that provide shelter from the sun and the rain are ideal additions to a meditation garden; if it's too noisy, hot, wet, or cold in your garden, consider building a little enclosed pavilion. If you have an existing summer house take advantage of using what's already there. The beauty of having a pavilion or summer house type structure is that you can fill it with soft furnishings such as a mat, cushions, pillows, etc., to make it a comfortable sanctuary for lying and resting in, no matter what the time of year may be.

, If you're going to be relaxing in this garden, the surface upon which you walk, sit, lie down, and relax matters a great deal. Surfaces that are too hot, cold, or hard will spoil the experience, so plan this part with great care. Some surfaces to consider include:


Soft, grassy surfaces – this could be created by lawn, native grasses, chamomile, button grass, etc.
Bricks – lovely old bricks make a wonderful sun-warm surface. Over time bricks attract moss, lichen, etc. That may or may not be to your liking but it does add character and it creates a sense of oneness with nature.

Pavers – these can be hit and miss if chosen poorly. Older, handmade ones are probably lovely. Concrete-cast ones in bland colors can be a terrible choice if they look cheap and feel nasty. Be very careful with choosing pavers; they can look fantastic if you create patterns with them and weave them in among other surfaces and not just rely on them alone.

Mosaics – if you have the time and money for mosaics, these can be used to make a small (or large!) part of the meditation garden. Choose designs that are meaningful to you.
Other possible surfaces include pebbles, wood, slate, gravel (very fine), sand, patterned paving.
Complexity is best used according to the character of the person. Too much can be distracting to some, too little can be uninspiring to others. A highly complex image can be an object of focus, functioning much like a mandala.

, There are numerous garden-friendly items that will help to really create the ""meditation"" or peaceful feel of your garden. Ideal additions include:



Sculpture – look for local artists whose work pleases you; this is a great way to support local artists as well as gaining something unique and special for your garden; you might even consider commissioning something with special meaning for you, such as an animal totem, or a memorial to someone beloved. And of course, you can always make your own sculpture!
Water features – water is calming and relaxing, both when it is settled and when it is moving. You might consider water bowls, fish ponds, a fountain, a trickling water feature, or other items that use or display water.
Rocks – rockeries, rock sculptures, Inukshuks, and other uses of rocks can help add to the solidity and steadiness of your peaceful garden zone.
Small plinths or altars – these can be ideal places for you to place a candle, a vase of flowers, make a small shrine, or leave incense, candles or other spiritual offerings if that is your wish. Who you offer them to isn't really the matter at hand, it is the intention behind it that counts, but it's still best to pick one that inspires calmness in you.
Statues – there are many possibilities with statues; simply choose those that instill a sense of peace in you. Buddha images or statues and small pagodas are good ideas, but only if they work for you.
Specific empty spaces. These are little areas which are surprisingly restful as these are places which don't need anything to fill them.

, English cottage garden type plants are just as valid as minimalist gardens which have very few, if any, plants. The plants you choose can be scented, flowering, herbal, tropical, native or even desert style. The most important thing is that the plants should evoke calmness in you; so, if they are ""fussy"" plants that need a lot of effort, you might like to leave them out of your meditation garden or you'll feel compelled to weed and tidy instead of meditating and resting!


Use your five senses to work out which plants will be most pleasing to you in the meditation garden. For instance, if you're a person who loves to touch things, look for plants with lovely texture, such as the velvety lamb's ears. If you're someone who loves visual stimulation, you might adore brightly coloured flowers. Or, if you're someone who loves fragrances, choose a range of scented plants that bloom at different times of the year, to ensure that they will waft a beautiful fragrance through the garden during all seasons. Some of the night-flowering plants are gorgeously scented, and create a heavenly feeling on moonlit or starry nights.
Plant forms can inspire you. When choosing plants look at the shapes, patterns, lines, and colors to inspire a sense of peacefulness as well as something to concentrate upon when meditating (if you choose to do so).

, A meditation garden is a place to be at one with nature and the Earth; it wouldn't make sense to drown it in chemicals such as pesticides (insecticides), fungicides, anti-microbials and rodenticides. If you are practicing a philosophy of non-harm, or a virtue system such as Buddhist precepts using such toxins can affect the quality of the meditation as well as your well-being. Instead, look for the eco-friendly options to keep weeds and other pests under control within your garden, as well as using eco-friendly plant nutrient options.


Read How to use homemade garden sprays safely for some safety tips.
Read How to use your compost and How to make compost tea for some earth-friendly ideas.
Read about companion plants as some aid the growth of other plants while attracting beneficial insects.

, As with meditation itself, which helps you to grow and change over time, your garden should not be stuck in time. Replenish and refurbish your meditation garden as your own needs and wants evolve.

, Use a cheap doormat or an old beach-towel as a cost effective meditation mat (so you won't get damp from contacting grass or soil when sitting), then close your eyes, relax, focus and just let the meditation happen. Do not try to stop your thoughts from racing, as effort makes that worse. Simply allow them to flow and fade.


For more information on meditation, check out the breathing and meditation section on wikiHow. There is a very wide variety of meditations to suit all kinds of people, some for calming and stress reduction, some for spiritual or mental health, some are insight or contemplative focused and some are exercise forms in their own right, such as Tai Chi, walking meditation or Yoga (etc). They all have subtle differences, but it always depends on how you use your experiences to make them worthwhile.

Make daily tasks a meditation.",How to Do Mindful Meditation," Think about a place where you will not be interrupted or have distractions. It can be a quiet part of your home or next to a tree outside. Choose a place that feels peaceful and where you can detach from the hum of everyday life.


If you are cultivating a meditation practice, consider creating a space dedicated to meditation. You can place inspirational or calming items on a special table, such as flowers or pictures of beautiful places. Soften the light by adding candles.

, You may be stationary for several minutes at a time, and for this reason, it’s important to be comfortable. Pay attention to the room temperature to make sure it’s adequate. You may want to have a blanket around you or near you as your body temperature may drop. Have some pillows or cushions near you to make sitting more comfortable.


Wear comfortable clothing that won’t bother you or distract you.

, You may want to start with just a five to 10 minute meditation and work up from there. Don’t choose to start meditating for an hour as this can seem overwhelming. Instead, choose small increments of time to commit to, and if you want, increase the time.


Try setting a timer so that you will not be tempted to check the time during your meditation.Just make sure that the “end of meditation” timer is something gentle rather than a jarring alarm or buzzer. Try to find an alarm that sounds like soothing chimes or soft piano music.

, While many people associate meditation with sitting in lotus position (with legs crossed), there is not just one way to meditate. You can sit on the floor or in a chair, stand, walk, or lie down. Play around with different positions, using or not using cushions or pillows and find what feels most natural to you. There is no “wrong” way to meditate.


While laying down is quite comfortable, make sure you don’t fall asleep! It’s quite common to begin meditation and then float off into dreamland.

, It may take you a little bit of time to settle in and begin to detach from all the things going on in your life. Especially if you’ve had a stressful day, you may find yourself thinking about what happened or about things that need to happen in the future. You may feel your emotions stirring. All of this is okay. Notice that your mind is dancing, and let it dance for a bit as you settle in.


Keep in mind that it is okay if you feel a little strange about meditating. Just take a moment to identify the feelings you are having and then switch your focus to your physical position. Try to make yourself as comfortable as possible., Bring your awareness to your breath, noticing the inhalations and exhalations of each breath.Feel how each breath flows in and out of your body, filling your lungs and then releasing through your throat and your mouth. Begin to lengthen and deepen each breath. Taking deep breaths helps settle and relax the mind and the body.Observing your breath is also a mindfulness practice in itself. You can practice observing your breath for the entire length of the meditation.

, As you meditate, remind yourself that you have control over what thoughts and emotions you choose to engage.When you notice thoughts or emotions coming up that you do not wish to engage, release them and choose not to put your focus onto them.


This insight can be helpful in realizing that you can change negative thoughts and that you can let them go.
Don’t beat yourself up when you notice your mental stream of thoughts. Practice letting go of these mental experiences without judgment.

, Any time you get distracted by noises, thoughts, or anything, go back to observing your inhalations and exhalations. Any time you experience unpleasant thoughts or emotions, return your focus to your breathing.


When you focus on breathing, focus on neutrality. If thoughts come up while focusing on breathing, make sure you're maintaining the practice of not passing judgment on your thoughts, including on how you are practicing meditating. Judging yourself will interfere in your meditation session. Understand that it's common for people to get distracted or for thoughts to come up regarding their day.
Remember that meditation is not a performance., One of the goals of mindfulness practices is to help you focus on the present moment. It’s easy for your mind and emotions to jump to the future or back into the past, but your body is always in the present moment. This is why many mindfulness practices are body-driven. If you find your mind wandering often, return to your body, especially your breath. Try to focus only on the present moment., Mindful eating may even help you to lose weight by helping you to slow down and really enjoy your food.You can practice mindful eating with a piece of fruit, such as an apple.


Hold the apple and look at it, observing the form, texture, or any writing that may be on it.
Feel the apple in your hands, or perhaps against your lips.
Bring it closer to your face and spend a few breaths smelling it. Notice if your body responds, such as salivating or increased desire to taste it.
Finally, take a bite of the apple, noticing how it tastes, what it feels like, and if it’s enjoyable to chew it.

, You can also meditate while walking. Try taking a walk and as you walk, pay attention to the way it feels to walk, feeling your muscles move, bend, and stretch. Slow your pace so you can focus on your movements and the sensation of your feet touching and leaving the ground.Doing a walking meditation barefoot can heighten the experience and allow you to feel many more sensations such as the texture and the temperature of the ground.

, You can do sensation mindfulness meditation if you are experiencing pain or you want to tune in to your body. The skill can help reduce pain and tension in your body. Choose a part of your body to focus on, either internally or externally. Are sensations pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral? You can note ""there is now a pleasant feeling"" or ""there is an ache here"". Observe how the mind and body interact with these feelings.


A similar method that applies to both first two body-focused foundations is a form of body scanning; namely, scanning the body up and down to examine sensations and then letting them go to pass onto another part of the body, or watching energy flow.Instead of tuning out much of what surrounds you, tune in to each sense. Open your eyes and take in your surroundings, noticing any movement, colors, or objects that stand out to you. Notice any smells in the air. Notice any sounds, perhaps the hum of electricity, cars outside your window, or birds singing., Anything can be a meditation if you do it mindfully. You can brush your teeth mindfully by tasting the toothpaste, feeling the bristles of the toothbrush, and feel the motion of your hand. Take a shower mindfully and notice all the ways you take care of your body during this time. Even driving to work can be a meditation: notice how you feel in the car, the way your body conforms to the seat, and observe the thoughts and emotions that you experience when confronted with traffic, and desired or undesired outcomes.


Whenever you do a mindfulness practice, remember the most important part is being present. Come back to your breath and observe your thoughts and feelings without following them or judging them.

Select a quiet, comfortable place to meditate.,
Relax any tension.",How to Practice Body Mindfulness Meditation1," Choose an appropriate time when you feel able to meditate, free from distractions. Select a posture comfortable for you––for this meditation, all postures are suitable. (The How to do mindful meditation page describes the four main postures in a little more detail to help you choose one that is practical for you.) Ensure your head and torso are positioned to allow for ease of breathing and awareness. Having a stiff posture will cause discomfort and a too-soft posture will encourage sleepiness.;
, Spend a few moments developing awareness of what you are doing, such as sitting, breathing and relaxing. Spending a few minutes this way allows the mind to build more focus and awareness as it examines the body for tension. Allowing the body to relax also lets your mind become calm and quietened.


Give yourself a few minutes for this to occur and let go of distractions, agendas and other subjects of thought.

Acquire, find or make a Zen garden.,
Choose a rake.,
Decide what you want to achieve with your garden.,
Consider a pattern you would like to draw with the rake, taking into account all of the other elements, stones, trees or other plants.,
While you can design your own raking patterns, there are some time-honored patterns that Zen gardeners use:


The Aranami pattern.,
Take deep breaths to calm the body and mind.

,
Use the opposite side of the rake, and with the straight edge smooth your sand or gravel, creating a blank canvas.

,
Rake your garden in your desired design.,
It may look easy, but raking a Zen garden requires practice.",How to Rake a Zen Garden," Desktop Zen Gardens are available through stores, and the necessary materials required to make them can be found at many home and garden stores.


If you have found a Zen garden in your town and wish to rake it, ask permission first. Many of these gardens are made for visitors to sit and contemplate, rather than rake.;
, There are 2 common types of dry landscape rakes. They are called the saw-tooth rake and the dowel-tooth rake. A saw-tooth rake head is made out of a singular piece of wood, and the teeth are formed when triangular shapes are taken out of the wood, similar to a saw-blade. The dowel-tooth rake has teeth made from bamboo or wooden dowels that are attached to a length of wood.


The space between the teeth should differ based on the coarseness of the gravel and your desired design in the gravel. For example, if your gravel is very coarse, you would want a rake that has more space between the teeth. Also, the overall size of your rake will depend upon the size of your garden. A desktop garden would require a very small rake that you can fit between your thumb and forefinger.

, Is your goal purely aesthetic? In Zen Buddhism, the raking of dry-landscape gardens is thought to improve concentration. In general, a Japanese garden is used to create illusions, such as water or a landscape, and in turn influence your mind by considering those concepts.

, For example, a rock can be placed in the sand to represent a frog jumping into water. The rake would then draw circles around the stone, representing the ripple effect.


Plan your design in advance. Many gardeners use patterns that leave no footprints, a very hard thing to do if you are raking a larger garden.

, This is translated as ""stormy waves."" Create big, rough ridges to represent turbulent seas.
The Ginshanda pattern. This is translated to mean ""silver sand and open sea."" Draw a calm wave pattern.
The Mizumon pattern is translated as ""water"" or ""water pattern."" A very common pattern, used to signify the ripple pattern around rocks and straight wavelets.
The Ryūsui pattern means ""running water."" Rake the sand to represent flowing streams and rivers.
Sazanamimon is a ""ripple pattern."" This design represents the waves or ripples around moss islands or rocks.
The Seikaiha pattern means ""sea waves."" Rake very large wave patterns.
The Tatsunami pattern indicates ""great waves,"" or creating the zigzag pattern of waves.

,,, Work slowly and deliberately.

, Rake whenever you are in need of a calming effect on the mind.

"
Mentally divide the body into its component parts.,
Start to mentally note individual parts of the body in more detail.,
Now spend a moment being aware of each part in turn.",How to Practice Body Mindfulness Meditation2," Start generally with arms, legs, torso and head. As you mentally note the location of each component, start to divide it up further to become more aware of smaller details. For example, the arm may become shoulder, upper arm, elbow, lower arm, wrist, palm, fingers, etc.


Spend a minute being both aware of each part, but also how they feel, such as tense or relaxed, hot or cold and so on. The purpose is to be aware of not only where they are, but what they are, how they feel and so on, building to a complete body awareness.

, There is a typical repetition worth learning, that runs along the lines of:
1. Head hair, body hair, teeth, skin, nails.
2. Muscles, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys.
3. Heart, liver, stomach, spleen, lungs.
4. Bowel, intestines, feces, undigested food, brain.
5. Bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, body fat.
6. Tears, skin grease, snot, saliva, bone lubricant and urine.


The traditional order of this list seems unusual but the list divides the body components into two classes - solid matter and liquid matter. It starts with some of the most easily recognizable external parts (head, hair, skin, etc.), then moves on to more internal parts increasing in complexity as you go.
What you are doing more or less, is a kind of mental CT scan of your body. If you have seen scans before, you see bones, muscles, organs, etc. This is what you are looking for in situ and in action. It may or may not appear visually to you like a CT scan, but you may feel a sensation, or another form of awareness of that body part.

, There is a host of things recommended as a point of study so you may choose any that feel relevant to you at the beginning and then work on to the more complex aspects. Give each part some time to be studied to gain an understanding, familiarity and insight while at the same time, direct a calm and relaxed focus towards its nature.


1. Examine its location in the body, how it feels, what it is, how it is, how it came to be, what it needs to continue to be, etc.
2. Examine your experiences of how your mind interacts with the body component, such as how the heart changes when there is tension in the mind and how the muscles react when there is discomfort.
3. Examine your experiences of how the body interacts with mental states. When there is tension, unease, fear, how does the body feel? When there is gradual relaxation in the mind, is there gradual relaxation in the body? There are many other questions you may ask in this theme.
4. Is there attachment or any wishes that occur to you in relation to that part of the body? The more sensitive practitioner may find the meditation somewhat unnerving and feel squeamish, or maybe even think it's gross and weird. This method can be used to break down any such squeamishness and other barriers, allowing for a tolerance and acceptance to be built on increased understanding of and familiarity with the body.
5. Consider how fragile the ecosystem of your body is. One example is to examine how the blood needs pumping to oxygenate it, prevent it from clotting and becoming fatal. The blood being pumped helps the immune and healing system and since it helps regulate body temperature, we feel cold or hot when the circulation is not free.
6. Consider how co-dependent it is on other aspects of the body and external facts such as food and water, air, temperature and so on. Consider how enduring each part is, or how much it changes.
7. Consider how many of the bodily processes and parts run and are maintained on their own, independent of us or on autopilot, if you will. The identity has no involvement in running the liver for example, it just works away, even when we are deeply asleep.
If you wish, you can spend the entire meditation on just one part, or one group. However, if you wish to do the entire body, move on to the next group: Muscles, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys. Again, be aware of each part as above.

"
"
Examine the body again and relax any parts that you can should you be aware that they are tense, or in an uncomfortable position.,
Let go of any distractions that may arise and keep examining and studying the part your body, or continue through the list.,
To develop this meditation further for deeper concentration, start to drop away the repetition of words to develop wordless awareness.",How to Practice Body Mindfulness Meditation3,"


This meditation essentially works to break down denial, fear and ""squeamishness"", while building familiarity with, as well as awareness and understanding of, the body you feed to keep alive. By examining its conditional nature, as well as its fragility and unavoidable exposure to chances of injury, illness, pain and organ failure, and the inevitability of aging, you can learn to accept the body as it is. By becoming disenchanted but at the same time compassionate and at peace with the body, it's not a shock or distressing should it get injured, grow old, feel hungry or become ill. By using the body as a means of study, you can learn to live with the body and its warning signs. You will no longer feel unnerved about it generally.
Many people have found this meditation very helpful for directed relaxation, pain management, increased immune responsiveness and, in more rare cases, to see which parts of the body are injured or out of alignment. You can also focus a compassionate, healing energy onto various parts, or simply allow the part of the body in question some space to relax and repair itself to aid recovery in some cases - instead of fighting it, worrying about it and causing other stress related problems. This is more advanced for people who have practiced for a long time, but it's a very useful tool to develop for those who wish to go further on this subject-method.

, This is another place where mindfulness and concentration comes in and is excellent to develop the mind to focus.

, Fix your awareness on the component part of the body that is most evident to you.
Should a particular part simply become visible, or more noticeable by feeling or some image, focus and develop that awareness, letting it become the sole object of your focus and awareness. Examine it more simply, but in whole, so if a color arises, it is recommended to not pay too much attention on the color but instead to focus on what part of the body the color refers to.
Mastering this does take time and indeed it can take many years before it becomes a powerfully insightful tool. Beginners should not be concerned if nothing happens at all in regards to increased awareness. For some, it might just appear on focus, for others they might need to look at some strands of head hair collected from a brush and put in the hand. You examine those (as per Kasina meditation) until an image arises. For some it will never happen, as this is not the right type of meditation for them.
Regularly measure against your own experiences how or where this meditation has bought you any benefit. It might have been an increase in general concentration, or a deeper understanding of the body to allow you to live more happily and healthy.


The analogy of the Lotus applies here too. The lotus grows in mud and dirty water but rises above it to stand free. Mentally, we can rise above the aspects of the body that we would otherwise find disgusting, stressful or frightening and so stand free from shock or fear.

Clear the desks.,

Po, a zen master once said ""All noises are the noises of the Buddha"".,
Remove electromagnetic disturbances.,
Leave worries at the bedroom door.,
Come to your Zen bedroom relaxed.,
Take Zen practices into the Zen bedroom.,
Keep the room cool.,
Adopt a Zen sleeping position.",How to Create a Zen Bedroom," Your bedside table should not be as a dumping ground for knick-knacks and growing piles of ""stuff"". Nor should it ever serve as an extension of your office. Put away the files, telephone, diary, highlighters, kids' toys and medications. Keep only the things that are essential for sleep and resting: a book, moisturizer, a photo, a glass of water. The fewer things next to your bed, the fewer distractions and the more disposed to sleeping you will be.;
, Your bedroom should be a haven. This may be hard if the neighbours hubbub can be heard through the wall. It's a bit too expensive in most cases to consider soundproofing the room but you can muffle any sounds coming from other rooms by putting up shelves and lining them with books. The books will absorb some of the noise. Although, Su T'ung

, Try to think of this when hearing that barking dog on the street.

, The radio alarm clock, TV, mobile phone, computer etc. - all these appliances emit electromagnetic pollution even when in stand-by mode or turned off. This can disturb sleep and block the production of melatonin. Not to mention the annoyance of blinking or glowing lights emitting from some appliances that disturb sleep. Best to move all such appliances to another room. And get a wind-up alarm clock!

, Don't bring your day's concerns into the bedroom. Instead, write a list of the things that need doing or are bothering you in order of priority that you will deal with tomorrow. This list will help you to clarify ideas and give you a sense of mastering the situation, thereby avoiding useless stress at the time you want to be falling asleep.

, This requires unwinding beforehand. Have a sea salt bath. Throw in several handfuls of sea salt into a bath of 36º C (97ºF) temperature. Not only is this assured relaxation as the warm water encourages physical relaxing but the sea salt penetrates your skin barrier to stimulate the circulatory system and unwind those tired muscles. You will feel good and sleepy after a sea salt bath.

, Meditation is permitted in a Zen bedroom. As is massage and no better than a sleep-inducing massage. According to traditional Chinese medicine, a 5 - 10 minute massage of the hollow found just behind your earlobe will stimulate your eyelids to close. Try it!

, In summer, toss the covers and spritz your body with water before pulling over the sheet. Even in winter, a cooler room temperature is better for good sleep than overly warm.

, Lying on your side is the best for aiding good sleep and digestion. Lying on your back tends to encourage snoring and sore necks, whilst lying on your tummy can inhibit breathing and place pressure on your stomach region, preventing easy digestion.

When you are finished with your meditation session, simply come out of sitting posture.",How to Do Zazen," Zazen can be done at any time, although it is particularly helpful first thing in the morning or before going to bed. Find as quiet as a room as possible, and set aside at least 20 minutes of time for practice. Turn off all your cell phones, pagers, televisions, iPods and computers so as not to be disturbed. Let others in the house know that you need some time to be by yourself.;
, If you are using a cushion, rest your buttocks on the cushion and cross your legs out in front of you. You can sit cross-legged or in either full-lotus or half-lotus position. The cushion should help tilt your pelvis slightly forward and down so that your lumbar vertebrae can come to their natural curvature. You may find it helpful to sway gently back-and-forth and from side-to-side to find a centered position. You should feel balanced on your ""sit bones.""

, It is best to spread your legs out as much as is comfortable to achieve a sense of stability.

, Your posture should be balanced to allow your breath to flow freely deep down to the diaphragm.

, Your eyes should be open, but with a relaxed gaze so that you are looking forward and down. Rest your hands on your lap. You can rest either your left hand in your right, or right hand in your left. Both are acceptable. Touch your thumbs together above your fingers. This is called the “universal mudra.” Your hands should be relaxed, but stable and not too limpid.

, Just allow the breathing to occur, without trying to change it. Stay with the sensation of breathing as a particular point: perhaps your abdomen as it moves in and out, or your nostrils as the air passes back and forth. While in the West we tend to think of initiating the breath by inhaling, the Japanese word for breathing is KoKyu, a composite of two words: ko (exhalation) and kyu (inhalation). It may help to think of breathing in this way to help let go each moment.

, Ask yourself gently: “What is this? What am I experiencing right now?”

, Notice the difference sensory experiences of anxiety or anger or sadness as different muscles tense or relax. Again ask: “What is this? What is happening to me right now?” Follow the flow of emotions as your breath. Notice that your emotions are only a small part of your experience.

, Notice how each thought comes with its own set of reactions as well. You may find yourself reacting to one thought with another, or even criticizing yourself for thinking certain thoughts. Follow the flow of thoughts as you breath. Notice that your thoughts are only a small part of your experience.

, Do not judge it or try to change or escape from it. Much of time, we are out of touch with reality. We tense up when a disturbing thought arises or we dissociate and distract ourselves when an unpleasant emotion emerges. Instead, just sit with your experience as it comes and as it changes from moment to moment.

, The clarity and presence you gain from meditation will follow you as you go about your day.

Clean your body internally.,
Clear away the dust from the mind.,
Understand what meditation is.,
Re-read the above mentioned step once more.,
Start doing meditation while fixing just two minutes for it in the beginning.,
Delve into self realization.,
What does self realization leads to.",How to Become Spiritually Aware," A healthy mind exists in a healthy body. And for spiritual well being, a calm mind is what forms the basis. Therefore the first step is to eliminate internal diseases and work to achieve a healthy and fit body. Do activities that make you walk, run, jump, and play games. Do Yoga, opt balanced diet. Do not get into the trap of satisfying the taste of your tongue. The taste remains only for a few seconds but health is going to stay all your life.;
, The seed of spirituality sprouts in a mind that is well sown with good thoughts and beliefs. For that


Read good books that inspire you and follow the authors whose thoughts make you believe in the idea of optimism.
Go to places where your mind feels relaxed and calm.
Talk to such people who do not judge circumstances and people. The idea behind spirituality is adopting a non-judgemental nature; the concept of Truth. And that comes with acceptance.

, It has not been mentioned to practice meditation straight away, because there are a lot of misconceptions regarding what meditation really is. Therefore, understand the basic idea behind the concept of meditation.


Meditation is being aware and conscious. It is about being present at the 'present' moment.
Meditation is all about the moments when your mind is at peace, calm, and no thoughts are disturbing your inner self.
for example, when you see rain, animals, sea, dark sky and stars, and you are just observing them without having any thoughts of past or future, that is also a form of meditation because you are present at those moments without being lost into thoughts
If you can feel, see what is happening at this very moment, you are in meditation; otherwise you are just in your mind. Coming out of mind is meditation.

, It is important because there is a high possibility that you may not have understood each point regarding meditation. Until and unless you completely understand what meditation is, drawing instances from your life do not go to the next step.

, Do not take the plunge into doing meditation for the sake of doing it. Do it because you want to. If it is a forceful meditation, such as you may decide to do it for an hour in a day even if your mind cannot keep calm even for 10 minutes, then do NOT do meditation for that amount of time. It has to be effortless.


You need to close contact to the outside world that you receive through various senses, that is why it is recommended to close eyes while meditating.
Start observing your thoughts. Do not try to suppress them. That is what I meant by becoming aware of your thoughts. And when you know what it is going on in your mind, calmly let it subside and go away.
The most popular way of meditating is concentrating on your breath. But if that seems difficult, because we are not used to doing that; then concentrate on something that you find easy. You can chant a mantra, that has no meaning and do not create any image on your mind screen.
Then automatically your concentration will move to your breaths. Start observing it, feeling it. Soon it would be like as if you can actually feel your breath touching various parts of your inner body.

, The journey of self realization comprises of knowing various truths. To be precise, it is to become AWARE of all those universal truths that were always there, and also that ONE TRUTH which unites all beings. A simple way to do it is:


In your meditation state, when you begin with analyzing your body. You come to know that what you term as ‘I’ is not your body.
You go further, and may wonder if it is your mind that is ‘YOU’. But if it had been the mind, you would not have been able to observe it, so ‘YOUR MIND’ cannot be ‘YOU’.
Then maybe it is your subconscious mind that is ‘YOU’ but subconscious is that which you are not conscious of, and this can be changed with changing habits and behaviour patterns.
At the last stage, you come to the realization of your real self that is ‘YOU’.
While coming back to your worldly state, you will find the ‘YOU’ in everything that you denied for in the beginning.

, This should make you realize that whether something good is happening or something bad has happened, you are just observing it from outside even when such events occur with you. At that stage, such incidents would not affect you because you have got the realization of the TRUTH.

Take classes.",How to Begin Zen Meditation (Zazen)," It's important to meditate in a relaxing place that's free of distractions. Find a place in your home where it's relatively quiet and take steps to create a relaxing environment. This largely depends on personal preference. Some people like to make an altar using objects like seashells, stones, or flowers. Other people enjoy lighting candles. Gather objects that you find soothing to create the right space to meditate.Your space will grow naturally with time, so do not worry if it's not perfect right away. You will figure out what does and does not work for you as you begin meditating regularly.;
, The literal translation for zazen is ""seated meditation"". How you sit is very important. What matters most is that you stay comfortable and keep your back straight. If you need to do something like cross your legs, or use pillows to prop up your back, do so.If you are very flexible, try the half Lotus Position (Hankafuza) or the Full Lotus Position (Kekkafuza). The Half Lotus is done by placing the left foot onto the right thigh and tucking the right leg under your left thigh. The Full Lotus is done by placing each foot onto the opposite thigh. If either positions are painful, however, avoid using them as they can be distracting.

, The positioning of your head is important for Zen meditation, as it's vital you do not do anything to strain your body. Hold your head in a position that feels natural and does not cause strain in your neck. Ideally, your spine should align with your neck. Imagine a straight line running up your spine. Move your neck so this imaginary line continues across your neck.Tucking in your chin helps align your spine and neck.

, Before you begin meditating, pause and be aware of any tensions you're feeling in your jaw and facial muscles. You may not notice the tension in your jaw until you pay attention to it specifically. Try to loosen your jaw and the muscles in your face in general before you begin meditating.If your jaw feels very tense, use your fingers to lightly massage your face to loosen up the muscles.

, With Zen meditation, much of the focus is on the breath. It's important to breath through your nose. Nasal breaths create a cooling and warming sensation as you breathe in and out. This can make it easy to follow the rhythm of your breathing as you meditate., As you begin meditating, notice your breath as much as possible. Pay attention to the natural in and out rhythm, the sound of your breathing, and the warm and cold sensations provided by air passing through your lungs. Strive to be as aware as possible of your breathing for the duration of your meditation sessions.This may sound simple enough, but it's very difficult to quiet the mind. Do not be discouraged if you struggle to focus on your breath at first. Meditation, like anything else, takes practice.

, You can keep your eyes open, or half closed, or you can shut them completely. Some people find it helpful to focus their eyes on a single point in the room. Others prefer their eyes to be shut. This is a matter of personal preference. Decide what to do with your eyes based on what feels most natural and soothing for you.This will take some trial and error. Change what you're doing with your eyes if you become distracted or uncomfortable. For example, if your eyes start to water when you're focusing on a single point in the room, close your eyes. See if this helps you better concentrate on your breath.

, It's natural for your mind to wander when you're sitting in silence. When you first start meditating, you will find yourself thinking about other things. You'll start thinking about errands you need to run or things that occurred earlier in the day. When you feel this happening, gently redirect your thinking to your breathing. Tune in to the natural ebb and flow of your breaths and the sensations they create.It can help to count your breaths to regain focus.

, Zen meditation takes some effort. If you try to meditate for too long too soon, you may find yourself unable to focus on your breathing. Start off with only two minutes of meditation at time. As you feel more comfortable meditating, you can increase that number., A zafu pillow is a pillow specifically designed for Zen meditation. If you find Zen meditation is helpful for you, you can purchase a zafu pillow online. This can help you easily get into the right position each time you meditate., Beginners sometimes worry they're bad at meditation. You may find it difficult to clear your mind and focus on your breathing. Do not get frustrated and beat yourself up. It's very normal for meditation to be somewhat difficult at first. Cut yourself some slack and keep practicing. Eventually, meditating will become easier.Keep in mind, even people who meditate regularly never completely clear their minds. It's normal to have to stop and redirect your thinking to your breathing once in awhile. Do not feel like getting distracted means you're meditating incorrectly.

, Start off with small sessions and build up. After you're comfortable meditating in short spurts, start adding on a few more minutes each week. Eventually, you'll be able to meditate for longer periods.There is no one size fits all rule for meditation. You may find very long meditation sessions, such as 25 minute sessions, help you relax. However, you may also find brief five to 10 minute sessions are sufficient. Experiment with different time frames until you find something you're comfortable with.

, It can be helpful to meditate with the assistance of an instructor. Check online to see if you can find Zen meditation classes in your area. This can help you improve your meditation technique so Zen meditation is more effective for you.


If you can't find a class in your area, look for guided routines online.

Take your time.,
Sync in with the flow of traffic.,
Turn off the radio, turn on your favorite music.,
Breathe deeply.,
Loosen up.,
Instead of squandering your consciousness on greater speed, observe your surroundings.,
Be thankful.,
Respond to road rage with compassion.,
Practice kindness.,
Try hypermiling.",How to Practice Zen Driving," Do not be in a rush. Be Laid Back. If you need to be somewhere on time, leave early so you have more than enough time to get there. Even if you're running late, don't worry about it. There's really not much you can do about it now, because the traffic, the stop lights, the laws of the road are still there. So relax. Drive as if you have all the time in the world. If you are late, at least you will have had a lovely ride.;
, Traffic moves like a school of fish. The more you try to get ahead and ""beat others,"" the more obvious you are to the cops (who act like the sharks) and the more likely to stir up other drivers' territorial behaviors - danger! Being in sync with the flow doesn't mean you have to be defensive - you can pass and move as needed, controlling your space with awareness and harmony. One thing is for sure, when you sync up, you seem to get there quicker, feel at ease, enjoy your music, and you never get a ticket. Enjoy the journey as much as you do the destination and ""be like water, my friend.""

, Why do you listen to talk shows? Probably because it helps distract you from what you're doing, and makes the drive more tolerable. But what's so terrible about what you're doing, that you have to pay attention to something else?Instead, try listening to the sounds of your car. The engine, the way the tires sound on the road. (This might even make you better at detecting problems with your car before they become expensive to fix.) Listen to your breathing, your heartbeat. This is an excellent time to learn to enjoy silence, since in our noisy world it can be hard to find.

, Feel your belly rise and fall (against the seat belt, of course) with every breath. Count each inhalation and each exhalation, until you get to ten. Start back at one again. This is at the core of Zazen (Zen meditation) and will help keep you calm.

, Look at your hands on the steering wheel. Are you clenching them? Let go of excess tension. You only need just enough grip to control the wheel, no more, no less. Then direct your attention to your stomach. Is it tense? Soften your belly, then soften your shoulders and consciously let go of tension anywhere else in your body.

, You will simultaneously be more aware of the beauty around you and more alert to hazards than you would be if you were pushing for speed and/or lost in thought. Pay attention to the cars around you. How are they driving? Is the person in front of you slowing down a little? Is the person behind you in a rush? Does the person on your left seem confused, or lost?

, Have you noticed, today, that you're in this incredible machine that was specifically designed to make your trip easy? All you have to do is turn a key, hold a wheel, and press your foot. Have you noticed that, right now, your car is actually working, not breaking down? Do you appreciate that not everyone has a car to drive, or do you take your car for granted, as if it's a right? Are you glad that you can drive on paved, safe roads? More importantly, are you grateful that at this moment, you're alive, and healthy enough to drive?

, They're in a rush. They're frantic. You've been there. You know what it's like. You know it feels like the end of the world, even though it's not. You can either increase their suffering, or relieve it. And the best way to relieve it is to get out of their way, as safely and as soon as possible. Forgive them. And don't let them infect you with their negativity; why let a stranger ruin your ride?


If someone is tailgating you, move out of the left lane if you're going slower than the traffic in front, then ignore them. Sometimes they are truly in a hurry, and they have nothing against you. Sometimes they sincerely believe that you deserve their wrath. If you respond to them, they will escalate their aggression and you will be in the middle of a stressful conflict. Just ignore them; imagine that your mirrors are set so that you cannot see them at all. They can always go around you. If a tailgater persists, lowering your speed three miles below the speed limit is usually enough to send them on their stressful way in a hurry.

, Smile and even wave at other drivers. Let people merge in front of you. If someone is parking, stop and give them room. In general, think of what others could do to make your drive more pleasant, and do those things for them!

, It is an excellent opportunity to practice Zen driving as it is not only gentler on your car, the environment, and your wallet, but it also requires great awareness and patience.

Take it day by day.",How to Become a Good Muslim Girl," Allah is inclined to forgive all sins for He is All-Understanding and All-Forgiving. Even if you feel that you are already too deep to become the good Muslim that you truly can be, He will help.;
, Maybe you can trace back the cause to either family situations or friends that are leading you on the wrong path. Leave the friends. They will not be there on the Day of Judgement when you have to face Allah on your own. If it is because of family, it is a little more difficult. This is where the next steps will come in handy.
, You need to let go of past mistakes and work on improving the future. Whatever has happened is done. It is in the past and there is nothing you can do to change it or better it. The only thing you can do is sincerely repent to Allah (SWT) and ask Him for forgiveness and leniency in punishment. Use those negative experiences as motivation to get better and do good.

, This is not to say that you should run every time a guy comes near, but learn to lower the gaze and interact with unrelated men in a way that is formal and business-like. Remember that Muslim women in the past also interacted with men in their society as business women, teachers, and scholars, and they were all well respected and admired; they did not have to flaunt their beauty to gain this respect or to feel confident or even to contribute to their societies. Remember that Allah (SWT) is severe in punishment, but also the most forgiving and the most merciful. They are not people that you need in your life anyway.

, If you are truly devoted to turning over a new leaf and becoming the best Muslim girl that you can be, wear the hijab. The hijab is not just a piece of cloth that covers hair, it covers and protects your whole self, including your mannerisms, speech, your gaze, and your heart. It changes you mentally and spiritually. Think of it as a way for Allah azza wajjal to protect the women. As soon as you wear the hijab, your whole perspective on self-respect and values will automatically change. In fact, women are not allowed to pray without the hijab since the hadith of the prophet Muhammad sallalahu alaihi wasalam reads ""the prayer of a woman will not be accepted without the headcover"". Hijab is mandatory, as explained in the Quran 33:59-60 women should cover to be recognized as part of the Muslim group, while in 24:30-31 women are told to pull down their head covers and make them long enough to cover their breasts with a ""khumur"" which means ""something which covers the head"". The word is from the same root word for alcohol, since it is a substance when consumed covers and clouds the head and the mind.

, This means that you have to cover your whole body. You have to wear loose clothes. Hijab is not supposed to be fashionable. Rather, it is a command from Allah (SWT). Avoid clothes that are too tight such as skinny jeans. Remember that it is obligatory to cover the whole body except the face and hands, which are highly recommended, although some scholars held the view that it is obligatory especially in the Hanbali school of thought. If you truly believe according to the evidence it is obligatory, then go ahead and make an effort to cover your face with the niqaab and your hands with gloves as no harm can come from it. This also helps you to change your whole outlook on what is acceptable and what is not.

, Before you get on the prayer rug, learn what the prayer words mean to enhance your contemplation within prayer. If you do not speak Arabic, try to find some translated versions of the prayer words and take some time to read and understand what the words mean. Start making prayer a normal part of your day, the way eating is a need of ours, our spiritual food is prayers.

, Read the Quran and also try to read the translation of the Quran and truly try to understand its meaning. You can read the translation in English or your language as well. Reading the Quran will help you establish a useful relationship with Allah and will also allow you to understand how beautiful the religion is. Listening to it (you can find videos online) also makes you feel closer to Allah.

, Know what you have to do (which is called 'wajib' things) and what you can't do (haraam things). The Internet is a valuable source to search for Islamic rules and regulations and the punishments that apply if they are broken. Make sure to go on correct websites for authentic sources of information. Islamic punishments may sometimes seem severe, but Muslims consider the Shariah to be a gift from Allah (SWT) that protects society and guides the believers to follow His way.

, Dhikr of Allah is one of the most excellent act to praise Allah. Dhikr has been stressed over a hundred times in the Holy Qur'an. Allah says in His Holy book : ""O believers, make abundant mention of Allah!"" (33:41) The Prophet said, ""If your hearts were always in the state that they are in during dhikr, the angels would come to see you to the point that they would greet you in the middle of the road."" Dhikr is, therefore, something of tremendous importance.

, For example, four hours for salah, Quran and Islamic studies will enable you to build up your relationship with Allah (SWT) and make good progress towards acquiring the necessary knowledge to become a good Muslimah. Remember that the five daily fardh salah are your top priority and you should form your daily routine around these. Allow time for self-reflection, especially to think about your sins and to pray to Allah for forgiveness.

, You should want to make friends who share your mission of being a good Muslim and influence you to do better, or friends who accept your religion. Try to make friends with other Muslims to encourage you to practice Islam.


Avoid friends that bring out bad influences, or friends that harm or hurt your feelings even being told to stop.

, Realize that there are many excellent female Islamic lecturers who are passionate about spreading the peaceful message of Islam. Try to listen to their lectures and make it your mission too to tell other women about how Islam can help them bring meaning and order to their lives.

, Marrying is considered Sunnah in Islam. If you do consider marrying, try to search for a person who is loyal and treats you fairly.

, Attending Muslim groups or group circles is a great way to learn more about Islam and is a way to socialize with other Muslims. Many Muslim groups are most likely provided at your local mosque., If you make it a priority in your mind that you want to strive to be the best Muslim girl possible, you will achieve this goal without even realizing it! Every time you are about to do something, think: ""Is this something good or religious?"" If it isn't, don't do it! Simply remind yourself and be ready to stop yourself, just in case. Every single moment of every day must be devoted to pleasing Allah (SWT).

, Timing when casting spells can be important. The Moon is important in witchcraft, and therefore has a profound influence upon us. It is very important to choose the right moon phase for your spell; magical workings for gain, increase or bringing things to you, should be initiated when the moon is waxing (from new to full); when the moon is waning (from full to dark), then its time for magical workings of decrease or sending away. The highest energy occurs at the full moon, and therefore this is the most powerful time for magical workings. The new moon is the next most powerful time for magic.

, There is a natural time for starting things (a planting time), for maturing things (a growing time), for reaping things (a harvest time) and, of course, a time for rest and planning.

, Make sure that you have all the tools that you need for casting the spell. Your tools must have no inherent magic. They are to help you create a mood. You also have to clean your tools. Don't forget to cleanse and bless (consecrate) your tools before you begin casting your spell.

, Remember that magic is the manipulation of energy, a thought is a form of energy and a visualization is an even stronger form of energy. Your visualization can be a method used to intensify further and direct your will. Your visualization can be the method by which you control the magical energy you have produced. You must know what you want. You must see it. You must feel the high energy flow. You must direct it.

, For making your words and thoughts stronger you can write your spell into a rhyme to be spoken aloud; this makes it easier to remember your spell, you can also chant your spell to raise energy.

, Read over your spell, and be sure that if abides by your personal ethics and morals. For instance, if you are Wiccan, it is important to remember and abide by the Three Fold Law.

Talk to a spiritual healer.",How to Remove Black Magic Spells," Examine your reasons for thinking you might have been cursed. Is there someone out there who wishes you ill? Why? It's unusual to be cursed by someone you don't know, so chances are if you're cursed, it's because someone you know has a problem with you. Here are the most common types of curses and hexes someone may have cast upon you:


Love hex, making you fall in love when you don't naturally want to.
Revenge spell
Bad luck hex
Anger boils curse;
, If you've had a run of terrible luck, it might mean that someone cast a bad luck spell upon you. If mishap after mishap occurs out of the blue, and something just seems off, it's possible you need to take steps to remove the spell. Here are a few examples of circumstances that can occur if such a spell has been cast:


You fall ill for no apparent reason (and it's definitely not just the common cold)
You get bad scores on a test, even though you studied hard and were sure you'd ace it
You have a bad acne outbreak right before going on a hot date, even though you haven't had a pimple in weeks
You trip and fall right as you were about to score the winning point during a basketball game
The car you're driving in breaks down, causing you to miss out on the biggest party of the year
You find out your family is moving to a new city with no warning at all

, No matter how bad things seem, chances are your luck has nothing to do with being cursed. Even if you have a few enemies, it's very rare that someone actually possesses the power to cause you harm from afar. Think through what's been happening and see if there's another reason why your life isn't going the way you want to. If you can't find any reason, and you're pretty sure someone has it in for you, then move on to techniques you can use to get rid of the spell.


For example, if your boyfriend breaks up with you for someone else, it might not be because the other girl cast a bad luck spell on you; it could just be that he was ready to move on.
Or if you come down with a case of hives, it could be you're allergic to shellfish or nuts. You should check into that.
However, if you're quite convinced that you have an enemy who wishes you harm, you should definitely take steps to break the curse, just in case it's real.

, An amulet is an object you always keep with you to protect yourself from bad energy, hexes and curses. Keeping an amulet with you can weaken the effect of a curse or hex so that it can no longer harm you.


An amulet can be any object that has powerful meaning and is sacred to you. A special piece of jewelry, a shell from your favorite beach, or even a length of ribbon you wore in your hair as a child can all be an amulet.
Wear the amulet around your neck or keep it in your pocket at all times.

, A ritual bath has the power to cleanse away bad energy that's harming you. If you feel you've been cursed, light some candles and draw a warm bath. Try to think only positive thoughts as you have a nice, long soak. Sprinkle one or more of following into the bath to increase its cleansing power:


A pinch of salt
Hyssop
Basil
Mugwort
patchouli
Vetiver
Wormwood

, The same magic herbs can be burned to have and ""uncrossing"" effect, which means they break the curse or hex. It's not necessary to use every single herb on the list, but take as many as you can and bundle them up. Tie the bundle with a piece of string, then light it on fire (preferably outside or on a safe surface). By the time the bundle has burned away, the curse will be broken.


Since mugwort, wormwood and vetiver are said to be particularly powerful when it comes to warding off bad spirits and breaking curses, you might want to carry some around with you. Fill up a small cloth sack with the herbs and tie it around your waist or put it in your pocket.

, Black magic takes its power from negative energy, and its opposite, positive energy, has the power to weaken it. In this case, laughter really is the best medicine, because you can use it quite effectively against any type of curse. You don't need a ritual or a spell: just your own well of positive energy.


When you feel the effects of the curse around you, think of something funny and laugh. Focus entirely on a funny video or book and let yourself fully enjoy how it makes you feel.
When you're confronted by the person you suspect cast a spell upon you, smile and be friendly. Crack a joke or two and try to laugh together. Even if the person doesn't find it funny, his or her power will be weakened by the strength of your positive energy.

, This is a positive, white magic spell that spiritually helps the person's energy turn from negative to positive, so he or she can no longer harm you with curses and hexes. A binding spell will not harm its subject; it just prevents the person from hurting you further. Inscribe a candle with the person's name. As it burns down, repeat these words:



I bring you forth from the dark and hold you to the light. Let not your past control my present. Let not my future be as dark as night. I meet and greet you with open arms, and move you back into the light. So mote it be., If you are convinced that a serious spell has been cast upon you, it may be time to talk to a spiritual healer who can help to remove it using a series of rituals. Talk to someone who understands what you're going through and knows the proper way to remove the curse so your life starts looking up again.


If you are religious, you may want to talk with your religious leader for guidance.
Talking to a psychic may help, but be careful to find someone who's authentic and well-versed in the ways of magic.
It might also help to talk with a therapist who is open to healing through meditation, hypnosis and other techniques that can bring more positive energy into your life.

, Apply Occam's Razorto your spell or ritual plan . Make sure that everything you do serves some kind of purpose, so that you aren't distracted. Make sure the steps are specific so that you don't miss something.

, Some ritual workings use objects with ritual value as a focus of the mind or a symbol of greater forces at work, while other magic requires only the concentration of your willpower (though this might be harder). If you need objects, be sure to gather them beforehand.


Common ritual objects include: candles, swords, wands, cups, discs, pendants, cards, and special robes.

, Go through the steps you outlined meticulously and confidently, then wait for results. Do not be frustrated if nothing happens immediately; even simple spells can take days for the inexperienced, and happen in unexpected ways.

Make cooking and cleaning a form of meditation.,
Only live with what is necessary.",How to Become Zen1," Being Zen involves living in the moment and putting proper focus on our everyday routine. Avoid multitasking when possible.


For example, when you are pouring water, just focus on pouring water. When you are eating, focus on your meal and experience your food.
Take time to focus on the task at hand no matter how big or small. This means not looking at your phone while at the dinner table, or trying to multitask during your day. If you are answering an email. Focus only on answering the email before checking your favorite website.
Put your focus into the task at hand to perform it deliberately, and take your time. Try not to move on to the next task until you complete your current one.;
, Try to do less with your day. This doesn’t mean being lazy but instead refers to not filling your day with an unending list of tasks.


Try to minimize the tasks and chores you need to accomplish every day. While this isn't always easy if you are in school or have a busy job, tackling fewer things in a day helps you to keep a clear mind. Focus on the now, don't obsess on the future.
Additionally, try to leave free time in your schedule. Don’t schedule appointments or meetings too close together. This only causes you to rush from one thing to the next. A packed schedule often draws your focus elsewhere to what you will have to accomplish later. Rather than what you are accomplishing now.

, Try to do at least one thing a day that serves someone else.


Remember to smile and be kind to others. The act of smiling can actually improve your mood by releasing endorphins. Even if you’re a parent or serve someone most days, encourage yourself to notice your actions. Don’t just do it because you feel you have to. Try to actually enjoy the act of helping others.

, Cooking and cleaning often feel like another thing that needs to get done. But these tasks can actually be daily rituals which help you embrace a more Zen lifestyle.


Try to approach both cooking and cleaning as a form of meditation. Concentrate on what you are doing and the benefits of these tasks.
Instead of just throwing ingredients together, actually prepare your food and take the time to enjoy the process of making a meal.
Likewise, focus on how cleaning is literally a way to cleanse both you and your home. A clean room can alter your mood and help you relax. Using these parts of your day as a form of meditation will help you to find meaning in ordinary tasks. , Living simply doesn’t mean that you have to go and throw out all of your material possessions. But it does mean getting rid of what’s not necessary.


Take stock of what you own and ask yourself if you need all of it. Do you need all those pairs of shoes, the tablets and TVs, and other gadgets?
You may find that if you get rid of some of the extra things which are making it easier for you to multitask and not be present, you can experience more joy from the moment.
What’s essential for each of us varies from person to person. Take note of what you use and do every day, and what is just sitting around or getting in the way.

Think before you react.,
Make negative situations and feelings positive.,
Understand your anger.,
Know when it’s time to remove yourself.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Become Zen2," We often let ourselves react without thinking in stressful situations when someone annoys or angers us. If you want to be more Zen, next time you are in a situation where you are upset, take a moment to breathe.


Oftentimes the first thing out of our mouths is not the best. Therefore, when trying to be more Zen, mull over what you want to say before you say it.

, Try to put a positive spin on everything, even when it seems like that’s not an option.


If you reflect hard enough, you can usually find a way to turn a bad situation or feeling into a good one.
Maybe you hate getting up to go to work. This could mean that you need to discover a new path in your life. Perhaps it’s time to start looking for a new job. Take positive action by setting a time and day to update your resume and start networking.
Don’t ignore your negative thoughts or emotions. Accept that you have these feelings and take a moment to think about how you can counteract these bad feelings or thoughts with good ones. If you feel beaten or rejected by something in your life, try to figure out what that is. Then reroute your thinking from “I’m not good enough,” to “This is an opportunity to explore something new.”

, Becoming Zen isn’t just about staying present and being happy. It’s about understanding how our body and mind works, especially together. And using that knowledge to accept who we are, all our faults included. Sit comfortably for a while with your eyes closed and try to picture your anger as if it were tangible.


What colors or images do you see? Notice anything that might come up which makes you angry. Your subconscious mind could be giving you clues as to what triggers your anger.
Notice where your body tenses up and where you feel anger. Some people feel a pit in the stomach; others feel a burning in the chest.
Breathe slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Jot down all of your angry thoughts and triggers. Write down where you felt your anger. Then, read what you wrote. Begin to form actionable steps on how to turn this anger into positive fuel and energy.
It will take a while to tackle all of your inner demons. And that’s ok because it’s natural.

, If you know that you are likely to speak without thinking or begin to feel that anger, fear, frustration, or any other negative emotion build up, it may be time to leave.


Inaction in certain settings is the path to being Zen. By not acting negatively in a certain moment and leaving, you are choosing to act positively in another moment.
Politely excuse yourself. Go for a walk outside and take a few minutes to breathe and find something to be grateful for.

, Negative moods, anxiety, depression, and a short temper are major side-effects of not getting enough sleep.


Decide to go to bed earlier on weeknights.
Unplug. Sleeping with the tv on or using your phone before bed affects how well you can fall asleep. The quality of your sleep after you dose off will also suffer. By keeping our eyes and brains stimulated from the blue light, noises, and pictures, we don’t give our brains the proper time to prepare for rest. "

Sit or kneel in a position that is comfortable to you.,
Practice your breathing.,
Pay attention to where your tension is.,
Relax your jaw.,
Don’t fight your thoughts.",How to Become Zen3," There are many positions which you can situate yourself for meditation. However, you will find the best results in one which is comfortable to you. The Burmese position has you sitting with your legs crossed and both your feet and knees on the floor.
The Lotus or Half Lotus positions has you seated with both feet placed on the opposite thigh, or just one in the Half Lotus.
Seiza posture positions your body so you are on your knees with your buttocks resting on your upturned feet.
Chair position has you simply upright in a chair.
For every position, place your hands folded together. One hand holds the other, palms up. Your thumbs are lightly touching. Rest your hands on either your feet or thighs depending on your position.
Keep your back straight and your head positioned over your heart. Picture a beam extending from the crown of your head into the sky.

, Feeling your breath is the main focus when meditating.


Breath in and out through your nose.
Take steady breaths and notice how your body moves as you breathe. Your diaphragm should extend out as you breathe in to allow for more air.
Breath through your whole body, taking the breath deep down and into your stomach and back.

, As you stay still and focus on your breath, you’ll start to notice which parts of your body carry more tension. It may be your back, neck, or shoulders.


During Zazen, Zen meditation, you will most likely experience tension. When you do, try to breathe into these areas and relax.
If you find that your shoulders are tense, notice how you are positioned. Are your shoulders scrunched up? Let your body loosen up as you continue to breathe.
If it helps, think of the tension blowing off of you with every breath.

, In Zazen, it’s typical practice to keep your mouth shut. However, oftentimes, this causes people to clench the jaw. Keeping your jaw and facial muscles relaxed is a great way to release a lot of tension.
Rub your jaw in circular motions before meditating to help loosen the muscles.
Clenching your jaw can often lead to headaches.
Put a slight smile on your face to keep your facial muscles loose.

, In Zazen, it’s common to keep your eyes open slightly and fixated on a certain point. This can sometimes cause you to become distracted. Try not to fight your thoughts.


If you wish, you can also close your eyes.
During meditation your mind will begin to wander. Let it. Try not to steer it in any way.
Focus on your breathing as much as possible. Sometimes it helps to count your breaths from 1 to 10, then starting back at 1. The counting will allow you to stay in the moment of your breathing and not wander.

Reduce your anxiety with an herbal tea.",How to Practice Witchcraft," The well-known neopaganist approach to witchcraft (“Wicca”) is hardly the only one. There are several different magical traditions that can all be considered “witchcraft,” which vary substantially between one another in purpose, origin, and worldview. However, because an article that covers all (or even some) of these traditions would become ludicrously complex very quickly, this guide only focuses on the modern Wiccan tradition of witchcraft.;
, Wicca is a modern religion, based on ideas about early west European paganism, that includes witchcraft as a core component. Wiccan witchcraft is by far the most popular and widely practiced form of witchcraft in the English-speaking world. Wiccans may belong to an organized group, such as a priesthood or coven, or they may operate independently or in loose coalitions.


Wiccan belief varies from practitioner to practitioner somewhat, but all share belief in some basic concepts: A five-element system (earth, air, fire, water, and spirit) of the world; a clear division between genders and gender roles throughout creation, most clearly embodied by dual deities, a Moon Goddess and a Horned God; and the use of ritual elements that reflect the four suits of a deck of tarot cards, namely the cup or grail, the wand, the knife and/or sword, and the pentacle.
Witchcraft is only one part of being a Wiccan. Much of the religion is concerned with the acceptance and embrasure of the natural world, its cycles, and the differences between individuals. Seasonal festivals, called Sabbats, and structured religious practice are major components of Wicca. You don't absolutely have to be Wiccan to practice Wiccan witchcraft, but the two are closely tied together.

, Depending on who you ask, becoming initiated into Wicca is either a matter of personal will, or a matter of ceremonialized induction into a formal group or “coven.” This reflects the young age of the religion, and the considerable range of disagreements about what, exactly, it means to be a “true” Wiccan. However, it also illustrates the extent to which nearly all Wiccans embrace the idea of personal power, responsibility, and freedom of choice. Choose what you believe will work best.

, Witchcraft is, essentially, the practice of magic. Because magic is a very personally oriented area of study, there are many competing views of it: how it works, where it comes from, what it means. Like any discipline, a novice in the field of magic should develop a grasp of the different general opinions and approaches to it.


Wiccans generally believe that the magic of witchcraft is the result of ritually imposing one's will upon the world by strengthening and projecting it through the appropriate mystical channels. This may include invoking the aid of powerful spirits, such as the God and Goddess or the Guardian Spirits of the four elements and directions; it also includes ritual processes to gather or cultivate power within the practitioner him- or herself. Understanding what various concepts and materials embody or represent is all-important to developing the most effective spell possible.
The related magical tradition of Aleister Crowley posits that magic, though it can put the practitioner in contact with otherworldly forces, is essentially an exercise in self-discipline and mental rigor. Deep concentration, focused meditation, and control of one's thoughts are all key components to generating the personal power required to cast useful spells.
Many psychologists see magic as a form of self-empowerment that is simply another framework for understanding the power of positive, proactive thought. The effects of magic are felt by the believer because the act of practicing magic primes him or her to see and seize opportunities he or she might otherwise have missed, thus creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts. Those who are able to focus strongly on their goals while maintaining a flexible approach to achieving them are most likely to reap the greatest benefits of magic, according to this model of understanding.
In many folk traditions of magic, the power of the spell isn't the power of the witch at all, except in its intent. The actual energy that makes the spell effective is coaxed from spirits, elemental forces, or other non-physical entities. The witch's job in this case is to draw in enough outside power for the spell to be effective, being sure to choose the right type of assistance for the job and avoid pulling too much outside force into the human realm.
Chaos magic is a recently formed and still-popular theory that posits that any system of magic, including others not listed here, can be effective, provided the practitioner believes in its power. According to chaos magic, practicing witchcraft in such a way that you can believe in it is more important than choosing the “right” or “true” path.

, Although not scientific in the usual sense of the word, practicing witchcraft nonetheless entails a lifelong dedication to, and passion for, knowledge and understanding. Many practitioners of witchcraft discover that they are more powerful in some areas than others, and become specialists over time, as they continue to learn and practice their craft. There are as many different areas of study available to the practicing witch as there are topics in witchcraft, but here are a few of the broader areas you might find yourself drawn to:



Wiccan ritual magic. The one type of magic regularly practiced by most Wiccans is highly ritualized religious magic, with special tools and geometric shapes (especially the pentacle) lending power and meaning to every step.

Ritual magic is highly flexible; a skilled witch in this area can empower nearly any spell by thoroughly understanding the symbolism of the elements of the ritual and using them to his or her advantage.
The constant contemplation of the relationship between humanity, nature, and the divine that is required to master ritual magic can also lead to peace of mind, clarity of thought, and exceptional strength of character.
Wiccan magic is often divided into sets of five types, since the number five is powerful to Wiccans. If you ask ten different Wiccan organizations what those five types are, you're likely to get ten different answers. This guide doesn't even come close to covering all of the possible answers, so ask your coven if you'd like to know the way they view it.



Plant, soil, and earth magic. The so-called “green witch” or “cottage witch” not only learns to draw poisons, cures, and other powerful substances from plants, he or she also develops a close understanding of their natural cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. These witches are versed in protective magic as well, drawing from the natural world to ward off ill fortune.

Studying this type of magic may lead to greater success in reading and understanding one's surroundings, coaxing plants to grow, and other powers that offer practical benefits to the witch's hearth and home.



Shamanic magic. Although not strictly connected to the Wiccan tradition, shamanism is widely practiced by witches, and in fact by people of various folk religions all over the world. The basic notion of shamanism is that everything natural which exists in our world has a spirit of its own, a belief which is also called animism. By learning to visit the spirit world or “astral plane,” a shaman can become adept at communicating with these spirits and invoking their aid in the waking world.

Seasoned shamans may develop a strong sense of spiritual guidance, an ability to “read” people and predict their actions, and powers of divination gained by building relationships with powerful spirit allies.
In witchcraft terms, shamans are sometimes referred to as “augurs” (prophets and spiritual guides) or “hedge witches” (travelers in the spirit world). Those who seek to communicate with mystical beings that don't have analogous representations in our world, such as fairies or elves, can also be considered shamans of a sort.



Other forms of witchcraft. Because witchcraft is often practiced subtly or in secret, there are many witches who don't easily fit into any of the above categories. All of these approaches require the same dedication of mind and spirit that any of the more broadly-defined approaches require. A thirst for knowledge and a need to understand the systems of the world is of the utmost importance to developing any kind of witchcraft. Some of the less commonly seen types of witch include:

Family witches, witches practicing a hereditary tradition that is kept secret within the family
“Eclectic” witches, who study extensively and become generalists rather than specialists
Solitary witches, who develop their own understanding of the craft and pursue knowledge in their own way, without relying on standard practices and rituals.



, Regardless of your opinion on how and why witchcraft works, or your interest in one field of magic over another, the simple fact remains that humankind bestows power and importance on things we venerate, uplift, and separate from the everyday. This means that the more you treat your witchcraft as something powerful and special, the more of an effect it will have in your life.


Cultivate the personal within the communal framework. As opposed to most major religious traditions, complete and total submission to an overriding idea or power is not a tenet of Wicca. If you're practicing witchcraft as part of a group of Wiccans, remember that the rituals and spells of witchcraft are as much about personal empowerment as they are about connecting to greater forces. Respect the traditions of your group, but don't shy away from bringing your personal approach to bear on them.
Find rituals that work for you. If you're a member of a group, their rituals will be lent extra power by the belief of the group. However, if you're practicing witchcraft irregularly or on your own, you'll need to develop a sense of what makes an object, act, or symbol significant to you personally. Use such significant items to create an environment of power and seriousness when you practice witchcraft.

, Magic depends on the will and intent of the practitioner to yield results. The more resolute and certain a witch is of his or her purpose, the more he or she will see and feel the effects of a spell. Therefore, it is important to cultivate a solid ethical and moral foundation through which all actions and interactions can be processed and understood by the practitioner as an individual.


Begin with self-understanding. This is a lifelong process, but you'll reap the benefits for as long as you continue on the path. Many people seem to go through life without much of a moral code, only following one when it's convenient or easy. You must not be one of those people. Instead, you must be the rare person who does his or her best to always act on principle, even when principles don't seem to matter.

To develop a strong ethical core, you'll need to truly understand yourself – not just your strengths, but your weaknesses. What things worry or frighten you about yourself? Those are the areas in which you're weak. You don't want to indulge those parts of your personality, but you feel you might not always have the strength to hold them back. By acknowledging and accepting them, you can begin to build stronger defenses against them.


Continue with self-awareness. As you begin to compensate for your weaknesses and focus on your strengths, you'll begin to see your own morals more clearly. Things that make you uncomfortable are likely things you have a moral opposition to; things that bring you a sense of peace or propriety are probably things in line with your sense of righteousness and decency. Your ethics help control your thoughts and actions, but your morals help you clearly understand the reasons behind them.
Follow through with self-discipline. The learning process is never a finite one. Like anything solid and strong, your ethics must be constantly maintained. Scan your mind for faults and cracks in your sense of ethics on a regular basis, and either compensate for or reshape them as time goes by. Always try to frame your ethics in terms of an easily-understandable moral code to be sure that you fully grasp not only how you will act in a given situation, but why you will act that way. If you do these things, you will become a principled person, someone for whom few decisions are difficult because the options can be judged internally according to a clearly-defined system that never wavers.

, If you're practicing as a part of a coven or priesthood, they are likely to have elaborate ritual tools and spells for special occasions throughout the year, but every witch who wants to practice magic on his or her own is generally allowed to do so. To cast effective spells, you'll need a number of tools. The specifics vary from witch to witch and coven to coven. The following is a list of some common tools used by most witches, and their meanings or alignments, if any.


An athame is a dagger (or sometimes a sword), one of the principal tools of witchcraft. It is associated with the male aspect and thus the God, and both the male Quarters, east (air) and south (fire).
A chalice is a ceremonial cup, and one of the principal tools of witchcraft. It is associated with the female aspect and thus the Goddess. The chalice is connected to the west (water) Quarter, one of the two female Quarters.
A wand is a length of smooth, straight wood, tapered at one end and sometimes set with a gem or other focusing element. It is a principal tool of witchcraft, and a phallic representation of the God. Like the athame, the wand is associated with the east and south Quarters, and the elements of air and fire.
The bell is a tool used to send spells to their destination with a pleasing sound. It is associated with the Goddess, and can be rung to invoke her presence during rituals.
The cauldron is an important practical tool in witchcraft, used to burn items (such as herbs) during spellwork. It is feminine, and associated with the Goddess.
The censer is a container for burning incense and pouring salt during spells and rituals. It is male, associated with the God, east, and air.
The besom, or broom, is a common tool in witchcraft. A besom is used to ritually cleanse and purify the space where magic will be performed, and as a ritual element that confers protection. It is associated with both the God and the Goddess, and is connected to the element of water.

, Aside from these powerful implements, there are a number of other tools used in most witchcraft that vary more from spell to spell and witch to witch. Some of the most important of these are described below.



Candles are an almost universal witch's tool. They're used to absorb and then slowly release your personal energy and the intent of the spell. The color of the candle used for a spell is determined by the purpose of the spell, but there is some disagreement among Wiccans about which colors work best for which spells. Plan to do your own research, and have a rainbow of colored candles (including black and white) on hand.

Robes are the ritual garments worn during the casting of a spell. They tend to be loose and breathable, and are often color-coded like candles based on the work being done: green for herb magic, brown for work with animals or the self, and so on. Not every tradition of witchcraft requires the use of ritual robes.
A grimoire is another term for a witch's book of spells. Grimoires can be coven-spanning tomes of powerful group spells, or personal collections written by individual witches. They often include recipes (as for potions and poultices), notes, and ritual instructions as well, as they're intended to be practical reference guides rather than highly stylized implements.
A Book of Shadows is essentially a witch's journal. It contains a record of which spells have been cast when, and for what purposes; powerful dreams or induced visions; personal reflections and feelings regarding witchcraft; and anything else that seems to be important or seems to stick to you. Some witches also use it for keeping track of spell ideas and original spells they design, though a Grimoire can also be used for that purpose.

, An altar or sacred space is the physical representation of the work area for a practicing witch. Altars vary wildly between practitioners, but generally feature some kind of oblong or rectangular raised surface, upon which important tools and spell elements are laid out. Create an altar according to your personal ideas and convictions. An altar is also the space in which the altar elements are set. It is usually set in a permanent location, but temporary altars are sometimes also used.


When laying implements on the altar, those associated with the Goddess and the feminine should be placed to the left, whereas those associated with the God and the masculine should sit to the right. The front of the altar is often set to face north, though this isn't necessarily required.

, The casting of the circle is one of the most basic and important rituals in witchcraft. It defines and protects the altar for the duration of the spell, by inviting the four directional and elemental Quarters to watch over it and protect it. The circle is almost always cast before any other spell is cast.


Rituals vary in length and ceremony from witch to witch, but at the most basic, casting the circle involves lighting a candle (usually white, for purification) and then ritually invoking the four Quarters in turn, starting with the north or east and working clockwise.
After a spell or ritual is done, the circle is closed by reversing the casting ceremony: start by facing west and bid each Quarter thanks and farewell in a counterclockwise order, then snuff your candle.
Ritual language such as a rhymed or metered chant is normally used, and the basic phrasing for each direction is the same, to create repetition.

, This basic spell is performed under the light of the moon, and should be done humbly and with reverence. Begin by casting the circle. Light a white candle for purification, and burn a mixture of sandalwood, balsam, and pine wood in your cauldron. Once the mixture is smoking, fill a simple bowl with pure water, and sprinkle salt over it. Set the bowl before you and wet your finger in it to start the incantation.


Touch between your eyes first. Say “Bless my eyes, that I may have clarity of vision.” Wet your finger again after this and each part you touch.
Touch your mouth and say “Bless my mouth, that I may speak the truth.”
Touch your ears and say “Bless my ears, that I may hear all that is spoken and unspoken.”
Touch your heart and say “Bless my heart, that I may be filled with love.”
Touch your bare feet (right, then left is the normal order for rituals) and say “Bless my feet, that I may find and walk my own true path.”
Extinguish the candle to finish the ritual. When you're finished, be sure to close the circle.

, Charm bags are small, enclosed pouches that contain any of a wide array of items. They are used to provide extra energy and focus your will on a specific goal or task. This charm bag empowers your dreams to provide you with clearer and more obvious insight into problems or concerns than regular dreams.


Choose any fabric you like. If you're using a dyed fabric, blue and white are the colors most associated with mending, purifying, and spirituality.
Slowly and deliberately sew two pieces of cloth together on three sides, while concentrating on the purpose of the bag (to provide clearer, stronger, and more powerful dreams). The longer you spend doing this, the more your personal power will infuse the bag.

To extend the time you spend creating the bag even further, consider decorating it with markings, beads, or other attachments when you're done sewing the first three sides.


Open the loose end of the bag and put just a pinch or two each of the following herbs inside it:

Peppermint
Cinnamon
Lemon verbena
Vervain (common verbena)
Marigold flower
Hops


Sew the top of the bag closed under the light of a full moon, while charging it and purifying it with your intent. Beginning the next night, rub the bag over the center of your forehead each night before you go to sleep, while concentrating hard on your question or concern. Place the charm bag underneath your pillow and then go to sleep. You should notice its effects within a few nights, at most.

Be sure to keep a pen and paper at hand to quickly write down details and insights from your dreams before your waking mind forgets them.



, Herbal tea might not sound like much of a spell, but herbs are powerful magical items. To a witch, only part of an herb's power can be seen or understood by traditional Western medicine; the remainder is awakened by ritual and intent.


Begin your plant magic by boiling a kettle of clean water.
Pour a cup of water, and add two teaspoons of valerian root while reciting a short chant to drive away anxiety. End your chant with “As I will, so mote it be” to infuse the concoction with your will.

In Dorothy Morrison's book Everyday Magic, the incantation is as follows: Nervous anxiety, you are dead / Roots and water, soothe my head / Bring me to your calming peace / As I will, so mote it be. Any similar incantation should work as well.


Drink the entire cup of tea. Sweeten it with plenty of honey if you don't like the taste. Repeat daily or as needed until your anxiety subsides. Be sure to let the tea cool before you drink it!

From dealing with the kids going crazy to being stuck in a 10 mile (16 km) traffic jam, recognize the situation for what it is and know that now is time to put on your game face and take care of yourself.;
, The first step to looking (and feeling) peaceful is to calm the body. The feeling of wanting to scream, yell or basically run around like a chicken with your head cut off must be stopped before you lose control and blow your cover. Breathing and counting can help to restore some zen in an otherwise crazy moment:


Practice deep breathing exercises the minute you feel anxiety take over. Close your mouth, your eyes (if possible) and breathe deeply through your nose, down into your diaphragm. Allow the breath to completely fill your lungs. Hold the breath for at least three seconds and then slowly and deliberately release the air. Practice these deep breaths at least three or four more times (or until you feel as if you're gaining control over your emotions).
Mentally count backward, starting with 10. One reason counting may help to relax the mind is because it provides the brain with something else to think about, rather than focus on your stressful situation. Breathe and count simultaneously until you feel that you can regain control over yourself.

, Starting with the tips of your toes, begin to mentally feel your body becoming limp––actually melting into your chair or the ground. Looking zen externally means that your body language must be consistent with being relaxed. To relax, your muscles must chill out, beginning with your feet. Visualize each muscle fiber releasing tension and relaxing. Work upward through your body until you get to your face––probably the most important body part for looking relaxed while stressed.


Relax the eye muscles and try to avoid frowning or looking angry, anxiety ridden or upset. If you can't bear the stressful situation with a smile, at least keep a neutral facial expression.
Become aware of the nervous ticks often associated with stress. Lip biting, fingernail biting, or knee shaking are easy-to-spot signs that you're stressed out. Know your unconscious habits and stop them dead in their tracks.
Try self-massage. Massage your head, neck, shoulders and lower back. Even better if you can get someone else to do this for you––you can always offer to reciprocate when they're stressed!

, Unfurrow your brow, as scrunching it up is a normal reaction when overwhelmed with anxiety.


One way to achieve fast relaxation is to deliberately tense your facial muscles and then release them. You'll notice the difference immediately. This can also be done with all your body's muscles.

, Anxiety-ridden people often act erratically and sometimes don’t make sense when talking or fidget incessantly, causing others to catch the jumpy mood. Instead of going into flight mode, be deliberate and slow with everything you do. Think slow motion.


Stop and think before you speak. Consider how your dialog will come across and what your delivery should look like if you weren’t stressed out. Stick to neutral topics and avoid integrating negative words or comments into your delivery.
Avoid racing around in circles or moving constantly. You'll appear to be frazzled and stressed if you don't practice grace with your movements. If you feel as if you are so tanked up with adrenalin, go for a short walk outside the building or wherever it's possible to walk, to try to release some pent-up energy and restore positive energy flow. Even a five-minute walk will give you the chance to unwind and re-focus.
Don’t make rash decisions while you're stressed. Being zen means that you're “going with the flow” so don’t decide to move to Montana because a hurricane may hit your hometown in Florida.

, If you don't have a wonderful view from the office, kitchen or wherever it is that you tend to stress most, then introduce one. Add plants that purify the air and add wonderful greenery to your visual space. Put up pictures of places of natural splendor, such as Yosemite, Yellowstone or your favorite local hiking trail. Images of pets, animals and flowers or trees can also help to keep you focused more on calm when you look at them.


If there is a special spot you like to go to and it's close by, slip out to it for a half hour and soak up the serenity it provides. If not, take a photo of your special natural place and pin it to the wall or a board so you can use it to remind you of what peace feels like.

, This could be traffic, the sound of children playing, an air conditioner humming or running water. Listen to the repetitive, rhythmic nature of your chosen sound until you feel calmer and more settled.

, Whatever it is that you're doing, break every hour for at least five minutes of different activity or rest. It is important to refresh your mind and to stretch your body. You will be a lot more effective for regular breaks than if you plow on through and you will find that doing this contributes massively to a zen approach to the tasks.


If the rest of your team looks askew when you take regular breaks, encourage them to do the same, pointing out how much more focus they'll have when they return to the tasks. It may take some convincing but it's worth getting others on board. If they won't, slip off quietly and have your break unnoticed.

, Put others at ease with a relaxed smile and an easy joke. Smile naturally––a forced smile will make you look ghoulish. The best way to cultivate a relaxed smile is to completely clear your mind and focus on something pleasant or peaceful like a garden meadow or a sunset. The smile will come naturally if your mind if filled with positive thoughts. When it comes to jokes, keep the topics light, tasteful, and appropriate. If small quips aren’t your thing, smile and stick to conversation about the weather.

, If you've been tasked with more work, chores or responsibilities than you're able to cope with, no amount of focusing on being zen will work for you until you've sorted out a fairer distribution. Be prepared to speak up and tell your boss, spouse, coworker, friend, etc. there is more than you're able to tackle and that some of what you're doing needs to be offloaded to another. Keep your calm as you explain this and state just the facts, including the perceived consequences for the other person should you not be able to manage completion of the tasks or responsibilities on time or to a satisfactory standard.

, This may seem like a no-brainer but in fact, it's often not. The insistence of other people that something is urgent can cause you to assume that a task is urgent when, on reflection, you might otherwise realize that it is something that can be left until later without any harm. In fact, a number of requests to do things are often better for a period of reflection. When someone else insists that something is urgent, be zen and question the urgency. If it really is urgent, you can have the satisfaction of completing it within time for good reason. If it is not, you can have the satisfaction of giving the matter due attention in a more realistic period. Ultimately, having the ability to state that something will get done within a reasonable time puts you back in control and helps you to maintain a zen-like calm.

"
Obey the word (as the voice) of the Lord in the Gospel as found in The Bible.,
Stop wishful thinking, but don't just start acting spiritual.,
Be sure that you are born again.,
Know this part of the point of life: to serve the Lord by also serving and loving your fellowman.,
Focus on what serving your fellow man means as ""whatever you do is being done to God."",
Pay attention to this point of life according to Jesus, as Jesus said:


""I say to you 'Love your enemy.,
Seek to do the things that you know Christ did because Jesus said:


""The works (deeds) that I do -- you shall do also."",
Come out of complacency by serving others more than ever before.,
Pray with others more.,
Give thanks.,
Allow God to soften the hardness of your heart to have compassion, and remove ""cancer"" (or call it ""the rot"") of sin by the grace and love of God.,
Pay back time: Jesus said that if you have cheated anyone out of money: ""Pay it back three fold, triple!"",
Forgive: as God has forgiven us.,
Cleanse your mind of doubt; put on the whole armor of God for service to the house of the Lord.,
Meet the Truth of the Gospel halfway.,
Seek to understand and live out that understanding through the Spirit.,
Abandon the old way, if that was self-centered life, and see the matter in the whole context that stands waiting beyond the threshold of your hearts desires.,
Engage the passion for the Truth of the Gospel.,
For a new way of life you may do as Jesus said in the ""Great Commission"":""Go into all the world and preach the Gospel: teaching whatever you have heard of me.""",How to Get to the Point With Christ," Read the promises, commandments and urgings in the Bible.

, Let God change you to be more like Jesus Christ. Be an example of getting the point of Christ.

, Jesus said ""You must be born again."" so that means to:


Pray, repent, be baptized and filled with the Holy Spirit, and proclaim the point of life in Christ.

, Seek to accept these parts of the point:

""He that would be great must serve.""
""Without faith it is impossible to please God.""

, That is not just because God is ""all"" and ""in all"" -- and so it impacts Him -- but it is because of what Jesus said about doing good to the least of these my children.

, Do good to those that hate you and use you spitefully.' ""
""Whatever you do to one of the least of these my children you do to me.""

,

, Apathy and depression are right there with complacency, and the Lord can break those off of your life. God will accelerate the power of the Holy Spirit in your life and those that you affect. You can have a greater affect on strangers, your friends, family and acquaintances than you may think.

, When you don't feel like praying: Pray! Pray with your children.
, Spend time in quiet fellowship or in fervent, effective prayer., Then you can seek to avoid many weaknesses such as envy, jealousy, hatred,...

, But not to even ask for payment if a poor man owes you money. Give grace as if the borrower is a close family member that you can carry indefinitely.

, That is not easy, but it is his command. He said: ""If you love me you will keep my commandments. This commandment I give to you: 'Love one another.' "" So, be concerned, not calloused, but be tender of heart, preferring the others good over yourself. Thinking better for the other, like: ""You can go first."" and ""Have mine. It's good food"" and so go beyond common courtesy.

, God knows the potential of evil, but He will not look upon evil or speak evil.


""Cleanse your mind ye double minded."";
, God will meet you there when you seek Him with a whole heart (core of being). God will take you, as one of His wayfaring children, and fill them with the spirit of the prophets -- like the spirit that was in Elijah -- The Holy Spirit.

,


""We have this treasure in this earthen vessels..."" -- and Christ can unlock the vessel to release your blessing.

, Not lust or greed, but ""The Truth"" who is renowned as Jesus Christ (called The Way, The Life, and The Truth).

, Can you handle it?

Ask yourself, are you a sinner?,
Learn the gospel (the good news), starting with the historical events of Jesus who lived, taught, died for sinners on the cross, was buried, and rose from the dead (1 Cor.,
Hear the Gospel of Jesus, and receive the only good news you need.,
Be saved from the wrath of God.,
Realize that Jesus is the one who died for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2).,
If you are not a Christian and want to be delivered from the righteous judgment of God, then come to the One who died for the sins of the world.,
Ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins (John 14:14; Matt.,After you are saved from your sins and forgiven by the blood of Jesus Christ there are some things that will help you continue to grow and live for God as you begin your new life with Him.,
Be Baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.,
Live a holy and consecrated life.,
Read the scriptures; they say: Psalm 119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?,
Love God and others.,
Tell the good news to others.,
Remember that Jesus will come again.",How to Get to Heaven (Christianity)," Have you ever lied, stolen, lusted, coveted, or been angry with someone unjustly? If you've lied, then you're a liar. If you've stolen, then you are a thief. You've broken the Law of God. God has said, ""You shall not steal; You shall not lie; You shall have no other gods before Me; You shall not murder, etc."" (Exodus 20:1-17). He has given the standard of righteousness; and if you have broken any of God's commandments, then you have fallen short of that standard and are under the inevitable judgment of God (1 John 3:4; Isaiah 59:2; Rom. 6:23). When you die, you will face Him; and on the Day of Judgment, he will deliver the proper judgment to all people. He must because he is righteous and holy. Here is the the salvation plan!;
, 15:1-4). His death was a sacrifice that turns away the wrath of God (1 John 2:2). His grace is the only way to be saved from God's righteous judgment upon those who have sinned (for all have sinned) by breaking his Law.

, You need his grace alone. Your works won't help you (Rom. 3:10-12; Isaiah 64:6), nor will your sincerity. You can never be good enough, and you have nothing to offer God except your sinfulness. It is only by the love and grace of God found in Jesus and His sacrifice that you can be delivered from the righteous wrath of God upon all who have broken His law. Jesus saves you from God's righteous judgment.


The Bible says that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23). That means that your sins have caused a separation between you and God (Isaiah 59:2), and the result is death (Rom. 6:23) and wrath (Eph. 2:3).

, ""It is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance as our way of life."", (Ephesians 2:8-10). You must trust in what Jesus did on the cross to forgive you of your sins and not trust anything else--not even your own sincerity or works., He is the only way to God the Father (John 14:6). He alone reveals God (Matt. 11:27). He has all authority in heaven and earth (Matt. 28:18). It is only through Him that you can be saved from God's wrath (Eph. 2:3). He can forgive you of your sin (Luke 5:20; Matt. 9:1-8). He can remove the guilt that is upon your soul. Jesus can set you free from the bondage of sin that blinds your eyes, weakens your soul, and brings you to despair. He can do this because He bore sin in His body on the cross (1 Peter. 2:24) so that those who trust in Him would be saved.

, Come to the One who died for sinners (Matt. 11:28). Believe and trust in Jesus. Receive Jesus, who is God in flesh (John 1:1, 14) and who died and rose from the dead (1 Cor. 15:1-4), as your Lord and Savior.

, 9:1-8). Receive Christ (John 1:12) and the sacrifice he made on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24). Repent of your sins. This means to change your mind about sin and agree with God that it is an offence to Him and is separating you from His fellowship. Only He can wash you clean from your sins, and only Jesus can deliver you from the future judgment of a holy and infinite God. Pray to Jesus. Seek Him. Ask Him to save you. Put your trust in him. At this point, you are saved and God has forgiven you of your sins forever.

Invite people who believe in the spirit world.,

Begin the séance near midnight.,
Have everyone hush and turn off their electronic devices.,
Be seated in a circle and light the candles.,

Decipher the spirits' answers.,
Continue the séance as long as you're still receiving answers.,
Thank the spirits for coming when you're ready to stop.,
Turn on the lights and process what happened.",How to Perform a Séance," This way the ghost spirits will be more comfortable with wining and dining with people who believe. A séance is much more powerful if everyone there really believes that it's possible to communicate with spirits. If even just one person is skeptical or thinks the whole thing is silly, the power of the séance will be weakened. A séance is built upon the collective positive energy of the participants, called ""sitters,"" so make sure everyone you invite is truly on board to have a supernatural experience.You might want to invite people who have lost someone they want to get in touch with. A séance is an opportunity to communicate with loved ones on the other side.
Don't invite someone who's deeply afraid of ghosts, or who tends to get nervous when something out of the ordinary happens. This could be disruptive to the séance.;
, Having questions in mind to engage the spirits will give the séance more structure. Rather than just asking the spirits to come and make their presence known, people can try to summon the spirits of specific people and receive information that would be impossible to get in any other way.


For example, someone who lost her grandmother could plan to summon her grandmother's spirit and ask if she's OK.
Bear in mind that people should not have the expectation of receiving a clear, straightforward answer to their questions. The spirits do not communicate the same way that humans communicate with each other.
""Yes"" or ""no"" questions usually produce more satisfying results than questions that would require a long-winded answer.

, If there's someone in the group who has had experience conducing a séance, or who is more psychically gifted than the others in the group, he or she might be the right one to mediate the séance. A medium opens the séance with a prayer, invites the spirits to join the circle, and asks the spirits questions.


Having a medium isn't a requirement, but it can be useful to have an experienced person lead the group, especially if there are first-timers among the group.
If you want to conduct a séance, but you don't know anyone you'd want to nominate to be the medium, you can actually hire a professional medium to facilitate the experience. If you choose to do this, be sure to look into the person's credentials and make sure the price is reasonable., It's important to conduct the séance in a place where there will be as few interruptions as possible. Choose a space that's quiet with lighting you can adjust to a dim setting. Make sure the room is comfortable and not filled with distracting electronics, loud artwork or other items that might take away from the experience.


Many people mistakenly think that a séance must be conducted in a haunted place. The room or building you choose does not have to be haunted. Spirits will come to any place if they feel welcome when you call them.
You may, however, wish to hold the séance in a place that holds spiritual meaning for you and the others who will be present. For example, you could hold it in the home of a loved one who has passed on if you seek to connect with that person through the séance.

, The typical seating arrangement in a séance is circular, so it's best to set a round table, although this isn't mandatory. Cover the table with a tablecloth and set out several candles. Using candles instead of electric lighting will help create a spiritual atmosphere. Arrange straight-backed chairs around the table for your guests.


If you feel it will help to enhance the mood, you can also use incense and instrumental music to create a spiritual setting.
If you wish to sit in a circle but don't have a round table, arrange comfortable cushions in a circle on the floor, and set the cloth and candles in the middle of the circle.

, All you really need to conduct a séance is the presence of willing sitters, but some people like to use special equipment that can make it a little easier to communicate with the spirits. Spirits frequently communicate through objects, so you may want to have an array of options on the table.


For example, you could use a Ouija board to help you ask questions and have the answers spelled out.
Even an item as simple as a glass of water can be used as a tool for communication. You could ask a spirit to alert you to its presence by disturbing the water.
Recording the session could add another layer of communication. Recordings often pick up sounds or images that aren't heard or seen by the people present. Consider setting up a video camera or tape player to record what happens.

, This is not absolutely necessary, but the time between 11:30 and 12:30 seems to have special significance in the spirit world. In the physical world, there are fewer interruptions at this time of day, and it's easier to get in the right frame of mind to be open to supernatural possibilities., This will help everyone get in the right state of mind to experience the séance. Make sure everyone has used the restroom, checked their phones, and so on before the beginning of the séance. Once the session is underway, any type of distraction could throw off the energy and prematurely end the séance.


At this time you might want to ask your sitters if they're ready to participate in the séance. Get a feel for people's moods. It's normal for people to seem a little anxious; you might see someone giggle nervously or look a little worried. However, if anyone seems to be acting cynical about the event, or if anyone looks frightened before it even starts, you might want to ask that person to sit this one out.

, Have everyone sit down and patiently wait while you light the candles in the center of the table. Make sure electric lighting has been turned off or dimmed. Light incense and turn on instrumental music if you wish. Once everything is ready, assess the environment and make adjustments if necessary to create just the right atmosphere., There's no set script for beginning a séance, but many people choose to recite a prayer of welcome to set the tone for the event. You (or the medium, if it's a different person) should thank everyone for coming and announce that it's time for the séance to begin. Ask everyone to please join hands and close their eyes, then recite the prayer and ask the spirits to join you.


Some people pray for protection from angry or evil spirits and ask that only well-intentioned spirits join the circle.
You may summon specific spirits by name during this time. For example, you could say ""Grandmother Margaret, we gather here tonight in hope that we'll receive a sign of your presence. Please feel welcome in our circle and join us when you're ready.""

, Either the medium should ask all of the questions, or sitters can take turns asking. In any case, ask one question at a time, and pause for several minutes to wait for an answer. Be sure everyone stays quiet, since the presence of a spirit be difficult to notice.


Remember that yes or no questions are more likely to solicit satisfying answers. Questions like ""Are you with us?"" and ""Do you have a message for us?"" are better than ""What is it like to live in the spirit world?""
Make sure no one breaks the circle while the questions are being asked. If someone gets up and leaves, or becomes distracted in some way, the spiritual energy will be lost.

, In very rare cases, a spirit will communicate by having someone in the group translate a message. The medium or another person who's psychically open might begin addressing the group with words the spirit has given him or her. Most of the time, however, the answers are more subtle than this, and the meanings are more difficult to interpret.


Pay attention to what's physically happening in the room. If a glass of water gets knocked over, a candle begins flickering wildly even though there's no draft, or a door inexplicably shuts, these may all be signs that a spirit is present.
Listen for sounds that are out of the ordinary and have no explainable source.
It can help to ask the spirit to answer a yes or no question by giving the group a sign. For example, you could say, ""If you're the spirit of my grandmother, or you have a message from her, make some water spill out of the cup.""

, A séance can last anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour or longer. Try to keep everyone in the circle until the spirits seem to be gone and you're no longer receiving answers to your questions. The ending of a séance usually occurs naturally when the spiritual energy in the room eventually dissolves.


A séance can be an emotionally intense experience that elicits a range of different reactions. If someone in your group begins to cry inconsolably, scream, or otherwise exhibit extreme negativity or fear, either have someone escort that person to a room that's less spiritually charge, or go ahead and turn on the lights to end the séance.

, It's always a good idea to give a séance closure, as you would any other type of spiritual service or ritual. End the séance by thanking the spirits for joining your circle. You may want to say a prayer of closure. Thank the sitters for their participation as well, then blow out the candles to formally end the session.

, Allow people a few moments to quietly pull themselves out of the spiritual realm and back into the physical, present moment. Talk about the events that occurred during the séance to find out what everyone can learn from the experience.


Analyze the signs and answers you received from the spirits. When that door slammed shut, could it have been caused by a draft? Or are you all absolutely certain that a spirit was responsible?
If you recorded the séance, watch and listen to the session. Turn up the volume and listen for voices and sounds that no one noticed during the séance.

Cover a large piece of paper with letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0-9, and the words ""Yes"", ""No"", ""Hello"" and ""Goodbye"".

, Each of you place one hand lightly on the up-turned glass. Decide who will ask the questions. Another person could be taking notes.

,,, You can add any other phrases you wish.

,,, Glass or sheet protector should be fine!

, You are ready to have your first talking board séance!

, You'll need a wood board, sanded and smooth. You'll also need paint, varnish (or another clear coating), and a soldering iron (with a calligraphy tip or similar). Pencil and paper will also help.

, Soldering irons are a little tricky. Practice on some scrap wood first so that you can see how slow you need to go and how hard you need to press. It will also give you the chance to figure how to move it in order to get different shapes.

, Make sure the wood is clean and smooth.

, You can draw the design free-hand or you can use a ""cheat"", such as printing the characters onto transfer paper or you can purchase ink stamps from a craft store.


Make sure the designs are not too small or detailed, especially if you do not have a lot of experience with a soldering iron.

, Draw over the design with the iron. Don't rush yourself. Look at it in different lights to be sure that it looks right.

, Let the burned areas cool and then brush off any excess material. Erase pencil marks and other marks and gently wipe the whole surface with a lightly damp cloth. Let it dry before going on.

, The varnish or other clear coating will create the smooth surface necessary to make the planchette work. Carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions for whatever finish you decide to use. You will likely need to do several coats and each one takes a long time to dry correctly. Set aside plenty of time for this project.

, You can paint on even more details once the varnish has dried completely. Details are best painted on in the second to last layer of varnish, so long as it is clear and not colored.

, There are a number of ways that you can lay out your board. The design isn't so important, so long as you have all of the necessary symbols. You need to include at least the letters of the alphabet, numbers 0-9, and the words ""yes"",""no"", and ""farewell"".


Use the traditional layout if you want to. This is where the letters are written out in two slightly-arced lines at the center, with yes/no above and the numbers and farewell below.
You could also use a diamond layout. In this design, the letters are written in a diamond shape, with each of the four points lining up with the center of that side of the board. The numbers are written inside this diamond and the corners are allocated for the words (allowing for an additional phrase, like ""not now"").
You could also try a circular layout. This design is similar to the diamond, but uses an oval shape instead.

, Choose a font which fits with the design of your ouija board. Gothic fonts are good choices, as are many Western-themed fonts. You can, however, choose whatever you like best. Write some test text in a word editor to get an idea of what you think looks best.

, Many believe it's a good idea to add certain symbols to the corners or other location on your board. Beliefs vary, but common symbols include: the moon, sun, and stars; the symbols for the elements; the symbols for the planets; and symbols or images in neurologically significant quantities (12, 13, 7, 3, etc).


You can also embellish your board with physical objects, such as set spots for candles, attached stones (quartz is good for this purpose), or places to put the elements (a bowl of water, a branch, etc).

, Choose a color scheme for your board. Darker, earth tones tend to be better at calling forth the spirits, but if you're looking to contact particularly cheerful spirits, there's nothing wrong with using colors you think they'd prefer. If you're trying to contact someone in particular, try their favorite color.


Try to use colors that contrast well. You want to be able to see your text easily.

, You'll need a planchette (the device where you place your hands) in order to use your ouija board. You can rescue one from a random set you find at a dollar store, or you can make your own.

It will be a lot easier to do this someplace peaceful. Here are some ideas:Places in nature, such as next to ponds, rivers, or lakes. You could also hold a session inside a cave.
Places with happy memories, especially for you, such as: gardens, gazebos, or where you got married.
Places where you feel safe and comfortable, aside from a living room, den, or kitchen.;
, If you connect with an evil spirit, you may get negative energy in your home. This will affect your dreams and day-to-day life.

, Haunted places, or places where someone has died, are also a bad idea. You might think it ""cool"" or ""spooky,"" but you'll only be asking for trouble. You will be more likely to contact an evil spirit in these sorts of places. This is something you want to avoid., This will help get rid of any negative energy that might attract bad spirits. Here are some ideas to get you started:Place quartz crystals around the board. They help cleanse and maintain energy. You can also use hematite, obsidian, or kyanite for protection.
Light black candles to absorb bad energy. You can also light white candles to attract good energy.
Burn lavender incense. This will help attract nicer spirits. You can also burn frankincense, myrrh, or dragon's blood incense for protection from the not-so-nice ones. Sage bundles are also commonly used in magic rituals for protection.
Draw a circle around you and the board using some sea salt.

, There are several ways you can do this. Most people will cleanse their boards before and after using it, especially if they met a bad spirit. Here are some ideas to get you started:Light some incense or a bundle of sage. Let the smoke cover the board and pointer. Draw a circle around the board using your finger or wand, then light a black candle. The candle will absorb the negative energy. Next, close your eyes and imagine a bright light. After a moment, open your eyes and blow out the candle. Discard it or bury it. Draw a circle around the board again using your finger or wand.
Sprinkle some rosewater over the board, while saying a simple, protective prayer. You can even make up your own. Here's an example of a protection prayer: I clear this space of all negativity. I clear this space of the energy of people or things that have no purpose in this household. I ask that this clearing be gentle, and that all of this energy be returned to its source.""

, Don't try to use it when you are feeling angry, annoyed, or depressed. Spirits can feed off of energy. If you try to use your board while you are in a bad mood, you might end up getting a bad spirit.


You might also want to avoid using the board if you are feeling anxious or scared. An evil spirit may try to use your fears against you.

, This will make it harder for you to focus. It will also make you an easy target for bad spirits, who may try to take advantage of the situation and possess you.

, Don't use the board in order to spy on someone or learning his/her weakness. Also, don't use the board to ask the spirit to possess someone or make his/her life miserable. Revenge may sound like a good idea now, but it will bring serious harm to both you and your victim.

, They will make you less aware of your surroundings. This can be very dangerous. When dealing with spirits and the spirit world, you want to be focused at all times.

, This may help dispel any negative energies that might be plaguing you. It might also help you feel relaxed. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Meditate. Try envisioning yourself surrounded by a bright light.
Say a prayer of protection. You can make up a prayer if you like. It can be something as simple as: Let nothing but good energies surround me. Let nothing but good intentions fill me. Let my mind and body be calm and at peace.""
Take an herbal or salt bath. The best herb to use is lavender, and the best salt to use is sea salt., This is for safety reasons, in case something happens to you and you are unable to end the session. It is also for practical reasons; you will need other people to help channel and build the energy. Plan on having a group of three to five people. Here's what an ideal group should look like:


One person to handle the pointer and ask the spirit questions.
One to three people who are also touching the pointer. They are focusing the energy, but not asking any questions.
One person to take notes or record the session. This will allow the group to analyze the spirit's answers later.

, The pointer is very important. It helps the spirits talk with you. Usually, it will move to a number or letter, but sometimes, it may start to do other things. Here are some things you should watch out for:If the pointer starts to move through the alphabet or numbers in sequence, the spirit is counting down. Once it finishes, it can escape through the board. You want to end the session before this happens.
If the pointer travels to each corner of the board, you have reached an evil spirit. End the session immediately.
If the pointer starts to make figure eights, it means that an evil spirit has taken control of the board. Flip the pointer over and end the session.
Never let the pointer fall to the floor. This will release the spirit that is moving it.
Never leave the pointer on the board once you have finished a session. Always put it back into its bag and store it on the other side of the room. If you see the pointer on the board and no one is using it, flip it over, and end the session. Then, store the pointer on the opposite side of the room.

, There are some things you shouldn't talk about when using a Ouija board. Also, read the spirit's replies carefully. If he or she appears annoyed by a question, change the subject. In general, you should avoid any of the following topics:God and religion
Your death
Where to find buried treasure
Your name or any of your group members' names

, Most people ask the spirit questions about itself, such as its name and its gender. Some people also ask the spirit about its death, such as: what it died, how old it was when it died, the year it died in, and how it died. You don't have to ask the spirit these questions; you can also ask the spirit if it has a message for anyone, or if there's something it would like you (or a group member) to do. Here are some other topics you can bring up:What the spirit's hobbies where, or what the spirit likes to do
Whether or not the spirit always lives in the realm of the living
Where the spirit used to live
The spirit's family and home

, You should not believe everything a spirit tells you, especially if the spirit seems to be mischievous or malicious., Sometimes, the spirit will end the session first. If it doesn't, you will need to move the pointer to the word GOODBYE. This is important. If you don't do this, you will leave the doorway to the spirit world open. Other spirits might use this to enter your house.


Remember to thank the spirit for his or her time before saying goodbye.
Respect the spirits. Try not to annoy, anger, or irritate them.

, Sometimes, you may need to end the session early, especially if you, any of your friends, or the space around you starts to feel strange. When this happens, you must move the pointer to the word GOODBYE, flip it upside down, and take it off the board. This will break any spiritual connections. Here are other things to keep in mind:


Remain calm at all times. If you start to panic, you may forget what to do. The spirit may also sense it, and use it to his or her advantage.
If the spirit starts to get angry or swear, apologize to the spirit and end the session. An angry spirit is a dangerous spirit.
If a spirit uses your name in any way, it is getting dangerous. You should finish the session right away.

, Keep your board someplace clean. Make sure that no one can mess with it. Keep the pointer in a cloth bag, and store it separately from the board. Do not store the pointer on top of the board, or you will risk leaving a portal to the spirit world open.

Close the board.",How to Use a Ouija Board," Technically, Ouija can be played alone, but it's best to play with at least one other person. Especially if it's a dark and stormy night.


Two people is ideal. The more people you have, the more hectic it may get (loud, distracting, etc.) and you may confuse the spirits. More than two is fine--just make sure everyone stays calm and respectful.

, Before getting down to the business of contacting ""the other side,"" you may want to get in the mood by dimming the lights, using candles, lighting incense, and burning sage.


Ouija can be all about timing. Sometimes the board is ultra-responsive and sometimes it seems asleep. It's best to try it at night or into the wee hours of the morning.
Remove all distractions. There should be no loud music, noise from the television, or kids running around. A séance requires your undivided attention in order to be successful.
Turn your phones off! Accepting a call in the middle of the conversation interrupts the progress and mood.

, On the original instructions of the game, it says to place the board on the knees of the two participants, with their knees touching. It also says, ""Lady and gentleman preferred."" So, take it for what it's worth. However, this shouldn't really affect your experience at all.


Working on a clear table or on the floor is fine. So long as everyone can clearly see and keep fingers on the planchette, or pointer.
The participants should be on either side of the board or at the base of it; sometimes the planchette moves fast and the letters need to be quickly processed and sequenced. Viewing the board upside-down could confuse the intended message.

, Sometimes the spirit needs a minute to warm up. You may not get answers right away. Don't give up.


The myths about 'moving the planchette to warm it up' mean nothing. The spirit is the one providing the answers, not the planchette, so slow answers will be nothing to to with the planchette. Some spirits can move the planchette faster than others.
Sometimes the planchette moves very quickly and sometimes it moves very slowly. If getting a message out of your planchette is like waiting for dial-up, don't get angry. Wait it out or close the board and resume a little later.

, If you are speaking to a highly communicative spirit, talk to it! Be friendly. This will encourage him/her to cooperate with you.


You may not get the answers you want. This is not the spirit or the board's fault. Getting angry or violent will just ruin the vibe of the board and the room.

, It's best not to bombard your spirit with questions on the content and length of your next history exam. Start simple, like a normal conversation.


Your first questions should have easy, short answers.

How many spirits are in the room?
Are you a good spirit?
What is your name?



, The last thing you want to do is stay up all night contemplating your imminent death. If you don't want to know the answer to a question, don't ask it. But if you do choose to ask about your future, take note that it will be jokingly. Just like us mortals, spirits can't see the future. They're messing with you if they tell you your sister is going to die in a week.


Don't ask silly or stupid questions. ""What did Billy tell his sister about me?"" is not something your spirit may want to waste time on. Not to mention how long it would take to spell the answer out!
Don't ask for physical signs. That's just asking for trouble. What's more, those you're communicating with may not be able to follow up. It's best to keep it contained within the Ouija. However, some spirits are ok with asking for proof. It varies.
Don't believe everything the board tells you. If it says you're going to die in the next ten minutes, just don't go running in front of buses. That's you fulfilling the prophecy, not the prophecy being correct.

, Designate one person to ask all the questions. This keeps things simple and prevents the ones on the other side from getting confused.


However, all players should have a say in questions. Take turns thinking up questions, but have the medium address them to the board.

, It should be resting on the ""G"" space on the board to start.


Ask all players to gently place their index and middle fingers on the planchette. Slowly move the planchette in circles to let the board warm up and concentrate on what you want to ask. Rest your fingers on it firmly but without much force; if you hold it too stiffly, it won't move as easily.

, This could be anything -- a prayer, a welcome, or even trinkets scattered around you.


Have the medium greet the spirits and affirm that only positive energy is welcome.
Line the board with jewels or other relics. If you are seeking to talk to a deceased relative, have something of theirs nearby.

, These should start out simple and progress as you get the feel for that specific session.


If your spirit indicates that he/she is bad, it's best to close the board and resume again later.
If you start getting rude or vulgar responses, do not mirror it with your own rude behavior. But you don't start using vulgar words. And don't shout if you get too scared just say goodbye to the spirits and quit.

, To get the best, most effective results, all players need to clear their minds and focus on the question at hand.


Everyone playing needs to sit seriously and respectfully. If you have a friend who is laughing or encouraging ridiculous questions, kick them out of the room.
As the planchette moves, you may want to have one person serve as the writer. Sometimes responses get quite lengthy and need to be worked out.

, Sometimes this happens quickly and sometimes it happens slowly; once in a while, it doesn't happen it all. But if everyone is focused and attentive, the planchette should slowly take off.


Make sure no player is dominating the planchette. If they are clearly the reason it's moving, they shouldn't be playing the game. Each player should have the same amount of weight distributed on the pointer.

, If the planchette starts doing ""figure eights,"" or counting down from Z to A, or counting down from 9 to 0, end the séance by moving to goodbye. Any of these 3 things happening indicates that the spirit is trying to escape from the board. It's very important to tell the spirits goodbye. You would hate to be left all of a sudden, wouldn't you?


Have the medium state that it is time to finish the séance and sweep the planchette over the 'GOODBYE' symbol on the board.

Of course, if you enjoyed the time with your spirit, say, ""Goodbye!"" and wait for the planchette to move to ""Goodbye"" in turn.


Before you box your board up, rub it with a soft, dry cloth. This keeps it clean and prevents dust and moisture from building up.

Choose a material.,
Cut out a planchette shape.,
Cut a window (optional).,
Glue felt pads to the base.,
Decorate and finish (optional).,
Create a writing planchette.",How to Make a Planchette1," Traditionally, planchettes are made from a thin piece of attractive wood, such as birch, mahogany, or oak.However, you can make a planchette from any lightweight material, such as thick cardboard, utility board, or a clear hard sheet of plastic.;
, Use a utility knife (for cardboard), a saw (for wood), or a plastic scoring knife (for plastic) to cut your planchette into the desired shape.Most planchettes are shaped like a heart, a teardrop, or a rounded triangle. You can use any shape you find attractive or that has a special meaning for you.


Make the planchette large enough that at least three people can comfortably place their fingertips on the edge.

, Most planchettes have a hole in the middle to act as a ""window"" you can look through to see the answer. If your planchette has an obvious pointer end, you can use that instead to indicate the answer on your Ouija board.


Many planchettes have both a pointer and a window. If you include both, you'll have to experiment to see which points to the right answer. Perhaps different spirits use different methods of communicating.
Optionally, fit a piece of clear plastic or glass into the window. The plastic ""window"" on some greeting cards is a good option that can be popped right in., Glue three or four tiny circles of felt to the outer edge of the planchette's underside. This helps the planchette slide smoothly across the board. Apply the glue sparingly, or the felt may become soggy or crusty.


A brief spray of 3M 77 or a dab of Elmer's Carpenter Glue are both good options.You can use small metal casters instead, attaching two of them to the wide end of the planchette and using a felt-tipped peg on the third side.

, If you like, you can decorate your planchette with astrological symbols, spirit names, or other mystical writing. Use a permanent marker or a fine-tipped paintbrush. If you are using a wood planchette and would like to prevent it from getting scratched, purchase wood finish from a hardware store and apply it in a thin coat to the top surface of the board.


Sand the wooden surface lightly before applying the finish for best results.

, If you want to use your planchette for automatic writing, fit a sharpened pencil through the viewing window so the tip just barely touches the surface underneath. Hold it in place using tape or a tight-fitting washer, then place the planchette over a piece of paper instead of a ouija board. The pencil might begin to draw or write strange shapes."

If You Don't Get A Response, Try Again Later.",How to Invoke Spirits,"


Before you start gathering supplies, you may decide that you do not want to invoke any spirits alone. If you are scared or worried of the possibility of becoming possessed, then asking at least one other friend to join you is the best route to go.;
,


Things you will need are a Ouija board, some kind of candles for light (spirits tend to like darkness), a piece of paper and pen (for writing down letters off of board), and a preferred place to conduct the invoking. Make sure you have all your supplies before starting because you don't want to have to stop if you forgot something important.

,


Once you have all your supplies and your friend or friends, you need to set everything up. Clear a place on a coffee table, or floor if you prefer, and place Ouija board on surface facing up and open. Place the planchette provided in center of board. This is the triangular hand tool. Place candles around you nearby in safe places that won't be disturbed. Check around you to make sure there are no sharp objects nearby that can be used as projectiles in the event of accidentally upsetting a spirit (this can happen and has). Light all candles and turn off lights.

,


If you want you can decide whether you would like to contact a lost loved one or just a random spirit that happens to be listening nearby. All friends should now place at least two fingers on the planchette and say the loved one's name out loud asking him/her to come forth. While you are doing these steps you and your friends need to move the planchette around in a circular motion consistently. If you are wanting a random spirit, just ask is there anyone out there listening?

,


Common questions to use can be: What is your name? How did you die? How many people are in this room? How old are you? What is it like to be dead? You may also ask any other personal questions you may have if you are contacting a lost loved one.

,


Sometimes it can take only minutes or even up to an hour for movement and responses. Just be patient and soon enough you should see results. When contact is finally made, the spirit will move the planchette and respond to your questions by spelling out the words using the letters on the board. This is where your paper and pen come handy. You can spell out words and sentences to help you communicate and keep track of conversation. If for some reason you are unable to make any contact just keep repeating the above steps. It is unusual to not get any responses at all but it can happen sometimes.

,


If you are unlucky and get nothing, don't be sad, and try again later.

",How to Behave During a Ouija Board Session," (See ""Things You'll Need"".);
, e.g. How old were you when you died? Are you good or bad? Have your questions in mind even before you break out the board.

, It is best not to use the board alone. Have at least two other people with you who are going to take the activity seriously. Make sure that both you and they know the dangers of messing around with spirits.

, It can be a shock but if you wish to stop, you can always say goodbye.

, If you are nervous before you start, you can say a prayer and/or wear a cross.

, Don't ask stupid questions like ""Are you fit?"" This can make the spirit angry.


Most people have no clue what the dead can do. Ask sensible questions. Be patient and do not laugh.

,, If one friend only wants to watch, get them to write down the invocations and answers so you can look back at them.

, If the board starts beginning to do figure of eights, or going from 9 to 0 or a-z etc., say goodbye and close the board.

Think about your life.,
Reflect on inner and outer happiness.,
Think about enlightenment.,
Make a good plan for your life.,
Live as a philosopher of happiness.,
Think about life, try out, find your way and realize your inner happiness.",How to Do the Philosophy of Happiness of Diogenes and Epicurus," Ask the big questions that are so often left unanswered. What are your goals? What do you want to attain in life?


""My goals are ... "" (choose yours: health, wealth, having friends, a good job, being loved, travel, a big house, helping those in need, promoting love and peace, alleviating poverty and hunger, etc.).;
, Research shows that 90 percent of happiness comes from inside, with only 10 percent derived from external things like a great partner, a lot of money, or a big career.Consider investing your energy in a healthy life, meditation, positive thinking, and working for a happier world.

, Enlightenment is the greatest form of happiness. Find your personal way of spirituality. Center your life in God or in a higher reason like truth, love, inner happiness or enlightenment.


What are the spiritual exercises you want to do daily? Some suggestions include: yoga, meditation, reading, positive thinking, walking, praying, doing good, etc.

, In yoga there are four phases of a full life: good learning in childhood; good work as adult; a good relationship or family; and good self-realization. If you're enlightened, you're happy at a high level. You know how to master the crises of life and to grow in your inner happiness despite such moments, and at all times. You live in love, peace, unity and happiness. And you need no outer things to be happy. If they come it is good. If they don´t come, it is also good. You're independent from other people and outer wealth. But you can have it, if you want. You only must know how to manage wise inner happiness and outer pleasure.

, Desire inner happiness. You can go the fast way to enlightenment like Diogenes (live like a yogi), the middle way to enlightenment like Epicurus (live inner and outer happiness at the same time) or the way to unenlightenment like Aristippus (outer pleasure and inner suffering). It is likely that one or other of the suggested ways resonates with you, or maybe even a combination. It is recommended that you apply each philosophical approach to your own life and experiences, to work out what fits you best.

, This is the essence of philosophy. Buddha, Diogenes, Epicurus, Socrates and also Jesus showed us the path. We have to go the way of inner happiness by ourselves. Let us all succeed. May we all find our path of wisdom, love, peace and light.

Use an upside down glass.,
Pop out an old glasses lens.,
Use a coin.",How to Make a Planchette2," Many people turn a shot glass, wine glass, or tumbler upside down over the Ouija board when they don't have a planchette. The glass magnifies the answer and bends the image, making the experience spookier.

, Another makeshift planchette that provides a window to look through is the lens on an old pair of sunglasses or glasses. It's best to use the cheap kind you can purchase at drugstores, not your friend's prescription spectacles or a fancy pair of designer glasses.

, Try using a lucky coin, or an old coin that has been touched by thousands of people. Of course, a coin will not point to an answer or give you a window to look through, but it can move on top of the letters or numbers on a Ouija board.


One superstition holds that a silver coin will prevent evil spirits from getting into your Ouija board."

, Many people believe that a planchette that moves off the board or table has become possessed by an evil spirit.Of course, you can't just pick up your hand when this starts happening... a planchette left on the board might be dangerous too!, Other supposed signs of an evil spirit include a planchette that moves to all four corners of the board, a planchette that moves in a figure eight, or a planchette that counts down through all the numbers or letters of the alphabet., Makeshift planchettes, especially drinking glasses, have a whole lot of extra superstitions. Some people never drink from a glass that's been used as planchette, while others only ban certain drinks, such as alcohol., Hold the drinking glass over a burning candle before using it as a planchette. Cleanse any planchette with your favorite ritual, whether that involves bible verses, pagan invocations, or herbal preparations at the right phase of the moon.Keep it clean in the mundane world too, with a little dusting now and then.

Buy a statue of Saint Joseph.,
Wrap the statue in protective cloth.,
Bury the statue.,
Consider burying the statue in a flower pot.,
Consider keeping the statue in your home.If the thought of burying a statue of St. Joseph seems disrespectful to you, consider placing the statue in your home, instead.,
Pray upon burial.,
Say a prayer each day until the house sells.,
Try a nine-day novena.,
Dig up the statue when your house sells.,
Give thanks.,
Display the statue in a place of honor in your new home.",How to Bury St. Joseph," Choose a small, simple statue so that the burial will be easier to perform. You can by saint statues at Catholic supply stores and online.


The ideal height is between 3 and 4 inches (7.6 and 10 cm).
Nowadays, you can even buy a St. Joseph “home selling kit” from retailers and some real estate offices. These kits usually come with a small statue of St. Joseph, a prayer card, and instructions on the practice.;
, Take a soft, clean washcloth or similar material and wrap it around the statue several time, covering all sides, including the top and bottom. Consider placing the wrapped statue in a resealable plastic bag, as well.


You could also wrap the statue in plastic wrap or place it directly in the plastic bag without first wrapping it in a cloth. The idea is simply to protect it from as much dirt and damage as possible.
Wrapping the statue is a matter of practicality, but more importantly, it is also a sign of respect. Even though you are burying his statue, St. Joseph is still a saint, so you should demonstrate a certain degree of respect for his likeness.

, Dig a hole in your yard that is deep enough to fit the entire statue. Place the wrapped statue inside, then fill the rest of the hole in with dirt. Note that any specifics concerning the exact placement of the statue vary depending on who you ask, so there is no one definitive choice.


The most common tradition holds that you should bury the statue near the ""For Sale"" sign or near the road. Place the statue inside the hole upside-down and facing your house.Others insist that the statue should face the road to symbolize the act of leaving the home.
Some traditions also suggest placing the statue right side up or lying on its back, pointing toward the house like an arrow.You could also consider placing the statue 3 feet (1 m) away from the rear of the house or in your rear yard flower bed.

, If you live in an apartment or a condominium, you may not have a yard that you can bury the statue in. Under these circumstances, you should bury the statue in a large flower pot. Place the flower pot on a deck, patio, or windowsill.


The flower pot can have something growing in it, but this is not a strict necessity.
Note that the rest of the tradition stays the same. You should still wrap the statue in protective cloth and treat it with the same degree of reverence.

, Set the statue down in a window or on a counter in clear sight of the “For Sale” sign in your yard.


When doing this, you do not need to wrap the statue in protective cloth.
Burying the statue is a matter of tradition, not doctrine. There is no Catholic doctrine stating that burying a statue of St. Joseph will help you sell your house. Church teachings do suggest that calling for St. Joseph's intercession when selling your home can help, though, which is why keeping a statue of St. Joseph in your home during the sale would likely work just as well as burying the statue.

, As soon as you bury the statue, you should say a prayer to St. Joseph, asking for his intercession. The exact prayer can vary, and you can go with a pre-written prayer or a prayer from your own heart.


Some prayers “threaten” St. Joseph, essentially stating that he should sell your home for you if he wants to get out of the ground. These prayers somewhat undermine the value of asking for intercession, however, so they are generally not preferred.
Consider using a simple, humble prayer, like the following:

""O Blessed St. Joseph, tenderhearted father, faithful guardian of Jesus, chaste spouse of the Mother of God, I pray you to join with me in praising God the Father through his divine Son who died on the cross and rose again to give us sinners new life. Through the holy name of Jesus, pray that we may obtain from the eternal Father the favor we ask for: our home sale. We have been unfaithful to the unfailing love of God the Father; beg of Jesus mercy for us his brothers and sisters. Amid the splendors of God's loving presence, do not forget the sorrows of whose who weep. By your prayers and those of your most holy spouse, our blessed Lady, may the love of Jesus answer our call of confident hope. Amen."", While saying a single prayer at the time of burial is good, repeating a prayer for intercession each day from that point on demonstrates a greater degree of faith and earnestness. You can say the same prayer each day or offer a different one.

, Instead of saying a standard prayer each day, you could try saying a novena. A novena is a set of prayers recited over the course of nine days. There are different variations, but essentially, you say a different prayer each day and follow each prayer with an “Our Father.” Consider using the following novena:Day One: O God, guide of those who listen and helper of those who hear your voice, speak to me, as you did to St. Joseph, and help me accomplish the things you give me to do.
Day Two: O God, you love your people and bless the ordinary lives we quietly live. As you blessed St. Joseph, bless what I do, however hidden and simple it may be, and let all I do be done with love.
Day Three: O God, ever faithful, you remember us always and in time reveal your blessings. Help me trust in you, as St. Joseph faithfully trusted, and never let me lose faith in the wonderful gifts you promise me.
Day Four: God of families, bless the family that's mine. Keep us safe from harm, and never let evil come between us. Let peace remain in our hearts.
Day Five: O God, who loves children, be kind to our children today. Give them eyes of faith for seeing far, a loving heart for welcoming life, and a place always at your side.
Day Six: God of our heavenly home, bless our home on earth. Let the spirit of Mary and Joseph rest at our table, shape our words and actions, and bring blessing to our children.
Day Seven: God, our Father, give your fatherly spirit to those who are fathers now. Like Joseph, give them hearts of devoted love for their wives and children and strength for forgiveness and patience.
Day Eight: Give shelter, O God, to those who need it, and bring together families divided. Give us enough to eat, and decent work to earn our bread. Care for us, O God.
Day 9: Bless all families, O Lord, especially those in need. Remembering the life of your Son, we pray for the poor, for those who lack a good home, for those in exile. Grant them a protector like Joseph, O God.

, As soon as the contract is signed and the final details are in order, remove the statue from its place in your yard. Unwrap the protective cloth and wash away any dirt that managed to get on the statue itself.


According to legend, if you leave the statue in the yard, the new owners of the house will not be able to stay there for a long time. New owners will come and go until the statue is finally removed.
While there may not be any proof to back this legend, removing the statue should at least be done as a sign of respect.

, Offer a prayer of thanks—first to God, and then to St. Joseph for his intercession. You can offer a prayer from your heart and in your own words, or you could say a generic pre-written prayer of thanks. Either way, the important thing is to pray with sincerity.


An example prayer of thanks would be:

""Heavenly Father, I thank you for my life and everything you have bestowed upon me and upon all people, this day and every day. I thank you for the good and bad, the understanding of forgiveness, and your holy power, without which we would have nothing. I thank you this day for all your blessings, your gifts, your never ending love for us. Although we all are sinners, I ask you to forgive me every day for what I might have done wrong, that I might not have noticed. Even though we all come short of the glory of God, I thank you for the sacrifice of your only son Jesus Christ for all our sins. You and only you know us Father and you know if our hearts are true. So once again, I thank you with all my heart and soul. In the name of Christ I pray. Amen."", Since intercession to St. Joseph helped you sell your home, it is customary to display the statue you buried in your new home. Doing so demonstrates gratitude and reverence.


The display does not need to be anything fancy. Simply sitting the statue on your mantel or desk will suffice.

, Ephesians 6:1-2 tells us to obey and honor our parents. If your parents are true Christians, then you should follow their commands. False Christians are Christians who say they are Christians but don't act like it.

, Jesus Christ died on the cross for sins. That way, we could go to heaven and live with him. That way, we could conquer death. That way could conquer the devil. John 3:16 says:


For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

, After reflecting on yourself, go to your parents. They will help you and assure you that God will be with you. Remember to pray to God and confess your sins to Him. That horrible guilt you once had will be wiped away. You will feel better thereafter.

, Praying is a way of communication between you and God. Cherish it because when you are alone, you could always talk to God. Wherever you are, you could always talk to God. If you need advice or help, God is the one to ask.

, Just as God listens to your voice when you pray to Him, you should also listen to His voice that is written in the Holy Bible. If you keep praying and not read the Bible, it would be like you keep talking and not listening to what the other person says. Then the other person wouldn't like it if you aren't leaving space for him/her. We should listen to God as much as we pray to God.

, Believe in Jesus and trust him. Remember that God loves you. He is always there for you.

, God gave you parents to help you on your way in life. Don't be wasteful of your time. Your parents won't be with you forever. But remember that God will. God could demonstrate to you many things through your parents and through other people.

, Church is a time for you to get into a Christian community. Church could also help you in your way in life. You can learn how to stay away from sin. You can ask the pastor some questions. You can learn many things in church. God wants us to be united among each other. We are one body with Christ as the head.

, Quiet time, devotionals, those stuff. This is the time for you to build up your relationship with God and to learn more about Him. This will help you to focus on God instead of doing the bad things.

, Sin is almost everywhere. Pray to God to help strengthen you with the Holy Spirit. Do not sin like the rest of the world. Instead, you should be different from the world. For Satan is the prince of the world, but God is the King of the Heavens. It is better to choose God rather than Satan. Romans 12:2 puts it this way:

, It doesn't have to be extremely long, just a short letter letting them know that you appreciate all that they do for the church. You can either give it to them personally, or mail it to their house.

, If you have a decent amount of children at your church, then you can have them sing a song for your pastor. If you'd like, you could even make it a surprise party.

Tell your parents about this wish.,
However, if they are not a Christian, carry on.,
Read the Bible.,
Do not swear.,
Don't watch porn.,
Respect your parents.,
Be nice to your school friends.",How to Be a Good Christian Child," If they are Christian/s also, they should be able to help you. Ask them the following questions:


Were you a Christian when you were my age?
Are there any Christian stories you can tell me? (Bible stories, stories that helped them in their faith when they were children, etc.);
, You should not have to change your faith because of your parents' beliefs, but it may be helpful for you to find a Christian adult to answer any questions you may have, and mentor you in your walk with Christ.

, You can borrow one from the library, or, if you have a Kindle E-Reader you can get one for free on Amazon, sent straight to your e-reader. Many churches and religious organizations give paper Bibles away for free, and you can even read and search the Bible on the Internet.

, Swearing is not proper behavior for Christians. Every time you hear the word swear, replace it with curse so that you can realise the severity of it.

, If you have already seen porn, you should realize that sex is not really like what you've seen. God created intercourse for married couples to show love to each other, not to jump into bed the moment they meet. Block all of these sites on your computer, phone, and other devices. If you have a problem with porn, try rewarding yourself each day you go without watching it with something like a piece of candy.

, Hug them and give them a day off from chores once in a while. Remember, if it wasn't for your parents, you wouldn't be alive or even here. So, thank them with all your heart.

, Help them and never tell their secrets. Whenever they're down, cheer them up; think of you as their map. If they're ascending the wrong hill, you get them up the right one. But *don't* be controlling.

Budget your tithe.,
Write a check.,
Decide where to give.,
Plan ahead for special giving.,
Give gladly.",How to Tithe Ten Percent to a Church," Biblically, a tithe is literally one-tenth of what God has blessed you with. This is not necessarily limited to your paycheck, but that is where most people today begin. The question of whether to tithe off of the gross or net pay is really a matter for your conscience, but your aim should be to give to God one-tenth of your best. So if seventy-five percent of your check is deducted before you ever see it, you may want to take that into consideration. Either way you will need to budget your tithe. Make it a priority and not an afterthought.;
, Don't set up automatic draft and avoid giving cash when possible. The automatic draft is too easy. You can easily forget that you are giving back to God from His blessings and find yourself irritated by the periodic debit, or worse, get hit with a fee for insufficient funds. Cash is better, but doesn't offer the incentive of being tax deductible like checks do. Christians are taught to be good stewards, so if you can get tax deductions go for it. If you get a tax refund, you can tithe from it - or give it all.

, Most church budgets today include both a general fund and several other ""dedicated"" funds. While the general fund covers most of the operating expenses of the church, a dedicated fund is for a specific item, such as ""world missions"". These dedicated funds are either replenished with personal giving or smaller percentages from the general fund, or both. Most people simply tithe to the general fund. However, if you feel led to give more, or all of your tithe to a dedicated fund of the church, it is still going to the church.

, There will be opportunities for special giving, and they generally come up quickly without advance notice. Plan ahead. Look at how you've budgeted your tithe to decide if you should give from your tithe, or over and above your tithe. You may want to budget for special giving so you are able to when the time comes.

, Take time to think about your giving. Think about where the money will go and pray for God to bless it. Take time to write the check out before you go to church and not in a mad rush as the ushers come down the aisle. Do not allow it to become a meaningless routine. The point is to savor this worshipful act to God, because tithing is worship.

Ensure you’re qualified to become ordained.,
Attend seminary.,
Apply to become ordained.,
Undergo the ordination ceremonies.",How to Get Ordained1," Only men can officially become ordained within the Catholic Church. Additionally, you must be baptized. Baptism is the ritual cleansing performed on individuals welcomed into the Catholic Church.Finally, you must be at least 35 years old to become a deacon, the lowest level of ordination through which you must pass before becoming ordained as a priest or bishop.Marriages must be recognized by the Church. Divorces must be annulled. Widowers may not remarry and must remain celibate. If unmarried, you must remain unmarried and celibate.
Consult your family and ask God for guidance before deciding to become ordained. If married, you must receive the consent of your wife to become ordained.;
, Seminary is a kind of preparatory school for Catholic priests. You can only attend seminary after obtaining a four-year college degree. In seminary, you’ll begin your work on a Master of Divinity (MDiv) or Master of Arts (MA) in Theology. You might also choose to obtain a doctorate in philosophy, theology, or canon law.This education will ready you to serve within the Church.


Before joining seminary, you must be screened by representatives of your local diocese to ensure you are mature enough to handle the commitment ordination entails. Your family history, spiritual life and understanding, health, and debt will be evaluated.Engage in a variety of spiritual activities such as mass, morning and evening prayers, and spiritual retreats.
Receiving pastoral formation -- the process in which you learn how to listen to people, offer advice, work with marginalized groups like the sick and poor, and act as a mentor to others -- is a crucial part of seminary.These are the skills you will need if you are to become a priest, deacon, or bishop and serve a Catholic congregation. Spend as much time as possible in seminary developing these pastoral skills.

, If you wish to become ordained, you must submit an application to your local diocesan dioconate office. Be sure to indicate on your application whether you’re applying to become a deacon, priest, or bishop. Talk to your local priest about submitting an application to be ordained. While different states and diocese have different processes, you can expect your application to require most of the following items:Four letters of reference, including one from your priest
A recent photo of you
Academic transcripts, including high school and college transcripts
Certificates proving your baptisms, first communion, confirmation, and parents’ marriage
A physical exam
A background check that examined your employment history, criminal record, and any previous entrance in seminary or ordination programs

, After your application is accepted, you will be ordained in a special ceremony recognizing your spiritual journey. You will be called to the pulpit stage by a deacon, then presented to a bishop, who will perform several sacralizing rites:


You will be given a verbal examination testing your knowledge of scripture and God.
You will then make a pledge of chastity and obedience to the Church, and lie prostrate on the floor before the bishop. The audience will then kneel and sing a religious hymn.
The most important part of the ordination is when the bishop lays his hands on your head. The laying-on of hands is performed in order to invoke the Holy Spirit -- one of the three aspects of God -- to make the ordained individual more holy and reserve him for the ministry.
Your hands will be anointed with oil. This stems from an Old Testament tradition that indicates your hands are prepared to serve the Church and its adherents by, for instance, offering the Eucharist and working to heal the sick.
The ceremony will end with you being presented with gifts by any family, friends, and spiritual mentors in attendance.Only a bishop can ordain a priest.The ordained individual will go forward to have a career in the church and a deeper connection with their faith.

Go before a board at your church.Being ordained begins with an evaluation of your spiritual life.,
Connect with a mentor.,
Attend seminary.Seminary is essentially a religious school where you learn all the skills needed to become a pastor.,
Conduct your internship.Part of your seminary work requires completing an internship at a charity, hospital, or chaplaincy.,
Engage in supplemental training.Your seminary will provide denomination-specific training so that you understand your community and denomination in greater depth.,
Write an ordination paper.Your ordination paper is like a final essay, and should include a statement of your faith and what you learned in seminary, as well as what you look forward to accomplishing during your time with the church.,
Become a probationary pastor.,
Face the ordination interviews.The ordination process varies somewhat depending on the specific denomination, but you’ll likely need to pass an oral examination where you’ll be tested on your knowledge of scripture.",How to Get Ordained2," Speak to your pastor about your interest in becoming ordained. If your pastor supports your goal, you will be brought before a local board at your church. This board or committee will ask you questions about your interest in becoming ordained.


You might be rejected if you express a mystical belief that God has chosen you to become ordained, if you suggest or imply that ordination would simply be a personal accomplishment, if you have few other professional options or have been unsuccessful in their professional life, or if you demonstrate an inadequate understanding about the purpose of ministry. You will also likely be rejected if you have a criminal history.
To be accepted as a candidate for ordination, express a willingness to serve the church and congregation, demonstrate that you are personable and have strong people skills, and show that you are willing to work hard.
Report back to the board periodically about progress you’ve made toward becoming ordained.
Be completely honest with your church committee.

, After passing the initial interview, the church might assign you a spiritual mentor -- an elder in the church or another person with strong faith -- to help guide you through the ordination process. If you are allowed to choose from a number of different potential mentors, select someone who you can communicate easily and honestly with who will keep you energized and focused throughout the ordination process., You will receive a Master of Divinity degree from a seminary accredited by the Association of Theological Schools. You could, alternately, obtain a Master of Arts in theology, though this is not preferred.


You do not need to attend a seminary explicitly associated with your denomination.
If you do not like your seminary, talk to your mentor and church committee about transferring to another seminary.

, You will engage in part-time work to gain practical experience as part of the clergy. In addition to the internship, a shorter period of internship called a practicum may be required. Check your seminary’s graduation requirements for specifics.

, You will also need to undertake sex-abuse training to identify and understand sexual abuse. Use training materials provided by the seminary to prepare for these tests.


You might also be given psychological and personality tests.

, You should also include some information about a specific topic or topics relevant to your ordination. For instance, you might write the main body of your ordination paper on a topic like “forgiveness in the Old Testament.”


The specific format of your ordination paper depends on the requirements of your seminary program.

, Some denominations like the United Methodists and Evangelicals have a probationary period for their pastors. You might need to rack up four years or more of ministry experience before you are properly ordained.During this trial period, find your own voice at the pulpit and gain more experience in helping, preaching, and providing inspiration to your community of believers.
Continue learning more about your role in the church and deepening your knowledge of the Bible through daily reading and reflection.

, You will also need to present personal references, some or all of which are from other pastors, deacons, or church elders. Talk to your mentor about the process in your church.

Familiarize yourself with Buddhist teachings and practice.The Buddhist teachings include the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, and the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment.,
Have a spiritual mentor.After learning a bit about Buddhism, dive deeper with a learned Buddhist.,
Take refuge and vows.Taking refuge refers to the act of formally professing before a member or members of the Buddhist clergy to place your faith in the Buddha, the Sangha (the Buddhist community), and the Dharma.,
Go on retreats.,
Join a monastic community.,
Undergo the ordination ceremony.Attain permission from the senior monk or abbot of your temple to become ordained.,
Contribute to the religious community.",How to Get Ordained3," Attend a Buddhist temple and improve your mediation technique.


Think carefully about Buddhist teachings and understand how they relate to your everyday experience.
Ordination within the Buddhist community is a challenging endeavor, and the vows are taken for life. If you’ve only read a few books on Buddhism and have a vague understanding of its teachings, you should not become ordained., In Buddhist tradition, it is important to have a teacher or guide to help you realize and understand the truths contained within Buddhist practice and law. Your spiritual guide will likely be another monk or nun, and they must be someone who can grant permission to ordain you.

, Five additional vows you must take include include commitments to remain free of lying, intoxication, stealing, inappropriate sexual behavior, and harming other living things.

, Going on spiritual retreats within the Buddhist community will give you a flavor of what life is like for a nun or monk.Talk to the nuns or monks you go on the retreat with, and begin practicing celibacy. You should also adopt the monk’s diet of vegetarianism during this time.


If you travel to Asia, you might be able to partake in a part-time ordination program where you can live as a monk or nun for a few days or weeks during the year.

, If you are ordained outside the Buddhist community where you intend to stay, you will be taken on as a guest monk at the monastery or convent. The monastic community will give you advice on Buddhist practice and evaluate your understanding of Buddhism. After about two to three months, your monastery or nunnery will decide to accept you., After getting the official monk’s robes, you’ll need to ask for the help of your fellow monks to shave your head.


When the ceremony begins, approach the senior monk and bow three times.
Hand over your official monk’s robes and recite a passage. The passage you recite will be decided by the senior monk or abbot, and come from the sayings of the Buddha.
After recitation of the passage, you will ask for the robes back in a formal way. You might also ask for a simple monk’s bowl. Then, make a formal request to be ordained. The specific content of this request will be explained by the abbot before the ceremony.
The abbot or senior monk will then administer the Three Refuges and Ten Precepts and give you your robes and/or bowl.

, After being ordained, you’ll be expected to join a monastery for at least five years. This might be the same monastery you were ordained at, or a different one. You might also choose to join a dharma center under the guidance of your mentor(s).When you join a monastery, you are forbidden from holding a “worldly job.” While basic amenities like food, clothing, and shelter are provided, you will need to work to obtain additional resources for your monastery. Many monks and nuns have the opportunity to offer their services to their dharma community in order to fulfill its needs. Talk to your abbot or spiritual mentor about opportunities within your monastery.

Choose your program.,
Complete the ordination form.,
Pay the required fee.,
Understand the limits of your online ordination.",How to Get Ordained4," There are many online ordination programs available. Each has its own philosophy and ideals. Look for a program that speaks to you and go forward with the ordination process.


The Temple of Earth (http://www.templeofearth.com/) emphasizes rationality, beauty, poetry, and humor as part of its manifesto.The Open Ministry (http://www.open-ministry.org/index.php) is non-denominational.
The Universal Life Church (http://www.ulc.org/become-a-minister/) upholds diversity and freedom in religion., The ordination forms vary from organization to organization, but they will all require certain pieces of basic information like your name, date of birth, address, email address and phone number, and gender. They might also ask for information about how you first heard about the program.Never provide your Social Security Number to an online ordination program.

, To receive your ordination certificate, you’ll usually need to pay a small fee with your credit card or PayPal account. Prices vary widely depending on the organization. While you might pay $75 for ordination within the Church of Spiritual Humanism, programs like the Open Ministry and Universal Life Church offer free ordinations. Compare prices of the various online ordination programs before settling on one.After paying required fee and filling out the necessary forms, wait two to three weeks to receive your ordination certificate in the mail.

, Being ordained online could be seen as questionable if you later decide you want to get ordained through a more official body, like a church or Buddhist temple.Some states, furthermore, forbid marriages officiated by individuals who were ordained through online ordination programs.Think carefully about whether online ordination is right for you before going through with it.


You might actually face a legal penalty or fine if you officiate a wedding after being ordained online.

If you're celebrating Advent as a family, do these readings when all family members are present. Make sure that each person has a copy of the reading and consider talking about the reading with everyone after reviewing it.
Consider using the following readings if you do not have a special Advent devotional:Week One: Isaiah 40:1-5 (Sunday), Isaiah 52:7-10 (Monday), Isaiah 40:9-11 (Tuesday), Genesis 3:8-15 (Wednesday), Genesis 15:1-6 (Thursday), Deuteronomy 18:15-19 (Friday), Psalm 89:1-4 (Saturday)
Week Two: Isaiah 11:1-10 (Sunday), Zechariah 6:12-13 (Monday), Micah 5:2-4 (Tuesday), Malachi 3:1-6 (Wednesday), John 1:1-8 (Thursday), John 1:9-18 (Friday), Mark 1:1-3 (Saturday)
Week Three: Luke 1:5-13 (Sunday), Luke 1:14-17 (Monday), Luke 1:18-25 (Tuesday), Luke 1:39-45 (Wednesday), Luke 1:46-56 (Thursday), Luke 1:57-66 (Friday), Luke 1:67-80 (Saturday)
Week Four: Isaiah 7:10-14 (Sunday), Luke 1:26-35 (Monday), Isaiah 9:2-7 (Tuesday), Matthew 1:18-25 (Wednesday), Luke 2:1-20 (Thursday), Matthew 2:1-2 (Friday), Luke 2:21-35 (Saturday)

;
, Set aside 10 to 20 minutes each day for special seasonal prayers. You can say your own prayers or recite a few written prayers specifically meant for Advent. Reflect on the words as you speak them.


Written prayers for Advent can be found online, in Advent devotionals, or in Catholic prayer books.
One simple prayer traditionally recited during Advent is the Saint Andrew Christmas Novena, which is prayed from the feast day of Saint Andrew (November 30) until Christmas Eve. The words of the prayer are:

""Hail and blessed be the hour and moment in which the Son of God was born of the most pure Virgin Mary, at midnight, in Bethlehem, in the piercing cold. In that hour vouchsafe, I beseech Thee, O my God, to hear my prayer and grant my desires through the merits of Our Savior Jesus Christ, and of His blessed Mother. Amen."", Even though Christmas carols are common during the Advent season, there are separate Advent hymns and carols meant for the season before Christmas. Sing these songs with your family, friends, and neighbors.Advent is a time of waiting, and Advent hymns reflect this tone more appropriately than Christmas carols.
One of the most well-known Advent hymns is O Come, O Come, Emmanuel. Additional Advent hymns can be found online or in liturgical missals, but a few other lesser known hymns include:

Ready the Way (of the Lord)
Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus
On Jordan's Bank the Baptist's Cry
Jerusalem, Lift Up Thy Voice
Creator of the Stars of Night



, Look for books about Advent and the meaning of Christmas and spend the Advent season reading through them. In doing so, you can help prepare your mind to celebrate Christmas in a more heartfelt manner.


If you have kids, consider finding children's books about the season. Wrap each book separately and arrange them in a basket. Before bed, instruct your kids to unwrap one book, then read that book instead of a standard bedtime story. Work through the books by reading one each night., If you're Roman Catholic, Advent is a good time to go to Confession.


Even though Advent is a season of joy, it's also a season of reflection and penitence. By reflecting on your wrongdoings, confessing your sins, and seeking to do penance for your sins, you can help prepare your soul for the coming of Christ.
If you aren't Catholic, you can still treat Advent as a time for personal one-on-one confession with God.

, The Advent wreath is probably the most commonly used symbol of Advent. Churches that celebrate Advent will probably have their own wreath, but you can have one at home, too.Four candles (three violet, one rose pink) are placed around a circular evergreen wreath. One candle is lit each Sunday. When doing an Advent wreath at home, the candles are usually lit during the evening meal or evening prayer.
It is also customary to read and reflect on a specific Advent reading after lighting each candle. The reading is usually based on the Western liturgical calendar.
Christ is represented by the light of the candles, and the evergreen wreath symbolizes the eternity of God.
The three violet candles symbolize prayer and penance. The rose candle is lit on the third Sunday and represents joy at the approaching birthday of Christ.

, Nativity scenes provide a visual representation of Christmas and the days surrounding it. You can add to the scene little by little throughout the season to help prepare for Christmas.


You can make your own scene or purchase one online or from most religious stores.
There are two common ways to set up the nativity scene for Advent:

Set up the entire thing at the beginning of Advent but leave the crib empty until Christmas Eve.
Set up the scene little by little. Move Mary and Joseph a little closer to the stable each night and add other pieces (animals, shepherds, etc.) one by one. Place the baby Jesus figurine in the crib on Christmas Eve.



, Advent calendars are popular amongst families with young kids. You should be able to purchase or make an Advent calendar, depending on your personal preference.


An Advent calendar helps the family count down to the birthday of baby Jesus.
The calendar has a separate compartment for each day of Advent. On each day, you open the compartment and take out the item that's inside. This item can vary; it can be a small treat or toy, or it can be a message of goodwill.

, The Jesse tree is separate from a traditional Christmas tree. It's both smaller and simpler, and it's used to illustrate the relationship between Jesus and His biblical ancestors.


Place a branch or wire tree in a vase or pot at the start of Advent. Each day, hang a new ornament on the Jesse tree to represent a different ancestor of Jesus. When hanging each ornament, read a passage about the ancestor that ornament represents., Display a small, empty wooden crib somewhere in your house and gradually add straw to it throughout Advent. As you add the straw, explain to any kids in your family that you are preparing the crib for the baby Jesus.


Members of the family should add a new piece of straw each time they perform a small sacrifice or kindness for someone else. Encourage the kids in your family to point out others' good deeds instead of their own.
By Christmas Eve, the crib should be filled with straw. You can place a small figure or doll, representative of the baby Jesus, in the crib at that time.

, You should strive to share the love of Christ with others throughout the entire year, but life can get busy and distracting, so it's easy to lose sight of this goal. Advent is a good time to re-focus your efforts by giving your time and/or material possessions to those who need it.


Try to be more mindful of other people during the season, including loved ones and strangers alike. Little acts of kindness can go a long way. Bake cookies for your neighbors or bring snacks for your co-workers. Hold the door open for the busy shopper whose arms are full or bring a cup of hot chocolate to the volunteer collecting donations for the needy outside of your grocery store. These acts of kindness don't need to be planned far in advance. When an opportunity to help arises, simply act on it.

, One way to help yourself spread the love and joy of Christ during the Advent season is to pick a special service project to participate in.


If you're looking for ways to celebrate Advent as an entire family, discuss a few different options with the family and pick one to work on together.
If you regularly attend church, talk to the pastor of your church and find out if there are any parish service events coming up. You can also suggest organizing a service event for the congregation if none are currently in place.
A few options worth considering include:

Give gifts to disadvantaged children
Donate food and clothing to those who need it
Volunteer at a soup kitchen, nursing home, or homeless shelter
Visit the sick in the hospital or in a nearby nursing home



, As each Christmas card arrives in the mail, place it near your Advent wreath or in another highly visible location. Go through the cards each night and use them as a reminder to pray for each sender.


A similar option is to make out 24 small prayer cards, each with the name of a separate relative, friend, stranger, or cause. Place these cards in your Advent calendar or in a small jar on your table, then draw a name each evening. Spend a few extra minutes praying for the name you draw each time.

, Make Sunday dinner a little more special than usual during the Sundays of Advent. If you have an Advent wreath, light that Sunday's candle at the start or end of this dinner.


You can either prepare a nice dinner or invite friends and family over for a large potluck. If you opt to invite friends over, make sure they know what to expect when they arrive and invite them to take part in your family's Advent prayers, candle lighting, and readings.

, The Advent angel practice is similar to the secret Santa tradition, but it has a spiritual emphasis instead of a material one.


Place the names of all family members into a hat and instruct everyone to blindly pick one of these names. Each person must keep the name he or she draws a secret.
You become the ""Advent angel"" of the person whose name you draw. Offer special prayers, small gifts, and special acts of kindness to that individual throughout Advent, keeping each act as secret as possible. Everyone can reveal whose Advent angel he or she was on Christmas.

Decide on your Lenten sacrifice.,
In addition to sacrificing something, include something special in your Lenten routine.,
Attend Mass as often as possible.,
Go to Reconciliation.,
Spend time on devotions.,
Take time for self-examination and reflection.,
Fast and abstain.,
Take something on.,
Have a seder meal.,
Promote a communal almsgiving project.,
Add purple adornments to your living space.,
Make a Lenten calendar.,
Eat lenten foods.,
Have a weekly sacrifice meal.,
Burn palms from last year's Palm Sunday.",How to Celebrate Lent," Lent is a season of solemnity and sacrifice commemorating Jesus' exodus into the desert; our sacrifice is a reminder of the sacrifice of self Jesus made to save us from our sins. Because of this, it is a Lenten tradition to sacrifice something for these 40 days.


Think about all the trivial things in your life that shift your focus away from God. Do you find that you dedicate more time to sending text messages and posting status updates than to prayer and time with God? Do you have a habit of eating junk food excessively? What is something your life could do without?






For the record, in 2014, Lent starts on March 5th, or Ash Wednesday, and ends on April 17th, or Holy Thursday. Easter is then that following Sunday.





;
, Giving up chocolate or Facebook for 40 days is great, but why not do something positive, too, instead of just removing the negative? Resolve to spend more time volunteering, with your family, pray more, or somehow get in touch with your faith.


Some families decide to set aside their spare change during these 40 days and do something with that money. Either donate it to the church or to a local charity, or spend it on goods for those in need. It's a nice touch to this season, focusing on those that don't have anything to sacrifice in the first place.







, In addition to weekly Sunday service, it's good to go to church frequently, especially during Lent. Lent begins on Ash Wednesday when we remember that we come from dust and to dust we shall return. Many traditions often have an additional worship service in mid-week, and attendance at these services is a good way to participate in Lent.


If you're going to choose a few extra times to go during this season, Ash Wednesday and Holy Thursday/Good Friday (or both) are your obvious choices.







, Reconciliation, or Confession, is a wonderful way to turn away from sin and reunite yourself with Christ. If you don't already, try getting into the habit of going to Confession on a regular basis. The Catholic Church has made it obligatory that all the faithful receive the sacrament of Penance at least once a year and once during the season of Lent, though it's recommended that you attend Confession at least once a month if possible.


Your church probably offers weekly confessional services, if not more during this time of year. If you're not sure when to go, pick up a local bulletin or just make a quick phone call! You can schedule private confessions as well.







, Though not required, devotions are a great way to put yourself in the right mindset for Lent. The Church highly encourages Adoration of God or the veneration of the Blessed Virgin and the saints. Your local parish probably has regular Eucharistic Adoration, where you can go to sit and engage in deep prayer, in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament. To practice veneration, you could say a decade of the Rosary daily, or pray to your patron saint.


Any prayer, so long as it means something to you, is a step in the direction God intended. If you have a prayer you've grown up with that speaks to you, resolve to spend more time focusing on what it truly means and how you can embody that prayer in your everyday life.







, Christmas and Easter are times of happiness and joy; while the preceding and succeeding seasons are cheery and bright, the same cannot be said about Lent. It is a time of simplicity and solemnity. It is a time to reflect on your dependence on God's mercy and your understanding of faith. Take moments during this time to think about how you embody Christ's message.


To top it all off, Lent, in most climes, is during winter -- when just a look out the window is a somber reminder of the tribulations Jesus went through for our happiness.







, All Catholics aged fourteen and older are asked to abstain from meat on Lenten Fridays, though fish is allowed to be eaten. Additionally, Catholics aged 18-59 are obliged to fast on Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, and all Lenten Fridays, meaning that only one full meal may be eaten in the day. Of course, do this however you feel is safe and effective.


Some people should definitely not fast (the pregnant or the elderly, for example). If fasting isn't a reasonable option for you, fast from something other than food. Make sure it's something that's a challenge -- like your phone or email -- so you can feel the sacrifice you're making.






Fasting is by and large becoming more voluntary than anything. Way back in 1966, Pope Paul VI made fasting only mandatory on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday -- everything else is at your discretion., While many people choose to give harmful things up for Lent, you could use the season to help you build good habits. You could promise to be more patient and kind toward your neighbor, or you could vow to help the needy. Whether you choose to sacrifice or to adopt new, strengthening habits, you should allow your Lenten promises to help you grow in faith and virtue.


In addition to bettering your own life, take this time to build habits that better the lives of others. Volunteer at a hospital or shelter, or simply get more active in your church by offering to greet, read, or take care of the offerings.







, Though some see it as largely a Jewish tradition, that is not the case! On Holy (or Maundy) Thursday, many Catholics have a seder meal, commemorating the Last Supper of Jesus -- the very last day of Lent. You eat the ""meal"" in silence, reflecting on your Lenten experiences with unleavened bread and wine (or grape juice). How has this Lent changed you?


If you'd like to get a little historical with it, try including matzah (unleavened bread), maror (horseradish root), egg, or haroset (apple, spice, and red wine mixture) as part of your meal. , Many communities choose to partake in something like Operation Rice Bowl during this season, offering help to those communities that are in need. It's possible your Church already has something like this going on -- but if not, start the ball rolling yourself! This is the perfect time to focus on bettering the world, just as Jesus did.


Any charity in the area can be the basis of your project. All you need to do is get your parish on board. Talk to your priest and see if he can help urge the masses to get behind a good cause.







, The color of Lent is purple - a quick stroll by any church will make that abundantly clear. Add a few touches of deep, royal purple into your home to remind you that these 40 days are quite meaningful.


But do keep it simple -- Lent is hardly a time for overabundance. A few purple candles, a purple table runner -- nothing too gaudy, eye-catching, or unnecessary. It's a time of reserve and preparation for growth. Save the excess for Easter!







, Such a calendar will help you to focus on the progression of the Lenten season and is a neat reminder to see the days ticking away, getting closer and closer to Jesus' resurrection. Lent is 40 days long and doesn't include Sundays. It ends the Friday before Easter (the last day being Holy Thursday); count backwards from there.


Hang the calendar in a common area in your home. Every day, tick off a box. As you get closer and closer to Easter, how do you find yourself feeling? Are your sacrifices becoming more or less difficult to maintain?







, As with any tradition, there is always food involved. Here are a couple ideas to commemorate this season:



Make hot cross buns. These are usually reserved for Good Friday -- but you've got to make them in advance!







Make soft, homemade pretzels. The shape symbolizes arms crossed in prayer.Of course, you could always prepare food for needy families or those at the local shelter.

, In addition to fasting on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, have a ""sacrifice meal"" once each week. A simple bowl of rice and glass of milk instead of your family's traditional spread. Limiting yourself to this will remind you of what's normal for you -- highlighting that it isn't normal for others. The things we so easily forget!


Again, only partake in diet restrictions if it's advisable for you. If you're not sure, it's wise to consult a doctor beforehand. Jesus doesn't want you sacrificing your health!







, At the start of Lent, Ash Wednesday, burn the palms you have from last year's Palm Sunday. Keep them in a bowl at your dining room table (or wherever they could serve as a reminder) to reflect on Jesus' life and death. As you eat each meal, you'll feel a natural urge of gratitude for the splendor that you have.

Gather and consecrate your salt.,
Read aloud Psalm 103.,
Obtain natural water.,
Take your holy salt and sprinkle it into the water.,
Recite prayers used by Catholic priests.,
Exorcise the water.,
Conclude the ritual.,
Use your holy water.",How to Make Your Own Holy Water2," You need to create Holy Salt before you can create Holy Water, so consecrate the salt first. And for the record, the salt is mainly used as a preservative. Just because it's holy doesn't mean it'll keep forever! Here's the benediction of the salt:


“The Blessing of the Father Almighty be upon this Creature of Salt, and let all malignity and hindrance be cast forth hence from, and let all good enter herein, for without Thee man cannot live, wherefore I bless thee and invoke thee, that thou mayest aid me.” – Key of Solomon the King Book II Chapter 5

, If you don't have a Bible handy, why, that's what wikiHow is here for!


Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies; Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children; To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them. The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. Bless the Lord, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the Lord, O my soul., If you can, get your water from a nearby lake, stream, or river. Try to stay away from tap water since it may have chlorine and fluoride in it. However, if your water is obtained natural, filter it beforehand -- you don't want dirty holy water!

, While doing so, repeat the following words from the Key of Solomon the King, Book II, Chapter 5:


“I exorcise thee, O Creature of Water, by Him Who hath created thee and gathered thee together into one place so that the dry land appeared, that thou uncover all the deceits of the Enemy, and that thou cast out from thee all the impurities and uncleanness of the Spirits of the World of Phantasm, so they may harm me not, through the virtue of God Almighty Who liveth and reigneth unto the Ages of the Ages. Amen.”

, You have two options to choose from:


Prayer #1: Our help is in the name of the Lord. Who made heaven and earth. God's creature, salt, I cast out the demon from you by the living God, by the true God, by the holy God, by God who ordered you to be thrown into the water-spring by Eliseus to heal it of its barrenness. May you be a purified salt, a means of health for those who believe, a medicine for body and soul for all who make use of you. May all evil fancies of the foul fiend, his malice and cunning, be driven afar from the place where you are sprinkled. And let every unclean spirit be repulsed by Him who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire. Amen.
Prayer #2: Almighty everlasting God, we humbly appeal to your mercy and goodness to graciously bless this creature, salt, which you have given for mankind's use. May all who use it find in it a remedy for body and mind. And may everything that it touches or sprinkles be freed from uncleanness and any influence of the evil spirit; through Christ our Lord. Amen.

, More words! Now, to purify the water and cleanse it of demons and impurities (so yes, it is a form of exorcism):


God's creature, water, I cast out the demon from you in the name of God the Father almighty, in the name of Jesus Christ, His Son, our Lord, and in the power of the Holy Spirit. May you be a purified water, empowered to drive afar all power of the enemy, in fact, to root out and banish the enemy himself, along with his fallen angels. We ask this through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire.

, While adding the final amounts of salt into the water say: May this salt and water be mixed together; in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Once you've combined a few teaspoons of the holy salt into the water and it has dissolved entirely, the ritual is concluded with another prayer. Again, you have three options:


Prayer #1: O God, who for man's welfare established the most wonderful mysteries in the substance of water, hearken to our prayer, and pour forth your blessing on this element now being prepared with various purifying rites. May this creature of yours, when used in your mysteries and endowed with your grace, serve to cast out demons and to banish disease. May everything that this water sprinkles in the homes and gatherings of the faithful be delivered from all that is unclean and hurtful; let no breath of contagion hover there, no taint of corruption; let all the wiles of the lurking enemy come to nothing. By the sprinkling of this water may everything opposed to the safety and peace of the occupants of these homes be banished, so that in calling on your holy name they may know the well-being they desire, and be protected from every peril; through Christ our Lord. Amen.
Prayer #2: God, source of irresistible might and king of an invincible realm, the ever-glorious conqueror; who restrain the force of the adversary, silencing the uproar of his rage, and valiantly subduing his wickedness; in awe and humility we beg you, Lord, to regard with favor this creature thing of salt and water, to let the light of your kindness shine upon it, and to hallow it with the dew of your mercy; so that wherever it is sprinkled and your holy name is invoked, every assault of the unclean spirit may be baffled, and all dread of the serpent's venom be cast out. To us who entreat your mercy grant that the Holy Spirit may be with us wherever we may be; through Christ our Lord. Amen.
Prayer #3: God, Who for the salvation of the human race has built your greatest mysteries upon this substance, in your kindness hear our prayers and pour down the power of your blessing into this element, prepared by many purifications. May this your creation be a vessel of divine grace to dispel demons and sicknesses, so that everything that it is sprinkled on in the homes and buildings of the faithful will be rid of all unclean and harmful things. Let no pestilent spirit, no corrupting atmosphere, remain in those places: may all the schemes of the hidden enemy be dispelled. Let whatever might trouble the safety and peace of those who live here be put to flight by this water, so that health, gotten by calling Your holy name, may be made secure against all attacks. Through the Lord, Amen.

, However, if your holy water is for a specific purpose, consider adding a few touches. Baptismal holy water has a touch of chrism added (holy oil), while Gregorian water has small amounts of ash, wine, and salt (used to consecrate churches).


If you want some serious holy water, most Churches give out some on Easter.

Choose your type of water.,
Drop a piece of silver into the bowl.,
Begin reciting your sacred charms.,
Add herbs.",How to Make Your Own Holy Water3," Different types of water are associated with different rituals. Morning dew is used for healing and beauty, spring water for blessing and cleansing, rainwater for fertility and abundance, and sea water for exorcism. Which kind do you want to use?


Collect and store the water in a non-metal container. If you'd like, leave it out to absorb sunlight, moonlight, or starlight.

, As long as it's silver, you're good. It could be a coin, a ring, a bead, or any silver object. The metal silver, not the color! Leave it in the bowl until the ritual is complete.

, They should be spoken monotonously and steadily, like a chant. Choose the one that most matches your intentions:



Water and earth / Where you are cast /No spell or adverse purpose last / Not in complete accord with me / As my word, so mote it be!

This charm is used for cleansing and purification.



Hale fair washing to thee / Hale washing of the Fians be thine / Health to thee, health to him / But not to thy female enemy

This charm is used for newborns (of Gaelic origin).



God bless your eye / A drop of wine about your heart /The mouse is in the bush / And the bush is on fire

This charm is used for averting negativity (also of Gaelic origin).



, You can either finish here or continue on, depending on how you intend to use the holy water. Add herbs like St. John's Wort to bless a house or sick person, Leaves of Vervain before a ceremony, or stir it with the twig of a sacred tree or add rose petals to unite the object with the Earth. It's up to you!


Holy water has a variety of purposes. A person can drink it to protect them from evil or illness, or it can be bestowed on an object (a house, even a piece of furniture) for cleansing.

Pick out supplies.,
Sort the beads.,
Prepare the cord.",How to Make a Rosary1," A rosary is composed of a crucifix, 53 beads of one color to represent Hail Mary prayers, and 6 beads of another color to represent Our Father prayers. The crucifix and beads are strung in a pattern on sturdy string or thread.


Religious supply stores sell small crucifixes that are suitable for making rosaries. They also commonly sell beads you can use to represent the Hail Mary and Our Father prayers.
Waxed nylon cord is commonly used for making rosaries. Be sure to pick out cord that fits through the centers of the beads you have chosen. The beads should fit the cord easily, but they should not be loose. You'll need about 3 feet (1 meter). ;
, Rosaries are divided into five ""decades,"" sections that contain ten beads each, as well as a smaller section with three more beads. Divide the Hail Mary beads into five groups of ten and one group of three. Place the Our Father beads in a separate pile.

, Use a ruler and an ink pen to mark the cord with a dot about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the end. Tie a knot over the dot to begin the rosary. The knot should be large enough to prevent beads from slipping over it to the other side of the cord.

Understand that Catholicism differs from other denominations in practice and belief.,
Come a few minutes early.,
You may see genuflecting (bending on the right knee), or bowing if their knees are bad, in the direction of the altar (the table up front).,
Feel free to sit anywhere in the pews.,
Look for a board somewhere towards the front that has numbers on it.,
In the pews in front of you, you might see several books.,
Once the Mass starts, breathe, sit back, and enjoy; this is not a stressful process.,
At one point, the priest usually says, “Let us offer one another a sign of God’s peace.” A typical sign of peace is a light handshake accompanied by the phrase “Peace be with you”.,
Prepare for Communion.,
Appreciate the beauty of the church.,
Feel free to take a bulletin to read later, and to greet the priest after Mass.",How to Visit a Catholic Mass," The service usually contains these things:

Two or three readings from the Bible: one or two from the Old Testament and/or from the Epistles (letters of Saint Paul the Apostle), and a passage from the Gospels (stories of Jesus' life). A Responsorial Psalm may also be said or sung in between the first and second reading (Sundays and feast days), or the first reading and Gospel (weekdays and Saturdays Masses that are not anticipatory).






Reception of Holy Eucharist






Singing of up to four hymns, if a sung Mass






Sometimes, some parts or hymns will be in Latin.






A sermon, which is sometimes called the Homily





;
, You will feel so much more comfortable if you can park (or better yet, walk) and enter the church five minutes early. Walk in through the main doors, and if you see people picking up a hymnal or leaflet, do the same.

, If you are not Catholic, do not feel awkward about not doing this. Catholics believe God is literally present in the Eucharist, which is kept in the tabernacle, a special cabinet or box that is often placed behind the altar. Genuflecting is simply a sign of deep respect for God and the Eucharist.

, Consider sitting closer to the front, so that you can see what is going on, and also toward one of the sides of the aisles. If you are taking notes (for class for example), you might be more comfortable sitting towards the side.

, These numbers refer to the hymn numbers in your hymnal. Feel free to join in with the singing; chances are, the church needs your voice.

, There are usually two types of books you will find: hymnals and Missals. Hymnals are somewhat self-explanatory: turn to the right number and sing along. Missals, coming from the word “Mass"", contain the ""Ordinary"" or order of the Mass (i.e., what things are said and in what order, for every Mass no matter where you are) and the propers for the day (readings, prayers, etc. that are specific to that day).

, All are welcome to kneel, stand, sit, or bow when the congregation does so, but do not feel pressure to do any of these. It is respectful to kneel at the consecration as God is physically entering the room (you would use the respectful gestures for a king or queen, so do the same for the King of the Universe). It is recommended, however, to stand when the congregation stands and sit when they are either sitting or kneeling, to avoid looking out of place.

, In some countries such as in Asia, a bow or nod is more acceptable form of greeting, as handshaking is not customary during Mass. Handshaking is also discouraged when there is an epidemic.

, Communion can be stressful unless you have a plan. Only regularly practicing Catholics who are free of mortal sin may receive Communion. Feel free to simply stay in the pew, but be sure to let communicants pass. If the pews are very narrow, just go to the aisle (hence the recommendation to sit towards the outside pews in your first couple times) and let people through until everyone is back in the pews after Communion.

, After Mass, feel free to look at any of the beautiful statues, paintings, and other artwork inside. These statues and icons are not idols, and Catholics do not pray directly to these. They are instead there to aid people in focusing their prayers to God, or ask a saint for prayers to God. These images and other symbols, which might appear mysterious or even bizarre to first-time visitors, aid Catholics in understanding their faith better. Some Catholics might touch these icons while praying or as sign of reverence, and then make the Sign of the Cross.

, Most priests are very friendly and will be glad to shake hands and talk.

Become Catholic if you are not already.,
Receive a welcome into the church.,
Accept Communion in a state of grace.,
Believe in the doctrine of transubstantiation.,
Participate in the Eucharistic fast.,
Ensure you are not under ecclesiastic censure.,
Go to Mass.,
Approach the altar.,
Receive the host.,
Receive the blood.,
Walk back to your seat and kneel.",How to Take Communion in the Catholic Church," You must be of the Catholic faith to take Communion. Baptized children go through the process in Sunday school, but if you are an adult you will take group classes, called RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults), and go through the process of Reconciliation, first Communion, and Confirmation to convert to Catholicism., Each church has its own welcoming ritual. Speak to the priest or another church leader to learn about the welcoming process. You must be formally received by the church before you can take Communion.If you are a practicing Catholic who simply changed churches, the priest may wish to speak with you to see if you have been baptized, go to Confession, and have received your first Communion and Confirmation. If you haven’t taken these steps, you may be asked to do so., The Eucharist may not be received while a person has mortal sin in their soul. If you have committed a mortal sin, such as theft, adultery, or sodomy, you must go to Reconciliation and repent before receiving Communion., You must believe in transubstantiation, which means that the bread and wine are actually transformed into the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ. The offerings only appear as bread and wine, but are believed to actually be parts of Christ himself., This means you cannot eat or drink anything for at least one hour before taking Communion. Water and medicine are excluded from the fast. Those who are elderly or ill can be excused from fasting, with the priest’s permission., Those who are under ecclesiastic censure, meaning they have been excommunicated from the church or continually commit grave sins, cannot receive Communion., You will take Communion during Mass. Prepare yourself mentally during the Consecration of the Eucharist (when the host is changed into the body and blood of Christ) to participate in Communion. You can do this by giving your thanks, appreciation, and reverence to Jesus Christ through prayer., The priests and altar servers will prepare to give Communion by taking their customary places. Wait for the usher to guide your row to walk up. When leaving the pew there is no need to genuflect (to kneel and cross oneself). Wait in line and do not skip people.

, Depending on the church and your personal preference, you can either have the host fed to you or handed to you. In the Traditional Rite, the host is fed to you. Open your mouth and extend your tongue so that the host does not fall. The host will be placed on your tongue. Close your mouth and allow the host to dissolve on your tongue while thinking of the sacrifice made.If you wish to have the host handed to you, hold out your hands, left on top of right. Do not take the host from the priest, but rather allow them to place it in your hand.
When you receive the host, the priest will say ""the Body of Christ,"" and you should respond ""Amen.""

, After receiving the host, you will receive the blood. Allow the host to dissolve while you are waiting your turn. Take a small drink from the chalice that is offered to you. The person offering the cup will say “the Blood of Christ,” and you should respond ""Amen.""The lip of the chalice is wiped off after each member receives the blood, so do not worry about the transmission of germs.

, This is a time to reflect and thank Jesus for coming to you in the Holy Eucharist. Return to your pew and pray, until the priest is finished offering the Blessed Sacrament. Follow the lead of more established church members if you are unsure what to do."

Begin by holding the crucifix in your fingers while making the Sign of the Cross.,
Say the Apostle's Creed.,
Move to the first bead after the crucifix and say the Lord's Prayer.,

Reflect on the Five Sorrowful Mysteries on Tuesday, Friday, and Sundays during Lent.,
Reflect on the Five Glorious Mysteries on Wednesdays and Sundays in Ordinary Time.,
Reflect on the Five Luminous Mysteries on Thursdays.",How to Say the Rosary," The rosary is said by traveling around the loop of beads, stopping at each one, and saying a prayer. Typically, if someone is going to say the whole rosary, rather than just a section of it, s/he starts with the crucifix at the ""bottom""., This prayer is a statement of Christian belief, one that essentially summarizes the things that all Christians believe, including the existence of God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and the Resurrection.


The words of the Apostles' Creed are: ""I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord: Who was conceived by power of the Holy Spirit, born of the Blessed Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.""

When Protestants say the Apostle's Creed, they usually change the meaning of the word ""Catholic"" in the line ""I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints..."" to reflect the concept of universality, rather than the actual earthly institution of the Roman Catholic church.

, Take the next bead in your fingers and say the Lord's prayer (also called the ""Our Father""). This prayer was passed directly from Jesus to his disciples as a way of expressing devotion to God in heaven.The words of the Our Father are: ""Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.""


, Next, say one Hail Mary for each of the next three beads, taking each bead in your fingers as you begin each prayer in succession. Traditionally, among Catholics, these 3 Hail Marys are offered to obtain an increase in the virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity and for the intentions of the Pope.


The words of the Hail Mary are: ""Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.""

Some Protestants are hesitant to say the Hail Mary because it is offered to Mary, rather than God or Jesus. Though it's up to you to decide whether you want to say the Hail Mary or not, the many arguments put forth by members of the Catholic Churchand various Protestant churchesregarding the prayer's biblical basis may help you come to a decision.

If you're reluctant to say the Hail Mary, know that some Protestant churches have their own versions of the rosary that omit this prayer.



, The Doxology (also called the ""Glory Be to the Father"" or ""Gloria Patri"") is a short hymn of praise exulting God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.


The words of the Doxology are: ""Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, will be for ever. Amen.""

Often, if the Holy rosary is made from string, rather than chain, the Doxology will be marked with a thick or knotted section.

, This bead, which is usually a large and/or decorative medallion, marks the beginning of the first ""decade"" of the Holy rosary. The Holy rosary is divided into five decades, each composed of ten Hail Marys and separated from each other by Our Fathers.

, After the central bead, move counter-clockwise to the first group of ten beads. Say one Hail Mary for each bead in the decade, moving along the length of beads as you go.


Note that many people say a single decade of the Holy rosary as a ""short version"" of the Holy rosary when they don't have time to say the entire Holy rosary.

, Optionally, you can also add the Fátima Prayer or/and the prayer for priests at this point; this is done without moving along the beads.


The words of the Fátima Prayer are: ""O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell. Lead all souls to heaven, especially those in most need of Thy mercy.""

The words of the prayer for priests are: ""O Jesus, our great High Priest, hear my humble prayers on behalf of your priests. Give them a deep faith, a bright and firm hope and a burning love which will ever increase in the course of their priestly life. In their loneliness, comfort them. In their sorrows, strengthen them. In their frustrations, point out to them that it is through suffering that the soul is purified, and show them that they are needed by the Church; they are needed by souls; they are needed for the work of redemption.""


, You have successfully completed the first decade of the Holy rosary. Now, continue along the Holy rosary's beads, following the pattern of the first decade for each subsequent decade - one Our Father for the first bead, followed by a Hail Mary for each of the following ten beads, followed by a Doxology. Work your way along the rosary in this fashion until you have gone all the way around the chain of beads and are back at the large central bead.

, The Salve Regina is a hymn extolling the Blessed Virgin Mary similar to the Hail Mary. When you finish, make the Sign of the Cross to finish the Holy Rosary. Congratulations - you're done!


The words of the ""Salve Regina"" Hail Holy Queen or are: ""Hail Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this vale of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary! Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.""

Catholic tradition dictates that, if you like, you may add any prayers at the end of the Holy rosary that you like. These can be ""official"" prayers like the Our Father and Apostle's Creed or personal, improvised prayers from the heart.

, The Holy rosary is not just a prayer tool - it's also a way to reflect on important events in the lives of Jesus and Mary. Many serious Catholics choose to do so by reflecting on certain sets of mysteries as they pray the Holy rosary. Each set contains five mysteries grouped according to certain emotional themes. Individual mysteries are events in the life of Jesus and/or Mary that are taken from the Bible. Each mystery is associated with a certain religious virtue or ""spiritual fruit"" (e.g. charity, patience, etc.). By reflecting on these mysteries, someone who prays the Holy rosary can work to strengthen his or her personal relationship with Jesus and and Mary, meditating on each event and the spiritual fruit associated with it. Note that not everyone who says the rosary chooses to do this, but anyone can.


There are currently four sets of mysteries. The fourth mystery was added by Pope John Paul II in 2002; the others are centuries old.The sets of mysteries are:

The Joyful Mysteries
The Sorrowful Mysteries
The Glorious Mysteries
The Luminous Mysteries (added by Pope Saint John Paul II in 2002)



, To say the rosary in observance of one of the sets of mysteries, the person saying the rosary proceeds as normal from the crucifix through the first few beads. When s/he reaches the first decade, s/he meditates on the first mystery as s/he prays the Our Father, the ten Hail Marys, and so on. Upon reaching the second decade, s/he meditates on the second mystery as s/he prays. The person saying the rosary proceeds through the rosary in this fashion, reflecting on a different mystery for each decade. Each set of mysteries contains five mysteries - one for each decade of the rosary.


Traditionally, a person reflects on a different set of mysteries for each day of the week. Below are more detailed instructions for each set.

, The Joyful Mysteries are happy events in the lives of Jesus and Mary. These events occur fairly early in their respective stories - two even take place before the birth of Jesus. The Joyful Mysteries and the spiritual fruits associated with each are listed below:


The Annunciation: Humility
The Visitation: Charity
The Birth of Our Lord: Poverty, or Detachment from the world
The Presentation of Our Lord: Purity of heart; Obedience
The Finding of Our Lord in the Temple: Piety

, The Sorrowful Mysteries are sad events in the lives of Jesus and Mary (especially Jesus). These events are centered around the death of Christ by crucifixion. The Sorrowful Mysteries and the spiritual fruits associated with each are listed below:


The Agony in the Garden: Contrition for our sins
The Scourging at the Pillar: Mortification of our senses
The Crowning with Thorns: Interior mortification
The Carrying of the Cross: Patience under crosses
The Crucifixion and Death of Our Lord: That we may die to ourselves

, The Glorious Mysteries are events associate with the resurrection of Christ and the entry of Jesus and his mother into heaven. The Glorious Mysteries and the spiritual fruits associated with each are listed below:


The Resurrection: Conversion of heart
The Ascension: A desire for heaven
The Coming of the Holy Ghost: The Gifts of the Holy Ghost
The Assumption of our Blessed Mother into Heaven: Devotion to Mary
The Coronation of our Blessed Mother: Eternal happiness

, The Luminous Mysteries are the most-recently created mysteries, having been added to Catholic tradition in 2002. These mysteries are events from Jesus' adult life and ministry. Unlike the other sets of mysteries, the Luminous Mysteries are not necessarily close to each other chronologically - while, for instance, the Sorrowful Mysteries all take place in sequence during a single short period, the Luminous Mysteries do not. The Luminous Mysteries and the spiritual fruits associated with each are listed below:


The Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan: Openness to the Holy Spirit, the Healer.
The Wedding at Cana: To Jesus through Mary. The understanding of the ability to manifest-through faith.
Jesus' Proclamation of the Kingdom of God: Trust in God (Call of Conversion to Messiah)
The Transfiguration: Desire for Holiness
The Institution of the Eucharist: Adoration

String 10 Hail Mary beads on the long end of the cord.,
String an Our Father bead after the second knot.,
Continue stringing 4 more decades.",How to Make a Rosary2," Make sure they stack up on the long end of the knot, and that there's no chance they'll be able to slip over to the other side. Tie a second knot at the end of the string of beads.


Leave a little space for the beads to slide, but not too much. When the rosary is used, the person using it should be able to slide the beads down slightly once each prayer is complete.
If you need help tying a knot in a certain place, try this trick: make a loose knot over the spot where you want to tighten it. Place a toothpick on the cord in the spot where the knot should go, then pull it tight and remove the toothpick., This bead should be a different color from the ten Hail Mary beads you have already strung. Tie another knot directly after the Our Father bead.

, After tying a knot after the first Our Father bead, string 10 more Hail Mary beads. Tie a knot, string an our Father bead, tie another knot, and string 10 more Hail Mary beads. Continue until you've strung all 5 decades with the exception of the final Our Father bead. Finish with a knot after the last set of 10 Hail Mary beads.

If your beads are large enough to slip over both tails, you may keep both strings intact.
If your beads are too small to slip over both tails, trim the shorter tail with a pair of scissors. Use a dab of clear nail polish or glue to keep the last knot secure as you continue.

, Tie a knot directly after it.

, Tie another knot to keep these beads in place.

, Secure it tightly by adding a double knot after you've strung it on the rosary. Use more clear nail polish or adhesive to make sure the knot stays in place. Clip the loose thread hanging off the knot.

, It is customary to have a priest bless the rosary before you use it to pray. Take the rosary to your parish and ask the priest to say a blessing, then use the rosary or give it away.

Find out when confession is held.,
Be truly sorry for your sins.,
Make an examination of conscience.,
Search the Holy Scriptures.,
Pray often before a Confession.",How to Make a Good Confession in the Catholic Church1," Most parishes offer reconciliation services by the week, but some churches may have them daily. If your parish does not offer a service that fits your schedule, call your priest and you can make a private appointment.


You can schedule a private session with the priest if you think your confession may last a bit longer (over 15 minutes). This is a good idea if you have left the Church, committed a grave sin, or have not confessed in a long time.;
, The idea of penance and confession is to feel truly remorseful -- the act of contrition. You must clearly reject the sin you have committed and resolve not to commit it again. To show God that your sorrow is genuine and authentic is to be truly sorry and profess a refusal to commit the behaviors again.


This does not mean that you can never sin again; we humans do it every day. You are simply resolving to try to avoid the near occasions that lead you to sin -- this still counts as repentance. If you want it, God will help you resist temptation, as long as you have the intention to improve yourself as well., Think about what you have done wrong, and why it is wrong. Consider the pain you put God through in committing that sin, and that because of that sin Jesus suffered all the more on the cross. For this you should express sorrow, and being truly sorry is a necessary component of a good Confession.


Consider asking yourself these questions when making your examination of conscience:

When did I last go to confession? Was it an honest and thorough confession?
Did I make any special promise to God last time? Did I keep my promise?
Have I committed any grave or mortal sin since my last confession?
Have I followed the Ten Commandments?
Have I ever doubted my faith?



, A good place to start is the 10 Commandments in Exodus 20:1-17 or Deuteronomy 5:6-21. Here are a few reminders of how God reaches out to us in loving forgiveness:



""If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."" 1 John 1:9.
How has it been made possible for sins to be forgiven? ""If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins."" 1 John 2:1,2.
To whom should sins be confessed, and why? ""Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in Thy sight."" Ps. 51:4.

See Genesis 39:9.



, You want to be honest and repentant. Say a prayer to the Holy Spirit to guide you and help you remember and feel true contrition for your sins. Perhaps something like: ""Come Holy Spirit, enlighten my mind that I may clearly know my sins, touch my heart that I may be sorry for them, and better my life. Amen.""


Try to identify the causes of your sins: Do you have questionable inclinations? Is it a matter of personal weakness? Or just bad habits? Try to eliminate at least one of these causes. This'll be easiest to do by either getting rid of one negative thing in your life or honing in on the most positive."

Wait your turn until you can enter the confessional.,
Begin your confession.",How to Make a Good Confession in the Catholic Church2," When it's time, choose either a face-to-face confession or an anonymous confession. If you would prefer to remain anonymous, simply kneel down in front of the curtain separating you from the priest and the priest will begin the confession. If you'd like a face-to-face confession, you need only to walk around the curtain and sit in the chair opposite the priest. He'll be expecting you.


Remember that confessions are absolutely confidential -- the priest will never (and can never) share your sins with anyone else. He is instructed to keep the seal of the confessional regardless of circumstance -- even under pain of death. Do not let your worries affect your confession.

, The priest will begin the Confession with the prayer of the Sign of the Cross. Follow his lead. There are a few variants, but the Latin Rite is the most common.



In the Latin Rite: Make the sign of the cross, saying, ""Bless me, Father, for I have sinned"" and tell him how long it has been since your last confession.(It is not necessary to remember how many times, only the the frequency of important sins.)

In the Byzantine Rite: Kneel facing the Icon of Christ, the priest will be seated at your side and may place his epitrachelion on your head. He may also wait to do this until the Prayer of Absolution. Do not be concerned either way.

In other Eastern Churches: Forms may vary.
Regardless of the variant, tell him your sins (including how many times you committed them). Go in order from the most serious to the least. Do not leave out any mortal sins that you can remember. You don't have to go into explicit detail of your sins unless the priest feels it is necessary -- and in that situation, he'll ask.

"
"
Listen to the priest.,
Complete your penance.,
Leave feeling better and living in the light of God's forgiveness.",How to Make a Good Confession in the Catholic Church3," He will often offer you counsel on how you can avoid sin in the future. Afterward, he will ask you to make an Act of Contrition. This must be performed sincerely, truly meaning what you say. If you don't know the words, write them down or ask the priest to help you.


At the end of your session, he will probably recommend penance (to be performed as soon as possible). At the end of the absolution he will say, “I absolve you of your sins in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.”If he makes the Sign of the Cross, follow suit. He will then dismiss you, saying something to the effect of “Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.” Reply, “Thanks be to God,” give the priest a smile, and exit the confessional.

, Return to the church and assume your prior seat. When you begin your penance, give thanks to God for forgiving you. If you recall some serious sin you forgot to tell, know that it has been forgiven with the others, but be sure to confess it in your next confession.


If the priest gave you penance that consists of some prayers to be recited, say them quietly and devoutly. Kneel in the pew, hands clasped and head down, until you have completed your penance and have adequately reflected on your experience. Resolve to return to the Sacrament of Reconciliation often.

, Rise joyful and confident for the Lord loves you and has been merciful. Live for Him every minute of your life, and let everybody see how wonderful it is serving the Lord.


Stay mindful. Don't use confession as a reason to excuse sins. Rejoice that you are forgiven and live as God intended you to to minimize the need for confession.

",How to Understand and Interpret the Bible," You should be able to consult someone with experience in exegesis (clear explanation or searching interpretation) of the Bible to help you. For example, a pastor, a youth minister or deacon in your church; a rabbi or a rabbinic scholar-in-residence in your community. When discussing the Bible with your mentor or teacher, remember that his or her interpretation may not be complete. Resolve and document which mode of interpretation he or she may be employing.;
, You decide how much time you wish to invest.


Understanding and interpreting the Bible is a life-time journey. It will start by offering a sincere prayer to the heavenly Father, and ask Him what topic you want to know more about, being specific in the words you say. This will help you to get a testimony and help you develop the Christlike attribute to distinguish things spiritually.
Accept that you can catch some ideas skimming the surface of the reading, but there are lots of other understandings at deeper levels, by cross references to related scriptures.
Reading and understanding the Bible may be a form of prayer and devotion. The intensity with which one studies the Bible is a communication to the Author of the intensity and sincerity of prayers and the intensity and sincerity of revelation and answers one expects from the Author.
You may delve into the original languages and even archaeological comparisons of the Bible sometime in your life.
Gems in scriptures that you dig from the Bible are valuable inheritances to be passed on from one generation to the next. The intensity to invest in understanding the Bible limits the value of the inheritance. The limits and capacity to be a mentor is defined by the investment you're willing to make.
The authority of the Bible stands on its own and explains itself through revelation but to dive deeper in for the answers, prayer is needed to have the confirmation of the holy ghost that what you are learning are true principles of the gospel.
Read, ponder and pray to get the spiritual confirmation that your interpretation is true, remembering the writings in the Bible are not to be ""private interpretation"" (for you alone).
You may choose to limit your understanding of the Bible to your language.
The Bible is like a telephone directory where one may expect a complete interpretation in whatever passage you happen to lay eyes. (This attitude may be known as employing ""hit and run"" or guerrilla tactics towards understanding the Bible; try comparing related scriptures.)
Though the Divine Author of the Bible is very enthusiastic in making revelation to us, don't expect all the gems of a passage to be immediately clear and gathered by a quick reading of a passage in the English language.
Ones understanding of the Bible would not be the same yesterday, today and forever, but you can be inspired to be a preacher, prophet, or to teach under authority of the church, based on the scriptural Gospel.

, An example of goal planning is:


One year from now - complete reading the whole Bible in English collecting as many surface flotsam as possible, following the same routine: read, ponder and prayer to consider whether it's true or not.
2nd year - study many of the cross-reference relationships that are established by renowned scholars plus a little of my own cross-references.
3rd year - start an archaeological comparison.
5th year - start studying Greek or Latin in the Bible.
10th year - start on the Bible in Hebrew and Aramaic.

,, Or, read and study the Bible on your own throughout the year according to a weekly calendar:



Follow an established calendar which assigns portions to each week of the year. For example, Orthodox Jews follow a one year cycle. Whereas, Reform and Conservative Jews follow a three year cycle. A calendar available to Christians is one planned by ""The Daily Bread"". Search the web for the key phrase ""Bible reading calendars"".

Devise and plan a calendar and time frame suitable for your personal goals. An effective way is to emulate the Jewish Bible reading calendar in how they combine related passages in the Torah and Haftarah into one reading, but using your own time frame. Christians may follow the same model, but with an additional time portioned-out for the New Testament. This would prevent myopic interpretation of the Bible.

,
A day for searching cross-references and concordances.
A day for reading commentaries and searching the web.
The rest of the week to consolidate your interpretation to update your blog.
A day for reading and writing arguments to comments accumulated in your blog.

, Decide and reason on which combination of modes you wish to have. Debate and argue with your peers or religious leaders on the appropriate modes.


All scripture verses are somehow applicable. None supersedes another, and unless a scriptural portion is specifically voided by a later revelation, every book, chapter and verse is applicable now as it has been and as it will be forever. Later revelations reinforce but do not void the truth of earlier ones.
All scripture verses are equal but some are more thought provoking. Divine revelation is progressive. The later revelations clarify earlier revelations.
Scripture is not always contextual to its era and culture. All scripture is applicable today though it is not possible to relive the cultural context of the era which had been the basis of a scriptural portion, but the principles taught can be made relevant and instructional.
Scripture is divinely inspired but humanly interpreted and humanely implemented. Rules of humanity never supersede scripture. It reflects the moral attitudes pro and con on which we can meditate and which we should learn to apply or to avoid.
Scripture is divinely inspired and those portions that touch on science are not meant as a science text, and those that archaeologists have disputed are not inaccurate but are still buried under modern cities. Some tunneling under cities in Israel is done and may reveal astonishing relics at any time.
Scripture is historically authoritative, and if any portion is questioned by science and archeology, it shows that science and archeology should not make conclusive statements, on inadequate data and on speculation.
Scripture should be interpreted by spiritual persons and authorities who then release their various interpretations to the public.
The interpreter may listen to the Holy Spirit who can inspire the interpreter on which of the above modes are more applicable to which portion. However, it is not justified to emphasize one portion of scripture, if such interpretation is in conflict with other portions of scripture.

, Find books about the Bible, and/or Bible studies, with insights that might help you understand what you read. The following are helpful tools:


A concordance like Strong's concordance, which classifies every word of the Bible in the original language and defines the meaning.
A lay person's cultural, archaeological and paleontological guide to regions of the Bible. Many of these books are written by atheists or agnostics. You do not need to subscribe to their atheistic views, but their cultural and archaeological insights could be helpful to see the opposite points. Those like Isaac Asimov's guide may try to be very persuasive in attempting to convert you to be an a doubter; so, you have to be careful in separating truth from falsifiable facts of unbelievers, possibly, purposely weighted and shaded personal or even collective interpretations.

,, Use one blog page per interpretation to facilitate tagging and rating. Each blog page should be sectioned into:


The scripture reading
The interpretation narrative
Scripture cross references
And very important - Classify each scripture cross-reference with whether this interpretation reinforces, duplicates, voids, supersedes or has conflict with.
Source of interpretation
Notable adherents or people who agree with that interpretation

,, Ask them to leave comments.

,, For example:


Hebrew language expertise
Aramaic language expertise
Greek language expertise
Latin language expertise
Archaeology and paleo-cultural expertise

Revise the exegesis for clarity and length.",How to Write an Exegesis," Listen to each word in the passage. Pay attention to each verse. Take your time and read the passage a few times to yourself and aloud.You may also want to read the passage from a number of different translations aloud so you get a better sense of it. Though you will choose only one translation of the passage for the exegesis, it doesn’t hurt to look at other translations.;
, Go through the passage and write down any words you do not understand or recognize. Look them up and think about their meaning in the context of the passage.You should also consider the grammar and syntax of the passage. Notice the structure of the sentences, the tenses of the verbs, as well as the phrases and clauses used.
For example, you may circle words like ""sow,"" ""root,"" and ""soil"" in the passage because you think they are important.
You may also note that the passage ends with ""Whoever has ears, let them hear,"" which is the standard refrain for a parable in the Bible.

, You are encouraged to use secondary sources for the exegesis, such as theological articles and commentaries in journals or books. You can also use a Biblical dictionary as a source. Use a theological library or online theological journals to find sources about the passage.You can also look for articles, essays, and commentaries that discuss the literary genre of the passage as well as any themes or ideas that you notice in the passage.

, Before you dive into the writing, make an outline for the essay that is broken into five sections. Make sure you have an introduction, a body, and a conclusion for the essay. You may follow an outline like:Section 1:Introduction
Section 2: Commentary on the passage
Section 3: Interpretation of the passage
Section 4: Conclusion
Section 5: Bibliography

, Start by providing the passage you are studying in full. Include the literal translation of the passage and the context of the passage. Specify where it appears in the Bible.You can also mention the literary genre, such as whether the passage is a hymn or a parable.

, Your thesis statement will act as a guide for the exegesis. It should sum up your key points or ideas in one sentence. Place the thesis statement at the end of the introduction section.For example, you may have a thesis statement like, “In this Bible passage, one learns about the value of a good foundation for inner and outer growth.”

, Do a close reading of the passage, focusing on the grammar and syntax. You can also discuss the language and sentence structure in the passage. Note the literary genre of the passage and how this affects the meaning of the passage.

For example, if you were writing about Matthew 13:1-8, you may discuss the language and sentence structure of the parable. You may also talk about how the passage uses nature as a metaphor for personal growth.

, Think about the key themes and ideas in the passage. Consider how the passage reflects common teachings in the Bible. Discuss the theological significance of the passage. Ask yourself, “How can I apply this passage to my life?” “What does this passage say about my faith?”You can also discuss the broader context of the passage, including its historical or social significance. Provide context around how the passage has been interpreted by others, such as theological scholars and thinkers.

, Use direct quotes from your research in the paper to strengthen your argument. Lean on reputable sources to help make your paper stronger. Include all the proper citations for the sources in the paper.If you are writing the exegesis for a class, ask the instructor which citation style they prefer and use it in your essay.

, Conclude the paper by rephrasing your thesis statement. Include any closing remarks about the passage you’d like to include. Reflect on the passage as a whole. Do not add any new ideas in the conclusion of the essay. Instead, consider what you have written in the essay and link your ideas together., Your exegesis should have a properly formatted bibliography of all the sources you used in the essay. Use the full name of the author and the title of the article, journal, or book. Include the publication date as well.Your instructor should specify which type of citation style they want you to use for the bibliography.

, Read the essay aloud to catch any errors in the text. Make sure all punctuation is used correctly. Check that you have no spelling or grammar mistakes. Having these types of errors will make the essay appear sloppy and unpolished.You can also try reading the essay backwards to catch spelling errors, as this will force you to focus on each word to confirm it is spelled correctly.

, Ask friends, peers, and teachers to read over your exegesis before handing it in. Pose questions about whether they think your exegesis is easy to follow, well organized, and detailed. Be open to constructive criticism about your essay., Once you have received feedback about the essay, review it a final time. Look at your sentences to ensure they are clear and easy to follow. Make sure you cover the specifics and general aspects of the passage in detail.You should also revise the essay to ensure it is not too long. If there is a word count for the exegesis, make sure you do not go over it.

Try reading many versions of the Bible and figure out which one communicates best to you.,
Understand how the Bible is put together.,
Figure out what book of the Bible you need for your life.,
Read daily and carry your Bible with you if you have trouble finding time to study.

,
Talk to Christian friends, even if they don't go to the same church as you, and get their support and help if you are having trouble doubting or sinning.",How to Use a Bible for Your Life's Road Map," Many people like the KJV, but don't be afraid to try other widely recognized versions; such as the NIV or the Gideon Bible. My personal favorite Bible for unscholarly and personal usage is the NLT. If you don’t get a Study Bible, at least make sure you have something explaining where and who wrote the book and differences between kinds of books of the Bible; Letters, Gospels, History, etc.


Remember to choose based on comprehension instead of academic recognition.
Not all Bible versions are best in the same books, so sometimes it is good to use different versions for different books. For example, the NIV can be better than the NLT in the Letters or Gospels, but it is easier to read through books of Poetry in the NLT. Getting a Bible with several versions together could help or just use the internet to compare.
Consider using a Study Bible to learn cultural facts that may change how deep you understand the passage. If necessary, even use dictionaries or a Bilingual Bible if you are fluent in two languages.;
, It is important to know the differences between the OT, NT, Letters, Gospel, Poetry, History, etc. Read about the different kinds of books and do studies on the different between the OT and NT.


Check for what Jesus said about old and new for understanding of the OT and NT. Hebrews also is a book that talks about the difference, but requires a lot of Bible knowledge to understand.

,


Gospels are always the best because you can spend direct time with Jesus.
More detailed instruction is in the Letters concerning more detailed issues because churches and their members have always needed more help from Jesus.
Proverbs is good in learning how to make wise decisions, but our model for behavior is in the Sermon on the Mountain.
Use the OT to understand the NT, but not for studying how to be Christ-like.

,, If they can't solve your problem, they can at least search for the answer with you as a brother or sister in Christ.

===Rosary Prayer==="
"
Begin by touching the crucifix and praying the Sign of the Cross.,
Pray the Apostle's Creed.,
On the first large rosary bead, pray the Our Father.,
On each of the next three beads, pray a Hail Mary.,
On the next large bead, pray the Glory Be, also known as the Lesser Doxology.",How to Pray the Rosary2," To make the Sign of the Cross, with your right hand touch your forehead, your heart, your left shoulder, and then your right. If you don't have a Rosary in your hands to hold, that's fine. You can keep track mentally. While making the Sign of the Cross, say:



English: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.







Latin: In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.
Touch your forehead when you say Father, touch your breastbone when you say Son, touch your left shoulder when you say Holy, and touch your right shoulder when you say Spirit.



, If you have a Rosary, you are still holding the crucifix. With your head down and in a contemplative stance, say:



English: I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth. And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, died, and was buried; He descended into Hell; on the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; He shall come again to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.

Latin: Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem, Creatorem caeli et terrae. Et in Iesum Christum, Filium eius unicum, Dominum nostrum, qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria Virgine, passus sub Pontio Pilato, crucifixus, mortuus, et sepultus, descendit ad inferos, tertia die resurrexit a mortuis, ascendit ad caelos, sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris omnipotentis, inde venturus est iudicare vivos et mortuos. Credo in Spiritum Sanctum, sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam, sanctorum communionem, remissionem peccatorum, carnis resurrectionem, vitam aeternam. Amen.

, The traditional version reads thusly:



English: Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

Latin: Pater noster, qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum. Adveniat regnum tuum. Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra. Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie, et dimitte nobis debita nostra sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris. Et ne nos inducas in tentationem, sed libera nos a malo. Amen.

, These three prayers should be done with the intention of an increase in Faith, Hope, and Love.



English: Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

Latin: Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta tu in mulieribus, et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Jesus. Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc, et in hora mortis nostrae. Amen.

, Technically, this is on the space between the three beads and the larger bead; the larger bead is for the Our Father.



English: Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

Latin: Gloria Patri et Filio et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio, et nunc et semper et in saecula saeculorum. Amen.

"
"
Announce the Mystery.,
On the first rosary bead, pray the Our Father.,
On each of the next ten beads, pray a Hail Mary.,
Before the next large bead, pray a Glory Be.",How to Pray the Rosary3," This is only necessary if you're in a group. If you are alone, you may choose to silently contemplate on it. There are certain ways that each person will choose to go about reciting the Mysteries, so choose a method that speaks to you:


The traditional order is to meditate on the Joyful Mysteries on Monday, the Sorrowful on Tuesday, the Glorious on Wednesday, the same pattern for Thursday to Saturday, and then Glorious again on Sunday.Since introducing the Luminous Mysteries in 2002, Pope John Paul II proposed a different schedule for those praying the full 5 decades a day: Monday - Joyful; Tuesday - Sorrowful; Wednesday - Glorious; Thursday - Luminous; Friday - Sorrowful; Saturday - Joyful; Sunday - GloriousDepending on the day, choose the appropriate mystery:1st Joyful Mystery: The Annunciation of Gabriel to Mary (Luke 1:26-38)
1st Luminous Mystery: The Baptism of Our Lord in the River Jordan (Matthew 3:13-16)
1st Sorrowful Mystery: The Agony of Our Lord in the Garden (Matthew 26:36-56)
1st Glorious Mystery: The Glorious Resurrection of Our Lord (John 20:1-29)



, You should be on the large bead that precedes the pendant.

, That's one Hail Mary for each bead. You should be moving in a counter-clockwise fashion, just to the right of the pendant at this point.

, After that, you may choose to pray one Fátima Prayer:



English: O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of Hell; lead all souls to Heaven, especially those in most need of Thy mercy. (Amen.)

Latin (there is no single official Latin translation of the Fátima Prayer): Domine Iesu, dimitte nobis debita nostra, salva nos ab igne inferiori, perduc in caelum omnes animas, praesertim eas, quae misericordiae tuae maxime indigent.

"
"
Announce the second Mystery.,
On the large separate bead, pray the Our Father.,
Pray the second decade.,
Close the second decade with a Glory Be.",How to Pray the Rosary4," Again, depending on the day, a different Mystery is appropriate. Choose from the following:2nd Joyful Mystery: The Visitation of Mary to Elizabeth (Luke 1:39-56)
2nd Luminous Mystery: The Wedding at Cana, when Christ manifested Himself (Jn 2:1-11)
2nd Sorrowful Mystery: Our Lord is Scourged at the Pillar (Matthew 27:26)
2nd Glorious Mystery: The Ascension of Our Lord (Luke 24:36-53)

, Do you see a pattern emerging? Apart from the introduction and conclusion, it's all the same. Big beads are Our Fathers, small beads are Hail Marys, and at the end of each decade (10 Hail Marys) is a Glory Be and, if desired, a Fatima Prayer.

, That is, 10 more Hail Mary prayers, one for each bead.

, Again, if desired, a Fátima Prayer fits in nicely right here.

"
"
Announce the third Mystery.,
Pray an Our Father on the first large bead of the decade.,
Pray the next ten Hail Marys.,
End the decade with a Glory Be.",How to Pray the Rosary5," Once more, depending on the day, a different Mystery is appropriate. Choose from the following:3rd Joyful Mystery: The Birth (Nativity) of Our Lord (Luke 2:1-21)
3rd Luminous Mystery: The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God (Mark 1:14-15)
3rd Sorrowful Mystery: Our Lord is Crowned with Thorns (Matthew 27:27-31)
3rd Glorious Mystery: The Descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2:1-41)

, Try to maintain a state of reflection, even though the prayers do get repetitive. Concentrating on the intention of your prayer will help. Are you praying for a sick friend? For strength? Think about your own intentions.

, As you pray each one, move down a bead. You're halfway there! If you don't have a Rosary, your fingers are the same number, quite conveniently.

, And what's next? You guessed it. The optional Fátima Prayer. Pope Pius XII is the one you can thank for that little ditty."
"
Announce the fourth Mystery.,
With the large bead in hand, pray an Our Father.,
Pray ten more Hail Marys.,
Finish the decade with a Glory be and the Fátima Prayer.",How to Pray the Rosary6," Kinda goes without saying, now doesn't it? Take a look at your calendar. What day is it? Choose from the following:4th Joyful Mystery: The Presentation of Our Lord (Luke 2:22-38)
4th Luminous Mystery: The Transfiguration of Our Lord (Matthew 17:1-8)

Speak with the Priest about your wish to prepare a Catholic funeral.,
In larger cities, there is usually a funeral home where you will receive advice about caskets and burials and a time for friends and family to visit with the deceased, whether it is for private prayer or for a personal paying of respect.,
It is good to have someone at home who will answer the telephone and answer questions about the funeral and things of that nature, someone who can help keep things organized.,
In smaller communities or towns, it is customary for the family to arrange for the making of a cross with which to mark the grave.,
The funeral is usually followed by a Reception or Lunch in a prearranged place.,
Everyone grieves in their own way and at their own speed.",How to Plan a Catholic Funeral," He will advise you about possible times to have the funeral. The funeral is usually set for three days after the death happened. During this time, there are things that need to be decided and there is paperwork to be done. Obtain a copy of the death certificate from the hospital or doctor. You will need this when you visit the priest and the funeral home. A Catholic funeral can be a funeral service in the Church with appropriate prayers and song, or it can be one that celebrates the full Funeral Rites, which will include Holy Communion. If there is a celebration of the Mass, attendees who are not Catholic may accompany others who are receiving Holy Communion and they should fold their arms across their chests, indicating that they will receive a blessing only. This instruction should also be given to children who have not yet received their first Sacrament of Holy Communion.;
, In places where a funeral home is present, the body of your loved one will be transported and kept there until it is time for the funeral. If you live in a small town sometimes the body will remain at the hospital morgue until it is time for the viewing or the funeral. Sometimes this can happen in the back of the church, or in a chapel at the hospital, or retirement home or wherever the person lived. Sometimes the body can be brought to a family member's home and a Wake can be organized. This is a time when the family can set up a visiting area and the body can be brought home in the coffin. The priest can be asked to come to the home to lead prayers or to celebrate a Mass. Family and friends will continually be present for one to three days, visiting, eating, singing, praying, and grieving. Expect chatter, tears, laughter, song, stories, and prayer. It is not a good time to serve alcohol but other beverages should be available, like coffee, tea, water, etc.

, It can be difficult for the bereaved to remember everything at this stressful time. Family members will decide things like who will create and deliver the eulogy, who will serve as pall bearers to carry the casket, how the casket will be transported (in a small town, in larger places the Funeral home will take care of this). At a Catholic mass, a little booklet or memorial page is usually provided to the celebrants of the funeral mass. This will have information about the deceased; usually it will have a picture of the person, birth and death dates, and the names of those family members who are the bereaved - family and extended family. It could also contain a short poem, a summary of the eulogy, or anything special that the family would like to include. Those who are working with the Priest to prepare the liturgy might want to prepare a page stating the order of the mass, the songs and where to find them, and the names of the celebrants and pall bearers. Ushers can be chosen to show people to their pews.

, In cities, probably the Funeral Home will do this and they will also prepare the grave site. In smaller communities, this is sometimes done by family or friends. When the funeral is over and the casket is placed into the hearse, vehicles will follow the hearse, lead by family members, to the grave site. At the grave site, after the coffin is in place and the people are assembled, the priest will deliver a final blessing. In closing, sometimes, when a Funeral Home is directing, those present will leave a flower on the casket before leaving. In smaller communities, the coffin is lowered into the bottom of the eternal resting place. Family and friends say their final good byes as they deposit a handful of earth onto the coffin before leaving.

, Family, friends and acquaintances who may not have been together in a while have a chance to talk and visit and grieve together before leaving. Sometimes family pictures are taken. If there is a Will to be read, the Executor might ask those involved to meet at a specified time and place so they can be present for the Reading of the Will. Sometimes this happens directly after the reception, especially if individuals need to leave to catch planes etc.

, Be kind and compassionate.

Pray for the Pope and/or the dead (optional).,
End with the Sign of the Cross.",How to Pray the Rosary8," You're onto the pendant! Here's how this one goes:



English: Hail Holy Queen, mother of mercy; hail our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this vale of tears. Turn, then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us. And after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed Fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Amen.

Latin: Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiae; vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve. Ad te clamamus, exsules filii Hevae; ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes in hac lacrymarum valle. Eia ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos misericordes oculos ad nos converte; et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui, nobis post hoc exilium ostende. O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria. Amen.

, Hands still on the pendant, recite the following:



English: O God, whose only-begotten Son by His Life, Death and Resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life; grant, we beseech Thee, that by meditating upon these Mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain, and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.

Latin: Oremus: Deus, cujus Unigenitus, per vitam, mortem et resurrectionem suam nobis salutis aeternæ praemia comparavit: concede, quaesumus; ut, haec mysteria sanctissimo beatae Mariae Virginis Rosario recolentes; et imitemur quod continent, et quod promittunt, assequamur. Per eumdem Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.

, This one is the most uncommon, but adds a nice finishing touch to your intimate session. This one goes like this:



English: Remember, O Most Gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thy intercession, was left unaided. Inspired by this confidence, we fly unto thee, O Virgin of Virgins, Our Mother. To thee we come, before thee we stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not our petitions, but in thy mercy, hear and answer them. Amen.

Latin: Memorare, O piissima Virgo Maria, a saeculo non esse auditum, quemquam ad tua currentem praesidia, tua implorantem auxilia, tua petentem suffragia, esse derelictum. Ego tali animatus confidentia, ad te, Virgo Virginum, Mater, curro, ad te venio, coram te gemens peccator assisto. Noli, Mater Verbi, verba mea despicere; sed audi propitia et exaudi. Amen.

, The Litany is a list of call-and-response prayers, with the first several invoking the three Persons of the Holy Trinity to ""Have mercy on us"", and the rest asking the Virgin Mary (under various titles such as ""Mirror of Justice"") to ""Pray for us"". It ends with a slightly different version of the Agnus Dei that is recited before Holy Communion at Mass. The full text of the Litany may be found here., Catholics sometimes add one Our Father, one Hail Mary, and one Glory Be for the reigning Pope, asking that he be blessed physically and spiritually. Some would also pray another set of the above for the intentions of the dead, including loved ones and particularly the Holy Souls in Purgatory., Lift your head, feel lightened, and go about your day, prayerful and contemplative. Now wasn't that a worthwhile 20 minutes?

Dress for mass, not the mall.,
Prepare mentally to hear God's word.,
PAY ATTENTION!,
Listen to the homily.,
Participate in the Eucharist.,
Silently reflect on what you have learned.,
Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

",How to Pay Attention During Mass," When you get ready to go to mass, don't think about how much cleavage you're showing, focus on looking nice for God, not the cute altar boy. Also, it's okay to wear makeup, but don't overdo it. Go for a nice natural look. Remember, God gave you the way you look as a gift, he wouldn't want you to cover it all up.;
, Really care. Before the service begins, think about this: Jesus was basically the king in heaven, He had angels and His father all adoring him then he gave all that up to come down to earth as a baby! He had to have someone else change his pants and feed him and make decisions about his life. Then, when he grew up, he gave up even his life as a human and was nailed to a cross for each and every one of us. Then he rose again! The least you could do is listen to His and God's word.

, Just listen. Imagine yourself as the people in the stories. What would you do? Respond when you need to. If you don't know what to say, pay attention to what other people say and say it next time.

, The priest will help you to understand what the readings have to do with you. Do what he says!

, Consume the body and blood of our Savior.

, Think about something you can do or stop doing and do/stop doing it!

Single out the reason(s) which you believe deter you from going.,
Find a mentor, hopefully around your age, who is strong in the faith and is a regular attendee of Confession.,
Pick and choose for priests.,
Understand the Sacrament.,
If you want to, print out an Examination of Conscience.,
Refresh yourself.,
Pray for strength, courage, guidance, and your ability to make a good Confession.

,
Remember that ""God wills the salvation of all people."",
Go for it.",How to Overcome Fear of Confession," Is it because of a bad prior experience in the confessional? Fear of the priest judging you? A belief that the Sacrament is not necessary? Fear that the priest will break his silence? Or maybe just natural, human aversion to admitting wrongdoings?;
, Pray together, and share your apprehension with him or her. Find out what makes him or her love the Sacrament so much, and why the fears you have don't stop him or her from attending.

, If you are reading this article, chances are you haven't attended Confession in a long time, possibly a year or more. In this case, you want this Confession to be a good one. If you are comfortable meeting a priest face to face, you can schedule an appointment for a personal Reconciliation so that you get the priest you think will best guide you through the Sacrament. If you prefer total anonymity, don't attend Confession at your parish- go to another Church around you so you don't need to worry about the priest knowing you.

, It truly helps to know WHY we practice Reconciliation in the first place. There are whole books on the topic, but there are also free online sources. This article on Catholic Answers goes into detail on Biblical support for the Sacrament.

, Having a list in front of you will make it easier to find sins that need to be confessed, and will help you organize your ideas before you receive the sacrament.

, If it's been awhile, it would be helpful to refresh yourself on how to make a good Confession. If you need to, print out a copy of the Act of Contrition and bring it with you.

,,

, Go with a friend for support if you have to. Have him or her hold you accountable, to make sure you don't ""chicken out."" Pray together beforehand. If your Church offers them, attend a Reconciliation service in which the parish community prepares for the Sacrament together before actually receiving it. Chances are, there will be individuals there in your same boat!

Get holy water from your local Catholic or Anglican parish.,
Go home and install the Holy Water holders.,
Tell all your family about the holy water.",How to Make Holy Water an Essential Part of Your Home," They are sold in religious stores, or you can make your own by using a flat seashell. Seashells have been used as a symbol of baptism for centuries.;
, Some religious hospitals also have a container of holy water in their chapel. If you do not see a container of holy water in the church sanctuary, don't be afraid to ask the priest about it, he will show you where it is located. Be sure to bring a bottle or small container to hold the holy water.

, Then, pour some holy water into the holders. You don't need to overfill. By placing a thin sponge in the font, you can delay the evaporation of the holy water.

, Explain that you believe that holy water forgives the common sins. Tell them that whenever they see a holy water holder, they should dip their finger in the water, make the sign of the cross with the wet finger, and leave. Tell them that they won't have to spend a lot of time in purgatory.

Plan your study.,
Get a good study Bible.,
Study the Bible with an attitude of prayer.,
Pray.,
Focus on the New Testament first.,
Consider reading John first.,
Pick out topics to study.",How to Study the Bible1," Set aside a time and place to study. Develop a plan of what you want to read each day in a calendar. Having a plan excites you to discover what you learn from God's Word for that day; it will also keep you organized, keeping track of what passages you have covered and what lessons you have learnt from each.;
, Choose a translation to use during your study. You should select from translations as opposed to simple paraphrases, as this makes sure you are reading the originally translated text not a commentator's interpretation.


Avoid bibles that have been translated from Latin, rather than the original Greek and Hebrew. These, like a game of telephone, can get incorrectly translated.
Always ensure your understanding of a passage you have read fits with the entire doctrine of the Bible (which is God's Redemption Plan of Salvation, 2 John 1:7-10); any revelation you get that does not fit the doctrine of Jesus alone must be cast away. Also you must look at years of Church history to compare your findings with history. If you discover something that everyone in Church history disagrees with, you are most certainly wrong (heretics don't proceed with caution- they go ahead thinking they are the new prophet in town!) To be thus a good student of the Word, you should research: the Puritan Hard drive is a good place to start as well as Ligonier Ministries and Wretched radio (it has links to great Biblical Christian sites and Church History). Be careful not to be arrogant in the course of studying. Its so easy to boast of your findings rather than prayerfully meditate on them. Studying extensively is good, you should know what the foundations of the faith are but make sure your ability to recall names of people throughout Church history does not exceed your ability to remember the Scriptures Word for Word! (Food for thought, Joshua 1:7-9) Remember even those who are illiterates can have a deeper understanding of the Word and deeper relationship with God than you do because they meditate on it. Simply knowing names and things is not good enough. You must practice and preach what you practice.
Good formal equivalence translations include the New Revised Standard Version or the English Standard Version. Good combination translations include Today's New International Version and the Holman Christian Standard Bible. A good dynamic equivalence translation is the Contemporary English Version, although strictly dynamic equivalence translations are usually frowned on by serious scholars.

, This should be the first step in understanding the Bible. Bible study should be approached with a prayerful desire to learn. Discipline yourself to be with the Word. The Bible will come alive for you. It is spiritual food.

, Ask God to help you understand his word before you even begin. Take the Bible literally. Don't assume a parable or story just because it seems vague. Don't try to interpret the Bible. ""Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation."" (2 Peter 1:20,21) That's where misunderstandings come from.

, Though the New Testament compliments the Old, and the Old compliments the New, it is better to read the New Testament first if you are a novice. The Old Testament will make better sense if you read the New Testament first.

, It's best to start with John, as it's the easiest Gospel to read, identifies who Jesus really is, and prepares you for the other 3. It would help to read it 2 or 3 times to get a good understanding of the author, topic, context, and characters. Read 3 chapters per day. Concentrate on your reading. and be patient.


When you're done with John, move on to Mark, Matthew, and Luke. As those tend to be the next easiest material. Read all the books -one after the other- until you have read all the Gospels.
When you're done with the Gospels, consider reading the letters from Romans to Jude. Because Revelation is pure prophecy not covered in the New Testament, stay out of there for now. When you get a good familiarity with the major prophets, then tackle Revelation.

, A topical study is very different than a book study or a chapter study. The subject index of most Bibles have specific areas of study. Once you have found an interesting topic, you begin by doing a rough read through of the verses. This will give you a general oversight of what the verses have to say. For example: salvation, obedience, sin, etc. Remember: reading a chapter several times will help you find things that you might have missed or skipped over before.

"
"
Use the dictionary.,
Have a Bible notebook.,
Highlight important stuff or things you really like in your own bible.,
Use cross references and footnotes if you have them in your Bible.,
Follow the references in your Study Bible back to the first time it was used.,
Keep a journal.,
Get rid of all distractions.",How to Study the Bible2," Make sure that you look up words in the chapter that you are reading from. This will help you understand the Bible better.

, This will keep you accountable to reading everyday. Also, ask yourself questions and write them down in your Bible notebook. Use the ""who"", ""what"", ""when"", ""where"", ""why"", and ""how"" formula for your studies. For instance, ""Who was there?"", ""What was happening?"", ""Where is this happening?"", ""How did it turn out?"". This simple formula will make the story make sense.

, But don't do this if it belongs to someone else.

, These are little numbers and symbols which tell you to look somewhere else in the text for more information, or show you when something was previously discussed. Footnotes, usually found at the bottom of a given page, will tell you where information is coming from or explain complex ideas or historical events and concepts.


Try picking out a few words that jumped at you and looking them up in a concordance to find other verses talking about the same thing.

, This is where a chain reference Bible is essential.

, You don't have to write a lot. Just use a notebook page with the date, book / chapter / verse on the top. Ask yourself some questions and outline what you are reading. This helps to show you what God is revealing to you through His Word. Write out ideas or verses or thoughts that come into mind as you read. Think ""Who, What, When, Where, How."" Answer every possible question under each category. Compare your findings with what you know the Bible teaches. Then look them over and pray about it.

, Turn off the television or radio. Unless you're studying with a group, try to to find a quiet place where you have a table to read and take notes. This is alone time between you and God.

"
"
Find a Bible study group.,
Share what you have found with others within your Bible study group.,
Don't take what someone else says about the topic, except as a guide.",How to Study the Bible3," Find a group of people that you can study with. The text is very complicated and having some help to get through it will be very important. They will also help keep you motivated and inspired.

, Discuss what you have read with others who may have more experience reading and studying the Bible than you do.

, Let the Bible inspire you. Increasing your knowledge about Biblical Principles will only come after years of dedication, hard work, and just plain reading.


The Bible is not just one book from Genesis to Revelation. There are 66 books, each from different authors at different times. Several authors have written more than one book, but they were written at different times for different reasons. You will find similar subjects and meanings throughout all the books of the Bible.

Start with the Gospels.,
Read Acts next.,
Read Galatians through Philemon.,
Move on to the Old Testament.",How to Study the Bible4," You can certainly read the New Testament in order if that suits you, but there are some plans that read the books out of order for a purpose. One is described in the following steps.

, Each Gospel paints a different picture of Jesus. Matthew shows Jesus as King; Mark shows Jesus as Rabbi (Many scholars believe that Mark is Peter's son. (1 Peter 5: 12 & 13) Further study shows that this Mark is actually the missionary that worked with Paul 2 Tim 4:11); Luke shows Jesus as man (Luke was a physician, probably a Greek, from Asia Minor (Col 4:14); and John shows Jesus as God, that is, the Messiah.


Read John again for continuity. This will give you a more complete picture of the Gospels. John was the last Gospel written. Matthew through Luke are known as the ""Synoptic Gospels"" because they tell the same basic story, bringing in their own points as directed. John fills in the gaps of what the others leave out. It's a book that completes the story of the Gospels.

, Acts, also known as ""The Acts of the Apostles"" was written by Luke, and is a picture of the revelation and development of the early church.

, These 6 shorter letters are personal letters from Paul to 3 of the churches he had visited, and to 3 of his friends, Timothy, Titus, and Philemon.


Read The Epistle to the Romans. This shows the means, and the path to Salvation, then the Epistles to the Corinthians. This is the introduction to the Holy Spirit, and develops His doctrine and Gifts, followed by Hebrews through Jude. The teachings of the early church elders.
Unless you have been a Christian for some time, and you have a good grounding in prophecy, leave Revelation for the more serious students in their study times.

, The Old Testament is compiled in the order for convenience, not chronology. You can read it by groups to make things easier. There are 929 chapters in the Old Testament. If you read 3 per day, you will have read it in 10 months.


Read Genesis. This is the creation and the early relationship with God.
Move on to Exodus through Deuteronomy. This is the Law.
Read the history books. Joshua through Esther.
Following the history section, read the books of wisdom and poetry.

Job, often said to be the oldest book, shows how one man's relationship with God and man went, and is full of lessons on how it could have gone better. It's a great lesson on what God expects of man.
The Psalms is the writings of a king of Israel who was a man after God's own heart despite the fact that he was not only a sinner, but a convicted killer.
The Song of Solomon, also known as the Song of Songs, was written by King Solomon in his youth. It was a work of poetry by a young man in love. King Solomon was the wisest and wealthiest man in the world.
Proverbs was King Solomon's writings as an adult when he was King of Israel, and was learning his hard lessons.
Ecclesiastes was King Solomon's lamentations of a man who had spent his life on riotous living, many wives, concubines, wine, women and song. Ecclesiastes is the book of lessons of what not to do.


Following the books of wisdom and poetry, get started in the 5 major prophets: Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, & Daniel.
Move on to the 12 minor prophets to finish the Old Testament.

Begin by scouring the internet for resources.,
Pray for God to give you wisdom and revelation.,
Assemble a core group of kids and ask them whether they will invite others from school, sports or extracurricular activities.,
Be yourself.,
Incorporate Christian music, food, fun and games related to the Bible.,
Allow them a time to talk frankly about their situations in practical Christian life that come up in studying the Bible.,

Remind them to be involved in a Bible teaching church that has a serious, active youth ministry.

",How to Start a Teen Bible Study Group Outside Church," Check the resource box below for free teen Bible lessons that can be easily adapted to a small group setting.;
, If you are reading this then most likely God has placed a desire within your heart to begin this ministry. You need nothing more; he will supply the rest, if you ask him.

, Follow though by welcoming their guests.

, Don't try to be cool. Kids see right through that. Feel free to tell them you've made mistakes throughout life, but God has given you the grace to repent and stay away from those past behaviors.

, Kids just want a place to hang out, and you are going to be infusing the word of God into this mix. Make it interesting and fun.

, If the group is large, meet together at first of each study and then break down into smaller groups (5 or 6 persons for example) with an appointed leader; keep doors between rooms open and walk about quietly, but noticeably supervising, for this discussion to have more focus and participation.

, Pray briefly to begin and end meetings. Let them know you are there for them and want to pray with them and help them when they are unsure of where to turn for ideas about their lives.

"
Recognize that Jesus said that Christians are not very savvy when it comes to money.,
Believe and act correctly upon the promises ""'If you can'?"",
Recognize that God promised to supply your needs (Philippians 4:19).

,
Read that the Father wants to prosper you so you can have your needs and
29“And do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not keep worrying.,
Prepare as the Bible recommends that you establish your career before you build a house (and get married): ""Prepare your work outside, and make it ready for yourself in the field; afterwards, then, build your house"" (Proverbs 24:27).54% of the divorces in America are over lack of money.

,
Recognize that you must invest in yourself and get a college degree.,
Be able, willing and give as Christ told his disciples: ""33 Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves 'money belts' which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near nor moth destroys.,
Recognize that the specialist gets paid well, the generalist does not.,
Pray to God to show you what career to pursue.,
Recognize that God wants you to work ""smarter"" not just ""harder"".,
Pray for Wisdom.,
Give in good measure, out of your first fruits, by Faith.,
Obey the Lord: ""46 the master of slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces, and assign him a place with the unbelievers.",How to Prosper As a Young Person According to the Bible," Luke 16:8 says that the children of the this world are wiser in their business affairs than the Children of light. This means that too many Christians are ""ignorant of God's promises"" and want to assume that spiritual holiness will make you money. The Holiness of Jesus Christ in salvation will get you to heaven (Hebrews 12:14), but you receive blessings by having the right attitudes (Matthew 5:3).;
, said Jesus. 'Everything is possible for him who believes.'(Mark 9:23), also ""Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything."" (James 1:4).

,, 30“For all these things the nations of the world eagerly seek; but your Father knows that you need these things. 31“But seek His kingdom, and these things will be added to you. 32“Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom."" (Luke 12: 29-32).

,, Deuteronomy 8:18 says that God had given you power to get wealth. Everyone has talents and abilities that when developed will make them a success. Invest in yourself and get a college degree because a Government survey done in 2003 shows that the average pay in America is over $28 per hour for a college graduate.


Don't leave college, if you could finish college (Proverbs 24:27). Isaiah, Luke and Paul were well educated.
Have you heard people say on TV, ""The Economy is not your source, Your Job is not your source, Your Boss is not your source, Your education is not your source, mail all your money to me and God will take care of you."" That is just plain foolish. Proverbs 13:15 says that good understanding gives favor. Proverbs 13:15 does not say that a man shall be rewarded for his generosity.
Jesus did introduce faith giving in Luke 6:38, but after you give, notice that God will bless you according to your ability (Deuteronomy 8:18), so you must be open to God's leading on how YOU will be a specialist and prosper.

, 34 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."" (Luke 12:33 - 34). And ""35 Be dressed in readiness, and keep your lamps lit. 36 Be like men who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast, so that they may immediately open the door to him when he comes and knocks. 37 Blessed are those slaves (of Christ) whom the master will find on the alert when he comes; truly I say to you, that he (the Master) will gird himself to serve, and have them recline at the table, and will come up and wait on them. 38 Whether he comes in the second watch, or even in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves (as servants of God). 39 But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what hour the 'thief' was coming, he would not have allowed his house to be broken into. 40 You too, be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not expect."", Proverbs 13:15, ""Good understanding gives favor."" You can become a specialist, if you stick with the same well chosen skilled-career for many years. Abraham was a cow farmer, Isaac planted seed, Joseph was a sheep farmer and Joseph was an economist in Egypt. Each person has different talents and if you develop your talents you will prosper. Even Jesus had to grow in wisdom (Luke 2:52).

, ""Call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not"" (Jeremiah 33:3). According to II Corinthians 1:20, all the promises of God belong to you in Jesus.


In the New Testament, Romans 8:16 God will witness to your heart and Romans 8:17 it will lead you into prosperity.
Galatians 3:14 the Blessing of Abraham is yours.
James 1:5 shows that God wants to give you wisdom and God wants to give it to you in abundance.

, Proverbs 12:8 says that a man shall be rewarded according to his wisdom (not on effort). Notice that it does not say, according to his ""hard work.""

, James 1:5 says, ""If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that gives to all men generously and willingly and it shall be given."" When you graduate from the University, pray for several days and get a witness inside that you can get a job at good pay in your field (computer related for example); apply and get started in your job.

, ""Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, 'shall men give into your bosom'. For with the same measurement that ye measure with all it shall be measured to you again."" Jesus introduced this concept in Luke 6:38.

, 47 And that slave (God's servant) who knew his master’s will and did not get ready or act in accord with his will, will receive many lashes, 48 but the one who did not know it, and committed deeds worthy of a flogging, will receive but few.""
""From everyone who has been given much, much will be required; and to whom they entrusted much, of him they will ask all the more."""

Understand the many forms of evil.,
Recognize the dominant evil in your life.,
Stay alert.",How to Protect Yourself from Evil with the Bible1," It would help to know how 'versatile' evil can be. Evil can be defined in several ways:1. morally wrong, wicked, as evil deeds,. 2. harmful, injurious, as an evil disregard of safety rules. 3. characterized or accompanied by misfortune or suffering, as to be fallen on evil days. 4. that which is due to actual or representation of the bad character, as an evil reputation. 5. marked by anger, irritability, or quick temper. 6. mischief, misfortune, to wish one evil. 7. anything causing injury or harm and its effect like Tobacco is considered to be an evil, which creates consequences. Also alcohol or drug abuse. You will want to recognize evil and also prevent it manifesting itself through you.;
, Realize that you need to resist and overcome two forms of evil because both external evils and your own internal ones affect both your life as well as those around you. Evil can affect you from outside or from the inside, as it may be around you or already within you. Sometimes you may wonder whether you had created the damage or something else prompted you. You may well be right at times that it's an evil force that pushes you towards something wrong.

, Life poses dangers and challenges without a warning or a signal. Then why not be watchful all the time? Keeping an eye for any untoward behavioral change in you or in your surroundings will help you guard against hurting yourself and others. Keep an eye on all semblances of evil and that which looks too good to be true.


Keep an eye not just on what is clearly bad but also what looks too tempting or too good to be true. The devil tries all its powers to catch the eye of the good. If it fails through simple means and traps, it goes beyond and comes in an attractive package which means in the face of a new person, a 'gift', a desire, an idea, and so on.
Evil tries to extend its reach and manifests not just through what appears bad but also through some things that look temptingly attractive. That's deception which suits evil and evildoers.
Stay within your lane. Don't meddle needlessly with things that do not pertain to you. Take heed of warnings or admonitions and avoid doing things solely for curiosity's sake.

Discuss your life and problems with someone wise or trustworthy.",How to Protect Yourself from Evil with the Bible2," God has said in the Bible that obedience pleases Him more than sacrifices (e.g. Is. 1:11-20). Pay more attention to your responsibilities and obey what you must do. Be cheerful and happy every day and let nothing keep you idle for too long that you skip your good-works.


Obey what you know must be obeyed. Develop respect for your being. It helps if you have someone to look up to. You feel more relaxed instead of tense during tougher times. If you could respect someone for something respectable in them, you could deserve to be respected for striving to live a good life. Make it good to the best of your capacity. Pay more attention to your responsibilities. Do not be lazy or reciprocate bad attitudes.
If you do not find someone to obey or respect, it is still fine. You can set good standards for yourself and follow them so you can respect yourself.

, Don't be lazy or idle. Sloth is an invitation to evil into your life. By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through (Ec. 10:18). Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord (I Cor. 15:58).


The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour. (Pr. 21:25)
The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. (Ec. 4:5)
The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute. (Pr. 12:24)
Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar. She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens. She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet. She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. (Pr. 31:10-30)

, Never stop working rightly and doing justice in your life. Learn all that you need, and apply that knowledge to prosper in life. Do justice in all you do, including school, work, or any other task. When you are working and responsible, do not stay idle and allow yourself to get into unhelpful or evil activities. Remember, an idle mind is the devil's workshop.


Make your boast in the Lord that He has overcome the flesh; arrogance is iniquity: ""But as it is, you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil"" (James 4:17).
Be informed and resist false words. Do not spread, listen to or accept unfounded opinions such as gossip, bias/prejudice and rumors (Eph. 4:29, Pr. 6:16-19, Mt. 12:36, Ps. 64:2-4).

, People and responsibilities pose many challenges in the day-to-day life. They may even try your patience till you lash out. Under conflicting situations if you lose your temper or mind and act rashly, you may create some negativity around you by hurting someone. You may also appear an ill-tempered individual yourself. This reputation may hurt you in many ways. Let go of conflicting arguments. Speak only what you have to speak and remain calm in the rest of the stressful situation.

, Anger has a bad reputation as being disruptive and unproductive. So, when losing temper, one may act threateningly to others and oneself. Anger is not bad just as a knife is not bad. It can be used as a tool. It is given unto you to use, and you must not allow yourself to misuse it. Likewise, use anger to empower your disciplining of the unruly, undisciplined and the aggressive ones. Do not stay submissive or too lenient, for evil may take over and hurt you and those connected. Evil is opportunistic, doing as it pleases when you make an opening for it.


Be disciplined and aware of what not to do, and try to bring discipline around you as much as you are capable. Do not force it, but do it wisely keeping your past experience and problem-solving abilities in mind.
Remember Jesus became angry when His place of worship was turned into a marketplace (Mt. 21:12-13). Be angry keeping the level of unlawfulness or mistake in mind. Use anger keeping an end result in mind and not just to show that you are angry. Do it as well as you could.

, Unfortunately, even near and dear ones may be tempted or be used as temporary instruments to lure you towards evil. So it is advisable to not allow any and everything that they suggest just because they are close to you. Use your understanding to see the good and the bad in what they say or suggest.


As you understand and act upon their behavior, try not to act roughly with them. They may not be aware of what they are doing and what you have gauged from their behavior. Try to guide and hint them amicably according to their nature. If you make them feel bad, it will hurt them and may create more troubles in return. Try to minimize conflicting reactions with the use of a careful and tactful dialogue.

, The best way to control your own temper and maintain sanity is by being forgiving. Forgive yourself and others. You don't have to make friends with conflicting beings but you can just not hold any maligning thoughts against them. In your heart and mind, know that you will never hate or hold any negativity for evildoers. If you do hold grudges then you give them a place in your psyche permanently. This makes it easier for them to manifest their wicked ways starting right from within you i.e. your mind.


Forgiving and not feeling agitated may not happen instantly. It is natural to feel this way. However, try not to let your present set of feelings push you towards any further evil. Hold yourself back and practice self-control.
Be forgiving but don't be vulnerable.

, Moral strength gives enough strength to face all evils may it be from people, temptations or any experience. No, moral strength cannot be gained in any other way than exercising righteousness. You must try to be truthful. You will fail or you may find yourself wanting to escape all the tests. But if you seek to be true in your heart, you will eventually get used to following the right path at all times. With this, you will gain immense strength which can't be broken by an evil mind.

, All that evil tries to do is for the world to reach a stage where there is no hope or goodness left. To defy evil and the devil, you must never allow all of the evil's maneuvering to get to you. Maintain your mental equilibrium and fight all forms of evil with hope and goodness.


Be patient towards the irritable.
Be forgiving towards the evil-minded.
Be cheerful in your heart and try to spread cheers among the hopeless.
Reach out and counsel those who are distressed.
Take a break and get back when you feel you can't take any more of the negativity.

, Equip yourself. As you observe what has occurred around you or with you and you try to rationalize you will learn what will be used to dilute the effects of the wrongdoing. Realize that your greatest strength under all the circumstances will be 'patience'. Patience is the strongest because it does not resort to petty fights or verbal salvo. It waits till the right time to make a strike. And when it does, it eliminates all the destruction. To be able to have that impact you don't have to be something special. You can be just yourself but slightly more patient and watchful. The one who waits and watches gets a better understanding of when, how and what/ whom to strike.


There are evildoers and there are those who promote or prompt evildoers. Pinpoint on these masterminds and maintain a clear stance with them. Deal with these evil minds with patience and do not involve in a petty fight with them. It will only boost their ego that they managed to stir your emotions enough to fight. Such people are neither ever too humiliated to stop or too 'taught' to make them understand.
Develop your self-defense. They may try all their tactics to attack you. Do not react on what they do or say. React with a reluctance to react. Let them know clearly that you will never be interested or annoyed by them. This will disappoint them. They may even move to a softer target than you.
Do not lose your calm. Always prepare yourself from evildoers common tricks.

, Don't react with any sudden, odd notion or unpredictable change, by being erratic: He's such a capricious boss I never know how he'll react.For example, people may ""go off"" (expressing sudden anger), perhaps based on gossip, bias/prejudice and rumors. Deciding good or bad before seeing and hearing true evidence is prejudging. Judge rightly.


Do not entertain unfounded opinions pro or con about people, without enough facts to base it upon.

, This includes bullying. Do not continue to observe or laugh, smile or even secretly to admire or enjoy bad behavior or any such thing.

, What you see and experience has a reason. It has a beginning and a way or a path that has led to some damage. Figure out what was the 'intent' of the occurrence and beat it. One way to do it is by getting stronger.

, Avoid giving too much responsibility to persons who need to prove themselves dependable enough. Yet, the Bible shows that God loves to use the common and the weak; so be open to building up new helpers, to an appropriate level of understanding.


Avoid rewarding inexperienced or permissive persons by leaving them in charge of important events. Also, protect the vulnerable, such as defenseless children who are so accepting and fun loving. Realize that some youth may act for lack of a vision or temporarily fail due to being inexperienced, or because of seeking excitement and not knowing the reality of danger and harm from unwise behavior.

, Strive to have a clear conscience. Stir clear of all negative thoughts such as:


Judging others even if they do something that is clearly right or wrong. What others do is their business and not yours to judge. If you must do something about others, think well of them and/ or offer help.
Taking the liberty to speak hurtful truths in the name of being forthright or frank.
Abusing - physically, verbally, emotionally or sexually.
Giving back anger for anger. React to bring a solution, however, do not overreact when provoked.
Do not envy someone who has something that you like. Let go of them and do enjoy what you have.
Do not nod along to any and everything someone says. Everyone has the ability to think and make a decision. Hold on to what you 'know' is right. When unsure, say it that you are not sure yet and hence you do not intend to make a hasty decision or judgment.

, If you resort to crime or wrong routes to help escape from difficult situations, you may not see beyond all the evil. Search the right path knowing that it may be tough. Walk on thorny steps if it is the right thing to do. Deny any comfort that makes you drift from the simple fruits of true labor. Such efforts and hard work will give you true protection. It will give you moral strength to keep going and be enriched as a human being and not just know about it.

, Merely having the desire to protect yourself from evil or making a plan may only remain in your mind and never go into action. Waiting for the right time, the right state of mind or the right reason seems good to keep in mind before acting. But, if you stay idle and slack for too long, you may unknowingly fall prey to being lazy. Act when it seems advisable. Your progress is your responsibility to fulfill.


Proactively work to your capacity instead of waiting for something you can do perfectly. While you wait you may allow a series of unhelpful thoughts to take place in your mind which may help it turn into negative actions without intending to do badly.

, Prepare yourself to accept the benefits of your efforts, as rewards often come in small installments. You need to be able to see what is the reward for all your fights with evil to be able to benefit from it. Some just do not see it and let it go. They also wonder whether they are doing enough to protect themselves from evil, or whether they are not fighting enough for positivity.


Experience is preparation. Prepare your mind, heart and body to receive rewards, but merely saying that you are prepared won't help. Actions give you experience and that can empower you to fight all the evil around. Stay alert and do not fall prey to inactivity and lose your chance to prosper. But, calmly reflect upon the happenings of life especially during distressing events.
Work keeping the end result you desire in mind. As you do that you will be prepared to accept completely what you have worked for. There are many who get what they want, but they lose it either because they fail to see it or because they feel inefficient to accept it.

, A greedy desire is one that you will never feel comfortable to give up. God said in Matthew 16:25, ""But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life because of Me will find it"". How far are you willing to give up your most loved possessions and dreams? If you must have them, how can you be brave enough to give your best, if need be, as God leads and guides by His word in The Bible. It is your test which will leave you stronger and blessed with all your hearts desires yielded to Him.


Remember how Abraham, after waiting for years for a child, was quick to obey God. So that he went ahead as if to give up his only son -- the son Abraham had after many years of waiting. No, you don't have to sacrifice someone, but you must be willing to leave and go to God's path as He expects of you. Take note that God waited for Abraham's decision, and his final act of giving. God spoke right when he was about to give up his child. Likewise, be willing to give up your plans and believe that He knows what He is doing. This will give you immense strength to protect yourself from evil, as God can show His strength for you when you are in your weakest moment.
Control your indulgences. Sometimes you want too much or try to gather beyond your needs or reach. You may be tempted to go to evil means to get what you set your eyes on. Know what you need and how much will suffice your needs. God wants you to ask for and to receive prosperity. The desire to prosper is different from greed. Greed is when you don't care if what you achieve is at the cost of others, and you don't feel anything wrong in stealing or resorting to illegal ways to amass your wealth, or treasure. Also, what you get by compromising your honesty and loyalty towards humanity, as well as near and dear ones, points towards your drifting away from the right path.

, Reread the best books. The more you read the more you may get the solutions to your problems and questions. What you couldn't grasp earlier will make more sense to you today. So pick up a book and reap the benefits of having a better understanding of the society, the world and your own mind.

, Writing has been scientifically proven to relax the mind. Writing your thoughts, fears, worries -- such as writing a diary about everyday events -- helps interpret everything and think about it a second time with a more focused mind. Dealing with negativities of life has a lot to do with your own understanding and ease of tackling various situations. Writing makes increases the chances of making you a better decision maker in the process.


You need not keep a record of everything you write. You can write and discard it later so no one reads what you wrote.

, Speak to a matured and empathetic person you know and seek good counsel. Sometimes even a small conversation leads to big solutions. Good conversations can open the mind and broaden the perspective. You would not want to miss out on these possibilities. No matter how mature or well-versed you feel you have become, continue interacting with the unbiased and those with good judgment. Share with them and ask them what they think, and then do what you feel is right for you. This way, you share and make up your own mind while taking the onus off any outcome of making the decision.


Continued interactions and prudent information sharing will help in bringing hope and better judgment to you in the longer run.

Refer to the word of the Lord for constraint.,
Follow the Ten commandments.,
Be equipped through the Bible.,
Pray.,
Read the Bible.,
Speak to a priest.",How to Protect Yourself from Evil with the Bible3," Christianity and the Bible have the basic rules and guidance to help one being a good human and avoiding all forms of evil. If you have problems with following a certain command, you can seek guidance that you feel will help you as is written in the Bible, Matthew 9:29, 'According to your faith be it unto you'.


The Lord has set rules which can help you correct yourself and also give you guidance as to what to do and what not to do. You can use those guidelines to help you understand your problems and make a choice.

, Strive to be righteous. Stir clear of evil. If you resort to evil to help escape from difficult situations, you may not see beyond evil even while you search good or protection. Seek the right path knowing that it is tough. Choose to walk on thorny steps if it is the right step. Deny any comfort that makes you drift from the sweet fruit of true labor. Seek effort and hard work which will give you true protection. It will give you moral strength to keep you going and experience God, not just hear of Him.

, ""So, the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work."" (2 Timothy 3:17) -- How? -- by following and applying God's way and plan found in the scriptures that admonish us to not only do good but turn from evil, and correct that which is wrong, if possible.

, Pray, not just like a group of words uttered through your mouth. Go beyond just utterance and pray keeping the end result you desire in mind. As you do that you will be prepared to accept graciously what you have worked or prayed for. There are many who get what they ask but they lose it either because they fail to see it or because they feel inefficient to accept the gift. Pray with a vision. This is faith. Faith is experienced to be applied. Merely saying that you have faith does not really gives you the experience. Faith will empower you to fight all the evils of the world. Pray 'Our Father', 'Hail Mary' and when in distress 'Lord is my Shepherd'.


Believe even if you are not answered. There is no such thing as prayers not being answered. It only takes longer to be answered but not prayers go unattended by God, Almighty. God knows exactly what your heart seeks. He will fulfill your prayers but you must have faith and be willing to wait.

, Read and read again everything the Bible states. The more you read the more you get the solutions to your problems and questions. What you couldn't grasp earlier will make more sense to you today. So pick up that Bible and read it again.

, Discuss your life and problems with the one who is said to be closest to God. Speak to a priest and seek their good counsel. Sometimes even a small conversation leads to big solutions. You would not want to miss out on those possibilities. No matter how mature or well-versed you feel you have become, continue interacting with the wise and the good servants of God. Share with them and ask them to pray for you. This will certainly bring hope and better judgment to you.

Learn what translation your church uses.,
Search online for your favorite Bible translation.,
Devise a plan for reading.,
Try to stick to your plan.",How to Read the Bible Online," Many churches have Pew Bibles for parishioners to read along during worship services, as well as during church-led Bible study sessions. Most Bibles will have the specific translation, or version, printed on the binding of the Bible. If you cannot find it, the first page of the Bible will likely name the translation.

If you are not a churchgoer, or you do not like the translation your church uses, research the different translations. Read at least a chapter from versions that interest you. If you can understand and appreciate the way the Bible is written in the particular translation, jot down what translation it is.;
, Bible Gateway is one of the more common websites offering numerous Bible translations. Find one that suits you best, and bookmark it.

If you own a smartphone or a tablet computer, there are several free applications available for Bible reading. Research options and translations available to you in applications, and download one you find to be the best.

, In print, it can feel necessary to read from Genesis to Revelation in order. Online, however, it is easier to select other books to start with.

, It doesn't have to be the same everyday. You may want to read in the mornings some days, and the afternoons or evenings on others, it doesn't matter. The important thing is that your spending time with your heavenly father!

, If you don't, that's okay! Try picking out a few words that jumped at you and looking them up in a concordance to find other verses talking about the same thing.

, You don't have to write a lot... Start small! This helps to show you what God is revealing to you through His Word! Write out ideas or verses or thoughts that come into mind as you read. Then look them over and pray about it.

, The Psalms are very intimate prayers and songs written to the Lord by various authors. This will help you get a better understanding of prayer and worship.

, God won't hold it against you if you slip up and miss a day or two. He is our heavenly father, we can come to Him as we are!His love for us stays the same. He will NEVER leave us or forsake us.

Once you have your group, talk with them about what passages they want to study and put together a Bible reading plan.",How to Start a Women's Bible Study1," This place can be anywhere just so long as it's okay with the owner of the property. Some ideas are: at your house, in a park, in a coffee shop, at a restaurant, or at your church. There are endless possibilities here!;
, The mornings tend to be calmer since the day has not yet begun and a lot of times, there are less people walking about. The afternoons are also nice since you can make it a lunch/bible study if you wish and people can be more awake than in the mornings. The evenings are nice since more people are off work at that time so their schedules are more free than at other times in the day.

, Some Bible studies meet once a week while others meet every day. There are some bible studies that meet for a half an hour while others meet for an hour. Normally, 30 to 45 minutes is a good amount of time to spend getting into the word although don't feel obligated to adjust the amount of time spent in the study.

, You can invite anyone you want to. This group of women can be your friends, people from your church, or even people you don't know well.

Identify the book of the verse.,
Identify the chapter.,
Identify the verse number.,
Locate the verse within the chapter.",How to Look up a Bible Verse1," When Bible verses are listed, the first thing you’ll see is the name of a book. Use the table of contents in your Bible to locate that book within it. The table of contents is at the beginning of the Bible. Locate the name in the table of contents and turn to the page associated with the start of the book. The name of the book might be abbreviated or spelled out completely. Some books include:Exodus (Ex)
Genesis (Gen)
Numbers (Num);
, After the book name, you’ll see two numbers. The first number is the chapter. For example, in “John 3:16”, “3” is the chapter number. Look at the verse and determine which chapter is is from in the book.


Some people may cite Bible verse using abbreviations and Roman numerals. For example, Lev. xx:13 is the same as Leviticus, chapter 20, verse 13.
Locate that chapter within the book. You may be able to find the location of that chapter in the table of contents. If not, you can thumb through the specific book until you see that chapter.As with other books, it should clearly say, “Chapter __” at the top of the chapter.

, The second number after the book name is the verse number. This number should come after a colon (:). In the case of John 3:16, 16 would be the verse number.


If you're looking up a longer passage, there may be two numbers, separated by a hyphen (-). For example, in John 3:16-18, you're looking for verses 16,17, and 18.

, Once you’ve found the chapter, go through it until you find the verse. The verses go in numerical order, just like chapters. There should be a small number at the beginning of each sentence or a small group of sentences. This is the verse number. If you're looking for multiple verses, such as John 3:16-18, 17 and 18 would follow directly after 16."

Pray for the group.,
Read the passage that you are going to study with the women twice.,
Write down three questions that you think would be good discussion questions for the group.,
Make sure you make any arrangements necessary to get the place that you want to meet at.

",How to Start a Women's Bible Study2," Pray to God that he would open the minds of the women to the suggestions that he has for them. Also pray that their faith in Christ may grow.

, Write down any thoughts or questions that you have about the passage or even things that could be talked about with the ladies.

, Make sure that they are thought provoking so that the ladies can feed off of each others responses.

,"
"
Pray with the ladies before you begin.,
Have the ladies read the passage and then read the passage out loud.,
Pause for a second to let it sink in and then open it up for discussion.,
After the conversation has winded down, ask the ladies if the have any prayer requests.,
Close the study with prayer.,
Watch as the spirit of the lord makes these ladies grow!",How to Start a Women's Bible Study3," Again, pray for an open mindset and open hearts to what the Lord has to say.

, A good trick for this is to first give them a chance to find it and then read it quietly to yourself. Once you are done reading it, most of the ladies should be done reading. If it is a small group, you can ask them if most of them are done. Reading it silently and then out loud often reinforces it in the brain. Plus, the repetition of the passage helps people remember it easier.

, Remember the questions you wrote earlier? Pull these out and ask the ladies the questions on the sheet. Let the ladies share their thoughts about the scripture. Once you have asked at least 3 questions, open it up for anyone to share their thoughts about the passage. This will create an openness and break any ice that might be there.

, Write down these prayer requests in a notebook so that you can pray for them throughout the week.

, Pray for those who requested prayer and thank the lord for the time that he has provided to have a bible study.

, You have created a wonderful resource to all women alike to enhance their walk with Jesus!

Choose a concordance.,
Search for a word from the verse.,
Search for other words if necessary.,
Locate the verse from the concordance list.,
Try another translation if necessary.",How to Look up a Bible Verse2," A concordance is a book that lists every instance of a word’s appearance in the Bible. This is a great tool if you remember the verse, or part of the verse, but you don’t know which book or chapter it came from.Concordances can be found through religious retailers or online. Your church may also have one that you can borrow.

, Remember an important word from the verse. Look it up in the concordance the same way that you would look it up in a dictionary. Concordances are alphabetized.Choose a distinctive word that may have limited occurrences, such as “flood,” “mountain,” or “rubies.” If you choose something like “love” or “evil” you’re likely to find an enormous number of results.

, If you find too many results, or you don’t see the verse you’re looking for, try searching for another word. For example, if you remember the phrase, “love must be sincere” and you searched “love” but found too many results, try looking up, “sincere.”, The concordance will list all of the places where that word is found in the Bible. A complete concordance will give you some context so that you can be sure it’s the verse you’re looking for.Use the location that the concordance gives you (for example, Romans 12:9) to look up the complete verse and its context in your bible.

, Concordances are specific to translations. If you can’t find the verse you’re looking for, try a concordance for a different translation. For example, if your Bible translated a word to the English word “praise,"" but your concordance is for a Bible that translated that word as “worship,” it will be impossible to look up the verse."

, Do you remember a certain phrase of the verse? Maybe you remember one or two words and the name of the book it came from. Even if you can’t remember very much, you can likely still look up the verse., Type in everything you can remember. You should also include the words “Bible” and “verse” to make sure that you get results that are relevant to your search.Your search terms may be something like, “Bible verse about wives in Psalms,” or “Bible verse chapter 7 desert.”

, There are plenty of sites online that catalog Bible verses by subject or by book. You can use one of these websites to search for the verse. Type in a keyword or a subject. You may also be able to do an advanced search by book or chapter.These online tools can be great ways to find other verses that may be relevant to you or helpful in your studies or prayers.

, If you can’t remember any exact words from the verse, or your search is not going well, search related words. For example, if you searched for “stars” and didn’t find anything, you could search for “night” or “sky” or “heavens” to see if the verse shows up. It’s possible you’re using a different translation or that you misremembered details about the verse."

Remember, you have the Lord on your side!,
Know your stuff.,
Talk with a priest.,
Remember that you do not worship Mary or the Saints.,
The Eucharist IS the Body of Christ.,
Remember that purgatory is not that strange of a concept.,
Pray.,
Remember that all religions went through difficult periods.",How to Handle Anti Catholic Persecution," In Matthew 16:18, Jesus said this: ""'I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of Hell will not overpower it.'"" The Church built on Peter is the Catholic Church, and it has Jesus' personal promise of protection!;
, Perhaps one of the most intimidating things about being a Catholic-under-fire is that the Protestants around you seem to know so much more than you! Read the Bible, especially the New Testament, and you'll find that it fits perfectly with, and indeed supports, Catholic teaching. What's more, read up on some Catholic apologetics in books and on the web. Catholic Answers is a great website with free articles on how to defend the faith, as well as forums for any questions you have left.

, Catholic priests are highly educated in Church teachings and well-trained in providing counsel to victims of persecution. The criticisms that people use today are as old as the Church itself.

, Catholics believe that it is possible to pray (""speak"" if you will) to souls in Heaven, particularly to ask their support and prayer. The traditional and logical choice is someone who had a very close relationship with God during their life on earth. Mary and the saints meet those qualifications. Catholics believe there is no difference between asking your mother to pray for you and asking Mary to pray for you. Toss some Greek in if you want. There are three words used regarding prayer. The first is ""latria."" This is the type of worship that is adoration and due to God alone. The second is ""hyperdulia."" This is the kind of veneration due to Mary as the Theotokos (""God-Bearer""). Then there is ""dulia."" This is the form of veneration due the saints.

, The Eucharist is often a very difficult idea to explain, but know that you have scriptural backing. Check out John 6:51-65. Jesus clearly says that to achieve salvation, one must ""eat his flesh and drink his blood."" To say this, He used the most graphic Greek words in existence, which actually translate to something more like ""gnaw,"" or the way a cow eats. Many of his followers LEFT Him because of this statement, and He never called them back to explain that it was only a symbol. If people were willing to leave Him because of this statement, it is clear that He was being literal.

, The Jews regularly prayed for the dead. The early Christians regularly prayed for the dead. The concept that only Heaven and Hell exist is less than a thousand years old. What's more, there is scriptural support for the doctrine in books of the Bible which Protestant reformers conveniently removed during the Reformation (such as Maccabees). All ancient Christians believe in this dogma in one way or another. Check out this website for more details.

, There is perhaps no better way to overcome persecution than to pray for the Holy Spirit to guide your words in the Church's defense and your heart in its steadfast faith.

, In fact, all human institutions went through difficult periods. Rejecting Catholicism simply because of past transgressions would be the same as rejecting the United States of America because of manifest destiny or slavery. Both the Church and the United States have reformed since those days. And once again- never forget that this Church has Jesus' personal protection, as he promised in scripture.

Cut the twine into segments approximately 20 feet long.
Use arm-span as a tool to estimate 20 feet.
Unroll the roll of twine until it is the length of your arm span. (The arm span of a person of average height is approximately 5 feet.)
Unroll the twine until it is the length of four arm spans. This will be approximately 20 feet. ;
,


Use scissors and cut the end of the twine at the length you previously measured.
Do not burn yourself or get molten nylon on anything; it does not come out.
Use the lighter to burn the cut ends of the twine.
Do not let the ends of the twine fully catch on fire.
If the ends catch on fire, quickly blow them out.

,


Lay the 20 foot piece of twine on the ground in front of you and find one end.
Hold the end of the twine in your left hand
Measure out approximately 1 foot of twine between your left and right hand.
Hold your right hand at the other end of the foot of twine.

,


Hold out your left hand at the end of the one foot of twine away from the end.
Drape the long end of the twine over your finger. (Give your pointer finger a sash.)

,


Do not wrap twine around your fingers tight enough to lose circulation.
Wrap the twine around your pointer finger 3 times. The loops around your finger should be wrapped from the tip of your finger in towards your hand.
Remove the loops from your pointer finger by sliding them off and gripping them between your pointer finger and your thumb.
Take the remainder of the twine (~19ft) and poke it through the middle of the loops created by wrapping the twine around your finger.
Pull the rest of the twine toward you.
Using both hands maneuver the knot into the desired position. Tighten the knot slowly. Pulling the knot to the left of the working twine while you tighten it will cause the knot to settle more closely to the left and vice versa.
Once your knot is in the position you want it, pull both ends of the twine evenly and tighten the knot.

,


Hold the previously tied knot in the crease of your pointer finger, and drape the twine over your pointer finger.
Follow the knotting process again to tie another small, 3-loop knot about 3 centimeters away from the previous one.
Repeat this process until you have created a total of 10 small, 3-loop knots.

,


To make a larger knot, add a little more spacing. Drape the twine over your finger as you did before .
Allow the last knot to rest on the second crease on your finger.
Tie the knot the same way as you did before, except wrap the twine around your finger 4 times instead of 3.
Only make this knot once.

,


Start with a larger space that measures about two knuckle lengths.
Tie 10 more small (3-loop) knots, 1 big (4-loop) knot, 10 small knots, 1 big knot, 10 small knots, 1 big knot, 10 small knots.

,


Using the end after the last small knot (~5ft) and the first knot (~1ft), hold them together and drape over your finger the same way you have made the rest of the knots.
Wrap both strings around your finger together 2 times instead of the normal 3 and poke the ends of both of the strings through the resulting loop.
The resulting knot is larger than the 4 loop knots.

,


Using the longer of the 2 remaining pieces, tie a pattern of knots as follows:

1 large, 4-loop knot
3 small, 3-loop knots
1 large, 4-loop knot
1 small, 3-loop knot (this will be the top of the cross)


The image above shows the completed cross. Your current work should look like this figure minus the completed cross at the bottom.

,


Take the remaining long piece of twine that is not knotted and fold it in half. The very end of the twine should be touching the last 3-loop bead.
Cut the twine along the fold creating 1 detached untied piece of twine that is the same length of the remainder of the twine after the last knot.
Lay the partially completed rosary on the ground.

,


Pull the remaining long piece of untied twine straight out from the rest of the rosary.
Lay the free piece horizontally over the pulled out piece approximately 3 inches below the last knot.
Make the horizontal piece into an S shape by taking the left side and running the end under the pulled out piece connected to the last knot above where the twine is laying.
Take the right side and run the end under the twine to make the bottom of the S-shape.
Take the left exposed end of the twine and weave it over the piece of twine that is attached to the knots and through the loop created by the top of the S.
Push this knot up right against the last 3-loop knot
Tighten as much as possible.

,


Tie one 3-loop knot on either side of the S-loop knot.
Push these knots as close to the center knot as possible. Tighten them as much as possible.
Tie two 3-loop knots directly next to one another under the center S-loop knot of the cross.
Your collection of knots should look like one above. If it does not, untie the most recent knots and try again.
Make sure these knots are touching and are as tight as possible.

,


Cut the extra pieces of twine off the end of the knots (the ends of the cross and the large connector knot).
Make sure to cut them as close to the knot as possible while still leaving a little bit of twine to melt.
Do not burn yourself or get molten nylon on things, it does not come out.
Carefully, use a lighter to melt the cut ends of the twine. It will smell strange and the ends will turn black, but this will prevent the rosary from unraveling.
Blow on the melted portions to allow them to cool faster or dab them with a paper towel.

, Happy praying.

So take a moment to call to mind your behavior since your last confession -- from the smallest to the largest of sins. If you wish to pray to the Holy Spirit during this time for guidance, you may. Don't know where to start? Here are a few questions you can ponder:


Have I disobeyed any of the commandments?
Have I nourished my faith?
Has anything else in my life influenced me more than God?
Have I denied or doubted my faith?
Have I hurt others, either accidentally or purposefully?
Have I rejected any part of my faith?
Have I been forgiving?
What are the causes of my sins? What temptations do I surround myself with?;
, Most of us commit venial sins on the regular; they're nothing to be ashamed of, though forgiveness should still be sought. These are your everyday sins -- lying to a friend to get out of a party, using God's name in vain, etc. Then there are the mortal sins, which are no laughing matter. Three conditions must be present in order for a sin to be mortal:


It must be something serious
You must understand what you're doing at the time you're doing it
You must have done it according to your own free will

Keep in mind that whatever it is, your priest will keep your secrets. Whatever it is, he will not (and cannot) pass judgment or let your secrets out. Even under threat of death! He can be trusted. You needn't worry about the consequences of telling him. In fact, neglecting to tell him is a sin in itself!



, This can either be done by dropping in or making a phone call; many churches have designated times for confessions. Though a priest can usually be found at most times with enough looking, going to a scheduled session is easiest. However, a quick phone call or brief meeting and you can schedule a private session as well.


If you're nervous to go into the church, don't be! Many churches have publicized when confession is -- either on a sign outside the church or as part of the church bulletin, which can almost always be found at the entrances. Some are even up online!
Private sessions are a good idea if you have a lot to talk about. A normal confession may last 10 or so minutes. If you think yours will last a lot longer, feel free to ask for a private session.

, It's always a good idea to do a little prayer before confession to ensure that all goes well, nothing escapes your memory, and to ensure that your penitence is meaningful and true. You want to go in with nothing but the best of intentions.


A large part of a good confession is meaning it, is seeking forgiveness, is putting your heart and soul into it. Even if you sat down with the priest and only muttered out an, ""I hurt my friend"" between sobs of regret, that'd be so much better than listing out every sin you've committed since your last confession between eye rolls. It's all about being true and faithful. The act of confession is about contrition -- wholly rejecting sin.

, You could go directly into the confessional (provided there's no one else in there or waiting outside), but sometimes it's nice to take a minute in the pew by yourself beforehand. You have this beautiful church probably almost all to yourself. Can you feel its energy resonating through you? Can you feel the majesty of the Lord's kingdom and how you're a part of it?


Take a moment to kneel and pray with your head down and hands clasped together. Reflect on your faith and how you feel currently. Think about how you've been responding to God's call and how you've been living in the light of his love.

, When the priest is ready for you, of course. You'll probably see him there by his lonesome or someone else walk out just before you. Sit down either across from him or behind the screen -- it's totally up to you whether or not you prefer to remain anonymous. He won't treat you any differently either way.


Make the sign of the cross upon his prompt, saying, ""Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been (blank) since my last confession."" This is your standard, traditional phrasing. However, if you just sit down and say hello, that's fine, too. The priest knows what he's doing.

The Byzantine Rite is a bit different. The priest may sit to your side and put his epitrachelion on your head. He may then also do the Prayer of Absolution. But the idea remains the exact same -- just go wherever he takes you.



, Once you sit down and you've made the sign of the cross, just sit back and follow the priest's lead. He'll ask you how long it's been since your last confession (if you don't voluntarily offer that information), how you are feeling, maybe how your faith is going, and then ask you what sins you would like to talk about with him and God. It's just a casual conversation!


Do not fret. There is absolutely zero pressure on your part. Again, as long as you come there with the intention of leaving with a clean heart, you're more than welcome in the church. There is no wrong way to go about confession!

, This part is intimidating, but think about it this way: the priest you're talking to has probably heard just about everything before. Whatever you have to say will not blow his mind. So when he asks, start rattling them off, from the most serious to the least. If he asks any questions, answer them, but do not feel the need to go into detail. A simple, ""I did so and so,"" will suffice.


Your priest is going to be very understanding. If you don't remember the exact timeframe, that's fine. If you don't remember your motivation, that's fine. All your priest cares about is that you're being as honest as possible and that your heart is in the right place.

, He'll talk you through everything, possibly asking about your intentions, but mainly just letting you know that God loves you, sin and all. If he has any ideas to bring you closer to God, he may suggest them at this juncture. He's there to help, after all. He will then ask you to make an Act of Contrition. That goes like this:


My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.
In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,
I have sinned against You whom I should love
above all things. I firmly intend, with your help,
to do penance, to sin no more, and
to avoid whatever leads me to sin.
Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.
In his name, my God, have mercy

, Don't worry! It won't be anything huge. You may even walk away just having to say a few meaningful prayers. Take the absolution to heart -- you now have a brand new, clean slate to work with. It'll feel so uplifting!


Just to clarify, ""absolution"" means your sins are washed away. ""Penance"" is your expression of regret and repentance, showing God that you're truly sorry for what you've done and that you wish for nothing more than to be forgiven.

, The priest will give you a ""Go in peace to love and serve the Lord,"" or something very similar. Smile, thank him, walk out, and be excited! Your sins have been forgiven and you have a clean slate to work with. You're that much closer to God. Can you feel it? Now what are you going to do with your fresh start?


If you forgot a sin you wished to mention, don't fret. God knows of your intentions and it has been forgiven along with the others. However, you may want to mention it next time. Or it could fester and turn into some unnecessary guilt!

, Many often choose to return to their pew and resume prayer, offering a silent thanks to God. And if your penance was a select number of certain prayers, there's no better time than now to channel God. So feel free to return to your seat and bookend your reconciliation with prayer.


Many reflect on their experiences and how they can avoid the sins in the future. When's the next time you plan on confessing? What can you do in the meantime to find inspiration to live in His image? Harden your resolve now to try to live as He intended.

, Whatever the priest suggested you do for penance is best completed as soon as possible. Whether that's in the pew or a conversation you need to have with a loved one, seek to fulfill His desires as soon as possible. You'll feel so relieved when all is said and done!


Upon completion of your penance, you may want to take a moment to thank God and revel in your absolution. Think about how much God loves you and how wonderful it is to be a part of His glory. Not everyone is so lucky!

, It is not expected that you never sin again. God knows that's ridiculous! It's only expected that you seek to avoid the situations that lead you to sin. It's also not wise to view confession as an excuse to sin! No, no, no. Confession is just a part of bringing humanity a bit closer to God, imperfections and all. All He wants is for you to do your best.


As you go about the next days and weeks, keep in mind God's part in your life and how you can strive to live as He desires. Seek out the scriptures for inspiration, and surround yourself with those who yearn to live in similar ways. In other words? Go forth to love and serve the Lord. Your Lord.

Come.,
Listen.,
Do your penance!,
Go.",How to Do Penance," Come to reconciliation. See a Priest and tell him what you have done. When you go in start by saying ""Bless me father for I have sinned, my last reconciliation was (blank) these are my sins..."" and don't hold back. He won't tell anyone, even if you committed a serious crime.;
, Listen to what the Priest says. He will tell you what good penance might be. It could be anything from 3 Hail Mary's, to just apologizing.

, If it's just a prayer, you can do it while you're still in the church. If you should apologize, go find the person or at least call them up!

, You have been cleansed of your sins. Go in hopes that you will not sin again.

Follow this tradition in Latin Rite and Protestant churches.,
Lift your right hand.,
Touch the fingertips of your right hand to your forehead.,
Touch the center of your chest.,
Touch the front of your left shoulder.,
Touch your right shoulder in roughly the same location.,
Say ""Amen"".,
Learn the small cross.,
Bless yourself when entering a church.",How to Cross Yourself1," This method is more common in the Western Catholic Church, and in Protestant traditions that support the sign of the cross, including most Anglican and Lutheran churches., Many worshippers make the sign of the cross with an open hand, their five fingers reminding them of the five wounds of Christ. Others raise the index and middle fingers together, symbolizing Christ's divine and human natures.The thumb is often bent to touch the ring finger in the two-finger position.


Many other hand shapes are also in use. There is no requirement to make a specific hand shape, but most leaders encourage you to follow your congregation's tradition unless you derive a spiritual benefit from another form.

, The sign of the cross is made in many contexts, both privately and in church. At the start of worship or when blessing yourself outside of church, it is usually accompanied by an invocation of the Holy Trinity. Begin ""In the name of the Father...""








Or in Latin: ""In nomine Patris...""

, Bring your hand down to your sternum. Say ""and of the Son..."" Some people place their left hand on their breast during the sign, and touch the right hand a little higher than it.








Latin: ""...et Filii...""

, Say ""And of the Holy...









Latin: ""...et Spiritus...""

, Say ""...Spirit.""









Latin: ""...Sancti.""

, You may place your hands together.









In many Latin countries, it is common to make the small cross with your thumb (see below) and kiss it before saying Amen. In the Philippines, this gesture has evolved into simply touching the thumb to the chin.

, Some of the first Christians to bless themselves formed a cross with their thumb and index finger and placed it on their forehead.Today, Roman Catholics make the sign with the same hand shape before the Gospel reading at Mass. Place the small cross first on your forehead, then on your lips, then on your breast.









There are many interpretations for this blessing. One common one asks you to approach the Gospels with an open mind, confess them with your mouth, and safeguard it in your heart., If you are part of the Latin Rite, it is traditional to bless yourself when you walk into a church. Dip your fingers in the font of holy water, then make the sign of the cross. You may use the large or the small cross.









Many Catholics also bless themselves when walking past a church, and after receiving communion.

Consider recommitting to your baptismal name.,
Understand the significance of the confirmation name you choose.,
Research the lives and spiritual commitments of the saints.",How to Choose Your Confirmation Saint," The 3 Sacraments of Initiation (Baptism, Eucharist and Confirmation) each mark significant milestones in the lives of young Catholics. The bond between baptism and confirmation is perhaps the most direct. The Catechism says that confirmation is the deepening of baptismal gifts as bestowed by the Holy Spirit. Church leaders, therefore, encourage youths to reinforce that connection by accepting their baptismal name for confirmation. Keeping one's baptismal name constitutes a formal renewal of the graces bestowed at baptism.;
, Many young Catholics choose a new Christian name for confirmation. This is in no way a renunciation of their baptismal names, but rather, it symbolizes their entering a new stage of their lives as Catholics. This important spiritual conclusion complements the conscious decision to pursue the sacrament. The confirmation name you choose can be the name of a Catholic whom you admire or a patron saint whose life was dedicated to pursuits similar to you own.

, Many confirmation-age Catholics study the lives of patron saints and take the name of the one whose life most closely parallels their own. There are several thousand beatified saints whose lives and testimonials of faith are well-documented. Saints had roles in virtually every walk of life, including:


Occupations and activities: All saints had devoted relationships with God and the Church, but not all were clergy. Saint Luke the Evangelist was a patron of artists. Other saints were physicians and apothecaries, poets and writers, and soldiers and servants.
Religious life: Perhaps the largest group of saints is those whose backgrounds are directly linked to the Church. Saint Pope Pius X used Vatican finances to build hospitals and care for the poor. Other saints with formal roles in the Church include priests and nuns, cardinals and bishops, and missionaries and monks. Many led colorful lives of personal achievement and sacrifice that young Catholics often find inspirational.
Physical and spiritual conditions: The Church lists saints whose faith endured despite severe personal hardship. Saint Ava of Denian was born blind but was healed by faith. Other saints faced similar obstacles, like deafness or debilitating disease that some Catholic youths can relate to. Some rose to sainthood after leading lives of martyrdom and slavery.
Particular interests: Confirmation candidates with a deep interest in animals can research the stories of the patron saints of specific creatures. Young athletes may choose Saint Sebastian as their spiritual guide. Sebastian was known for his physical prowess and endurance.
Cities and nations: People with a strong connection to their communities and countries may wish to take the name of a saint of that region. Many Catholics who aspire to public service will research saints who took a similar path in the military or government.

Hold your right thumb, index, and middle fingertips together.,
Bring your hand from your forehead to the top of your stomach.,
Cross yourself from right to left.,
Recite a blessing.",How to Cross Yourself2," In Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, most people use the three-finger blessing. Your fingers represent the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity, brought together in the Godhead. Tuck the other two fingers into the palm of your hand, representing the Two Natures of Jesus Christ (meaning He is fully human and fully divine).This ancient practice likely dates back to the 400s.







, First bring your hand to your forehead, then down to your solar plexus. Some people place it on their chest instead, as in the Western tradition, but others are concerned that this makes an inverted cross, with a short lower end. (The inverted cross traditionally symbolizes humility, but has been used by anti-Christian groups.)









You can instead bring your hand all the way to touch the ground. This is sometimes used during the Great Fast of Easter, or in times of great trial., Unlike the Latin tradition, the Eastern cross starts at the right shoulder and ends on the left. This is a tradition from many centuries ago, and was once shared by the Western church.







, There are many ways to do this. Here are two examples, separated with slashes to mark where you move your hand:









""Lord / Jesus Christ / Son of God / have mercy on us.""“My hope is the Father. / My refuge is the Son. / My protection is the Holy Spirit. / Holy Trinity Glory to Thee.”"

Research the lives of saints.,
Choose a name associated with Christian virtue or ritual.,
Talk to your priest.,
Ask the godparents for advice.,
Think about the religious history and future of your family.,
Symbolize the new beginning in your faith.",How to Choose a Baptismal Name," Many people like to choose a Biblical name for their children. If you want to give yourself or your child a baptismal name that reflects a saint, find a saint you admire.


Conduct an Internet search of Catholic saints. You will find names and descriptions that may inspire you.
Read books about saints. Check out the reference section of the library, or browse your local bookstore. There are also books of baby names that have specific sections on religious names.;
, You can keep a Christian feeling around the name without using the name of an actual saint.

, When you choose to baptize yourself or your child, your church will want you to work with a pastor or a priest. He will help prepare you and your family for the sacrament of baptism.

, The godparents are appointed by the infant's parents to help with some of the ritual functions of the baptism, and to provide spiritual leadership and guidance to the parents and child. Ask the godparents you have chosen if they have any thoughts on what to choose as a name.

, Some parents decide to give their children names that are honored or cherished by the family.

, If you are an adult being baptized, you can keep your own name that was given at birth. Or, you can select a separate baptismal name to indicate your new identity. This is uncommon, but you have the option.

Sit down with yourself for a serious talk.,
Read the Bible and the Catechism.,
Know your circumstances.,
Visit local Catholic churches.,
Attend Mass.,
Pray.,
Contact the Parish Office of your chosen church.,
Talk to a priest or deacon.,
Start your Catholic education classes (RCIA).,
Complete the season with a sponsor.,
Begin the period of purification and enlightenment.,
Become a full-fledged Catholic.,
Begin the period of mystagogy.",How to Become Catholic," Becoming a Catholic will change the rest of your life. It's not like deciding to be a hipster or marking ""Y"" on your driver's license to be an organ donor. This will become a part of you and it's not something you want to do half-heartedly. Sure, there are shiny lights at Christmastime, but those can't be the basis for your faith (pretty though they are).


Are you familiar enough with the teachings of the Catholic church to be able to say that you know this is something you want to be a part of? If the answer is yes, great! Keep on reading. If you're not so sure, seek out a friend or a member of the clergy for information. And there's always the Internet!
Do you believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the true Messiah? Do you have faith in the Holy Trinity -- the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit? How about the Virgin Mary and transubstantiation? Yes? Great! Moving on.;
, The Catechism (you probably know what the Bible is, huh?) is basically a set of instructions for Christians in the form of questions and answers. It may be just the source you need to seal the deal!


If time isn't on your side, read Genesis and the Gospels. You'll get a good grasp on the creation story and the story of Jesus. What's more, when you do talk to a priest and express your interest, it'll be clear you've done your homework.

, If you have no prior history with the Catholic church, you'll be going through the process outlined in this article -- namely, RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults) classes and getting the full head-to-toe spa treatment at next year's Easter Vigil (Baptism, Confirmation, etc.). However, if you've been baptized but nothing else or have other previous ties to the Church, your process may be a bit different.


If you've been baptized, but your initiation process stops there, you may not need to take RCIA classes. It all depends on your education and desires. Most baptized people will go through a much shorter period of inquiry and reflection and can join the church on any Sunday., It's not too hard -- just look under the yellow pages of the phone book under ""Churches"" or wander around your neighborhood. They'll be the big, pretty buildings with crosses on top, hint hint. Alternatively, search on the internet for churches and their Mass times. There is also an app for that - MassTimes is free and uses your GPS to show you what Roman Catholic Churches are in your immediate area.


Sure, finding one is good, but finding 4 is great. Think about churches the way you would think about college. They'll all offer you an education, but each one will be very different from every other. One church may turn you off while another feels like home. If you haven't found one that speaks to you, keep looking.

, You wouldn't buy a car without test driving it, would you? Going to church is not a privilege reserved for those in the elite Catholic club, so attend! Anyone is welcome and no questions will be asked if you do choose to go. Go with a Catholic friend who can explain when to do things and what they mean. While you won't participate in Communion, you will participate in everything else. And no, no one will notice (or care) that you didn't go up to receive the Eucharist! The church is welcoming of all.


Don't let a particular Mass or church influence your decision. Most churches have a fair amount of variation in services. Many churches often offer ""teen Masses"" or ""guitar Masses"" as well as Masses in different languages corresponding to the local minority community. Additionally, your enjoyment of the sermon may depend on the priest who is celebrating that particular Mass. So search around! There are plenty of options out there.

, Just because you're not a seasoned veteran of the Catholic church doesn't mean you can't pray. And it definitely doesn't mean God can't hear you! Take some time out of your day to pray and see how it feels. If it relaxes you or connects you to a deeper level, that's a good sign.


You're not necessarily looking for answers when you pray. Just a little talk with someone up there (saints included!) to show your appreciation, ask for help, or just to relax with and take in the moment. It can be done anywhere, anytime, anyplace, and through thought, words, singing, or action.

, Inform them of your desire to convert and you're on your way! There are group classes, called RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults), for all people wishing to convert within a period, giving you a social framework for assimilating the experience. But before you start, you'll have to go through the ""precatechumenate"" process -- which basically means talking to a priest, reflection and attending Mass regularly. It's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds!


Sometimes churches work like schools in that you're only allowed to go to the one designated by your geographical area. If you find one that is further away and this is the rule in your diocese, just get a letter from your local parish allowing you to attend your desired church., He will ask you why you wish to become Catholic and in general, talk to you to be sure you are sincere in your desire and are aware of the conditions of being Catholic. If you both are ready to move forward, you will begin in the RCIA.


During a Mass, you (and everyone else in your ""term"") will publicly announce your intentions through the Rite of Acceptance into the Order of Catechumens and the Rite of Welcoming.Don't worry -- there's no public speaking involved. You are no longer in the pre-catechumenate process and have stepped forward to being a catechumen!, You will learn the history of the Church, the beliefs and values of the Catholic Church, and the proper order of celebration of Mass. During this stage, many classes have you attending Mass for only part of the time, leaving before communion, as you may not receive Eucharist until you have entered the Church.


However, you'll be involved in many other ways! You will receive anointing, participate in prayers, and become involved with the community at large. Not to mention, your class will become closer and closer and do things on their own time.

, Most RCIA classes take place over the course of one liturgical cycle. That way, you get to experience all the feasts, fastings, and holidays. In this time, you'll receive a sponsor -- or, if you have one in mind, you can choose one to work with. They're just there to help, answering all the questions you may have.


During this time, you may be asked to clarify your marriage status. If you are divorced but have not received an annulment, you will need to obtain one before becoming Catholic. If you are married but not by the eyes of the Catholic church, you may be asked to get ""remarried,"" (or have your marriage ""blessed"") which can -- believe it or not -- be done by appointment., Once the end of the liturgical cycle nears, you will be deemed ""an elect."" This is the part where you'll prepare for three public celebrations: the Rite of Election, the Call to Continuing Conversion, and the deal-cincher at the Easter Vigil.


The first two listed are at the beginning of Lent. When the 40 days are up, at the Easter Vigil you will be baptized, confirmed, and receive Eucharist. Yayyyyy!

, After the Easter Vigil (a truly memorable, beautiful experience), you are now a proud, valued member of the Catholic church. All your hard work and studying has paid off and you're good to go. Welcome!


In case you're curious, for the Sacraments, no, you don't really have to do anything. Showing up with a smile on your face and good intentions in your heart is really all that's required. There's no memorizing, no actions, and no final test. The church is just glad you're here. The priest will take care of the work!

, Sounds magical, doesn't it? Technically, it's a lifelong process of becoming closer to God and delving deep into your Catholic beliefs. Non-technically, it ends around Pentecost and is a fancy term for exploring your experience through catechesis.


Some churches may continue to ""teach"" you (more like guidance when needed) for up to a year. You're still considered a newbie and may ask all the questions you need! Really, they're just there to help. Then it's out of mother's nest and into the heavens!

First you must determine whether or not you have the Holy Spirit installed in your heart.,
Be baptized and begin to submit yourself to Him, for if you do not you break your connection with the Spirit and lose the ability to hear Him.,
Begin your time with the Bible with a prayer… it might go something like this; “Father God, I ask you now to come and teach me by your Holy Spirit.,
Begin to read the Bible, choosing a time when you will not be interrupted.,
Think or meditate upon what you have read as you drive, wash dishes; just go about your day.,
Respond to Him as you come to know and understand His Word and, thereby, Him!,
Have faith that the Holy Spirit is teaching you; knowing that He is the Teacher that Jesus selected for you to begin with!",How to Let the Author of the Bible Teach You the Bible," He isn’t called the ‘holy’ Spirit for nothing and will not live in anyone who has not been cleansed and forgiven of all sin. If you have not done so, you must repent of all known sin and surrender your life to Jesus Christ; becoming indwelt by this Spirit. This is really a simple step to take if you are a sincere person and truly desire to know God and the Bible. Romans 10:13 “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” He will immediately respond to you by coming to live within you by His Holy Spirit. That will equip you to learn, and you may now be taught by that Spirit living within you.;
, He is still there but He will not respond to you when you are not responding to Him and the Word of God (which is your manufacturer’s manual in a sense). He says baptism is step two and part of the process!

, I really want to understand and I ask for your help. Teach me what you would have me to know and help me to walk in what you show me. In Jesus’ name, Amen.” You don’t have to pray that every time, but that should be your heart’s attitude… wanting to truly know His Word and Him.

, Just as you would take a pleasant walk, read your Bible that way, taking your time. If something kind of strikes you, stop and reread that part. Take a moment to reflect on it before you go on. First, read simply, not trying for hidden meanings; just take it at face value. Relax and know that the Holy Spirit is programming you as you read; installing the Word of God within you. Follow the story line and just go with it. Go for quality; not quantity. You don’t have to follow any prescribed program unless you want to. Lay it aside when you want to and go about your business.

, This gives the Holy Spirit the time and opportunity to teach you. He will begin to open the Word for you. Think of how it applies to your own life, giving the Spirit time to develop the thought He is giving to you. If what you read has raised questions in your mind, go back, take it up again and reread it. Break the verse down by portion, considering each part and what it means to you. He shows you a mystery to draw you to deeper meanings, sometimes… intriguing you to follow. Pr 25:2 “It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honor of kings is to search out a matter.” (As you grow more accustomed to reading you will begin to use the cross-references and other aids to help you navigate by subject and so forth as you go deeper into His Word.)

, If you are so inclined, pray about what the Holy Spirit is showing to you… perhaps you have been guilty of some selfishness or sin that He is revealing to you. Perhaps He is simply correcting some error or misunderstanding you have lived with. (The Bible is truth and overturns misconceptions in our life and blesses us with new understanding.) You come into a closer relationship and accelerate your learning process in that way for He responds also!

, Right before His crucifixion Jesus began to tell the disciples that He would be leaving them but that He would return to them as this Holy Spirit. “If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of Truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but ye know Him; for He dwells with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.” (John 14:15-18) Jesus also explained the Spirit’s function. “But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.” (John 14:26 ) There you have it, His promise that the Spirit would do this thing we ask!

Establish the fact that Jesus talks to the the people in parables usually and is usually literal with his disciples.,
Quote what Jesus said at the last supper.,
Bring up what Jesus told the Jews in the synagogue multiple times, and the fact that his disciples were in such disbelief and disgust when he claimed to be the bread, that they left him.,
Point out that in all the things Jesus says, he uses the word ""gnaw"" (a translation from ""Trogo"" in Greek), ""this is my body"", and ""flesh"".,
Point out all the Eucharistic miracles.",How to Defend Real Presence in the Eucharist," You can conclude those two things by closely scrutinizing this passage


Matthew 13: 10 The disciples approached him and and said, ""Why do you speak to them in parables? 11 He said to them in reply, ""Because knowledge of the mysteries of heaven have been granted to you, but to them it has not been granted.
;
, This is the weaker of all the evidence supporting Real Presence, but should be said first. Even in this, Jesus is very clear. He did not say it as part of a parable. He says ""this IS my BODY"". The sacrifice of his body at the last supper appears almost identical in the three gospels.


Matthew 26: 26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and giving it to his disciples said, ""Take and eat; this is my body."" 27 Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, ""Drink from it, all of you, 28 for this is my blood of the covenant, which will be shed on behalf of many for the forgiveness of sins.

Mark 14: 22 While they were eating, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, and said, ""Take this; this is my body."" 23 Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it. 24 He said to them, ""This is my blood of the covenant, which will be shed for many.""

Luke 22: 19 Then he took the bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, ""This is my body, which will be given for you; do this in memory of me."" 20 And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, ""This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which will be shed for you.""


, When the Jews wondered is Jesus was being literal, he repeated his words.


John 6: 51 ""I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world."" 52 The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying, ""How can this man give us (his) flesh to eat?"" 53 Jesus said to them, ""Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you. 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him. 57 Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever.""59 These things he said while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.60 Then many of his disciples who were listening said, ""This saying is hard; who can accept it?"" 61 Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this, he said to them, ""Does this shock you? 62 What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63 It is the spirit that gives life, while the flesh is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe."" Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him. 65And he said, ""For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father."" 66 As a result of this, many (of) his disciples returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him.

Recall the books of the Bible.",How to Find Any Book in the Bible in Under 10 Seconds1," Start with memorizing the New Testament, then repeat these steps with the books of the Old Testament. You can follow these steps with any Bible that you want to use. This article describes how to memorize the books of the Protestant Bible, but it can easily apply to any other Bible, as well. Get out a Bible and look at the Table of Contents in the front of the book. You can also go online to see a list of the books of the Bible.

, You can set the books of the Bible to a tune like Jingle Bells or Yankee Doodle. Choose a simple song with a strong pattern that you are very familiar with.


Find a YouTube videos of people singing the books of the Bible to a song you know. , When you are singing the easiest way to memorize is to group the books, and then match the groups with the phrasing of the song. For example, chunk the books as follows, and sing it to Jingle Bells:


Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, and Romans - Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
First and Second Corinthians, Galatians, and Ephesians - Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Phillipians, Colossians, First and Second Thessalonians - Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
First and Second Timothy, Titus and Philemon- Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Hebrews, James, First and Second Peter, First and Second Third John- Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Jude and Revelations the books of the New Testament. - Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

, Practice singing the song, again and again, until it sticks. Sing the books of the Bible so many times that singing them becomes second nature. Practice by writing the books on a piece of paper or on a whiteboard.
Erase the books or fold the paper when you think you have a group memorized.
Keep practicing until you have all of the books completely memorized.

, When someone asks you to go to a book of the Bible, think about which group contains the book. This will only take you a few seconds to do in your mind. Start flipping to the section of the Bible you think it is in while you process the book order in your head.


For example, for Romans you would remember the group order goes Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, Acts and Romans. You know this chunk is at the very beginning of the New Testament. The New Testament starts around two-thirds of the way through the Bible. So you would flip to two-thirds through, and look for any of those grouped books. Once you find one, keep flipping more slowly until you get to Romans.
If you are having difficulty finding a group of books, think about the next group. For example, if you are looking for Colossians and you can't find Philippians, Colossians, First and Second Thessalonians, look for First and Second Timothy, Titus and Philemon. Once you find the later chunk, you can then flip back to find Colossians.

Realize that the Bible is not one single book, but is made up of the sacred texts of many people over a long period of time.,
Understand that the Bible may contain apparent conflicting views, but the Bible is an essential document for anyone trying to understand the evolution of human spirituality.,
All translations will have flaws, because the Bible was penned by human beings, but inspired by God.,
Understand that many Christians have believed that Jesus is God's Living Word (Logos) and that the Bible is a record of truths / beliefs written down by humans.,
Understand that the Bible is a historical book and that, while some of its messages may be applicable today, not all may seem to apply.

,
Know the central theme of God's message to you is to love God with all your might and all your strength, and to love others as yourself, both in the Old and New Testaments.

,
Look for Jesus in each book.,
Approach it expectantly.,
Understand that the hardest part of Bible study is in getting started.,
Set a daily study time.,
Soon you will notice that a desire to attend your study has developed and you will find it getting very enjoyable and much easier.,
Suddenly you may realize that you have missed your appointment for several days in a row and you may feel terrible about yourself.",How to Gain Understanding of the Bible," It should not be surprising that it contains many internal variations, as it did not go through a systematic compilation all at once. The process which created the Bible involved many different cultures, and therefore many different motivations. If you can accept this, it will enrich your study by giving you the power to see the beauty of the evolution of ideas.;
, Talk with others about what you are reading, look at good biblical commentaries and pray often.

, Remember that, with diligence, you can resolve these conflicts by comparing the Bible with other texts from the same time period. For this reason, it is OK to start with any translation. The NIV is the most understandable version, but the King James version is the most accurate. The NKJV is a good compromise, accurate and understandable. If it is the truth you seek, your journey will never end.

, All the stories we have of Jesus were written by humans, who can make errors. So we must not accept any one text as authoritative. The only safety is found in a process of comparing and contrasting between the many available sources found within and outside of the Bible.

,,, All scripture either points to the cross or refers back to it.

, Expect God to reveal Himself, answer your questions, and change your life for the better.

, So be patient with yourself and work toward consistency. Five minutes per day is much better than an hour once a month. A simple decision, followed by daily determination, is necessary.

, Routine is very important. Treat it like an appointment that you cannot miss. Scheduling your study time first thing and then everything else around it is always best.

, Surprise!

, Disappointment may follow. Don't worry. Just pick up where you left off and stay in the flow. Regularity will develop over time. Always have grace with yourself in how much, or how often, you read the Bible. Don't be legalistic about it. Do it because you want to, not because you feel that you have to.

,
See whether or not there is a cross reference in your Bible--which is usually setup in two text columns, and then the cross reference may be found in the middle of the page in a very narrow column.,
Inspect the bottoms of most pages or above the beginning of each chapter, or in subtopic headings between groups of verses to see if your Bible has selected comments about the subject, meaning and/or history of the material in that chapter.

Verses are usually arranged with small numbers within the text. Some Bibles are formed into paragraphs and only have the number of the verse that begins each paragraph.

It is when a person denies the holy spirit to the point that their heart is hardened, that he can no longer hear the holy spirit. When the holy spirit talks to you and you cannot hear him because you rejected him to the point your heart is hardened, the holy spirit will leave you forever. Don't deny the holy spirit. Also, those that fear that they did commit blasphemy against holy spirit have not done so.

Or if you want to read some poetry and other deep writings, read Psalms, Proverbs, Isiah, Daniel or Songs of Solomon.

You may feel lost, if you start in the middle; if so go back a few chapters, or look for the part that you wonder about.;

You can read ahead of time or during Bible study, and then have discussions about the interpretation of unclear parts or analyze the characters to try to understand why they did what they did. This will make the Bible more fun to read because you get to learn more with others, and you are not alone. Even the best, heroic persons in the Bible made many and some horrifying mistakes by failing to follow the Father's principles of patience, love, forgiveness, making peace, overcoming doubts and all the odds (try checking God's word before and after conflicts).

, Keep a Bible journal near by to record your sightings and things you learned from the books. Don't forget to write down verses you like, or highlight them so you can find them later. The Bible is your guide to life, so take those verses to heart, and use them when you feel depressed, lonely or scared.

, Many just look at it as a myth, others as a religious book, but in reality, it is the word of God. There are many messages God is trying to tell you that you won't know unless you read it. Anytime learning about God should be enjoyable.

Become a poor in spirit.,
Take the suffering in your life.,
Be meek.,
Go the way of rightness.,
Be merciful.,
Purify yourself with spiritual exercises.,
Be a peacemaker.,
Let go of your ego.",How to Do the Sermon on the Mount (from the Perspective of Enlightenment)," Jesus meant poor in terms of the inner self, and not the outer self. Outer poverty does not lead automatically to inner happiness. Those who let go of outer attachments, can simply exist and find a way to inner contentment in God.;
, Suffering in and of itself does not lead to happiness. However, those who can take suffering in their lives and raise themselves through spiritual exercises, can find solace in inner peace. Mourning can help to let go, but one should not allow the self to be overwhelmed by grief. Grief is not the center of life, rather inner peace.

, Those who can greet their fellow beings with non-violence and placidity, can live in a relaxed and peaceful way and relinquish into a cosmic consciousness. Those who are at peace with all things, are at peace with themselves.

, Righteousness means rightness (correctness) in the Bible.To long for a correct life, means to long for a life in the light. Those who long for happiness and search for it in the right places will receive it one day.

, Those full of empathy, will feel with all other people. Those who love their enemies receive inner harmony. Those who love all other beings get a cosmic consciousness, enlightenment and holiness. They will experience the mercy of God.

, To dissolve inner tension, exercises for the body using yoga, going, meditation and exercises for the spirit through reading, reflecting, positive thinking are required. Those who exercise spiritually enough will reach enlightenment one day. They will feel and see the light of God in the world, in all beings and in themselves.

, Make peace in yourself and in the world. Inner peace is the first step to enlightenment. You will find God in inner silence. Work for a world of love and peace as a world saver. You will find God in the love of all beings. Peace and love are the two big steps to enlightenment. Those who are enlightened can be called holy, a son or daughter of God.

, The ego can be interpreted as Satan or sin. He who sacrifices his ego will be in the light. Without a sacrifice, the breakthrough to enlightenment cannot be made. Those who live strictly according to the Sermon on the Mount, provide such a spiritual sacrifice, because it is causing difficulties in their everyday. Correct to sacrifice is a great art. Who sacrifices wrong, gets inner tensions. Who sacrifices properly, solves his internal tensions. By the time he becomes enlightened and lives in the light (God, positivity, paradise view of life). We should not sacrifice too little or too much. Those who go the right way will be rid of their inner conflict.

Donate it.,
Have the Bible restored.,
Save the Bible.",How to Dispose of a Bible1," If the Bible is in reasonable condition, consider donating it to a person or to a charity that will use it. This allows someone else to experience the word of God who may otherwise not have had the opportunity. Below are just a few ideas for who you may want to donate your Bible to:


Churches, who may in turn donate the book to the needy.
Libraries, who may offer the book for checking out or sell it in a fundraiser.
Thrift stores, who can offer the book for relatively cheap to someone who may need it.
Christian homeless shelters, many of which offer prayer groups and bible study classes.
The Gideons (Gideons International), who are a Christian group dedicated to distributing the Bible worldwide free of charge.Another similar Bible-distributing charity. For example, some charities will send Bibles to countries where people are persecuted for reading the Bible.;
, Just because a Bible is old and worn doesn't necessarily mean it has to stay in that condition. Professional book repair and restoration services offer the ability to bring most old or damaged books back to a high level of quality (for a fee). Some of these services even allow you to ship your books to the restorers for repair.These types of services are a great choice for when your Bible carries some sort of sentimental significance. However, because restoration fees can be somewhat pricey, they may not make sense for ordinary Bibles.

, Alternatively, you may want to keep the Bible, storing it safely so that its condition deteriorates no further. Though the Bible will no longer be practical for everyday use, it may be able to serve as a family heirloom for you to pass down to your children.


This option is a good choice when the Bible has sentimental significance but is either too costly or too difficult to repair.

Show respect to the Bible.,
Bury the Bible.,
Cremate the Bible.,
Recycle the Bible.,
In special cases, defer to the advice of your personal priest or reverend.",How to Dispose of a Bible2," The Bible itself doesn't contain any special instructions for its own disposal. Though the word of God is considered by Christians to be holy and eternal, the physical document that contains the word is acknowledged as being neither. Still, with its millenia-long history, its billions of devotees, and its rich spiritual tradition, it's important to show the Bible the respect it is due, even if you're not Christian. Virtually any reasonable method of Bible disposal is appropriate as long as it's done with virtuous intentions and with careful respect.


To show your respect, you may want to recite a prayer (or prayers) that hold(s) special meaning for you as you dispose of your Bible, though this is by no means required.

Never destroy a Bible with a method that is deliberately irreverent. Though it's not inherently sinful to treat an object of paper and ink with disrespect, it is sinful to deliberately denigrate God.

, One way to dispose of an old Bible is to return it to the Earth with a respectful burial. The burial may be as ""involved"" as you'd like (within reason), though a humble burial is just as valid as one with more pomp and circumstance. Below are just a few ideas you may want to consider for your burial:


Gathering with family members in quiet reflection
Saying a prayer as the Bible is buried
Enlisting the help of a priest to bless the Bible
Marking the buried Bible's location with a small marker

, Another way to dispose of a Bible is to respectfully cremate it (similar to how many national flags are retired). Though some who wish to disrespect or desecrate God's word do so by burning it, there is nothing inherently wrong with burning the physical Bible so long as proper solemnity and respect are observed. Generally, burning a Bible means building a bonfire or pyre large enough to completely burn the book up, then carefully placing the Bible in the fire and reverently watching as the Bible is burnt.


As above, while cremating your Bible, you may want to consider saying a prayer, reflecting in silence, and so on.

, Finally, since the Bible is made out of paper, you may want to dispose of it by recycling it. This is an especially good choice if you're interested in serving God by preserving the natural beauty of his Earth, as recycling reduces the need to cut down trees for new paper.


However, for many, ""throwing out"" the Bible in the same way as they might throw out ordinary paper trash can feel wrong, regardless of the intent of the act. In this case, you may want to create a special vessel for the Bible to separate it from the rest of the trash by placing it in its own bag or box.

, Though most Christian churches will accept nearly all methods of Bible disposal so long as they are performed with good intentions and proper respect, some select Christian churches may hold that it is sinful to destroy the physical vessel of God's word regardless of how or why it is done. If you subscribe to the beliefs of this type of church, you will probably want to consult with a member of your clergy to ensure that you dispose of the Bible according to your church's unique rules.


In this case, follow the advice in the rest of this article only after receiving confirmation from a qualified member of your church.

"
"
Leave specific instructions in your will as to the disposal of your Bible.,
Be sure to designate where the dedicated Bible is generally located in your home.,
Have the deceased hold the Bible in the casket for viewing.

,
Have the Bible buried with you (or cremated) at the funeral.

",How to Dispose of a Bible3," Make sure your family knows where these instructions are located.


If you have a pre-paid funeral plan, make sure the funeral director knows of your wishes to have the Bible buried or cremated with you.

, This is especially important if you have more than one Bible.

Become Catholic.,
Live an exemplary and pious life.,
Perform at least two miracles.,
Die.",How to Become a Saint1," Modern saints in Roman Catholicism are all Catholic themselves, so if you have not yet been baptized and confirmed into the church, get on that right away.


If you have been living a life of sin so far, don't worry: many saints were sinners who underwent radical, life-changes when they joined the church. It's tricky, but you can still make sainthood if you have a miraculous conversion and then turn away from your debasements to take up a life of virtue.;
, There are lots of different ways to do this, from comforting the sick and dying to spreading the word of God, from fighting against poverty and oppression to devoting your life to scholarly study. Whatever you do, it has to be virtuous, selfless and memorable. Don't try explicitly to become a saint—just focus on being the best, most compassionate Christian you can be. Be humble and work to serve God and make a positive difference in the lives of others.


Joining the church as a priest or nun is a good start, but not required. The Vatican works hard to identify laypeople who are candidates for sainthood.
Think big! Some saints are honored for extraordinary service to a small group of people or local community, but your exemplary life is more likely to be recognized if you have a bigger, more globally noticeable impact.

, Miracles are extraordinary events not normally attainable through human works, and thus attributed to the intervention of a divine and supernatural power. Unexplainable healing of the incurably sick, wounded or dying is a classic, as is interceding to miraculously stop or rescue people from an impending disaster. Really, however, a miracle can be any inexplicable but benevolent phenomenon you can conjure up. Just remember, you aren't really performing these miracles: God is performing them through you.


You don't technically have to perform these miracles while alive—you could intercede from heaven to make your miracles happen instead. However it isn't as guaranteed that you will be recognized for the miracles you perform after your death, so it doesn't hurt to get this requirement out of the way as soon as possible.

, No getting around this one: sainthood is a posthumous title. In fact, the canonization process only begins minimum of five years after the subject's death.


If possible, try to be martyred for your faith. This happens less and less these days, but being killed because you refused to renounce your (Catholic) religious beliefs is sure to get you and your sainthood case noticed.

"
"
Develop a local ""devotion"" of people who remember your holiness and pray to you.,
Have your local bishop initiate a ""cause"" with the Vatican's Congregation for Sainthood Causes.,
Get investigated by the church.,
Be recognized by the pope as ""venerable."",
Have your first miracle verified and be ""beatified"" by the pope.,
Get that second miracle verified and become a saint.,
Answer prayers.",How to Become a Saint2," Hopefully this should grow naturally out of your extraordinary life and works.

, This will get the ball rolling, but you have a long way to go before the canonization process is complete.

, A postulate will pour over the details of your life, works and your writings. Any miracles attributed to you will also be thoroughly and skeptically investigated. Make sure everything is squeaky clean—nothing is off the table for this investigation, and a ""devil's advocate"" will be around arguing against your case.

, This is simply an acknowledgement that you lived an especially holy life, or were martyred, but it is the first step on the canonization process.

, After that you will be called ""blessed,"" and a feast day will be dedicated to you in your home diocese, your religious order, and in places significant to your life works.

, If the Vatican recognizes a second miracle attributed to you, the pope may then name you a Saint. You will be assigned a feast day that can be celebrated by Catholics everywhere, and churches can be named in your honor.

, Now that Catholics are officially permitted to venerate you, they can ask you to speak with God on their behalf.

Study the prophetic books of the Old Testament Look up a Bible Verse about the End of Time.,
Consider the entire prophecy of Joel in the section of the Bible called the book of ""Joel"" which all relates to the last days.,
Research that as the expected last of ""The Feast of Trumpets"" (using the Holy Shofars, originally made of ""rams horns"") for the Daniel 9:27 (treacherous) treaty for peace in the Middle East with a global peacemaker who will turn out to be a false messiah.,
Know that such evil and tyranny will ""not"" be able to stand for long before the true Messiah, ie: Jesus Christ, who will return to take leadership when and vanquish Satan's counterfeit, forgery and fraudulent Messiah and government...,
Get ready for the end times as a Christian described in the New Testament basically that will lead up to the return of Jesus Christ including The Rapture and His judgment of humanity and the world.,
Think about the year 1948"" which was when the secular state of Israel became established in the area of Ancient Israel and Judea near Jerusalem by a vote of the United Nations.,
Pray, meditate on the word, in the Bible, not the tabloids, then repent and receive the re-birth, be ""born again"" and avoid fear, confusion and many of the troubles to come; so be filled with the Holy Spirit, get right with God and be ready to go to Heaven.

",How to Explore Biblical End Times1," In the Old Testament, the primary passages on the end times are in


Isaiah through Malachi (including Daniel where there is much more that you can read).

The Resurrection was predicted in the ""TNH or Tanach,"" Hebrew Bible, with the same content as the ""Old Testament,"" by the prophet Daniel: ""Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt."", It features celebration, and also shock and awe.It is foretold that Israel will enter into a binding covenant with a global peacemaker for a term of seven years.

The prophet Daniel gives details of this Daniel 9:27.
Moses warned the ""covenant people"" of YHWH-God that their disobedience leads into tribulation in the latter days. This prophecy is recorded in Deut.4:29-31.
Jesus Himself spoke of ""His people"" entering into covenant with one who would come in ""his own name"" (not Godly). This is recorded in John 5:43.


About this, here are the prophet Joel's words to God's people about seeing this happening. Joel 2:15 - 17.


15 ""Blow the trumpet in Zion, Consecrate a fast, Call a sacred assembly;
16 Gather the people, Sanctify the congregation, Assemble the elders, Gather the children and nursing babes; Let the bridegroom go out from his chamber, And the bride from her dressing room.
17 Let the priests, who minister to the Lord weep between the porch and the altar; ...""



, It will be a day of combined celebration and alarm to those knowing/believing the prophecy.

,,


Every and any setting of the date of the end has been wrong, so far, but 2012 -- who knows. It's not in the Bible, ie:

the Bible does not set a particular day or hour (and any month or year is speculative: call it guesstimating). Why should one expect 2012 to be the end, but expect great piles of books and TV shows, and movies concerning that about ""planet alignments"" in or near 2012, and about ""planet X"" existence and passing and even a ""polar shift"" 2012. It may involve mostly dollar signs and question marks and may be comparable to the Y2K (year 2000) paranoia, but that doesn't prove anything about the present time...



,


70 years 10 X 7 (10 ""Sabbaths of years""), so look at the implications of 1948 + 70 = 2018. So why do some consider adding 70. Compare that to the destruction of the Temple by the Romans, that occurred 70AD. The Birth of Jesus until that destruction was about 70 years. Then it is thought by some that that would suggest the re-birth of the nation of Israel in 1948 + 70. Some use a scripture about the End of Time within one generation as Jesus said: ""I tell you the truth, this generation"" (including the re-birth of Israel) ""will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened."" Realizing that the length of a man's life is up to around ""120 years"" according to Genesis 6:3 may suggest that a reference to a generation may be longer than 70. ,"

Know that only ""...the Father knows the day and the hour."",
""...See that you are not troubled all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet...."", Jesus said about the wars and such. ,
Watch for events predicted by Jesus' in Matthew 24:4-44 summarized below::



Observe the troubles between nations:

There will be fears and rumors of wars but the end is not yet.",How to Explore Biblical End Times2," -- Jesus said that you may know the ""season"" of His return.There are always reasons to be positive, ie: we are part of the Father's plan, and we are promised blessings through Jesus Christ the Lord.;
,, (It's not just that. Wars are not new.) There is much more of other things.
Nations will be rising in wars among nations at the end in gruesome wars.



Recognize events in the earth and the heavens:

Multitudes will die in starvation due to famines such as drought and other changes in weather.
Many will die in earthquakes in a diverse variety of places.
There will be changes in the effect of the sun, moon, stars.




Expect false prophets coming in Jesus' name:

Many people will be deceived by false prophets (including people who set a fictitious -- guessing the -- date for the end).
False prophets will or may seem to perform signs and wonders.



Be looking for the following events among groups of individuals:

Expect persecution of believers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to shake believers if possible.
People's love of God decreasing (will grow cold) and becoming worse and worse.



Be aware of this encouragement: we are told to comfort one another as believers as you see the end approaching and the gospel is being preached to the whole world (the Bible predicts that) ""and then the end shall come.""Watch for a great impostor and the following events due to that one:

The ""abomination of desolation"" (involving a world leader who makes himself out to be God).
The great tribulation will be in progress and will soon be more clear...



Watch for Jesus' return -- expecting The Resurrection and The Rapture when the true followers will be taken up to Him:

Regarding the ""rapture,"" the event where Christ's born again followers are caught up to meet him in the air, some main texts for that are: Matthew 24:31, Mark 13:27, 1Corinthians 15:51-52, 1Thessalonians 4:16-17, and 2Thessalonians 2:1-4.



Realize this is when Jesus claims His own but later He will vanquish the enemies of God:

Jesus' is conqueror and champion coming with love and with judgment.
Jesus judges the people upon the earth for good and evil...

It is very helpful to photocopy the passage (or copy it to Word from an online Bible) and enlarge it to a size you can easily read at arm's length (e.g.,
Underline words to emphasize importance, and add extra commas to denote an extra or longer pause.,
Articulate the words naturally as if speaking extempore by eliding or combining the syllables as you normally would.,
Generally read a passage as if the author was addressing your audience, and in particular, an apostolic letter can be read as if the apostle himself were delivering the message.,
Avoid dramatic flourishes which draw attention to your performance rather than the Word.,
When reading, words need to be articulated properly, and in particular, consonants must be clear (using lips, teeth and hard palate).,
Don't rush, but read at a pace that allows emphasis on particular words, and puts pauses where needed.,
During preparation, pray for your Scripture reading and commit yourself to the Spirit's leading.,
In introducing the passage, maybe start with book and chapter (e.g.,
At the end, close using whatever is normal in the church, or perhaps close with the traditional exclamation: ""This is the Word of the Lord!""",How to Do an Exciting Scripture Reading," 14 point), and then mark it for emphasis.;

Know what sacristans do.,
Consider these typical requirements/qualities before applying for the position:


Sacristans are usually older than altar servers, and typically having once been one.,
Decide if this is something you think you can do.,
Ask around in the church community.,
Fill out the application, if you are given one.,
Ask to be trained.",How to Become a Sacristan," Duties vary greatly by community, but the basic jobs are these:


Preparing the Holy Eucharist for the celebration of the mass. This includes readying the wine, water, and bread and putting them in place for the start of mass.
Setting up the church. Typically, sacristans arrive at church before anyone else- often even the priest/celebrant. They light the candles, arrange the books, and basically perform a little housekeeping before mass begins.
Assisting the altar servers. Sacristans prepare and help the altar servers perform their basics duties before and during mass.

Note: Read Be an Altar Server to see what this position entails.


Cleaning the holy materials after mass. There is usually a sacristy, a room at the very front or back of the church reserved for this position, where the holy containers for the water, body, and blood are stored and cleaned. Everything is set back in its place in the sacristy before sacristans leave the church.;
, Being an altar server before sacristan can familiarize you with the ""behind-the-scenes"" order of the mass.
Sacristans must be responsible and mature. Part of this job is respecting the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Sacristans should not fool around with the holy materials or try to be funny; they are there to get the job done.
Sacristans should be reliable. Depending on the church, you may be asked to do this job anywhere from every week to once a year. Either way, make yourself available every time, and consistently be at church as a viable substitute or fill-in when needed.
Sacristans should be quick learners, and very organized. This will further help the order of the mass run smoothly.

, The sacristan position requires you to be responsible, reliable, and enthusiastic and willing to help out in any situation. Can you really commit to showing up every Sunday and sitting alone on the side, ready to jump up at the priest's beckoning call? Are you willing to sacrifice time with your family to assist the community? Keep this in mind.

, How you apply for sacristan depends greatly on the church. Check out the church bulletin and call up the office number, or send an email. Catch the priests after mass on Sunday, introduce yourself (if you have not already done so) and ask if the sacristan position is open, and if so, how to apply. Be polite.

, Don't lie to make yourself sound reliable; for example, if you know you're not in town for most of the summer, don't put down that you are available whenever they may call for you. Let your true good qualities shine through, and you are sure to be accepted as a decent candidate for the job.

, Experienced or past sacristans, or even priests or deacons are willing and happy to train a new sacristan. Listen carefully and pay attention to detail, because soon it will be you up there fulfilling that spot- are you ready?

"
"
Prepare for the task.,
Arrive at church at the very latest at least 20 minutes before the Mass begins (Make a visit to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament in the Chapel).,
Go to the Sacristy in your church that holds the altar serving albs or cassocks and cottas/surplices.,
Decide who will be doing which jobs.,
Wait for the priest or deacon and, on some occasions, the bishop to join you at the entry to the church.,
Stand at your seats singing during the opening hymn, which will have been sung during your procession up the aisle.,
During the homily, listen attentively to what the priest has to say.,
At the preparation of the gifts, sometimes called Offertory, bread and wine are brought to the altar.,
If bells are used, ring once at the epiclesis (when the priest calls down the Holy Spirit by extending his hands over the gifts), and three times each for the elevation of the Host and the chalice.,
Follow the local custom when receiving the Holy Communion.,
After the priest or deacon sings or says the dismissal, all of the servers will move to the entrance to the sanctuary in their pairs, usually in the same order that they processed up in.,
Clean up.",How to Be an Altar Server in the Catholic Church," Before you arrive at your church, be sure to wear good clothes, such as a collared shirt and pants. However, in some albs, wearing a collared shirt is impractical.


wearing smart clothes is not imperative as the congregation cannot see what you are wearing. However, be sure to wear smart, presentable shoes that you can easily walk in without tripping, as the congregation probably will see these.
Refrain from wearing trainers, high-heels or flip-flops. If you have long hair, tie it back or wear it in a ponytail so that it does not get caught in anything. In some churches, altar servers often carry candles, so by not tying back your hair, you could risk it catching fire.
;
, The earlier you arrive, the more time you will have to prepare.


When you first arrive at the church, be sure to remove any gum or candy you have in your mouth. It would be distracting and disrespectful to be chewing or eating something before or during the Mass. (Note: You may not receive Holy Communion if you have consumed anything other than water one hour before Mass. If you do eat or drink something before Mass, you may wish to refrain from receiving Communion to avoid a Mortal Sin)

If you will not be receiving Holy Communion, please do not serve.

, Try not to talk loud, but whisper.


Put on your alb correctly by buttoning it up or zipping it up all the way. Sometimes robes simply go on over your head. Albs are usually girdled with a cincture, so be sure to put one on that is not too long and not too short.
Try to wear it at around the same length as the other servers, but if you are unsure, again, ask a member of the clergy. If any of the albs are ripped or torn, let the priest or deacon know.
Remember to choose an alb that fits you, coming down to your shoes.

, Usually the Master of Ceremonies or deacon will decide this, but often the choice will fall on the most senior server available. If you are unsure which jobs need doing, ask the deacon or priest.

, And once you process into Mass, please--NO TALKING DURING MASS. Always have your hands joined. The lead server should rotate the younger servers in different duties. Depending on your parish's traditions, different servers will lead the procession. Often it is the job of the cross bearer(crucifix), sometimes accompanied by the acolytes/candles, but a lot of the time, the cross bearer will lead.


Don't start heading up the aisle until the priest tells you to or gives you a signal. Once you arrive at the sanctuary, genuflect if you are not carrying anything.
If you are carrying something(e.g. cross or candles), make a profound bow before the altar. Next proceed to your seat, where you should stand. When going around the altar, make sure that you and your partner go around on alternate sides; one should go around the left of the altar, whilst the other should go around the right.

, After the hymn has concluded, the priest will welcome the congregation.


After the Collect (opening prayer) you will sit down, as will the congregation. It's okay if you don't know the words, few servers sing at church, and Jesus and the people you serve with are the only ones who will hear it.
If you don't know the words, sing the title or main verse over and over, or stand quietly.

, It usually relates to the scripture readings of the day, and carries important information about the Faith.

, Sometimes a cross bearer goes down the central to accompany the gifts to the altar. Most of the time, the priest and deacon will go to the entrance to the sanctuary to receive the gifts and hand them back to the servers to place on the altar.
Servers should stand at the side of the altar and give the deacon (or priest) water and wine from the cruet or jugs as appropriate. Then, with the water and towel, stand in the same place to allow the priest to wash his hands.

, Kneel after the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God)

, After receiving communion, servers will return to their seats.

,


Walk forward past the altar, giving enough room for the other servers and clergy to stand behind you before turning to face the altar. Everyone in the procession will genuflect (except if you are holding something in your hands. You may bow your head, however). Turn and process to the back of the church by walking up the main aisle. The priest and deacon will usually stop at the entry of the church to talk to the congregation as they leave.

, A server's job is not over at the end of Mass. Before hanging your robe back up, extinguish all of the candles using a candle snuffer to avoid blowing hot wax onto yourself, the altar or the floor. According to parish custom, the deacon/Master of Ceremonies may tell you if something extra needs to be done, or if something has been forgotten, e.g. preparing for another Mass. Hang up your alb neatly and cincture in their respective places.

Understand what altar serving is.,
Other things to keep in mind:


There are three altar servers: a cross bearer, and two candle bearers.,
Decide if this is something you would like to be a part of.,
Sign up.,
Altar serve.",How to Be an Altar Server," Although procedures vary from church to church, basically, the main duty of the altar servers is to assist the priest during the mass. Items include:


Processing with the cross and candles down the aisle to signify the beginning and end of the mass.
Processing with candles to light the Gospel.
Delivering the Book of Gospels to the priest.
Helping the priest/deacon prepare the altar for the Eucharist.;
, You will always be with two (three, if there is incense) other people.
Altar servers typically wear the long white robes, along with any accessories that your church includes.
Altar servers have to get to church 5-20 minutes early, depending on the church.

, This is an excellent way to contribute to the church, but it is a big responsibility. You must come to church early, dress in the proper altar server garments, work with other altar servers, and help the priest let the Mass run smoothly. Can you make this commitment? This is something to consider.

, Ask your church about altar server trainings or meetings, or simply ask for a tutorial. Get an older, experienced altar server to show you the ropes, and there are many websites on the subject, although some churches do things differently than others. Make sure you know exactly what to do before you get up on that altar.


Most churches have some form of training for new acolytes. This should help you out, because every priest has a different method and has different preferences. Make sure that you pay attention!

, Make sure, for your first time, that your other altar servers are experienced and can whisper to you when to grab the Book or hold the candles. You will get better and better the more often you practice it, and eventually, some things will become habit. You will get to know better the priests, deacons, and members of your community. You will be serving the church in a way you haven't before. Congratulations, you're an altar server.

Attend mass!,
Learn how to receive Communion.,
Go to Confession regularly.,
Develop a devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary.,
Pray daily.,
Volunteer.,
Practice chastity.,
Join a youth group.,
Become involved in the Catholic pro-life movement if you think that way.",How to Be a Practicing Catholic As a Teen," In the Catholic faith, Mass is very important. You may attend on Saturday evening or Sunday night (main days to go). However, many churches also have services during the week.


When you go to Mass, make sure you know all the responses. For example, at the start of the service, the priest will say, ""The Lord be with you!"" You must reply, ""And with your spirit.""
Get involved in the Mass! There are many ways to help out, like reading, being an altar server, or collecting during offertory.
Make sure you dress appropriately for Mass. No jeans or sneakers. Girls should dress modestly, avoiding low-cut tops and short skirts. Boys should wear dress pants and a nice collared shirt.;
, There is communion at every Mass because the Eucharist is the center of the Catholic faith. Before you go to receive Communion, you must realize and believe that it is the full body, blood, soul, and divinity of Jesus Christ.


Go up when it is your pew's turn. You can receive the Eucharistic wafer in cupped hands or right on your tongue. Bow your head and say ""Amen."" Next to the priest, there should be a Eucharistic minister holding the chalice. Taking the chalice is optional, but if you do take it, you must still say ""Amen.""
Go back to your pew quietly and pray afterward. Some Catholics thank God for being in their presence, but you can pray for certain people or other such intentions. The point of the time after Communion is to reflect on the presence of God within each of us. Say whatever prayer you want; it is your own personal prayer time.
Remember that it is gravely wrong to receive Holy Communion with a mortal sin (grave offence against the law of God) on your soul. You must go to Confession if you are aware of having committed a mortal sin.

, The sacrament of Confession is just as important as the the sacrament of Holy Communion. Familiarize yourself with its basic outline, and what you are expected to do and say during Confession. There are many excellent online resources for help with examining your conscience, making an Act of Contrition, etc.. Most churches offer Confession Saturday afternoons, or any time upon request.

, Mary is without a doubt the greatest saint to whom we can have recourse. When she said yes to God's wish to make her the mother of His son, she said yes to Jesus, making her the very first Christian. She embodies the virtues of love, compassion, mercy, and countless others. She is truly our heavenly mother. No one in heaven knows God as intimately as she does, and you would greatly benefit from praying to her on a daily basis.

, Catholics are serious about prayer, so make sure you bow your head a few times a day and have a conversation with Jesus.

, You should ask your local church what you can do to help out. There should be much to do, even if it is something small. Do it!

, As a teen, it can be very difficult to hold fast to sexual morality, but the Catholic faith emphasizes the importance of saving sex for marriage, as God intended. In addition to simply abstaining from sexual acts outside of marriage, being chaste also means keeping your thoughts pure. Things like pornography and masturbation prevent us from honoring our bodies as temples of the Holy Spirit.


Jason and Crystalina Evert are husband and wife speakers who give talks to teens all over the world on the importance of purity. Drawing from their Catholic faith, they offer a unique perspective on chastity and pure love. They have written several books on chastity for teens, which are available in many Christian bookstores, and they have a website, Chastity.com, with resources for young Catholics pursuing a chaste lifestyle.

, If your parish has one, join! It is a great way to grow in your faith and meet other Catholic teens. Some youth groups offer monthly volunteering opportunities, or service projects. Others offer retreats for teens that will hopefully build up your relation with God. Youth group can help you to become involved with your church.

, The Church strongly opposes the destruction of human life through abortion because it undermines the preciousness of God's gift of life, however, it does not oblige its followers to be pro-life. Follow your opinions. Participating in pro-life activities with your church can provide you with a stronger sense of God's love for all His children.


Consider taking part in March for Life. The March for Life is an annual meeting and march in Washington, D.C. where tens of thousands of pro-lifers protest against abortion. Beginning with a powerful youth rally and mass at the Verizon Center and concluding with the protest march to the Supreme Court, the March for Life can be a great experience. Consider encouraging your church's youth group to take part!
Organize drives and fundraisers for your church's single expecting mothers. Raising a child alone can be difficult, and so, helping single mothers with the expenses can help them to realize that they are not alone.

Receive God's provision: The important thing is to know God's love!,
Respect Him in prayer and revere His presence!",How to Be a Good Catholic1," Realize Jesus gave his all, as He died to give us life! No matter what, as Catholics, we believe that through the Sacrament of Confession or Reconciliation, God forgives our worst sins. Do not despair but hope in God. If we look at the lives of the saints, many of them were as far away from God as you could ever imagine; but they were able to change their lives around, serve God, and enter joyfully into His Heavenly Kingdom.

, God is with us at all times, even when we think we are alone. Try to be aware of His presence which is all powerful, all knowing, and all loving. Love Him who first loved the world.

If you are not already Catholic, please go to a local church, and talk to the priest about becoming Catholic.,
Pray and participate in the Sacraments.,
Read the Bible every day.,
""Love thy neighbor as thyself,"" Jesus said, and: ""By this ye shall know ye are my disciples; 'That ye love one another.'"",
Keep the Ten Commandments.

,
Avoid the 7 deadly sins: lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, anger, envy, and pride.

,
Go to church regularly.,

Know your heresies and how to beat them.

",How to Be a Good Catholic2," Do some research by going to your local library, looking at some good Catholic websites such as catholic.com, and sit in a pew and observe Mass at the local church;
, Mass is the source and summit of our Faith as the Bread and Wine offered at Mass according to Church doctrine becomes the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Our Lord Jesus Christ. Also frequently praying and partaking of the Sacraments brings us closer to God and makes us stronger in our Faith. There are numerous prayers that have been written throughout the Catholic Tradition. Some parishes sell Catholic prayer books to help you with your prayer. Pray the Rosary (at the bottom of the article), say the Our Father, the Jesus Prayer, or just have a conversation with God. Remember to ask for the intercession of Jesus Christ to the Father, and that of Holy Mary, the Mother of God and the saints in your prayer. We are not worshiping the saints and Mary but praying (communicating) with them to God.

, Pick a passage or set a time of maybe ten minutes to read the Bible each day. You can also look for Catholic Bible commentaries that may be sold at a parish or through an online Catholic website to assist you with trying to understand the Bible more

, Give charity to the poor, visit those in prison, give food to the hungry, forgive, clothe the naked, give drink to the thirsty, and bury the dead.

,,, Catholics are required to attend church on every Sunday and Holy Day of Obligation (HDOs for the Byzantine Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh are listed in the tips).

, The leader of the Church as a whole is the Pope, although various Churches have their own leaders (e.g. the Metropolitan of Pittsburgh of the Ruthenians; the Patriarch of Antioch of the Maronites; the Metropolitan of L'viv of the Ukrainians, etc.). Hold true to the Traditions of the Faith as the Faith has been passed down from Jesus Christ to the Apostles to their disciplines through the numerous saints to this present day. Research and look into what the Church actually teaches by going to good Catholic websites and by reading good Catholic books. The Catechism of the Catholic Church lays out point by the point what the Church teaches and believes.

, The most common of these is the Roman Church. The others are known as the Eastern Catholic Churches. Almost all of them (except for the Maronite and Italo-Albanian Churches) have an Orthodox counterpart. The members of Eastern Catholic Churches are not pleased when people refuse to accept the fact that they are in full communion with the Bishop of Rome.

Accept the call of God on your life: To be a true Christian prophetic visionary you must first be a ""born again"" Christian who believes in the power of God.,
Be filled with the Holy Ghost (Read: Acts 2: 2- 4, I Cor.,
Be led by God's word: any man who is called in the Christian ministry must first be guided by The Bible and the Holy Spirit and, if possible, be trained by a minister or in a Bible school.,

, You can present passages of the Bible to people when they need them, if you know and understand them well.

, or ""Wait.""

, When He chooses, God may speak to us directly, as he did with Adam (Genesis 3:8), Noah (Genesis 8:15), Abraham (Genesis 17:1), Moses (whom God spoke with face to face -- see Exodus 33:11), and all of the thousands of People who heard Jesus Christ in person and the Apostle Paul (on the road to Damascus), etc. Occasionally, God may speaks to us through dreams; some examples are Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, a Pharaoh, a King of Babylon, and the prophets Samuel, Isaiah, and many other persons. God also speaks through visions as He did to Apostles Peter and John, for instance and via angels, as he did with Abraham and the Apostles Paul (Acts 27:23 - 24) and John (on the Isle of Patmos). Have faith, and doubt not when you believe that God speaks to us as long as it agrees with ""The Bible"" in concepts and purposes.

, (Romans 15:13) Imagine God stuffing you full of joy and peace (happiness and contentment) -- just like that -- for free, and it's a real miracle.


To receive this happiness and contentment, the Bible shows that it comes through the power of the Holy Spirit.

Take the Cardinals' Oath.",How to Become a Cardinal," To begin the process of becoming a cardinal in the Catholic Church, you need to meet a few basic requirements. You must be Catholic, male, and unmarried.


Along with being unmarried, you must take a lifelong vow of celibacy.
As long as the other qualifications are there, you can be a widower and still become a member of the clergy. You will still need to take a vow of celibacy for the future, however.
You cannot be divorced if you want to become a member of the clergy, but you might be eligible if you obtain an annulment.;
, Catholic clergy are expected to be actively involved in the lives of those Catholics whom they serve. Being active in your parish and the broader Catholic community before you even start the process will give you a taste for what it can be like and may look better to the people in charge.

, It should go without saying, but becoming a cardinal—or a bishop, or a priest—requires you to have a full-time spiritual commitment. A vocation is a calling, so before you embark further in the process, you should make sure that God is calling you to religious life.


As part of your discernment process, ask for guidance from your priest.Your parish priest and other leaders in your Catholic community can provide you with additional information, as well as guidance. These people can also pray for and with you, helping you in your personal discernment.

, You will need to obtain a four-year undergraduate degree from an accredited institution. Technically, your degree can be in any subject, but a degree in Catholic Philosophy is preferable.


Your grades upon graduation do not need to be top-of-the-class, but you should be an average or above average student.

, You need to take a two-year Pre-Theology Program consisting of 30 credit hours of philosophy courses and 12 credit hours of theology courses.


Note that you might be able to satisfy the requirements in part or in full during your undergraduate education if you take courses from a Catholic university that match the courses required in a Pre-Theology Program.

, Attend a Catholic Seminary and obtain a four-year graduate-level degree.


In order to get into a seminary school, you might need letters of recommendation from current leaders within the church.
Academically, a seminary will prepare you by offering courses in Biblical studies, Catholic philosophy and theology, liturgy, pastoral studies, church history, and preaching.
Additionally, a seminary should help you discern once and for all if you are called to a religious vocation. This means preparing you academically as well as spiritually.
Entering into seminary is not a permanent decision. You are not committed to the life and work of a priest until you take your final vows.

, Usually, you will need to spend six months as a deacon before you can be ordained a priest. As a deacon, you will be expected to actively take part in the running of a parish to which you will be assigned.


In essence, the time you spend as a deacon is like a trial period for priesthood. You will be assigned many duties by the priest of your assigned parish, and these duties often include many that you will have to take care of as a priest when the time comes.
The priest of your assigned parish can voice his opinion on whether or not he believes you to be fit for the priesthood.

, With all of your educational requirements completed, the final stage in the path to priesthood is gaining the bishop's approval. If the bishop of your diocese determines that you have what it takes to be a good priest, you will be ordained.


Once the bishop of your diocese approves you, there will be an official Ordination Ceremony during which you will take your vows and officially become a priest.
After taking Holy Orders, the bishop of your diocese will assign you a position. Usually, you will be appointed as a priest or assistant priest to a parish within the diocese, but sometimes, you might be appointed as a chaplain to a Catholic hospital or another similar post. You might be able to make requests, but your requests may or may not influence your final position.

, While not an official requirement, obtaining a Ph.D. in Theology will improve your chances of being selected to become a bishop.


To improve your odds even further, go through the program at a Catholic university, since a Catholic school will teach you theology from the perspective of the Catholic church.

, Experience is not an official requirement, either, but it is another important “unofficial” prerequisite quality you should have if you want to be chosen. You need both life and vocational experience to make the cut, and should be 35 years of age or older and a priest for five years or more.


During this time, it also helps if you gain a bit of a name for yourself. The more active and dedicated you are as a priest, the more likely your efforts will be noticed by the right people.

, The number of bishops is determined by the number of dioceses. The only way to become a bishop is to wait for the bishop of your diocese, or a bishop from a nearby diocese, to retire or pass away, thereby creating an open position.


Retirement is mandatory for bishops at the age of 75.

, Unfortunately, you cannot apply or “run” to become a bishop. The initial selection of candidates is made by local bishops from neighboring dioceses, and this initial selection must go through various channels before the new bishop is chosen. If you are chosen, however, you will probably hear the news within a few months after the position opened up.Local bishops select priests from the area and form a list of potential candidates who they believe to be capable of performing the duties of a bishop. These candidates are put on an undisclosed list and sent to the Apostalic Nuncio.
The Apostolic Nuncio is the ambassador to Rome for your country. He reviews the names on the list sent by the bishops, and after performing a series of interviews and research, chooses three candidates from that list. He then passes the three names to the Congress of Bishops in Rome.
The Congress of Bishops in Rome will look at the three candidates and determine who, if any, should be selected as the new bishop. If they do not like anyone, the Apostalic Nuncio will need to select another three candidates. If they do like someone, the name is passed to the Pope.
The Pope looks at the final candidate. If he approves, that candidate becomes the new bishop. If he vetoes it, the Apostalic Nuncio needs to pick out new candidates.

, A cardinal is not the boss of other bishops, as the hierarchy of the Catholic Church might suggest. A cardinal is actually still a bishop himself, and “cardinal” is actually just an additional title he receives.


Note that, according to Church law, new cardinals should be ordained bishops before being considered for appointment as cardinals. In some rare instances, however, elderly priests who have gained great esteem and have performed admirably for the Church can be appointed as cardinals without first being appointed as bishops., Among the cardinals, there are three separate ranks: cardinal bishops, cardinal priests, and cardinal deacons. No rank is ""higher"" than the others, per se, but each rank does have its own responsibilities.


Cardinal bishops are bishops within Rome who are involved in full-time service to the central administration of Church affairs within the Roman Curia, or governing body of the Church.
Cardinal priests are bishops with dioceses outside of Rome.
Cardinal deacons are bishops in title whose primary duties involve full-time service to the Roman Curia.

, Technically, you can be appointed as a cardinal as long as you are the bishop of just about any diocese, but the bishops or archbishops of certain dioceses are historically more likely to be selected than many others.


Once you reach this stage of preparation, take a look at the bishops who have been made cardinals over the past few decades to determine where your best odds lie. Traditionally, within the United States, Baltimore and Boston are the two dioceses most commonly headed by a cardinal.Note that an archbishop is a bishop who governs over his own diocese while also leading the bishops of other smaller dioceses within a wider, metropolitan district.

, As with becoming a bishop, there is no way to run or apply for a job as a cardinal. Instead, you need to hope that the current Pope sees your efforts, recognizes them as spiritually significant, and determines that you should be a cardinal by God's will.


In addition to the suggestions already mentioned, it helps to be a notably pious bishop. Regardless of the diocese you serve, as a bishop, you must demonstrate your dedication to God's will and desire to lead the Catholic faithful of the flock you've been given charge of in order to be noticed and considered.

, Once you are selected to become a cardinal, you will be given the right garb during an official ceremony, during which you will also need to take a vow to express your dedication in your new position.


During the ceremony, you will receive a scarlet zucchetto (skullcap) and scarlet biretta (four-cornered silk hat), as well as a ring signifying your new title.
One rough translation of the Cardinals' Oath is as follows:

""I , Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church, promise and swear to be faithful henceforth and forever, while I live, to Christ and his Gospel, being constantly obedient to the Holy Roman Apostolic Church, to Blessed Peter in the person of the Supreme Pontiff Francis, and of his canonically elected Successors; to maintain communion with the Catholic Church always, in word and deed; not to reveal to any one what is confided to me in secret, nor to divulge what may bring harm or dishonor to Holy Church; to carry out with great diligence and faithfulness those tasks to which I am called by my service to the Church, in accord with the norms of the law. So help me Almighty God."""

Use a period to distinguish between Bible chapters and verses.,
Never underline or italicize individual books or versions of the Bible.,
Know how to reference the Bible on the ""Works Cited"" page.",How to Cite the Bible1," The first time you cite the Bible in a paper using MLA style, you will need to list the name of the translation first, then the Bible reference. Include a comma between the two.


For example, "" 'In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly father' (New Living Translation, Matt. 5.16)."";
, The second time you quote a passage from the same translation, you only need to give the scripture reference.


For example: (Matt. 5.16).

, When citing the books of the Bible, make sure to use the correct abbreviations, as outlined in the MLA handbook.


For example, Genesis is written as ""Gen."", Leviticus is written as ""Lev."", and 1 Corinthians is written as ""1 Cor.""

, While some writing manuals offer flexibility in using a period or colon, MLA format requires a period. Double-check your paper to make sure you catch all Bible references.


For example, rather than using the customary colon to separate the chapter and verse (5:15), MLA uses a period (5.5).

, When referring to common versions of the Bible, or specific books, there is no need to italicize, underline or place in quotation marks. For example: ""The King James Version of the Bible was originally published in 1611.""


However, the titles of individually published editions should be italicized. For example: ""The NIV Study Bible includes an introduction to each book of the Bible."", With MLA, you will also need to reference the Bible you used on your ""Works Cited"" page. The reference should include: the translation and/or version of the Bible you used, the author's or editor's name, the publication information and whether it was a print copy or accessed online.

",How to Cope With the Trials of Life Using Bible Scriptures," For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.;
,, During the difficult times we should not listen to the lies of the accuser. When you are sick do not allow the devil to tell you that you are sick because you have sinned. Believe what the Word of God says pertaining your situation that you are healed through His stripes on the cross. When you experience financial difficulties do not allow the accuser to attack you with lies that you will never be able to come out of debt. What does Gods' word says about finances? Philippians 4:19 says, And my God will meet all your needs according to His Glorious riches in Christ Jesus. Do not allow the enemy to tell you that God does not care for you, or that He does not have time for your problems. God loves you and will help you. Those who call upon the name of the Lord will be saved, and if not in this life as we hope, then in the better life to come.

, Our right standing in God. God has forgiven all our sins and we are righteous through Jesus Christ. Romans 8:1 Therefore there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ. Do not allow the accuser to condemn you, Jesus died for you and we can have a relationship with our Heavenly Father.

, The armour also includes the preaching of the Gospel of peace. Telling co-workers, friends, everyone you meet of Jesus Christ. This is part of the full armour.

, Jer. 29:11 says, For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. When it seems to you that the situation you are experiencing is so dark you cannot see the end, have faith and know that God has a plan for your and it is one of prosperity not to harm you. Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. We have to have faith that God has already provided us with a job, our debt has been paid in full and that God has already healed us. Although we cannot see it yet.

, Do not think thought of defeatism; think what the Word says that you are more than a conqueror through Christ Jesus. Only, accept doctrine clearly based on Biblical teaching not ones opinions or imaginings.

, Jesus said to Satan in Matthews 4:3-4 The tempter came to Him and said if you are the Son of God tell these stones to become bread and Jesus answered ""it is written....."". We have to follow Jesus' example and use the Word of God as our sword.

Know how to do your first in-text citation.,
Know how to do subsequent in-text citations.,
Use a colon or period to distinguish between Bible chapters and verses.,
Understand that it is usually unnecessary to include the Bible on your reference page.",How to Cite the Bible2," With APA style, the first in-text reference to a particular scripture should include the book, chapter and verse, followed by the version of the Bible it was taken from.


For example: ""In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly father"" (Matt. 5:16 New Living Translation).
Note that there is no comma between the scripture and version.

, Once you have explicitly referenced the version of the Bible used in your first citation, you do not need to keep repeating it.


You can simply give the scripture reference, e.g. (Matt. 5:16) for all remaining citations, unless you switch to a different version.

, Either punctuation mark is acceptable as long as you remain consistent.


For example, (Matt. 5:16) or (Matt. 5.16).

, According to the APA style manual, it is usually unnecessary to provide references for the Bible, in addition to other well-known classical texts.


However, if you are writing a paper for class, your professor may prefer that you provide full publication information, so it may be best to ask if you are unsure."

List the scripture reference first, then the translation.,
Use a colon to distinguish between Bible chapters and verses.,
Stay consistent in your abbreviations.,
Understand that with Turabian style, you do not need to include the Bible on your bibliography or reference list.",How to Cite the Bible3," With Turabian style referencing, the book, chapter and verse come first, followed, by the version of the Bible you are using. Place a comma between the two.


For example, "" 'In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly father' (Matt. 5:16, New Living Translation).""

, Though this is a fairly typical way of referencing Scripture, some citation styles prefer periods. However, Turabian requires a colon.


For example: (Matt. 5:16).

, Turabian allows for two sets of abbreviations when citing books of the Bible. The first is a traditional set, the second a shorter version. Pick one and remain consistent. Consider asking your instructor to see if there is a preferred set to use.

, Unless your professor specifically requests it, you don not need to provide publication information for the version or versions of the Bible you use. "

Understand when to use underline and when to use italics.,
Include the Bible on your works cited page only when referencing editorial content.,
Use book abbreviations.,

Identify the Bible translation you are using.",How to Cite the Bible4," There are certain times when you should use underline and italics when referring to the Bible, and other times when you should refrain from doing so.


When you refer to the Bible itself throughout your paper or presentation, you should not set it apart in any way except by capitalizing the word Bible or capitalizing the book you are referring to, such as Matthew, Mark, or Luke.
When you refer to a specific edition of the Bible, italicize the title like other books. For example, The NIV Study Bible.

, Using Scripture verses in your paper does not warrant the need to cite the Bible as a source on your bibliography. However, referencing specific notes or commentary within a specific study Bible does. List specific study Bibles like other books on your works cited page. Include title, edition, publisher, location, and year.

, When you reference specific passages in the Bible, use the abbreviation given for the book. For example, instead of ""Matthew 5:16,"" you would write ""Matt. 5:16."" Find the appropriate abbreviations for books of the Bible by using a guide provided in many Bibles or by searching online.

, Some traditional writing uses Roman numerals for books: II John. Instead of Roman numerals, stick to the Arabic form: 2 John.

, Most research papers stick with one translation of the Bible (e.g., New Living Translation, New International Version, English Standard Version). Simply reference this in your first citation and leave it out of the others. However, if you are constantly changing from one translation to another, include the translation in every reference.

, If you are young and you still live with your parents, you may find it helpful to talk to them if they are also Catholic. Even if you don't live with your parents, it is possible that you will have more confidence talking to them than to others.

, Contact the office of the church and ask when you can arrange to speak with the priest. You will need time to ask all that you want, so it's best to make an appointment. The priest will be glad to see you.

, If your doubts relate to a special subject such as angelology, New Testament apocrypha, lateral interpretations of the scriptures, or versions of the Bible, it is probable that you will have to look further. Look to the bishop of your city or to the nearest seminary. There you will find specialists giving classes or, if you're lucky, having a bit of coffee and with a bit of free time.

Line up several translations, side-by-side, and compare the same verses.,
Consider your purpose.,
Decide what kind of translation you would like.,
Some consider the King James Version (KJV) but do remember that the English language has changed since the 1600s.,
Remember that several major translations fall somewhere between the highly literal/thought for thought spectrum.,
Before purchasing a Bible read the translators preface- this will help you to determine the philosophy of the translators, and whether the translation is likely to be more or less literal.",How to Choose a Bible Translation," There are interlinear Bibles that will do this for two, four or eight translations. Read some passages in each one. (You may want to compare Acts 26:14 and Psalm 1:1, since these show how translations deal with difficult Greek words and how sensitive they are to avoiding English idioms, respectively.)


Are certain translations clear and understandable, while others make little or no sense? Ideally, the translation should ""speak to your heart"" as well as your mind. The worst translations speak to neither, and make it easy to ignore items that a part of you wants to ignore.
Best translations are not the ones which are flowery or use old out of date terms and expressions which we no longer use in modern day language.
Many find that Bibles which use modern day, common language are easiest to understand and the easiest to build ones' faith on.;
, How will you use the translation? Do you intend to read through the entire Bible, or entire books or chapters? Will you be looking up single verses and then quickly checking their context? Will you be wanting to study the original language(s), word by word?


As you compare the translations (in step 1), consider your intended usages. Which translation will make that easiest and help you avoid misunderstandings?

, Are you searching for a translation for serious study, or one that reads easily in modern language? Consider purchasing both -- one of each -- different translations serve well for different purposes.


New American Bible (NAB): This a modern language Bible which is a relatively easy to read and study.
New World Translation (NW): This is a modern language literal translation for serious study, and comparing the English to the Greek. The NAB and NW are the most literal modern translations available, with the English rendering corresponding most closely to the Greek.
English Standard Version (ESV): Also quite literal but has fewer study helps available.
Revised Standard Version (RSV): A literal translation which was revised again in 1990 by the (New) Revised Standard Version (NRSV) which is considered a considerably looser translation then its predecessor.

, Some words which seem familiar may have changed their meanings over time; for example, the word ""nice"" used in the KJV originally meant ""silly."" This translation is therefor harder to understand.


Also, archaeologists and linguists continue to learn about the sites, cultures and languages of the Bible. We continue to discover earlier manuscripts. Newer translations (such as the NKJV) account for such discoveries; the KJV does not.
The Contemporary English Version (CEV) is very easy to read, and yet remains faithful to the original meaning. Another popular choice is the Good News Bible (GNB, also called the Today's English Version or TEV); the English used is very simple. The New Living Translation (NLT) is another popular example of this kind of translation.
The Living Bible (TLB) was a paraphrase by Dr. Kenneth Taylor of the American Standard Version, whereas the NLT used a translation committee and translated from the Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic. Another popular paraphrase is The Message. Many enjoy the freshness of this rendering of scripture, paraphrased from the Greek by pastor Eugene Peterson.

, The New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) and New International Version (NIV) are examples of such translations that are generally well respected and used by many churches.


They are modified-literal translations that began with a word-for-word translation, and then translators modified the results to make the sentences more closely correspond to English syntax (grammar).

,


Staff at Christian bookstores may be quite knowledgeable about different translations, and will likely be willing to answer any questions you may have.

Decide what you want to cover in your faith journal.,
Consider whether you'd like to follow a more structured approach to Bible journaling.,
Keep notes on anything that reading the Bible raises for you.,
Use imagery and visual prompts.,
Consider sharing the Bible journaling.",How to Bible Journal," Bible journaling is a personal pastime, one in which you decide what things to explore through the medium of a journal. Suggestions of what might inspire you include:


What readings in the Bible mean to you, have caused you to think more deeply about.
Reflections on particular stories or morals in the Bible.
Messages or insights that you feel are pertinent to things you're experiencing at the moment, or things you've gone through.
Analysis of things you've read, and how these link to other parts of the Bible, or to your faith in general.;
, If you need some direction, consider following a strategy such as S.O.A.P., which is short for: S - Scripture, O - Observation, A - Application and P - Prayer. This involves reading the Scripture and noting down a verse, passage, etc. Then, write down what you have observed from the reading, what insights you think it has revealed to you. Follow it with consideration of how this applies to your daily life and ongoing interactions with others and your relationship with God. Finally, prayer is a form of conversation, with God or listening to what God has revealed to you through what you have read in the Bible.


You might like to do a journal chapter for each chapter you read in the Bible. Take notes after verses and passages, then do an overview summary at the end of each chapter read.

, This may not necessarily be while or just after reading the Bible. The inspiration might come to you any time, during activities, when out in the park, watching TV at night, etc. If you have your journal handy, note the things you're thinking down; you can explore them later, when you have time for reflection.

, While writing is an important way of exploring your thoughts, so are images. You can draw pictures (or glue in images from print-outs, the newspaper, etc.), draw mind maps or picture diagrams and use geometric shapes for other ways of expressing your exploration. If you like colors, add plenty in to brighten up your journal; this will encourage you to reread many sections of your journal at a later date.


Some passages or verses might inspire you to draw or create diagrams that represent the message within. Be creative and let the inspiration flow into your artistic impressions.

, You don't have to do this but it can be a good way to share ideas and explore insights together. To keep it personal, consider only reading out particular reflections in a pair or group context, such as a Bible study group.


Ask questions about each other's reflections, to help all of you explore further.

Place the spine on a hard surface.,
Let the covers fall open.,
Crease open a section of pages at the front.,
Crease open a section at the back.,
Repeat through the remaining pages.,
Let it rest.,
Apply oil to real leather covers.,
Treat the end of the ribbon bookmark.,
Flip through the pages.,
Keep the Bible out of direct sunlight.,
Avoid moisture.,
Support upright Bibles.,
Mark carefully.,
Use the Bible regularly.,
Apply additional oil, if necessary.,
Quickly clean away dirt and spills.",How to Break in a Bible," Hold the closed Bible with one hand. Rest the spine on a table or counter.


Throughout the entire process, you'll need to use one hand to hold the upright, closed portion of the Bible in place. You'll need to use your other hand to open and crease each section.;
, Keep the pages closed while carefully releasing the front and back covers. Gently ease the covers open until they lie flat on the table.


Instead of letting the covers drop quickly, it would be better to slowly open and lay them down using your free hand.

, Carefully open the first 50 to 100 pages of the Bible. Lay them out flat, then slowly run your fingers up and down the gutter of the top page, pressing into the binding as you move.


This action gently stretches the stitching of the Bible binding, making the pages of the book more flexible, easier to turn, and easier to handle. As a result, the pages of the book are less likely to loosen or fall out when being handled.

, Open the back 50 to 100 pages of the Bible and let them lay flat on table. Gently yet firmly run your fingers up and down the gutter here, as well.


This back section should be just as thick as the front section was.
By alternating between the front and back of the book, you can make sure that the stitches are stretched evenly in both directions.

, Continue opening and creasing sections of the Bible using the same technique. Alternate back and forth between front sections and back sections, repeating as often as necessary until the Bible is completely and evenly split open.Once the entire book lies open on the table, the “breaking in” process is complete.

, If you ordered your Bible and had it shipped to you in cold weather, open the package and let the book sit out at room temperature overnight before handling it further.


Cold temperatures can cause the binding to become stiff and brittle, so it lacks the same sort of flexibility it might otherwise have. Opening and handling the book while it is in this state can weaken the stitches or glue holding it together.
If you purchased your Bible from a store or received it in the mail on a temperate to warm day, this step is not necessary.

, Gently buff the cover of authentic leather Bibles with mink oil or neatsfoot oil. Allow the oil to soak into the cover overnight.


Soak a small patch of a clean rag in the oil, then gently buff the oil over the entire cover using small circular motions.
Coat the cover thoroughly and evenly, using as little oil as necessary to get the job done.
Any excess oil should be removed with a clean cloth.
The cover will feel sticky at first, but after the oil soaks in, that stickiness should fade away.

, If the Bible has a ribbon bookmark, treat the end of the ribbon to prevent it from fraying. You can use either liquid seam sealant or a low flame to accomplish this task.


Seam sealant is the safest and easiest option.

Choose a seam sealant like ""Fray Check"" or ""Fray Block.""
Apply a small dab of the sealant onto the end of the ribbon, smoothing it over the raw edge in a thin, even layer.
Let the sealant dry.


If the bookmark is an acetate ribbon and not a silk one, you can use a match or small lighter to prevent the raw edge from fraying.

Hold the raw edge of the ribbon in a low flame for approximately 5 seconds, working carefully to prevent the ribbon from catching on fire.
Remove the ribbon from the flame and pinch the end with your fingers to cool it down and set the end.



, If the Bible has gilded edges, quickly flip through the pages, passing your thumb over each edge in the process. Doing so can help break apart pages that are stuck together.Most modern Bibles are decorated with art-gilt pages. The edges are dyed red, and gold foil is melted over the red dye, creating an orange-gold hue that lasts longer than painted gold gilt. Since the gold foil was melted onto the page edges, though, the pages have a tendency to stick together initially.
Quickly fanning the pages with your thumb should separate most of the pages, but if you do run across stuck pages as you handle your Bible later, you should usually be able to carefully pull them apart by rubbing the two pages in between your thumb and index finger.

, Try not to let the book sit out in direct sunlight or areas of strong heat for prolonged periods of time.


Sunlight can cause the colors of the cover and the page gilding to fade.
Heat can cause leather and faux leather to dry out and become stiff.

, Keep the Bible as dry as possible, especially if the cover is made from authentic leather. Store it in an area of low humidity.


Excessive moisture can cause leather and faux leather covers to dry out.
Humidity or dampness can also cause mold to develop.
Contact with water will cause the pages to ripple and warp.

, If you plan to stand your Bible on a bookshelf, make sure that both sides are supported by other books or bookends.


If you store the book so that it lies flat on its back cover, no extra support should be needed.

, If you plan to highlight sections of the Bible or make notes during your studies, use a pencil, ballpoint pen, or specially designed Bible marking highlighter or pen.Do not use pens, markers, or highlighters with felt tips, gel inks, or roller points. The ink produced by these writing instruments will usually bleed through the pages, causing them to stick together and making your notes difficult to read.

, The best way to keep the cover in good shape is to handle it on a regular basis. The natural oils produced by your hand should keep the leather or faux leather in good condition.


Oil allows leather and faux leather to remain supple and easy to handle. Your skin produces natural oils, though, and they alone should be enough to keep the cover in good shape if you handle it on a fairly consistent basis.
If you do not handle this particular Bible for several months or years, though, you may need to apply supplementary oil.

, You can keep authentic leather covers in even better condition by applying minx oil or neatsfoot oil once every year or two.


This is especially beneficial if you don't handle your Bible regularly.
Apply a small amount of your chosen oil using a clean rag. Buff the oil over the entire cover using small, gentle, circular movements.
Wipe away excess oil with a clean rag and let the book dry overnight.

, If you accidentally get the cover dirty, you can clean the dirt or spill away with a lukewarm water and mild liquid detergent.


Dip a clean, soft rag in lukewarm water. Ring out the excess water, then apply a dab of mild detergent to the wet rag. Rub the detergent into the rag until a mild lather forms.
Wipe the dirt or spill away with this soapy rag.
Wipe away any soap residue with a separate damp rag free of soap.
Thoroughly dry the cover with a clean, soft, dry towel. Do not allow the cover to air dry.

Study and see that the Bible definitely is by inspiration of God.,
Be Born Again as the scripture said: ""Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and abides for ever: But the word of the Lord endures for ever.,
Repent of your wrongdoing, called ""sin"".,
Receive the words of the Bible as being ""by inspiration of God,"" and ""not"" as words of man and always read and understand before you practice it.,
Believe what the Bible tells you about: ""Who is God and how He is to His people?""",How to Become a Christian According to the Bible1," If you want to be a Christian based on what the Bible says, then it is necessary to believe that the Bible has been inspired by God Himself, and says exactly what He wants it to say.;
, And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.""(1 Peter 1:23,25)


After receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit , be spiritually minded that is always thinking about what God wants from the scriptures. (Luke 13:2)

, As Jesus said, ""Unless you 'repent' , you will likewise perish.""


Repent means that you must ""change your thinking"" and ""turn away from your old ways"", and that is hear and believe as: ""faith by hearing -- and hearing, by the word of God.""(Romans 10:17) ""How shall one believe unless he is taught?""
Jesus said, ""...blessed they that hear the word of God, and do it.""(Luke 11:27,28) You will be blessed by following the words of Jesus Christ the Lord, to do them...

""For this cause also we thank God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received not the word of men, but as 'it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe'.""(1 Thessalonians 2:13)



, Here is what the Bible says about that:


""All scripture given by inspiration of God, and profitable for doctrine’', for reproof , for correction, for ‘’training in righteousness:""(2 Timothy 3:16)
Examine ""Why become a Christian?"" Here is what the Bible says about sin (wrong-doing):
Twice, in both Deuteronomy 5:11 and in Exodus 20:7, God says ""You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.""
Jesus said in Matthew 12:36 ""But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment.""
Christ teaches that your thoughts matter. It is not just written laws and physical acts. The 10 Commandments say ""You shall not murder"" and ""You shall not commit adultery,..."" But, in his famed Sermon on the Mount, Christ went beyond actions and showed our attitudes matter as well; for example, he said if you have hated anyone, then you are guilty of murder and if you have thought a lustful thought you are guilty of adultery, all of which helps show the absolute need of God's grace. (Matt. 5:21-28)

To be a Christian, therefore, involves one's heart condition in accepting God's plan and then live by His attitudes, also:

""For 'by grace' are you saved 'through faith'; and that not of yourselves for it is the gift of God: so that it may be impossible for anyone to boast.""(Ephesians 2:8-9)Never also think that because grace prevails you will continue to sin and ask forgiveness.



,


John 4:8 Says ""God is love."" Yes: God is love, and God is patient, but a common misconception is that because God is loving, He cannot or will not punish sin.
The Bible says God is a God of justice, as well as a merciful God. And when God ""rolls up the heavens and earth as we now know them like a scroll,"" all those whose names are not written in the ""Lamb's Book of Life"" will appear before God to be sent to the second death (called Hell). Only those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book (The book of the saved) will not be condemned to the second death.

Be happy about the fact that you were lost, but now you are found.,
For more, please go to Wayofthemaster.com and Wretchedradio.com to learn and grow in the faith.",How to Be Right with the God of the Bible," The Bible says that all of us have sinned and fall short of God's standard of righteousness. (Romans 3:23) Have you stolen? Lied? Cheated? Taken God's name in vain(blasphemy)? Thought bad thoughts? The Bible says ""There is not one who is good, no one is righteous."" (Ps. 14) In thought, word and deed we have failed to meet up to God's standards. The Bible says our righteous deeds apart from faith are like filthy rags before God. (Isaiah 64:6) If your motivation for being ""good"" is anything other than a desire to obey and honor God, it's not enough to please Him; to be in God's presence, we must be made holy through God's grace despite our sinful nature. Understanding that you are spiritually bankrupt and have broken God's commands is the first step to realizing you need God's forgiveness. Salvation is by grace and faith alone. It cannot be earned. (See Ephesians 2:8-9);
, Act on that prayer by getting baptized in water(Acts 2:38)(Acts 18:8)(Acts 22:16). God's purpose for making us is so that He can demonstrate his mercy, grace, and loving kindness. Our purpose is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. Embracing sin or trying to get ""better"" by yourself is a foolish attempt at ensuring the future. We often think that we can do enough good things to outweigh the bad, and God will reward us for it. But the truth is, purity and righteousness are unattainable without God's help. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for our sins. His sacrifice - of His life - was the consequence of every wrong thing we have done or will ever do. He knew we couldn't know Him through our own efforts, so He made a way for us to know Him by covering our sins with grace, on the cross.

, Repent from your sins. Repentance is a full 180degree turn from doing sin. Sin is breaking God's law. (1 John 3:4) Repentance isn't merely being sorry or guilty for sin, but it's turning away from it...God can't be mocked. God doesn't accept hypocritical repentance, thinking you can continue sinning so long as you ask for forgiveness. You will not have your sins forgiven unless you truly don't want to live wickedly anymore. Cry out to God to grant you godly sorrow, that you may turn from your sins and desire nothing but God's righteousness. Jesus paid your sin debt, He paid the fine you could not pay. The very sins you committed are the very things that crucified your Savior... you should not want anything to do with sin anymore. God will help you in your weaknesses and help you overcome evil.

, God's Word - the Bible - is a love letter to the world. He wants to save us from sin's condemnation, but that only comes through repentance and trust in Jesus Christ and receiving the Holy Spirit . If you don't believe God is telling the truth, you will not allow Him to guide and save you, and you'll be condemned eternally to Hell because you never had your sins forgiven and weren't born-again (made a new creation in Christ.) We are ""children of wrath"" before we come to Christ. We must be made a child of righteousness. And only the finished work of Christ on the cross can grant us that--if we trust in Him.

, If you are truly born again, you'll have the desire to tell others about the forgiveness available in Christ and that they can be made right with God before they die. If I love Christ, I'll obey what He commissioned all Christians to do: preach the Gospel!

, Believe the promises in the Bible. Trust what God says is true -- so that: He means what He says. Then, watch Him work in your inner-being and in your daily life as He fulfills His promises to you in response to your faith and obedience. Are you growing in the fruits of the Spirit? (See Galatians 5:22-23)

The path to becoming a vicar is long, and the job itself is extremely demanding. Those who decide to become vicars have strong faith, and see the job as more of a calling than a vocational path. Spend some time learning about the demands of the career to decide if it's right for you.Vicars are the backbone of any parish. As a vicar, you are responsible for many ceremonial duties such as marriages, funerals, communal worships, and christenings. If you have a large parish, this can be a very demanding job.
Your job is not just ceremonial. As a vicar, you must help your parish navigate their spiritual paths. You must provide one-on-one guidance to members of your church, advising them on how to live Christ-like lives and carry out God's work. People rely on you to assure them passage into heaven, so your job is quite serious.
While the job can be incredibly taxing, it can also be rewarding. If you have strong religious faith, and feel a personal calling from God, becoming a vicar may be the right career for you.;
, You should take some practical considerations into account. How much you make depends on your denomination and the length of time you've been working. Some vicars are paid on a stipend that ranges from $600 to $2,000 a month, but you may also be provided lodging by your parish. Benefits in terms of things like health insurance range by church. Other vicars are paid a regular salary. Most vicars do not become greatly wealthy, so make sure you're prepared to get by with less as a vicar., Start early if you want to become a vicar. You'll want to be heavily involved in your church so you'll know the ins and outs of the church's ceremonies, values, and customs. You'll also learn the Bible more significantly, and be exposed to different teaching and interpretations of the Gospels and other religious doctrine.Obviously, you should attend church regularly. Go to any weekly communal worships and pay close attention during the session.
You should also develop a one-on-one relationships with the leaders of your church. Talk to priests and other vicars about your desire to become a religious leader. Ask them for advice and guidance.
If your church has a vestry, consider joining. Being an active vestry member can help you build the skills necessary to succeed as a vicar.

, An in-depth knowledge of the Bible and its teachings is necessary if you want to be a vicar. Spend time reading the Bible each day, join a local Bible study club, and ask priests and religious leaders to recommend supplementary texts written by renown Biblical scholars. You want to be able to understand the text of the Bible and its application in the world.


It can help to take a religious studies course. If you are in high school or college, see if there are any religious studies courses offered by your school. You can also look into enrolling in or auditing a religious studies class at a community college or four year college in your area.

, You want to foster a one-on-one relationship with God if you want to become a vicar. This means spending time alone in prayer or meditation. You want to make sure you feel as close to God as possible going into the vicar career path.Close yourself off daily for personal prayer and meditation. This should become a necessary part of your day, as important as showering and brushing your teeth.
How you pray and meditate depends on your church and personal preferences. If you're unsure on how to get started, talk to a religious leader in your local church. Ask him or her for advice on how to pray and mediate when alone.

, To become a vicar, you need excellent interpersonal communication skills. You'll want to spend time working with your community. Volunteer work that involves helping others and bettering your local town or city is an excellent way to gain the skills necessary to becoming a vicar.You can always volunteer at your church, and this may be the best place to start if you want to be a religious leader. Talk to your priest about volunteer opportunities at your church, particularly those working with others. You may even be able to go on faith-based volunteer trips with your church, helping communities across the world or country.
You can also look for local religious organizations, that fall within the values of your denomination, and volunteer here.
In addition to church-based volunteer work, strive to work with any organization with a focus on community outreach. You could volunteer at a local nursing home, work with an organization like Little Brothers/Big Sisters, or outreach programs that provide food to impoverished families.

, As a vicar, public speaking will be a vital part of your job. You will have to give weekly sermons and speak at events like weddings and funerals. Look into ways to gain public speaking experience as you move along your path to becoming a vicar.Ask your priest if there are any public speaking opportunities within your church. Your priest may, for example, allow you to give a lecture or brief sermon on special occasions.
If you're still in high school, join the debate club. This will provide you with invaluable public speaking experience.
You can also attend open mic nights if you're a creative type. If you, say, write poetry, you may be able to read your poetry at various events. This can help you hone your public speaking skills.

, Once you're ready to move forward with more official studies, contact your local vicar or Bishop. Which religious figure you ask depends on your church, so make sure you review your church's specific rules regarding vicar training. Talk to him or her about your desire to become a vicar, and your commitment to the church. If your vicar believes you're ready, he or she will help you start on the path to officially becoming a vicar.Make sure to prepare before speaking to the vicar. You want to make it clear that you're sincere in your intent and your commitment is strong. Review the Bible and spend some time thinking about how to articulate your beliefs about God, community, and religious duty.
When you talk to your bishop or vicar, mention any experience you have. Talk about past volunteer work with the church, and the relationships you've fostered in your current religious community. You want to make sure the bishop think that you're ready to start on the official path to become a vicar.

, If your local vicar thinks you have what it takes to become a vicar, you will go through a round of interviews with an advisory panel from the church. For around three days, you will be interviewed various times about your career plans, beliefs, and commitment to the church.You may also have written work to complete during these interviews, as well as activities to engage in before the panel.
You can prepare by studying your Bible, reviewing your beliefs and goals, and talking to your local priest and parish.

, Once you have been approved by an advisory committee, you will attend a four year theological college. At a theological college, you will study the works of the Bible in depth so you'll be fully equipped to guide members of your parish on their spiritual journeys.Your church may select a seminary for you, or offer a recommendation. If you have to decide on a seminary on your own, think about what you want in a community. Make sure any seminary you choose is rooted in the right denomination for your goals. If you want to become a vicar, you want a school that is committed to the Bible and scripture. You'll want to avoid secular colleges when obtaining a theological degree to become a vicar.
The duration of your studies varies depending on your current knowledge of the Bible, and any previous theological training you've had. In general, training lasts two to three years. As your job is to be a spiritual guide for your parish, you'll need an incredibly detailed and informed view of the Bible, its history, and its teachings. Your studies will be long and, at times, difficult, but try to stay committed and keep your faith strong.

, After you complete your theological studies, you'll need to become a curate. A curate is a lower position in the church's hierarchy, and you'll do some work like conducing funerals and giving some sermons. This is sort of like a practice/apprenticeship to becoming a vicar.During this period, you will be supervised by a priest. During your first year, you will primarily conduct funerals and baptisms while learning more about the church's workings.
During your second year, you will begin to take on more duties. You will be promoted to the position of priesthood, allowing you to perform marriages.
By the end of the four years, you should be familiar with a wide variety of duties of the parish. At this point, you can begin to apply to various parishes to become a vicar.

, The application process varies by denomination and church. You usually apply to the head of a local branch or division of your church, after which you will be assigned a parish based on your specific skills and qualifications. You may not have a lot of choice in where you are assigned to serve, so be prepared to move if necessary., Once you are assigned a parish, you can begin fulfilling your duties as a vicar. A vicar is not a job confined to Sunday services. Your duties will be diverse, and you may have little downtime some weeks.You will be responsible for a variety of ceremonies such as weddings, funerals, baptisms, and so on. This involves talking to families to make sure such ceremonies are conducted with respect and regard for everyone's wishes, so make sure to listen to the requests of your parish.
You also have certain administrative tasks you must do. You must keep track of church's bank accounts, fundraising campaigns, and run church meetings.

, As a vicar, people rely on you to guide them in their own spiritual journey. This is an incredibly important task that you need to take seriously. Be available for your parish as much as you can, offering support and guidance to those suffering from crises or spiritual doubt.You may have to make house calls for elderly or housebound members of your parish.
You will have to be open to one-on-one discussions with members of your parish in need of personal guidance. You may also have to guide young church members who want to become vicars themselves someday.

, As a vicar, public speaking will be part of your job. You'll be asked to hold morning prayer meetings and other services for your church. Try to get comfortable speaking in front of a group of people and work on keeping your voice clear and audible.It will get easier with time to speak publicly. As you'll be conducting multiple services a week, you'll find yourself gaining confidence as time goes by.
Make sure you work on enunciation. You can record yourself speaking and play it back to yourself. Listen for words you commonly fumble over and mispronounce.

, As a vicar, community outreach will be a key part of your job. In addition to working with your own church, you'll frequently have to work with local hospitals, other churches, and community centers. Make sure you're willing to work weeknights and weekends if you're needed outside your church. Remain and open an accessible member of your community throughout your time as a vicar., The job of a vicar can be taxing. You'll be dealing with people going through a host of personal struggles. Keep daily prayer, as well as meditation, a part of your regular routine. This will help you maintain a solid relationship with God, keeping your faith strong for the long hall.

See what the Bible says, ""How do I become a Christian?"",
Remember that God gives each one the option to repent: ""The Lord is long suffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should 'come to repentance' ."",
Be sure to receive your free gift, intended for everyone that would believe and seek it: be saved from having to endure the punishment of sins, through Jesus Christ His Son.,
Love God is the first commandment and love your neighbor is second: to fulfill the Law.,
Believe and be baptized ""in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost"" and some say that that means ""in Jesus name"" (John 3:5) and be filled with His Holy Spirit, as seen and explained in the book of Acts (Acts 2:4).,
Being a ""true Christian"" doesn't particularly suggest that you must adhere to the practices of one denomination (governing body of Churches).,
Accept and understand the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as God Himself has revealed it to you:


""to open their eyes, to turn from darkness to light, and the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.",How to Become a Christian According to the Bible2," The historical Jesus Christ (the Messiah), is the Son of God. And the only way to become a Christian is to believe in Jesus, obey his Word, and receive by faith his righteousness and follow His steps.


""For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.""(2 Corinthians 5:21) Three days after Jesus was put to death, He rose from the dead and was seen by over 500 people.
""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.""(John 3:16) believing in Jesus includes the need to be born of water and the Spirit (the breath of God). (John3:5)
""Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;"" Titus3:5

, (2 Peter 3:9), individually, and be saved (be born again)...

, When Jesus the Messiah died, He died willingly, according to the plan of His Father, who is God of all of The Universe and those in it.

, As a Christian you must accept the free gift of God's grace (His Holy Spirit), and then He accepts you through faith as if you always do ""love God with all your heart, soul, strength and mind""--even though everyone has already ""fallen short of the glory of God:"" including you. And, God's gift of His Love is ""by grace--through faith"" including grace for Jesus Christ's commandment to love one another --""as I have loved you.""


God grants grace to us in Christ though we love one another, imperfectly:

""This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.""(John 15:12)



,


""3 Do you not know, that as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death? 4 Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death: that as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. 5 For if we have been planted together (in baptism) in the likeness of His death, we shall be also be in the likeness of His resurrection: 6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. 7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.""(Rom 6:3-7)

As a side-note to the statement about being baptised, baptism by immersion is a practice primarily of the Bible and bible believing denominations, immersion or being baptized at all is deemed unnecessary to be saved by many denominations, ie: some denominations merely sprinkle (anoint) believers with water as a symbol of baptism. This however is contradictory to the Bible example of fully covering with and under water, momentarily.



, You may actually be what is considered non-denominational or independent and still be a true Christian.

,""(Acts 26:18)
""But the natural man"" ""can not discern"" ""the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.""(1 Corinthians 2:14) and you know the source of faith:

""So then faith by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.""(Romans 10:17)

Becoming a reverend or pursuing any call to ministry is not about you. Rather, you are being called to serve God and to serve other people in a special way. This is not a vocation to pursue as a last resort or as a way to glorify yourself.
Consider what other people have said to you in the past. If you have been especially active in church and those around you have noticed your dedication and have suggested that you could do ministry in some official capacity, that can be a good indication that your calling is true enough to be visible to those around you. Not having this approval is not an automatic reason to disregard a spiritual prompting, though, just like this approval alone is not enough to determine whether or not you really are being called by God.;
, Most Christian denominations follow the same basic procedure outlined in this article, but some may skip or rearrange a few steps while others may have additional requirements not specified here. Before you begin your journey, find out what you will be expected to do before becoming ordained.


There are a few different ways you can find out about these requirements. The simplest may be to just research your denomination online. Otherwise, you can consult with a youth leader or young adult leader at your church, or talk directly to your pastor about what to expect.

, He or she will want to know why you are interested in becoming a reverend. If your pastor deems your intentions to be good, he or she will bring it up to an official church board or committee.


Unless there are any glaring red flags indicating that you do not have the right mindset about pursuing a vocation as a reverend, your pastor will likely support you and pass you along to the next step. The talk you have with your pastor will typically be the most personal yet least formal of the interviews you will go through during this process.

, In most cases, once you get your pastor's approval, you will need to go before a board or committee at your local or home church and discuss your calling with the members there. If that committee recognizes your intentions to be true, it will likely offer you its support as you move into the next stage.


Note that this may not always be the case, though, depending on how your denomination is set up. If your church has a more official, patriarchal hierarchy rather than a small, community-oriented structure, your pastor's approval may be all you need before moving onto the next step. In these cases, you may still end up meeting with church committees and support groups, but they will be there mainly to support and guide you, rather than deeming whether or not you are worth passing along.

, Once your home church recognizes your desire, you must convince a regional denominational committee to support you, as well. Such committees will interview and screen you on a more professional level to determine if the job is right for you. If you are rejected here, the process ends, at least for the time being.


The name of such a committee can vary based on your denomination, and you might hear it called by a term like ""diocese,"" ""presbytery,"" ""synod,"" or ""annual conference.""
The regional committee will interview you. They may also require you to get psychological screening and to pass a criminal background check.
Disclose everything to the committee during your interview, even personal problems that you have faced and resolved.
The committee will probably reject you if it feels that you are using ordination to glorify yourself, using it to run away from other life or career demands, failing to understand what ministry is about, or failing to demonstrate adequate people skills. You might also be rejected if you have a criminal record.
If you obtain the committees approval, they will approve you as a seminarian. This is required if you expect to be accepted into seminary school.
Throughout the academic part of the process, you will likely be required to report to this committee about your progress.

, If your denominational committee approves you, that committee may or may not assign you a support group or mentor to assist you through seminary school. If you are not assigned a mentor, you should consider finding one on your own.


A mentor or support group can help guide you through the process and avoid burning out. If you do not feel you will make it through at any point, they may also be able to help bail you out as painlessly as possible.

, Before you enter seminary school, you need a four-year degree from an undergraduate school. You do not need to study a specific field, per se, but a bachelor's degree in some sort of religious studies usually looks good on your application to seminary school.


Bible schools and private schools affiliated with a religious denomination are your best bets for undergraduate school. Verify whether or not the school must be affiliated with your particular denomination before attending. Usually, it does not need to be.
Consider a major in Bible studies, pastoral studies, theology, or ministry.Expect to take classes about both the Old and New Testaments, as well as courses on theology, ethics, and sociology.

, During your time at your undergraduate college, you should make it a point to involve yourself in whatever campus ministry activities you can find. This gives you a taste of what being a reverend will be like while also making your seminary application look even more convincing.


If your campus does not have any official ministry groups, you can usually start up a small Bible study group with some of your peers. Additionally, you can search out service and ministry opportunities with local churches if opportunities are lacking at your college.

, Some seminary schools have specific prerequisites you must meet before you can be accepted. These requirements may go beyond having and undergraduate degree and gaining your denominational committee's support.


Choose the right school. Most denominations will require you to choose a seminary that is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools. Some denominations also require you to go to a seminary affiliated with your denomination, while others do not.
You can also expect to need various letters of recommendation. The completion of a formal application for admission will also be required.

, It will usually take you two to four years to complete your education at seminary school. When all is said and done, you will usually gain a Master of Divinity, but you may also seek a Doctor of Ministry or Doctor of Divinity, as well.Expect to take classes concentrating on the Old and New Testaments, biblical interpretation, preaching, biblical languages, the history of Christian worship, the practice of Christian worship, counseling, curriculum development, sociology, church history, ethics, theology, and non-profit administration.

, Seminary may require you complete a certain number of internships or practicums before you can earn your degree. Find out what the requirements are and fulfill them.


During your internship, you will usually work with a pastor at a local church, charity, or hospital on a part-time basis.
You will not usually need to write and defend a thesis, however.
Note that the process can take as long as eight years for part-time students.

, While it is not always necessary, some denominations will ask you to go through additional training during or after your time in seminary school. This training will usually prepare you for the people-oriented and legal sides of the career.


Additional training will usually revolve around topics like sex abuse, clinical pastoral care, or harassment. Such training is typically mandated by the denomination's liability insurance company. To that end, you may also undergo psychological and personality testing, as well.

, After all your education requirements have been completed, you will need to write an ordination paper describing your experience and calling. This paper will be submitted to your denominational committee.


The length of your paper may vary, but you will need to cover, in full, your academic, social, and spiritual journey throughout the process you have undergone thus far. You will also need to demonstrate your personal conviction and dedication to the calling.

, The denominational committee will want to interview you one last time before deciding whether or not you are ready to be ordained. If you have completed all the steps, you will usually pass the interview, but you should still treat it very seriously.


Your ordination paper will be discussed at your interview. The committee may also ask you to clarify or describe things not explicitly disclosed in your paper.
As with your first interview, you should answer honestly and completely. Do not withhold any information.

, Once your denominational committee determines that you are fit to be a reverend, an ordination service will be set up for the sake of formally ordaining you into ministry.


Many ordination services are held individually, while others may be held for groups of people seeking ordination as a reverend at once. Find out what to expect from your denomination beforehand.

, Some denominations will allow you to jump straight into the life of a reverend or pastor, but others will require you to serve under another pastor for a probationary period to determine if you have the ability to operate on your own.


During this probationary period, you will have slightly more responsibility than you had during any internship you may have gone through, but you will still report to a church pastor or reverend whose position is higher than yours.

, While you may not need a state license to simply preach at church, if you plan to become a reverend who can also perform marriage ceremonies, you might need to be formally licensed by the state before doing so.


If you have gone through the process and have received your denomination's approval, getting a state license will usually consist of very little. You may simply need to file or fill out paperwork.
Contact your county or state clerk to find out what the requirements are.

, As with any other field, one of the trickiest parts of becoming a reverend can be actually finding work as one. Many denominations will assign reverends to certain churches, though, or at least help direct those reverends to churches in need of additional leadership.

, If you only plan to be a reverend of a small home church unaffiliated with any denomination, a shortcut can work. If you ever plan to work through a larger church or within a certain denomination, though, do not expect to be taken seriously if you took a shortcut through the ordination process.

, The most common shortcut people take toward becoming an ordained reverend is by applying online. These services usually require you to submit a fee and to fill out some brief paperwork before you gain your a “license” from them to act as a reverend.


If you do go this route, try to find a service that will at least provide you with a hard copy of your certificate instead of simply allowing you to print one out.

, While it is rare, some independent, non-denominational Christian churches will ordain someone with little to no formal training. At most, you might only be expected to take a class or two before being ordained.

Be single.,
Meet the age requirements.,
Let your children grow up.,
Be in good financial and physical standing.",How to Become a Nun1," We're already assuming you know you have to be Catholic and a woman, but you also have to be single. If you are married, an annulment recognized by the Catholic church must be obtained. Widows are viewed as single in the eyes of the church.When you become a nun, you will receive a ring to denote you as God's bride. Because of this, you may not have another relationship distracting you from God's call.;
, Back in the good ol' days, most nuns were straight out of high school or college. Now just about anything goes -- from 18 to your 40s. In certain circumstances, older women will be accepted -- it depends on the community you choose to enter.


In general, most religious communities encourage their members to have some type of college education. Having at least a BA is preferable, but not necessary. Life experience, including professional experience, is also a plus., If you do have children, that is. You must not have any dependents upon entering. Many nuns have children -- they're just fully grown., That is to say, be debt-free and healthy. Most institutions prefer candidates that aren't overwhelmed by other issues and can fully devote themselves to God.


If you have debt, don't let it stop you. If you find a community you'd like to join, address the issue with your director. They may be able to help."

Work with a vocation director.",How to Become a Nun2," The more mentors you can get a hold of, the better. You'll gain a clearer understanding of what it's like to be a nun and the different communities and lifestyles you could soon be a part of. If you don't have access to a group, go to your parish and seek out information from your priest or those active in your church community.


There are three general types of religious communities to choose from:contemplative communities and traditional and non-traditional apostolic communities.

Contemplative communities focus on prayer. Their lifestyles are more serene, meditative, and insular than their apostolic counterparts.
Traditional apostolic communities work in education and healthcare. Many nuns can be found teaching in area schools or helping at hospitals and other healthcare facilities.
Non-traditional communities also do service for others, but can be found working with the homeless, incarcerated, or those with HIV/AIDS.



, The last place you thought would be on the edge of technology would be convents, but even they're stepping it up! Some even have songs to download and blogs to read!Vision Vocation Network is a Chicago-based network that is leading the ""virtual discernment"" phenomenon. Their counterpart is Vision, the magazine.Vision Vocation Match helps those in discernment find communities that are right for them. Think of it as online dating, but for to-be-sisters and brothers looking for the right ""home.""Catholics on Call is also based out of Chicago and holds retreats and workshops to meet and network with other prospective candidates and seasoned experts on the sisterly scene.Out of New York City is the Sisters of Life. The vocation director will respond directly to your email if you're curious about what you see on their site. Hundreds do it each year.A Nun's Life is a blog that is aimed at women in the thinking stages of becoming a nun. It does a good job of spelling out the process, requirements, and details of, well, a nun's life., Once you've started networking in person and online, you'll start hearing about events you can attend. This by no means locks you in to anything -- you have no obligation to any organization at this juncture. Going to the retreats is simply a way to get your feet wet.


The Institute on Religious Life can help you find a congregation or order of sisters that may be what you are looking for -- they have information on the work, personal and community prayer and daily living schedule in for dozens of communities, in addition to information on events across the country. They even have an online assessment that helps a person know what congregation of sisters they may be best suited to visit!, Once you've done your research on the communities you're considering joining, contact the ones you like. Each one is different (not only in purpose but in size, locale, etc.) and one will probably best fit you. However, feel welcome to contact more than one! It's all part of the discernment process.


If you know a nun within the community, talk to her. If you don't know any members specifically, contact the vocation director. Her information can be found on their website; if that's not an option, contact your diocese for information.

The Vision Network as discussed above is generally chock full of information when it comes to communities and their directors. Do a little digging if you're at a loss initially.



, Or two or three. Once you've contacted the head of a community or two you're considering being a part of, you'll start participating in more activities. You still have no obligation -- you're still feeling it all out.


You'll probably explore the campus, take part in retreats, get to learn all about the hang outs, and help in community events. You'll meet the sisters and see if you vibe with the feel of their community.

Choose a community to dedicate yourself to.,
Start the candidacy process.,
Enter the novitiate.,
Take your first vows.,
Take your final vows.",How to Become a Nun3," You already have the vocation director on your side -- all you have to do is express your serious interest and they'll take it away from there. You'll discuss logistics, concrete when, where, and hows, and meet the vocation board. It's all downhill from here!


The pre-candicacy process (where both parties are interested and you're working together) can take 1 to 3 years.This is a serious time commitment and should be taken seriously. If you're unsure, bow out now.

, This may be called the pre-novitiate or postulancy.You will live on the campus, work with the other sisters, but still manage your own expenses (this is part of why you had to be in good financial standing initially).


To get the ball rolling, you write a letter of interest stating your desire to join their community. The candidacy process usually lasts 6 months to 2 years, though will end (and move on) when both parties see fit.

, At this point you will be a member of the community, but still not be permanently committed. You are deemed a ""Novice"" at this juncture. Church law requires this to be a one-year period, though many communities take 2. Part of the reason for the time requirement is to make sure you're doing the right thing for you.


The second year is for generally reserved for education and working in the community. At the end of this phase, you are allowed to rejoin the lay community or proceed onto taking your vows.Some congregations of sisters ask a Novice to choose a Saint's name, upon taking your public vows, but not all. You may also keep your Baptismal name.

, A Religious sister takes only temporary vows that are renewed each year until final profession; this can be done for 5 to 9 years (depending on the organization), though many don't use the maximum period of time.


This is the point where you may have your hair cut. If you weren't dedicated before, you sure are now! You'll receive a black veil, a new name, and a full-length scapular once you've pledged your obedience and fidelity to the Lord.

, If you're ready to make your permanent vow to the church, it's time. A wonderfully elaborate process will be held where you receive a ring and other adornments to show the world your promise. Congratulations! Your life awaits.


There are a couple of exceptions to this rule. The Jesuits' first vows are their final vows and the Sisters of Charity only ever taken ever-renewable vows."

Meet the requirements.,
Find a training location.,
Enter the pre-postulancy stage.,
Become a candidate or Anagarika.,
Graduate to becoming a samanera, or novice.,
Take the Bhikkuni vows.,
Become a Theri or Elder.",How to Become a Nun4," For a woman to become a bhikkhuni, she must meet several basic requirements. They are generally quite practical:


She must not be pregnant or nursing
If she has a child, she must arrange other care for her dependent
She must be of sound mind and body
She must be free of debt and other obligation

, They vary in size (from very small to quite large) and can be found in rural areas in addition to in cities. Once you've found one that's right for you, express your interest in training there. Each community has different regulations, but most will have you training for a few weeks.

, If you enjoyed your time at the monastery and they, in turn, took a liking to you, you may be asked to return upon the completion of your initial training. It is during this time that you will undertake the eight Buddhist precepts. These are the 5 of lay practitioners, plus three more (known as the upasika vows).


You do not have to shave your head at this juncture. You will, however, be wearing white or white and black clothing. This stage normally takes a few weeks to a few months.
The precepts (or Garudhammas) are the following:She must not harm any human or non-human life
She must not steal
She must abstain from all sexual activity
She must not tell lies or deceive
She must not drink alcohol or otherwise ingest intoxicants
She must only eat at the appropriate times
She must not sing, dance, or wear cosmetics or perfume
She must not indulge in sleep or spend her time in luxurious places



, This literally means ""homeless one,"" since you will have abandoned your home for the life of a nun. You are required to shave your head, wear white robes, and uphold the 8 precepts. This normally takes six months to several years, depending on your situation.

As of now, you are still technically a lay person. You are allowed to handle money and support yourself financially, though certain expenses will be shared with other women in the same position.
Practice meditation. The ""Brahma Viharas"" of Loving Kindness (Metta), Joy of Appreciation (Mudita), Compassion (Karuna) & Equanimity (Upekkhā) are very important meditations to develop.

, This is where you fully enter the pabbajja, or monastic life. Different communities have different age requirements and traditions when it comes to this stage. Certain countries will place prospective members on a probationary period before the pabbajja commences.Now you must undertake the ten novice precepts, which includes not using money. You may also be prohibited from driving. You will also be given an elder member to become your personal teacher.

, This is known as higher ordination. With the permission of your teacher (after an agreed-upon period of time), you may request to become a full-fledged Bhikkhuni. 20 people will (must) witness the ceremony you will be ordained with a whopping 311 precepts., After 10 years or so, you will begin teaching and taking on your own proteges. Within that time, you may travel as much as you please, working with different mentors or staying all your life with your original teacher. After 20 years, you will be deemed a Mahatheri or Great Elder."

Educate yourself.,
Be sure to shop for a congregation that fits you in terms of your skills and temperament.,
Once you are a pastor, get to know everyone in the congregation personally.,
Once you are established, be sure to balance your time.,
For emergencies, use a special cell phone.,
Be sure to take good care of your physical, spiritual and mental health.,
Be certain to take time out to become more knowledgeable about being a pastor.,
How you dress, where you live, and the car you drive will depend upon a balance of what is comfortable for you and your congregation.,
It's difficult to know beforehand what your parishioners will need from you.,
Whatever you do, work to create lay leadership that can help you develop worship and other activities for the congregation.,
How you are compensated is up to you.,
Pray.",How to Be an Acceptable Protestant Pastor," Learn as much as you can about being a pastor by attending a seminary or some other program. Ask successful ministers what challenges they have had to meet. Find a mentor.;
, Make sure that you can grow together with them. One critical thing to consistently observe is the size of the congregation and the activities of its members.

, Even though it isn't possible for all of them to be like family to you, you will most likely be somewhat of a member of their family. Start with key leaders in the congregation, then work your way through.

, You can schedule office appointments. Try to do this most often as you can be prepared to talk to the individual when they arrive. You can also have office hours when people can drop by. Be sure to schedule visits with the sick and home-bound to keep them connected with the congregation while they cannot come to church.

, If you get non-emergency calls on this number, have the congregation hire an assistant or answering service that can field calls for you.

, Take a day of sabbath each week. Since a majority of your work is on Sunday, choose another day in the week.

, Continue to grow. Take courses, meet with other ministers, keep advancing your skills. Be sure to keep a group of colleagues that you can go to to learn more and help direct your growth. They will be a great resource when you have challenges arise in your congregation.

, Sometimes its good to approach the middle, and dress like your average congregant. Sometimes you should take the lead and dress a bit better or drive a slightly more expensive car.

, If you are a protestant pastor, all of your parishioners will need more knowledge of the Bible, and guidance on how to develop their spiritual lives. But many will need your help and support for their mental, physical, and emotional health. Most likely you will be the conduit to professionals in each area, but you may be the first person to which they turn for help.

, Ask them to help you keep the congregation engaged. As a leader, you will need to determine what to delegate and what to do yourself.

, This is something you will need to have the will to negotiate with your congregation. So too is how you will lead your family life. Though there are many pastors and pastoral families who live with little time or other resources for themselves, there are many who balance the love for their congregations with love for themselves and their families. Having a good balance is a challenge, not an impossibility.

, Hope. Love. Care. I think most people realize that this is not a life that will be easy, but perhaps it can be rewarding no matter how hard it is.

Begin by discussing your desire to be a deacon with the parish rector or head priest.,
Meet with a committee of lay members of the congregation over several months, during which time you will discuss your calling and your suitability to serve as a deacon.

,
Ask your parish rector or head priest to send a letter endorsing your candidacy to the bishop of the diocese.,
Complete any educational requirements required by your diocese for becoming a deacon.,
Fill out all forms, sit for all interviews, and attend all meetings stipulated by your diocese.,
Apply for admission to your diocese deacon formation program.,
Complete all final administrative requirements and schedule a date for your ordination by the bishop.

",How to Become a Deacon in the Episcopal Church2," Explain the reasons why you want to become an ordained minister. All Christians are called to deaconal work, so it is important to reflect on what ordination will add to a ministry of caring and service which should already be well-established. Indicate how your experiences so far at your parish have prepared you for the diaconate.

,, This will alert the diocese of your desire and inaugurate any administrative processes that have to be completed at that level (requirements vary by diocese).

, This may vary from a series of readings to a formal educational program (often the Education for Ministry program) that lasts 3-4 years.

, This process, in conjunction with your education program, will begin to familiarize you with the responsibilities of a deacon, and will allow church leaders to evaluate your suitability. Reflect deeply on whether some of the unique characteristics of the diaconate will be impediments to your ability to fulfill the role well., The program will usually last two years, during which time you may be assigned to a parish for an internship.

Address a Monsignor.,
Address a Bishop.,
Address an Archbishop.,
Address a Patriarch.,
Address a Cardinal.,
Address the Pope.",How to Address Catholic Clergy," Below are a few identifying markers for various individuals within the Catholic hierarchy. It is important to note that these are more guidelines than rules; a Pastor may be Byzantine but wear a Roman cassock, for example.



The Pope is easy to distinguish by the fact that his everyday cassock (robe worn by clergy when not doing anything liturgically) is white. He is usually the only one who has a white cassock (there is a tiny chance that an Eastern clergy member might wear a white cassock, since colors are not regulated closely in all Eastern Churches, and some Latin Priests are permitted to wear white cassocks in tropical countries).

A Cardinal has a red cassock (although it should be noted that at least one regular Eastern Bishop has one).

A Metropolitan or Eastern Bishop may wear a loose cassock, a riasa (a cloak-type garment worn over the cassock, with long, flowing sleeves), a tall black hat, possibly with a veil; in some Slavic traditions, a Metropolitan's hat will be white), and a Panagia, which is a medal with an icon of the Theotokos on it.

A Latin Bishop may be recognized by the red lining, piping and buttons on his black cassock, the red sash around his waist, and that red skullcap (zucchetto). He also wears a pectoral Cross.

A Monsignor is known by the red ng, piping and buttons on his black cassock. But he does not wear a pectoral Cross or a red skullcap. This title of honour is generally not given any more in the East.

An Archpriest is maybe the Eastern Catholic equivalent of the rank of Monsignor. If he chooses to wear a hat, it may be purple or red. In a liturgical setting, he can also wear the shields, like a Bishop. Other than that, he dresses like an Eastern Rite Priest.

An Eastern rite Priest dresses the same as a Bishop, with some exceptions. Instead of a Panagia, he wears a pectoral Cross. Instead of a klobuk, he may wear a black kamilavka. In some Churches, the kamilavka is a reward, while in others it is an option for any Priest.

A Latin Priest wears a tighter fitting cassock. He also wears the white collar.

An Eastern Deacon dresses the same as an Eastern Rite Priest, minus the pectoral Cross.;
, He should be directly addressed as “Deacon (Last Name)” – or, on paper, as “The Reverend Mr. (First and Last Name).”

,,,,
During a formal introduction, a mother superior should be introduced as “The Reverend Mother (First and Last Name) of (name of community).” She should be directly addressed as “Reverend Mother (First and Last Name),” “Reverend Mother,” or, on paper, as “The Reverend Mother (First and Last Name), (initials of community).”

,, (First Name and Last Name).” Note that, as with a Priest, you should stand when he enters a room (until he invites you to sit) and again when he leaves it.

,
During a formal introduction, a Monsignor should be introduced as “The Reverend Monsignor (First and Last Name).” He should be directly addressed as “Monsignor (Last Name)” or simply “Monsignor,” – or, on paper, as “The Reverend Monsignor (First Name and Last Name).” Note that, as with a Priest, you should stand when he enters a room (until he invites you to sit) and again when he leaves it.

,
During a formal introduction, a Bishop should be introduced as “His Most Reverend Excellency, (First and Last Name), Bishop of (Location).” He should be directly addressed as “Your Excellency” – or, on paper, as “His Excellency, The Most Reverend (First Name and Last Name), Bishop of (Location)”. Note that you should stand when he enters a room (until he invites you to sit) and again when he leaves it. Remove your hat in his presence, and you may kiss the sacred ring during both the greeting and the closing. If he is your own Bishop, you may kneel when kissing the ring (though bowing at the waist is also acceptable); however, do not do either if the Pope is present.

,
During a formal introduction, an Archbishop should be introduced in the same way listed above for a Bishop. However in some parts of Canada, especially in the West, it is common practice to address an Archbishop as “His Grace"". In this case, during a formal introduction, an Archbishop could be introduced as “His Grace, (First and Last Name), Archbishop of (Location).” He could be directly addressed as “Your Grace” or “Archbishop (Last Name),” – or, on paper, as “His Grace, The Most Reverend (First Name and Last Name), Archbishop of (Location)”. Note that, as with a Bishop, you should stand when he enters a room (until he invites you to sit) and again when he leaves it. Remove your hat in his presence, and you may kiss the sacred ring during both the greeting and the closing. If he is your own Archbishop, you may kneel when kissing the ring (though bowing at the waist is also acceptable); however, do not do either if the Pope is present.

,
During a formal introduction, a Patriarch should be introduced as “His Beatitude, (First and Last Name) Patriarch of (Location).” He should be directly addressed as “Your Beatitude” (except in Lisbon, where he is addressed as “Your Eminence”) or, on paper, as “His Beatitude, the Most Reverend (First and Last Name), Patriarch of (Location).” Note that, as with an Archbishop, you should stand when he enters a room (until he invites you to sit) and again when he leaves it. Remove your hat in his presence, and you may kiss the sacred ring during both the greeting and the closing. If he is your own Patriarch, you may kneel when kissing the ring (though bowing at the waist is also acceptable); however, do not do either if the Pope is present.

,
During a formal introduction, a Cardinal should be introduced as “His Eminence, (First Name) Cardinal (Last Name), Archbishop of (Location).” He should be directly addressed as “Your Eminence” or “Cardinal (Last Name)” – or, on paper, as “His Eminence, (First Name) Cardinal (Last Name), Archbishop of (Location).” Note that, as with a Patriarch, you should stand when he enters a room (until he invites you to sit) and again when he leaves it. Remove your hat in his presence, and you may kiss the sacred ring during both the greeting and the closing. If he is your own Bishop, you may kneel when kissing the ring (though bowing at the waist is also acceptable); however, do not do either if the Pope is present.

,
During a formal introduction, the Pope should be introduced as “His Holiness, Pope (Name).” He should be directly addressed as “Your Holiness” or “Holy Father” – or, on paper, as “His Holiness, Pope (Name)” or “The Sovereign Pontiff, His Holiness (Name).” Note that men should wear a dark suit and tie and remove their hats in his presence, while women should wear black dresses that cover their arms, as well as a head covering such as a veil (dressing in white clothes and veil, known as the privilège du blanc). Stand when he enters a room (until he invites you to sit) and again when he leaves it. When introduced, kneel on your left knee and kiss his ring; repeat before he leaves.


Le privilège du blanc (""the privilege of the white"") is a French term used for a tradition whereby certain designated Catholic queens and princesses are permitted to wear a white dress and white mantilla during an audience with the Pope. The Italian term is il privilegio del bianco. The Prefecture of the Pontifical Household sometimes issues special instructions when the privilege may be used, such as during papal audiences or masses at the beginning of a pope's reign. It is reserved for the Catholic queens of Belgium and Spain, the Princess Consort of Monaco, the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, and princesses of the former Italian royal House of Savoy.

Know God through His Word, and bless His name for He is faithful!,
Be mindful of God's instructions to us that Jesus read and quoted to the people from the scrolls: ""Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.,
Be mindful to be reasonable and just: Remember that God is not only right but is truly gracious in administering justice -- as He provides His grace to those who honor Him and serve Him, including to those helping mankind (within God's way and in His will).

,
Unite with your source so be as one with the Truth, the Life and the Way...

,
Acknowledge God's blessing: ""The LORD has been mindful of us; He will bless us;""so give up hardness.,
Be amiable to go wherever your following Him sends you: while thinking so that you can bend in the wind of God's will, but when thinking is set and one is not learning then the will and activities are stiff and can not yield to the good of others and to God's will.,
Honor God being mindful to observe the Judaeo-Christian Sabbath Day as holy unto God: and think about ""God's number"" seven -- but not like a superstition -- so rest in the ""Holy Sabbath"" and sometimes use seven as a reminder the ""Sabbath number"":

,
Realize (be mindful) that in Judaeo-Christian life there is the Sabbath of days (and of years) multiples of seven.

,
Recognize (be mindful) that Pentecost means fifty days and is based on the new day after 7 X 7 = 49 days and so adding one you come to the newness of the 50th day.

,
Remember (be mindful of) the Sabbath in various ways: You can even try paying bills in multiples of 7 in the money by sending $21.77 on a credit account for example when a minimum like $20 is due.,
Appreciate (be mindful of) the Judaic Calendar which is in 28 day months.,
Be mindful of Jerusalem:""I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that are mindful of the LORD, keep not silence; Give the LORD no rest"" pray without ceasing ""until he completes his work, until he makes Jerusalem the pride of the earth.""",How to Be Mindful (Old Testament)," (That is not fateful. We are not under fates or luck per se'.);
, But his delight (joyous mindfulness) is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate (is mindful) day and night."",,, Of this be mindful:""This I recall to my mind; therefore I have hope. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.""(Lamentations 3:21-23)""The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him."" (Lamentations 3:24-25),


Remember those who refused to obey commands or to follow in the good path""... neither were mindful of Your wonders that You didst among them; but hardened their necks,... in their rebellion""""Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength,..."" (Isaiah 17:10),,,,



Sometimes get seven pieces of fruit: But, it is not magic!
Purchase 7 kinds or containers of food.
When buying a fuel like gasoline you might get a quantity similar to 7.77, 14.77 or 28.77 gallons (or liters).

, 4 multiples of the Sabbath is 28 -- be mindful that this is not worship of the orbs or stars and it is not for reading of your fate nor is it astrology...


The Judaic (lunar) month is not at all based on 365 days or the solar year, but consists of four, seven day weeks so that is where the 28 days are found, as our Moon takes ~ 28 days to orbit the Earth.

We know there are 13 lunar months in this rotating, recursive system which is not synchronized to the sun... and so 13 X 28 = ~ 364 (Well, so that lunar system is off from the solar year by about 1 1/4 days, while the solar Calendar is off by 1/4 day: so that we have the leap year every four years).

Decide if you want to ""give up"" something.,
If you do decide to give up something, determine what is important to you.,
Pick a favorite.,
Consider giving up a bad habit.,
Consider giving up an addiction.,
Once you've chosen what you'd like to give up, consider the following questions:


Is this something I like?,
Stick with it.",How to Decide What to Give up for Lent," Lent is based on sacrifice, so most Catholics choose to stop eating a favorite food or pursuing a favorite activity. However, you can also choose to do something instead. For example, say an extra prayer every day, go to Church twice a week, or read some scripture verses. Many find it harder to commit to doing something extra in this forty-day period, while others see it as the easy option. Whether you give up or start something is completely your choice, so choose wisely.;
, Do not give up something you do not like; this is not a sacrifice at all. Don't give up something you don't have, either. For example: if you've never tried peanut butter cookies before, don't make this your Lenten sacrifice, because you're not sacrificing anything you have.

, Sit down and think: What is my favorite food? What is my favorite drink? Favorite treat? Snack? Dessert? Activity? These things that are truly important to you might seem like a difficult thing to go without for forty days, but remember: It will be all the more worth it on Easter morning if you went through with something you thought you couldn't live without.

, Constantly biting your nails and want to stop it? Make this your Lenten goal.

, Things like cigarettes, drugs, and alcohol harm your body, and to make it your Lenten (and personal) goal to lash out these bad addictions (not just for Lent, but permanently) would be very rewarding to both you and God, and give you a lasting sense of accomplishment.

,
Is this something I enjoy doing/eating?
Is this something that's important to me?
Do I think this will be a challenge throughout Lent?
Will I appreciate this when I can have/do it again on Easter?
Am I giving this up because I have to (someone is making me), or because I want to?
Is this a true sacrifice?

If you answered yes to all of these questions, you've chosen an excellent Lenten sacrifice.



, Say you've given up your favorite treat, chocolate, and it's been about a week. You rarely go this amount of time without your candy sweets, and you're not sure you can make it until Easter. Don't quit. Don't give up or give in early. Jesus ate nothing for forty days, and we have to do is sacrifice one little bit of our busy lives. On Easter morning, you'll thank yourself for it, and more importantly, God will thank you, too."
"
Center your life around Jesus Christ.,
Admit to Jesus that you are in need of His help.,
Recognize that your situation will change.,
Realize that our afflictions are about Him.,
Note that it is often times those difficult moments in life that lead the sufferer to come closer to Him and into His hands.,
Understand, that God is wisdom.,
Look back and record every memorable moment of your lifetime that you may recall.,
Feel loved.,
Rejoice!,
Just be.",How to Be Biblically Enlightened in Troubled Times," Dedicate your every breath and waking moment, your every strength and weakness, your every success, your every dream; let it all fall into His Hands. Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight. -Proverbs 3:5-6;
, Trust that He shall never forsake you. Pray to Him, and cast your every care, Tell Him everything that is going on in your life and tell Him you are giving it to Him. Jesus will carry it for you. Be able to honestly say that you wish for your situation to glorify Him, and be solved in terms of His Will. Be patient, as you will get an answer. Most often, you will receive more of His strength and wisdom to help you, rather than direct solutions. This makes your journey very meaningful. Just trust. Remember, ""Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and I will give you rest.""-Matthew 11:28

, Whether it is for the better, or worse, it will change. God often makes things get worse on the way to better. Focus on the facts. God sees a bigger picture than we do. He knows our every need, and everything that will ever happen. In fact, He creates it! “For I am the Lord, your God, who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, do not fear; I will help you.” –Isaiah 41:13

, Every difficult moment is a gift. The tragedy and suffering is insignificant compared to the reward in the end. Your suffering will lead someone into faith. Due to human suffering, others come to know life!

,""Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out His love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom He has given us."" -Romans 5:3-5

, Every tragedy has lessons, from calamity to triumph, which God presents to us, in order to gain His wisdom. You may come to discover yourself as an individual, in terms of who you are. God reveals amazing things before us. He knows us and loves us more than we could, or may ever imagine! He shows us our motives and our individuality, just when we forget who we are.

, Note the way in which all of these fit together and bring you to faith. Record every lesson learned, every joyful experience, all of your hopes, dreams, and aspirations; every pain and peaceful moment. You may choose to journal this account. Look for patterns. Begin to notice this as part of His plan. Cherish this plan, and find enthusiasm that Jesus will show you where you need to be. Everything is a gift from Him; all are blessings, that one day lead us to our life purposes. Every experience leads us to something more, and unto what God meant for us to do and be: serve Him. You will grow in your faith as you realize how one thing leads to another, and then unto the truth. Jesus is the truth! ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me"" (John 14:6)

, God’s love is unconditional. Jesus loves you, regardless of what you say, think, or do. Jesus loves you no matter what how you dress, or what type of personality you have. Jesus loves you because you are you!""And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard our hearts and minds in Jesus Christ.""-Philippians 4:7

, “Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice” (Philippians 4:4).Find joy that He created you!

, Look around at all the miracles. Focus on His creations, including you and the world around you. Notice every beautiful thing you see; whether it be an animal, plant, or person. Look at things a little deeper. Slow down, and notice how still and wonderful nature is. Stay in the present moment, as it is the only reality. Breathe slowly, and deeply. Notice kind actions of others and yourself, and be grateful that God is the center of all loving-kindness. Feel His presence. Feel His arms wrapped around you, His love filling your heart. Be grateful for everything you see. Be grateful for His love. Be grateful that you were once lost, and now, you are found! ""By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made of what is visible.""-Hebrews 11:3

Find a Tridentine Mass near you.,
Prepare your missal.,
Familiarise yourself with the order of the Mass.,
Find something appropriate to wear.,
Know the formalities and actions of the Mass.,
Have good etiquette.,
Be attentive and enjoy the experience.,
Feel free to introduce yourself to the congregation after Mass.",How to Attend a Tridentine Mass," You can find a church that holds Tridentine Mass by looking up organisations such as ""ICKSP"" (Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest) or ""FSSP"" (Fraternal Society of St Peter). These groups stick exclusively to the old form, are in full communion with Rome and can be found in many cities around the world. Other churches may hold Tridentine Masses occasionally, so look on church websites or ask around in Catholic circles. Steer clear of any Sedevacantist churches and chapels, as they are celebrating the mass illicitly and are in schism with Rome;
, There are two options for this. Read over the missal beforehand. You may also want to not bring a missal and just enjoy the Mass for what it is, but know that it's almost entirely in Latin and you may get confused or bored.


A bound missal. The 1962 version is preferable as it is the most commonly used, but other versions may suffice as well. A good missal contains a translation of the form of the Mass from Latin to English near the front, often with descriptions of what the priest is doing as things are said, sometimes with illustrations. It should also contain at the back the ""propers"", which are the parts of the Mass which change depending on what day it is. If using a bound missal, bookmark the pages you need.
A printed missal, if you can't get a bound one. You can find free PDF's online of the form of the Mass, and of the propers for each day.

, These are mostly explained in the missal. Some parts are omitted, done in silence, sung, said, chanted or added in. Most is said by the priest and altar servers alone, but sometimes everyone will join in.


The Mass begins usually with an opening hymn and a procession of the priest up to the sanctuary (where the altar is), along with the altar servers (young boys that assist the priest with Mass).
First is the prayers at the foot of the altar, which ends with the Introit. You can find the Introit in the propers. A ""Kyrie Eleison"" (Lord, Have Mercy in Greek) is said or sung- you can find the words for it in the missal. A ""Gloria"" (prayer praising God) is said/sung after that, except for during Advent and Lent.
The Collect (a prayer), Epistle (a Bible reading), Gradual (small hymn), Gospel (reading from Mark, Matthew, Luke or John Bible books), and the homily are said. You can find all of these in the propers for that day, in your missal. During the Gospel, all stand and it is read in both Latin and English. The homily is like a sermon written by the priest that discusses morals and usually in reference to the celebration of the day or the readings previous,
After the Gospel, a ""Credo"" (a declaration of the Catholic faith) is read out, sung or chanted. Next is the Offertory which is in the propers. The Offertory and prayers following are said over a plate of small wafers and a chalice of wine, as the priest prays that God will accept it as an offering. There may be a part called the Incensation, where incense is used all around the altar.
The priest washes his hands while saying a Psalm. Many more prayers are said over the wafers and wine, and a prayer called the Secret is said. It's not actually secret, and you can find it in the propers. It's just called that because it's said in a low voice. A Preface said after can be found in the propers, or they may use the general one found in the main general instruction of the missal.
The priest will pray in silence for about ten to fifteen minutes- you can read what he says in your missal's ""Roman Canon"". This is to prepare for the Consecration, the most glorious and important part of the Mass. When the bells ring three times, it means the Consecration has occurred, where Catholics believe the wafers transform in to the real Body of Christ, and the wine in to the real Blood of Christ- this is called the Eucharist. The priest raises the Eucharist (no longer a wafer, but the Body of Christ) above his head so the congregation can adore Him. He does the same with the chalice.
More prayers are said, and the priest consumes the Blood (only he may drink it). The congregation goes up for Communion, kneels at the rails and the priest says a small prayer as he places the Eucharist into the person's mouth. Only Catholics in a state of grace may receive the Eucharist- this is very important, and to neglect this rule is considered one of the greatest mortal sins.
The Communion and Post-Communion prayers are said, found in the propers. Then a final Gospel reading is said, a final hymn and the Mass has ended. You can leave or stay and pray for a while.

, Women wear some form of head-covering. Most common is a chapel veil a.k.a a mantilla, which is a lace veil worn over the hair. Many traditionalist churches have a basket of these near the front for people who don't have one, but ask beforehand. A scarf placed over the hair, a formal sunhat or a beret all work fine. Usually, the dress code also dictates women should wear longer skirts or dresses that are at or below the knee, and blouses that give good coverage of the chest and upper arms. Men should wear trousers, a collared shirt, nice shoes and usually a tie. Some men choose to wear a coat and tie, or a sweater vest. Men should not wear hats inside the church.

, If receiving Communion, fast for three hours beforehand (this is a necessary rule, or you can not receive). You will be sitting, standing and kneeling at different sections. Most missals have instructions, but you can also follow the congregation quite easily. There are also responses the congregation sometimes says- for example, when the priest says ""Dominus vobiscum"", everyone will say ""Et cum spiritu tuo"". These are again listed in the missal. People also do the sign of the cross often (touch head, chest, left shoulder, right shoulder), and cross their foreheads, lips and hearts before the Gospel is read.

, Turn your phone off and avoid chatting with people in the church itself. You may want to ask before you go in to the church if there's someone you can sit beside to help you follow along. If you have noisy or crying children, see if they have a ""crying room""- a soundproof room with windows so the children will not disturb the silence, but you can still see the Mass. If you aren't a Catholic, sit at the end of a pew that is furthest away from the aisle, so people won't have to clamber over you to receive Communion.

, If you have European ancestry, this is what most of your ancestors were attending from 1570 onwards, before Protestant Christianity became more widespread. Smell the incense, hear the chanting, look at the beautiful movements of the priest, and admire the gorgeous altars, artwork and statues around the church. If you get lost in the Latin, don't fret. Simply ignore your missal until you reach a ""landmark"", such as the ringing of the Consecration bells, or the Homily, that can ground you in the order so you can continue following. Or, abandon the missal entirely and just watch.

, They may be curious about you, especially if it's a small parish. Be friendly and say hello, and you may make some good friends. You may also be able to meet the priest- the appropriate title to refer to him is ""Father"", or ""Father "". Often the congregation will have a cup of tea and a snack together in an adjacent hall, to break the three hour pre-Communion fast.

Join a Bible class or group.",How to Read the Bible," The Bible’s ultimate message is the story and teachings of Jesus Christ, told in a set of books called the Gospels. If you’re just starting out reading the Bible, go with these first. There are four Gospels. They overlap in parts but have differences, too:Matthew alternates stories of Jesus’ life and sections which provide his teachings. These provide context relating Jesus to prophecies in earlier Biblical books.
Mark is a fast-paced account of Jesus’ life. This dramatic narrative culminates in the crucifixion.
Luke has larger blocks of stories and teachings. It focuses on Jesus’ relationship with people.
John is often set apart from the other (Synoptic) Gospels. It focuses on the character of Jesus and contains stories not told in the others.;
, The first five books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) are known as the Pentateuch. These tell of God’s creation of the world and about ancient spiritual figures like Noah, Moses, Abraham, and Isaac. They also include important passages like the Ten Commandments. Read these if you want to learn about the foundations of Judeo-Christian belief., Other books from the Old Testament, like Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon are filled with poetic passages of wisdom. These can be wonderful readings if you want to deepen your understanding of things like faith, praising God, and righteousness., Certain books of the old testament, like Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel include passages that discuss the coming of the Messiah and his role in God’s plan. If you want to deepen your understanding of Jesus’ role in Christianity as a whole, these books are a good start., Books like Corinthians, Galatians, Peter, and Jude are called Epistles. These are presented as letters by early followers of Jesus. They provide accounts of how early Christians were persecuted and tested in their faith, but also great wisdom about how to life a devout life. Read these if you want to deepen your understanding of Christian values., The Bible covers many different topics related to spiritual matters. Study Bibles suggest sections for readings based on common topics. If you want to read the Bible for a certain reason, these can be very helpful. For instance, you could try reading:Matthew 1028-33 or Philippians 4:4-47 if you are struggling with adversity.
Psalm 91:9-16 or Joshua 1:9 if you feel bullied.
Luke 15:11-24 or Psalm 107 4-9 if you are feeling lost.
Psalm 100 or 2 Corinthians 9:10-12, 15 if you want to express thanks.

, Some people believe that selecting books, chapters, or verses from the Bible at random can lead to insights. Many spiritual leaders and Biblical experts suggest that this can be a confusing method and lead to contradictions. But if it keeps you reading, then go ahead., Aside from the creation story and stories of ancient figures, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy give accounts of the 12 Hebrew tribes. This includes their captivity in and flight from Egypt, and information about their laws and customs. These are a great resource if you want to study ancient Hebrew history., Several books, such as 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles, and 2 Chronicles, describe the early kingdom of Israel, Babylon’s overtaking of the kingdom, and other stories. Biblical scholars are divided about the historical accuracy of these books, but they are a critical part of tradition., There are few references to Jesus written during his lifetime. However, certain books of the Bible, including the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles (like Corinthians, Galatians, Peter, and Timothy) discuss how early followers of Jesus spread his teachings around the Mediterranean and Middle East. These are a rich source of information if you are interested in the early development of Christianity and its establishment as a religion., The individual books of the Bible aren’t all placed in terms of the order of events. If you are interested in reading the Bible as one big narrative, you will have to shuffle some things around.For instance, since Job lived before Abraham was born, you can read the Book of Genesis through chapter 11. Next, read the Book of Job, and then go back to Genesis chapter 12 (when Abraham is born), and keep reading.
Check your study Bible or online guides for charts that tell you what order the books were written in.

, The order of books in the Bible also doesn’t reflect the order in which they were written. Look for tables telling you when the books were written. These can be found in many Bibles or via sites like Bible Gateway., One Biblical book doesn’t necessarily lead directly to the next. Spiritual leaders don’t always recommend reading the Bible straight through. If you are ambitious and want a sense of accomplishment, you can try it. Start at Genesis chapter 1 and read all the way to Revelations chapter 22.


Services like the Bible Project can give you guidance with each part of the Bible as you read it through. This can help you understand what you read., Getting through the whole Bible within a year, for instance, is a popular goal. Setting a goal like this can be a great way to keep you motivated to read. There are lots of resources to help you in your quest.For instance, a group called Gideons offers a plan (online or via their app) for reading each of the Bible’s chapters within a year.
Some plans will couple the daily reading with a Psalm or excerpt from Proverbs for variety.
You will need to read about 3 chapters a day to read the entire Bible in a year, but only about one a day to read it within three years.

, The Bible is divided into two main parts. The Old Testament covers events and teachings before the birth of Jesus. The New Testament discusses his life, teachings, and first followers. You don’t have to treat them as truly separate parts, however.For instance, each day you can read a chapter from the Old Testament, and one from the New.
You could instead read one whole book from the Old Testament. Then read one from the New Testament, then back to the Old, and so on.
This technique is most useful if you are trying to read the whole Bible in a certain amount of time, and want some variety rather than reading cover to cover.

, There are many translations of the Bible. New ones are always being developed. Each translation has a different emphasis and style. The most important thing is to find one that speaks to you and inspires you to keep reading.The King James Version (KJV) was created in the 1600s for the Church of England. It sounds old-fashioned, but many readers still enjoy its powerful style.
The New International Version (NIV) is a translation done in the 1970s. It is readable while still conservative in its interpretation.
The New Living Translation, isn't a direct translation, but it conveys the Bible's message in a clear, inclusive way.
You can also read and compare several translations to get a sense of how the original texts have been interpreted differently.

, Traditional Bible reading is done with the print text in hand. Many readers still enjoy this direct, classic way to read. It’s easy to make notes, highlight, and use tabs to mark passages you want to remember. You also never have to worry about battery life with a print Bible.

, There are many options for reading the Bible electronically if that is more comfortable to you. You can read electronic Bibles on practically any device.

There are also numerous versions of the Bible available as ebooks and apps.
Some app and ebook versions of the Bible have nice features that let you highlight and make notes.

, With so many tasks and distractions in life, finding the time to read the Bible can be a struggle. Setting a schedule helps. Try to make a commitment to read a certain number of chapters or verses per day, or to read for a certain amount of time each day. If you need more help, try:Reading on the way to school or work.
Listening to an audio version of the Bible while you are doing something else.
Downloading a Bible ebook or app and reading while you are standing in lines, waiting for a bus, etc.

, You can read the Bible as literature, as history, or as philosophy. But for most readers, it’s the book’s spiritual importance that matters above all. Pray before and after your readings for help understanding what you read., Many Bibles come with extra materials. These can help you learn about the history, significance, and interpretation of different sections of the text. Take a look at these before or after you read from the Bible. Deepening your knowledge of the Bible can inspire you to read even more., While it might seem a little like you’re in school, writing down your thoughts and questions as you read the Bible can deepen your reading experience. You can keep a notebook dedicated to your reading. Many online Bibles and Bible study apps also have features that allow you to take notes electronically as you read.As you read, take notes about ways to apply what you read to your own life, or jot down questions that come up.

, Reading together with others can encourage and inspire you. Being able to talk about what you read with other people can also deepen your understanding of the Bible. You can check out Bible study groups at local churches. You can also look for community Bible study groups that meet in informal locations for discussions.Bible study groups often set a schedule for what to read, and devote time to questions that members have.

Consider which trait(s) correlate best with who you are., Piety is learned most easily by talking about what it looks like. It is a virtue that contains elements of humility and religiosity.Saint Francis of Assisi was considered an incarnation of piety. His friendship with God was second nature. He listened to Scripture and to the Gospel, but was more of a man of action than he was of contemplation.Some saints, like Saint Hippolytus, Saint Helen, and Saint Olga, did not become saints until later in their lives. They did misdeeds but ultimately became saints through repentance and martyrdom., If you notice the needs of other people and speak up in support of them, pick a saint that matches that. Saints like Saint Angela Merici, Saint Teresa of Avila, and Saint Maria Goretti were saints known for being outgoing in their sainthood.Saint Maria Goretti was a virgin martyr, facing the decision of sin or death before the age of 12 and bravely saying that God would not want that kind of thing to happen.Saint Teresa of Avila was known as an active reformer. She spent time and energy reforming herself and the Carmelites, leading them back to the full observation of primitive Rule., Having courage is how a lot of saints acquired their sainthood. If you are the kind of person that stands up for the little guy, choose someone brave to guide your spiritual journey.Saint George is known for being the Saint of courage and bravery, particularly for his strength during battle.
Saint Joan of Arc is another saint known for courage and bravery.

, You can learn a lot about where you’re headed by looking at where you’re from. Look back to the day you were born to see if you feel connected to your birthday saint.Every day of the year has the feast of at least one saint. Match your birthday to the feast day of that saint.
A great online source for looking up saint names based on their feast days is: http://catholicsaints.info/calendar-of-saints/


, For every cause, there is a patron saint who matches it. Base the Confirmation Name you choose on the interests and causes of the patron saints you have in mind.If you are connected to animals, you might want to name yourself after Saint Francis of Assisi who was known for being a great lover of animals.
If you are connected to acts of selflessness, choose the name Maximilian after Saint Maximilian Kobe.
If you feel a connection to music, choose the name Cecelia after Saint Cecelia.

, Your saint should help you to live as holy a lifestyle as possible, so choose a saint who inspires you and whom you admire. In your faith, what do you aspire to do? Let your aspirations, your prayers, and your devotion guide you in choosing.

, Find a spiritual connection to the stories of the two saints you’ve chosen. Saint Joan of Arc, for example, is remembered for her great bravery and love for God. Saint Agnes of Rome was only twelve when she was martyred for her devotion to God and her chastity. Saint Tarcisius was a martyr of twelve, killed because he would not give up the Holy Eucharist., Don't be shy to talk about your options with your parents, your sponsor, or your pastor. Discuss what has attracted you to the saints you have chosen on a spiritual level.Talk to your family and friends again when you’ve made your selection between the two names. Practice saying your Confirmation name again and again.
Practice writing your Confirmation name as part of your name too.

, When you pray, ask that the saint intervene for you, that he or she helps you make great moral choices, and ask that they be a powerful guide for you spiritually for the rest of your life., When you’ve found a saint that inspires you and your faith, completing a form is the next step. After completing the Confirmation Name Report Form provided by your church, return it to your catechist., Every form is not the same, but most of them contain similar requests for information. You will be asked for your full name, your gender, address, contact information, occupation, and birth date., This is asked more often on forms meant to be completed by younger children. If so, help younger people with filling in information about the saints they’ve chosen.Be prepared to answer questions about who their saint is and why they want the saint to be their Confirmation name.
Questions of their feast day, their birth, and their death will also be asked on Confirmation name forms.
They might also need to give two examples of how the saint was a witness and disciple of Jesus Christ.

, In addition to the other information outlined in this passage, the Confirmation form will require some details about your own faith. List your baptism date, the denomination you were baptized in, and when you intend to be confirmed.If you would like to make a public affirmation of faith by being baptized or confirmed in another Christian denomination, indicate that on your form by placing a check mark by that option.
If you would just like to be kept informed about any future opportunities your church has for Confirmation, indicate that option with a check mark.

, It is important that everyone is prepared before the bishop arrives on the big day. When you speak your Confirmation name and the bishop confirms you in that name, you will know that you made the choice of the Holy Spirit.Buy books, statues, and/or pictures affiliated with your namesake. Visual reminders throughout your home and day to day life will help you during times of reflection.
Call on your patron saint for guidance and inspiration in leading a holy life as God has intended.

Be honest.,
Write the way you speak.",How to Write Your Christian Testimony," Your testimony is a strong tool you can use when witnessing to non-Christians. Since the primary purpose is to honor God and advance His kingdom, praying to the Holy Spirit for guidance before you set pen to paper is a logical first step.;
, Get an idea of what to include by reading an effective testimony someone else wrote. You can either use a contemporary example or look for an example provided in scripture.


One of the best examples you can read through is Paul's testimony in the Bible. To read his testimony, check out Acts 22 and Acts 26.
You should also ask yourself if there were any testimonies you heard or read prior to your conversion that left an impact on you. If so, recall the details of that testimony and determine what made it so powerful from your point of view.

, More specifically, think back on your life and attitude before you gave your life to Christ. Ask yourself what issues were important to you and what arguments for conversion had the greatest impact on your final decision. Seek to include these elements in your own testimony.


More specifically, ask yourself about the obstacles you faced and how you felt when you were alone with your thoughts. Remember what it was that made you crave change, and any attempts you made to change in other ways prior to your conversion.

, Before you write out the actual testimony, it can be a good idea to write an outline or to otherwise summarize each section of your testimony. As a general rule, your testimony should be divided into three parts: your life before Christ, your decision to convert, and your life after conversion.

, The first part of your testimony should include information about what your life was like before you accepted Christ. Focus on the negative here. You may have been materially wealthy or well-off in other ways, and you can mention that, but you need to make it absolutely clear that your life was missing something big. In order to do that, you need to draw attention to that which you lacked, as well as your past struggles with sin.


Use specific detail rather than relying on generalities. Instead of saying, “I was materially wealthy but lacking something spiritually,” explain the luxury you lived in—“I was the boss at a successful company and had a six-digit salary”—while showing the reader that there was a definite problem—“I was so cruel that my family left me and I felt so empty inside that I drowned my cares in alcohol each night.”

, As the saying goes, “it is darkest just before the dawn.” If your life reached an all-time low before you converted, describe this specific low point. Paint the picture as effectively as possible.


If you did not have a specific moment of darkness before you turned to Christ, however, that is perfectly fine. You do not need to make your circumstances seem more dramatic than they were. Simply describe your past life as clearly as possible, including as much detail as you can about your unhappiness and your desire to seek something more. From there, move directly into the story of your conversion.

, This is the focal point of your testimony, so you need to be specific. Describe the exact moment you asked Christ into your life. You do not need to describe your conversion in mystical terms or flowery language. On the contrary, a simple statement about the day and hour it occurred is usually more effective.


Think of your conversion moment as a ""but then"" in the tale of your life. Up until this point, you've described a life that was lacking in purpose, hope, joy, or some other form of meaning. When you introduce the moment of your conversion, you are saying, ""but then...this and that happened to change my life for the better."" The entire tone of your testimony shifts from negative to positive at that moment.
As with your ""before"" story, you need to be specific when you describe the details leading to your conversion. List specific events, places, and people as applicable. If your cousin Benjamin or your long lost pal Susie first introduced you to Christianity after you ran into him at the grocery store or met her again at a school reunion, include those details in your story. Avoid non-specific statements like, ""A distant relative invited me to church one day."", Remember that your testimony should focus on God saving you. Avoid phrasing your conversion in a way that makes it seem as though you saved yourself.


As a general rule, do not focus about how “good” you were before your conversion or how “holy” your deeds became afterward. Take a step back and ask yourself if any of the details you wrote glorify you more than they glorify God. If so, rephrase them or leave them out.

, In order to see how beneficial your conversion truly was, you need to let potential readers know how your life has improved since the day of your salvation. Mention any ongoing struggles you might have, but keep the overall tone of this section positive.


Describe any specific changes you've experienced internally thanks to Christ's influence on your life. Explain how your motivation now varies from the motivation you had in the past., In essence, your entire life story could be a form of testimony in itself, but you want to avoid writing that much information when jotting down a testimony you intend to share with non-Christians. Aim for roughly 500 words, give or take another 100 words or so. This amount does not need to be strictly adhered to, but it is a goal worth keeping in mind as you write.


Another way to look at it is to consider how long it would take you or another person to read your written testimony. The target time you want to aim for is 3 minutes. Anything shorter may not include enough detail, but anything longer might start to drag on.

, More precisely, use lingo that everyone can understand instead of weaving in words and phrases limited to a church audience. If you use religious lingo, the non-Christians you hope to reach with your testimony may not be able to follow along well.


A ""church term"" does not need to be complicated. On the contrary, most terms you'll intentionally need to avoid are seemingly simple terms that have only become part of your language after you converted.
Common church terms include: born again, saved, lost, gospel, sin, repent, converted, and convicted.
Use these terms only if you intend to explain them. Often, you might find it best to simply replace the term completely by its definition. For example, instead of saying ""lost,"" say that your life was ""heading in the wrong direction"" or that you were ""separated from God."" Instead of saying ""born again,"" use a more descriptive phrase, like ""spiritual birth"" or ""spiritual renewal.""

, This is especially important if you expect your testimony to reach readers who do not speak English as their native language. Idioms do not usually translate well or carry over well from culture to culture, so foreign listeners might get confused upon hearing them.


Even if you know that native English speakers will be reading your testimony, it is still a good idea to avoid using too many idioms in your writing. When you rely too heavily on idioms to make your point, you might accidentally leave out details or more specific information that would actually make a stronger point. Consider this: does saying “I was all washed up” really convey more meaning than describing the circumstances of a meaningless career, broken family, or selfish life choices, or is the opposite true?
Idiomatic expressions can include phrases like ""Nobody gave a hoot"" or ""a God shaped hole."" When you are tempted to use one of these phrases, opt for something more direct like, ""I felt that no one cared"" or ""I felt incomplete inside.""

, While you need to use language that a non-Christian can appreciate, you also need to point your finger at God repetitively throughout the story of your salvation. One of the most effective ways to do this is to back elements of your testimony with words directly pulled from scripture.


Use one or two verses, at most, and only weave them in if they directly relate to your experience. The Word of God is a powerful tool, but the idea here is to make your testimony as personal to your own life as possible. If you rely only on scripture as you write your testimony, you won't have room for your own words.

, Make your conversion experience about you and God. You can mention someone who was vital in bringing you closer to God, but ultimately, the comments you make about other people should be fairly non-specific and brief.


In particular, you should avoid mentioning churches or denominations by name, and you should leave out any statement that reflects negatively on a church, Christian organization, or member of the Christian community., Maybe you feel as though your testimony was a rather simple, unexciting event and are tempted to exaggerate the details to make it more impressive. Similarly, if you do not have your life completely together yet, you might also feel tempted to make your current circumstances sound better than they truly are. Resist the temptation to lie about your story, though, even if your motives seem good. Only a clear, 100% true testimony can convey the truth of your faith accurately., Keep the tone of your writing casual and avoid formal speech. You want people to be able to connect and relate to you story on a personal level. In order to do this, you must address your readers on a personal level from the start.

Provide for the poor ""liberally"" as an individual as a conservative through private or church related charities and your own efforts.,
Teach your children by living in God's will yourself and as their goal, like: ""as much as it is up to you, be at peace with everyone...""; ""...love your enemy ""; ""He who wins souls is wise."",
Love others is the most conservative kind of values that you may desire for your children and grandchildren because it is to give peace to them and others.,
Teach: ""Deal with people, including children, firmly..."" but not overreacting harshly–angrily as when one even a child may not do all one could, as well as possible.

,
Celebrate their initiative and industriousness, as your child can thrive in good work so do all ""some now; some later"" while upholding high standards in a patch of weeds and briers.

,
Work with each child toward Christian wisdom, ie: ""win souls""—expecting this though not always seeing it.

,
Teach initiative: ""Get it going (and doing it right) and then improve it later!,
Read Christ's words (in red in ""Red Letter Edition of the Bible"") to them.

,
Insist on industriousness (perseverance) in activities, but relax some and enjoy your life's-work, love others to live peacefully and justly.,
Teach your children to love and bless your enemy with peace and kindness--as much as possible--not only loving your brother and your neighbor as yourself.,
Guide your children to be righteous--hopefully--but only by accepting the grace of the one true God and accepting faith in God which itself is a gift from God so that no one may boast.",How to Help Children Learn Conservative Christian Values1," Then children may learn to think critically about choices like working to be able to help others--and to believe in absolutes of a quality in Christ-likeness that may guide them to right choices.;
, and ""...never be an unjust judge;"" and I do not even judge myself] there is one judge.""

, They will grow in love in Christ among the weedy areas like among many immoral and unloving people who are not so well taught.

,,,, (in the next revision... so to speak: ""working toward perfection"").


""Lord, I believe, but help my unbelief."" expresses an imperfect faith, but Jesus said that it was expressing great faith. That is not unlike: ""Life is but a stage, and every man an actor..."" while praying for guidance from God in Jesus' name, with the creator as director–producer of your practical Christian life...

,,


""You are not finished in a day nor even in a lifetime (but still successful) with good efforts/progress...""

, Your children will value hard work and compassion as a conservative virtue, but season every virtue with ""moderation in all things,"" being self-sufficient--with the thrill of learning--with fun and love in the their lives for the weak and the most ""despised"" deserving kindness (if not liberty).

, So beginning now become more responsible with high standards of love--realizing that God is absolute love, and we are to be like him in word and deed...

Start shopping as early as possible.,
Get the recommendations and rules of dress from your priest or parish.,
Consider your own cultural traditions, and if you’d like to incorporate those into the day.,
Talk about expectations for the dress with your daughter.,
Take accurate measurements of your daughter for the best fit.,
Think about accessories you might want for the dress.,
Consider adding a veil.,
Set your budget before you start shopping, and stick with it.,
Shop with a trusted retailer.",How to Choose the Perfect First Holy Communion Dress," Communion season is in the spring, so mid-winter (December and January) are the best times to start shopping. You’ll have the most selection and won’t be scrambling to find the right dress at the last minute.;
, While there are no set rules for communion dresses, the general rules are that dresses should be white and modest. Individual parishes often have their own set of rule, so be sure to check with yours before you go shopping.

, You might want to include a family symbol into embroidery, or a flower that’s special to your family.

, Getting on the same page with each other will help you avoid conflict during a shopping trip. Share the rules with her so she knows what is expected, and listen to her ideas. This will help you narrow in on the right dress when you go shopping, too.

, Communion dresses aren’t sized like other little girl’s clothing, so you’ll need to have her measurements to make sure you are getting a dress that fits perfectly.

, If you choose a sleeveless dress, some churches will require your little girl to wear a bolero or stole. Find one that matches her dress and that she can wear comfortably throughout the ceremony. A small purse is a great idea so your daughter has somewhere to store small items on her big day.

, While the requirement for a head covering has been lifted by the church, it is still an element that can add to the deep meaning of the event. Make sure the veil is an appropriate length and won’t trip your child when she walks.

, It can be easy to get carried away looking at the beautiful dresses available for your little girl, so make sure you know what you can spend and then avoid looking at dresses outside of that range.

, Whether it’s online or in person, find a store that has a great reputation. Ask friends and family about their suggestions, and choose a store that offers great customer service.

Read children's Bible stories to them.,
Watch Christian cartoons.,
Take them to poor people and together with your children, help the poor.,
Take them to church.,
Pray with them.,
Teach them and talk about the commandments that God gave.",How to Teach Children About Jesus," It is very important for them to know about Jesus and what He did here on this earth. Children have a good memory, so they will remember the stories from the Bible about Jesus well.
, Children like cartoons. So instead of showing them junk that is not good for your brain, show them about Jesus. Not only do they read stories from the Bible, but also have a picture (video) of how Jesus walked on water, helped the poor, healed the sick, did miracles, died on the cross, and arose from the dead., Jesus here on this earth came and showed mercy and helped the poor people. You can tell your children that Jesus helped the poor, and let your children see how in real life. It also helps them understand that Jesus is a loving God. In addition, it will help them learn to be nice to people., It will help them learn more about Jesus in Bible school for children., Teach them to talk with the Lord Jesus. Tell them that not only can the read and watch about Jesus, but actually talk with Him!

Realize that young people have no individual, personal historical reference so they have no concept of the previously singular meaning of a word that is now subject to doublespeak technique (Read the book: Nineteen Eighty Four: ""1984"", by socialist George Orwell...).

,
Point out that crafty people have redefined words by their ""doublespeak."",
Support and work for conservative government, politics or politicians that define marriage as one man and one woman, define abortion (killing unborn babies) as injustice because it was and still is a sentence of death on hundreds of millions of innocent unborn babies when is used as ""a birth control method"" (brought to you in its legalized form by the in/famous Roe v. Wade decision).

,
Explain to children when they are old enough to understand birth and death that no one (conservative or ""liberal"") would be alive if women (not ""mothers"") chose to have a doctor ""terminate"", or kill (abort) us before birth as a liberal ""choice."",
Show them and explain some words that now have two opposite or dissociated meanings (doublespeak) i.e.,
Explain how it is possible that the double-talkers can and ""do"" call that which is good: ""bad"" and that which is bad: ""good!"",
Read this scripture to them: ""A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, and a rotten tree cannot produce good fruit.",How to Help Children Learn Conservative Christian Values2,",


This is not exactly the same as double-talk. Double-talk is saying a concept two ways--probably or possibly--to confuse people.
Doublespeak is similar but distinct as it is redefining words to add a new meaning that was not there before. It is like sarcastic speech (or reverse logic) being redefined as standard, logical speech.
Point out that some of the doublespeak that the politicians engage in comes from advisers; there is a possibility that some advisers would try to purposely confuse the message of the busy executive and lead the communications into failure for their own reasons: to avoid undesired change.
Point out that a lot of the doublespeak is, however, done on purpose and it has the same result as lying and is wrong and the child should never do this.

,, Choose you this day whom you will serve.

,: liberal once meant just being ""generous"" or ""kind"" but now it also means many forms of distorted logical frames of reference like using the word ""gay"" that once meant only ""happy"" to now also mean just ""one kind of sexual orientation"" which was previously not even called normal but is now normalized and ""gay."" Those are examples of ""doublespeak.""


Some non-conservatives (doublespeak: liberal/progressive) have redefined ""opposition"" to bad mores, opposing immorality indecency, amorality and immorality"" as hate.

Earnestly show that you learn important skills and new subjects in your daily life by taking a course in cooking; learning to play an instrument and polish your music, sing unto the Lord a new song, and then glorify God in your new talents.,
Show your children that you are ""consistent"" as you praise good efforts to learn and to be responsible (Don't punish ""failure"" if they are trying.),
Show children that you do not depend or rely on ""welfare agencies"" unless you are physically or mentally disabled/challenged, or live in an area with excessive unemployment, war, famine, pestilence or epidemic disease.

Do not be deceived: ""Bad company corrupts good morals.",How to Help Children Learn Conservative Christian Values3," This is whether or not you're in school--in all areas of life--and continue ""your education"" until you are very old. Learning more and helping others to succeed is a privilege, honor and should always be accepted as a challenge: this attitude is one thing that can help you achieve your aspirations (dreams and goals) and to guide your children to love learning and that they understand and uphold high standards of personal responsibility--by being conservative.

, and never be unnecessarily mean or excessively harsh, love honesty, love real justice, always show admiration of good teachings and good learning, knowing the Truth and upholding conservative standards.

,, How can you expect children to have faith unless you give God all Glory and all honor for any good thing, to accept responsibility for your actions and never blame God for the bad-times...

, If your thoughts tend toward lazy learning, you’ll have a hard time convincing your child that building knowledge and upholding good moral values is not just a good imperative: but it is truly necessary.

But there will be shallow ground for planting your seeds if your teachings come into conflict between your own:


greed, doubt and unkindness instead of

industry, faith and love, and
other needed conservative values.


So be the right kind of parent, and you may expect all manner of good things coming your way--to your family.

Appraise your initiative, industry and general work ethic.",How to Help Children Learn Conservative Christian Values4," If you mess around more than you display the value of what you have learned, or if you spend your time frivolously and neglect to build a career or to save and invest, don't expect your child to develop really much better habits.

,, Develop a plan for your own betterment including a budget and stick to it. Start saving money and invest for retirement and college funding for your children, even if it is in very small amounts.

If so, discuss with your child how you have decided to follow a better, new plan and are now determined to alter the choices you've made regarding finding and developing your life work not just a job.

, Thinking positively about teaching love of your lifework is in having a skill and a work that you value and enjoy--love it! If you are not happy in your work, take action and make realistic plans to get increased training or a different job description: accept new kinds of responsibility.

Clarify that ""There is only one God."",
Avoid explanations that seem a little too childish, ""Sunday School"" or preachy for the people to whom you are trying to give a clarification.,
Tell them the doctrine of the Trinity.,
Consider that things are, for instance, ""from the Father,"" ""through the Son,"" and ""in the Holy Spirit"" with all agreeing in one.",How to Explain the Holy Trinity," Point out that there is really no way to fully comprehend God; it is beyond our comprehension, as are God's many attributes such as being all powerful, present here and there, knowing all things. Tell them you're not trying to present just one way to comprehend this, but help them know what to look into and to comprehend by examples and comparisons.;
, A common explanation is the egg explanation. The egg represents God as a whole: one God. A yolk, the white and shell represent God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit for instance. The yolk is not the white, the white is not the yolk; each is different yet they are both egg. The shell plays in just like that too. Another common one is the apple explanation. There's the apple as a whole and the apple has three parts, the core, the flesh and the skin. It works the same as the egg. But this can often confuse an adult to whom you're explaining this and can make it no easier for them to accept the Holy Trinity because the conception of God/Our Father, Jesus/His only begotten Son and the Holy Spirit/Guide and Comforter are clearly much more involved and deeper than the conception of an egg or an apple.


However, to a young child this way may be best, at least until they're older.

, The definition of the doctrine of the Trinity is this: ""The belief that God is one in being and three in person."" God is a being and has three persons. A being is ""The quality or essence that makes something what it is."" A person is ""The quality or essence that makes someone who he is."" A being and a person are two different things. What and who is not the same. So God is a being which makes him distinctly different from his three persons. God's one being and has three persons; God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. However, these three aren't separate beings -- but ""three in one"". Remember, the being is what makes something what it is. Take a human being for example. The person is what makes someone who he is; call that personality. Ones personality is separate from the visually apparent body, yet the being's body and personality are parts of the same entity.

, The Father sent Jesus. Jesus promised to and did ask the Father to send the Spirit. The Father sent the Spirit of Christ to abide forever (eternal being). Many other concepts seen as elements of the Christian faith, regarding God: ""monotheism"" (one God), ""incarnation"" of Christ (God in the flesh), ""omnipotence"" (all power), are denoted by terms directly not found in the Bible, but Christians consider the concepts to be in the Bible (the word ""Bible"", itself, is not found in the Bible). The term ""Trinity"" is another such term.Some foreshadowing of the son of man in the term Trinity is seen in the Old Testament, as in:
""Daniel saw in a vision at night: 'behold, one like the Son of man' came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before Him. And: there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom shall never be destroyed. (Daniel 7:13-14)"".


Jesus said, as He died: ""It is finished!"" The New Testament develops the implicit concept of the Trinity, implying the Trinity in Matthew 28:19, which commanded: Baptize ""in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit"". Fourth century conferences among Christian believers led to doctrine that corresponds to data gathered from the Bible, deliberated and proclaimed in the term Trinity.

Keep walking.",How to Walk with God," To understand what it means to walk with God on a spiritual level, consider what it means to literally take a walk with a friend or relative. Ask yourself how you interact with that person. What do you expect from that individual, and how to you speak and behave in return?


When you take a walk with someone, the two of you are traveling in one direction. Your steps move at a similar pace so that neither one of you leaves the other behind. You talk with each other and your attention remains on one another. In short, there is an overall sense of harmony, unity, and community between the two of your during your walk.;
, Scriptures contain a few different examples of men and women who followed God, but to understand what it means to walk with God, look specifically for examples using that exact phrase—“walk with God.”


Enoch is the first person man in the Bible said to walk with God, and as such, he is possibly the most common example used to illustrate the concept. According the Scripture, ""Enoch walked with God three hundred years, and had sons and daughters. So all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years. And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him"" (Genesis 5:22–24).
The gist of this passage is that Enoch was in close community with God throughout all the years of his life, so much so that God took him away to Paradise at the end of his days. While this passage does not suggest that anyone who walks with God will be taken to Heaven without seeing death, it does imply that walking with God opens up the pathway there., Before you can focus on God, you need to let go of all the worldly things that distract you from your relationship with God. These distractions may not be “sins,” per se, but they include anything that you intentionally or subconsciously prioritize over God.


Think again about what it's like to walk with a friend. If your friend spent the entire time on his or her cell phone rather than interacting with you, the walk would not be very enjoyable, and you wouldn't actually be walking ""together"" on a meaningful level. Similarly, the distractions you focus on instead of focusing on God can prevent you from really walking together with God.
Sins that you cling to create an obvious distraction, but they are not the only things you need to watch out for. Even things that can be beneficial can become harmful distractions if you are not careful. For instance, working hard and earning money to support your family is a good thing. If you become obsessed with work and money to the point of neglecting your family and neglecting your relationship with God, though, you have then allowed it to become a distraction.

, It may not give you specific instructions concerning the direction your life has taken, but it does present a good picture of what God wants for and from humanity.


Since God will never call someone to do something that defies Scripture, having a thorough understanding of what the Bible says can help guide you away from harmful missteps.

, Prayer allows the believer to stay in close, personal connection with God. Prayers of thanksgiving, praise, and supplication all have their rightful place. The important thing is to pray what's in your heart.


Think again about how you behave when walking with a friend. You may walk in silence sometimes, but oftentimes, the two of you talk, laugh, and cry together. Prayer is what allows the believer to talk, laugh, and cry together with God.

, Meditation can be a tricky concept, but essentially, it means spending time in God's presence and mulling over God's works.


Modern day meditation usually involves deep breathing exercises, mantras, and exercises meant to clear the mind. While these practices alone do not quite hold the same meaning as spiritual meditation, many believers still find that they are a good way to clear the mind of distractions so that one can focus more fully on God.
If standard meditation practices do not work well for you, though, simply do whatever you can to escape from worldly distractions and spend time thinking about God. Listen to music, take a walk in a nearby park, and so on.

, While God may seem distant or silent at times, there are also times when God may interrupt the usual flow of things in a significant enough way to change the path a person is on. These signs of providence can be subtle sometimes, so you will need to keep your eyes and heart open to discern them.


Consider the story of Isaac and Rebekah. Abraham's servant went to look for a bride among Abraham's relatives in his homeland. God brought Abraham's servant to a well, and while the servant was praying for the right girl to arrive, Rebekah comes and offers him and his camels a drink—a chosen sign. The meeting was too important to merely be a coincidence. Instead, providence brought Rebekah to the well at just the right time and guided her to perform just the right actions. (Genesis 24:15-20)

, Consider the way you currently live your life. Ask yourself which components of your life follow God and which stray away from that path.


Take the time to sit down and reflect on your walk thus far. Think about times in your life when you felt “in harmony” with God. Those days were likely days on which you were walking with God. Then, think about times when you felt lost, directionless, or distant from God. Ask yourself if you were doing things that pushed God away during that time, even if those things were as simple as not making time for prayer, church, or meditation. Those days may have been days on which you paused or took a wrong turn in your walk.
Seek to model the behaviors you followed during the times you've walked with God in the past, and actively try to avoid the behaviors that previously led you astray.

, To walk with God, you must keep in step with Him. To keep in step with Him, you need to model your actions after His and follow the instructions God has already provided all of humankind with.


Part of this process means obeying God's commandments regarding moral behavior. While some view these instructions as being restrictive, ultimately, they are meant to keep humanity safe and spiritually connected to God.
The other significant aspect of following God's commands involves following God's command to love—to love God, to love one's neighbors, and even to love oneself. Model your life after the love God has shown and continues to show for humanity.

, While some steps can be determined via Scriptures and church tradition, other steps on your walk with God are more personal. To take those steps, you will need to pray to God and ask to obtain an understanding of what those steps are.


Children rely on their caretakers to guide them along safe, positive paths. They may think they know all the answers, but inevitably, the time will come when they realize that they should have listened to guidance offered by their parents, grandparents, etc., instead of stubbornly getting themselves into trouble or danger.
In the same way, believers ultimately rely on the Holy Spirit to guide them along paths that are spiritually positive.

, The answer to a prayer or the solution to a difficult circumstance may not arrive as promptly as you would like. In order to walk alongside God, though, there are times when you must slow down your own pace and walk at God's pace.


Ultimately, God will guide you to the place you are supposed to be at the time you are supposed to arrive. You might be in a rush to get there, but if you want to walk with God, you must trust that God's chosen time of arrival is better than yours when the two disagree.

, While you can certainly have loved ones outside of the faith, it is important to fellowship with others who share your dedication to God. These people can become your support here on Earth, and you can support them in return.


Other believers can also help keep you accountable to the commitment you have made to walk with God.
Keep in mind that God often uses the people in one's life to guide your steps.

, No matter how many times you trip and stumble, you need to dust yourself off and continue walking. God will not turn you away, even if you temporarily lose sight of the road you're supposed to travel on.

Wickedness and corruption will always try to lead you astray. You must be aware of these dangers before you can hope to avoid them.


Your ""spirit self"" is in constant battle with your ""flesh self."" Whichever side gains control of your beliefs and actions will gain control of your soul and become victorious.
Walking in the Spirit means walking with the Holy Spirit in a manner that allows your own spirit to gain control.;
, In essence, you'll have to face three different but connected enemies: the devil, the world, and the flesh.Know that the phrase, ""the devil made me do it,"" is somewhat inaccurate. Even though the devil has power and influence in the world, he cannot force someone who is saved and walking in the Spirit to do anything. The devil may tempt you, but giving into that temptation is your own responsibility.
The devil's influence is in the world, and as such, the world will often tempt you away from what is good and right.
Identify the flesh. The flesh is not your body, even though the two components are connected. The flesh is merely the part of you that desires worldly pleasure and rejects spiritual virtue.
Routinely denying your flesh strengthens your spirit. By taming the flesh, you are saying ""no"" to worldly desire and ""yes"" to the God., More accurately, familiarize yourself with both battle fronts. You will need to prepare yourself to confront wickedness both internally and externally.


The internal battlefield of the mind refers to the way you think and feel about the world around you and the people in it. The external battlefield of behavior refers to the way you act and speak in various situations.
These two fronts are connected. If your mind is steeped in wickedness, your actions will eventually follow. If you continually indulge in wicked behavior, your mind will gradually make excuses for that wickedness.

, There are two components of your identify. First, you must recognize yourself as a human, which means acknowledging your own weakness and limitations. Second, you must see yourself for who you are in Christ and understand the strength that comes with that new identity.


You are a soul living in a physical body. As such, true well-being refers to the state of your soul more than the state of your body.
On your own, you are not safe against sin, vice, and spiritual death.
Accepting God and embracing your identity in Christ means understanding that God loves you and is on your side.

, Every person deals with temptation, but no one deals with temptation in the same way. The temptations you feel weakest against may not be the same temptations that your neighbor feels weakest against. Identify your greatest weaknesses so that you can guard yourself against them more effectively.


You can be certain that the devil knows your weaknesses and will prey on them as often as possible. The good news, however, is that God also knows your weaknesses and knows how to prepare you to work through them.

, Once you fully understand the battle you are fighting and the danger of being led astray, you need to recognize that your greatest ally in the conflict is the Holy Spirit. Only by walking in the Spirit can you hope to overcome the flesh.


The Holy Spirit will give you the strength and endurance to fight the battle and live a virtuous life. You may still slip and stumble, but by relying on the Spirit, your overall spiritual journey will have a positive outcome.

, If you really want to walk in the Spirit, you need to make a conscious effort to do so each and every day. Your spiritual walk is the most significant aspect of your life. If you ignore it or place other issues before it, you are likely to lose your footing.


Put ""first"" things first. Your daily life is made up of various concerns—family, work, school, and so on—and each of these matters have their place. Your spiritual walk comes before all else, though, and you need to recognize that if you want to be sure of your steps.
A good way to set your mind on the Spirit is to offer a prayer of renewed faith and dependence each morning when you wake up, preferably before you do anything else.
When analyzing any given situation or circumstance, think about it in terms of how it fits in with the Kingdom of Heaven before worrying about how it appears from a worldly perspective. Ask yourself if God would be pleased with something before wondering what others will think.

, Ask God for guidance and assistance on your walk. More importantly, pray, then listen. You probably won't hear an actual auditory response, but God often has other ways of telling you what you need to know.


Typically, the Spirit will whisper some warning to your heart when you have encountered something wrong or dangerous to your spiritual well-being. Learning to interpret these whisperings can take practice, but with experience, you will likely come to understand them for what they are.
Consider what it is like to have a conversation with someone in which the other person does all the talking and never lets you speak. When you pray ""at"" God by merely reciting a wish list of requests, you do not give God the opportunity to speak to you in return. Instead of doing this, you should spend time in contemplation and meditation when you pray.
God might talk to you by putting a thought in your mind you would not usually have or by arranging circumstances in a way that stand out. Keep your eyes, mind, and heart open as you go about your daily routine.

, While feeling constant guilt over your sins can drag you down, you do need to examine your conscience on a regular basis and be honest with yourself about your missteps and stumbles. Only by acknowledging these flaws can you hope to overcome and avoid them in the future.


Consider the image of a garden. By examining the garden of your spiritual life, you can identify weeds and remove them before they start killing healthy plants and fruits. If you mow everything down carelessly, you will end up destroying good along with the bad. If you do not remove anything, though, the bad can eventually strangle the good.

, Allow God to communicate to you and trust that His will is best. Once you learn to trust God's will, you will naturally find it easier to obey it. In the meantime, you will need to obey God's will and commandments even if doing so goes against your gut instinct or human desires.


You need to obey God's law—general rules that apply to all mankind—as well as God's instructions for your own life as an individual. God's law is described in the Bible, but you will need to be attentive to how God speaks to you in your own life to decipher personal instructions.
Sometimes, the direction the Spirit leads you in will be obvious, but oftentimes, the purpose behind that guidance does not appear to make sense. It is during those moments that trust in the Holy Spirit becomes important. If you believe that God loves you and wants the best for you, it follows that God—who is all-knowing and all-powerful—will guide you toward your best possible future.
Understand that obeying God means obeying immediately. Delaying your obedience is actually a form of disobedience.

, When your life begins to exhibit these “fruits of the Spirit,” you can reassure yourself that you are walking in the Spirit as you should. These fruits are not responsible for your salvation, but they are typically the natural result of your salvation and of a healthy, consistent walk in the Spirit.


The fruits of the Spirit, according to Galatians 5:22-23, are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.Understand that the walk comes first and the fruits follow. Simply mimicking the fruits of the Spirit in your own life will not set you on the right path, mainly because it will be impossible to truly display those fruits in your long-term thinking and actions. First you must follow the Spirit. After that, the fruit will develop naturally.Do not be discouraged if you do not display all of these fruits. Spiritual struggles will likely follow you all your life. The important thing is to let God develop these traits in you in His time.

, When unavoidable conflict comes, you will need to stand firm. That being said, you should maintain a spirit of peace and love as far as your own actions are concerned. Avoid strife for the sake of nurturing your own spiritual walk. You should also avoid spreading conflict for the sake of others.


Another way to put it would be, “don't go looking for trouble.” When trouble finds you, let God guide you through it. Knowing that God will guide you through difficulties is no reason to create them yourself, though.

, Words have a greater power than people often realize. The words you choose, how you speak them, and when you speak them can help maintain your walk or quickly throw you off balance.


Listen to others before and consider what you hear before you speak.
Allow the Holy Spirit to guide your words and the motives behind your speech.
Avoid saying anything rash. Do not speak evil of anyone or use your words to harm another. Remember that there is no ""taking back"" what you said. Once you speak, the words continue to hang in the air no matter how you try to make amends later.

, There are times when you will be righteously angry, and that is fine. Blind fury and rage should be avoided, however, because that sort of anger has a tendency to destroy rather than nurture. Destructive anger will only make your walk more difficult to manage.


Be slow to wrath. Do not allow your anger to control you and control the way you deal with others.
When you get angry, ask yourself what the cause of your anger is. Righteous anger has spiritual roots and is directed toward sin and injustice. Destructive anger has worldly roots and often turns into grudges held against specific people.

Examine the matter: Paul says ""Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked.,
Be pure; don't be sexually immoral or commit adultery.,
Put God first in all things; don't be an idolater.,
Be straight; don't practice homosexuality.,
Work for your money; don't steal and don't be a swindler.,
Be generous; don't be greedy.,
Be sober; don't be a drunkard.,
Speak well of others; don't slander others.,
Make peace.",How to Stay Qualified for Heaven (Christianity)," A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction."" He also said, ""Let him who thinks he stands take heed that he does not fall!"" The question is, does this refer to falling from the faith? Possibly. Paul says, ""I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified."" (1 Corinthians 9:27). To think of even Paul possibly being disqualified seems almost unbelievable. But this article will lay out some things that can disqualify anyone for heaven, even a ""Christian.""


James says, ""Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do....faith without works is dead."" And lastly, Paul says, ""Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."" (1 Corinthians 6).;
, Sexual immorality can include a lot of things really. Paul does not mean by his statement in 1 Cor. 6 that if you were ever sexually immoral, you won't inherit the kingdom of God. Paul is saying, that if you continue in that life the rest of your life, you won't go to heaven.


Paul says ""do not be deceived."" Many are deceived into thinking ""Once, I say one prayer, I get my ticket to heaven, and so then I can live however I want!"" but that is not what the Bible says. If someone is saved, or thinks so, but is still highly sexually immoral, cheating and cruising, bar hopping or what have you, they probably aren't really saved, as seen by the evidence. What evidence?... If the mind of Christ dwells in you, it will show up. His mind is consistently/always right, not hating or being a hypocrite.
One of the number one things that turns non-believers off to Christianity is when Christians still live like anyone else does (as hypocrites), but the key is to realize that ""you shall know them by their fruit"" but not by mere perfectionism... If someone is habitually cheating on the spouse, or habitually looking at porn or sleeping around, etc., they probably aren't really ""reborn/converted/or new"" in Christ. It makes a difference in enjoying life more -- not less... and takes away the need or strong desire to ""walk in the dark, on the wild side"". Jesus Christ brings newness, joy and contentment, if you let the Holy Spirit rule and reign supreme in both your work and play. Now you want to play right, not causing pain nor habitually lusting (there are many forms of lust and greed by the way: lust of the eye, lust for ""gold"", lust for whatever could takeover ones life and also harm others).
The true mark of a Christian is one who might sin from time to time, but will regret it, repent, and want to be and then really keep trying to be different from your old-self; you do have power over all things through Christ. As Jesus said, ""Go and sin no more."" This is why John says,

""No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God."" This does not mean that a Christian will never sin, this means that a true Christian will not be in a habitual non-repentant pattern of sin. ""Except you repent, you shall all likewise perish, (like the unsaved)."" (1 John 3:9)



, An idol can be anything really; it can be a thing, person, activity, etc. Many people idolize the spouse. Be careful of doing that, because if death occurs or you are left for another, and this was your whole world, then what will you have? You will be devastated, unless you keep God first in your life -- and not your spouse.


Many people idolize money. That is why Jesus said, ""You cannot serve two masters. You will love the one and hate the other. You cannot serve both God and money."" Many guys idolize football. Many women idolize beauty and shopping.
Test yourself to see whether you have any idols in your life by considering ""What do I think about the most."" Examine the number one thing that you are often thinking about? If you are Christian, that one thing should be thinking about -- and helping others to find and enjoy knowing -- God and his Kingdom. This way of thinking is what it means to ""pray without ceasing"" as instructed in the Bible. To always have God's will in mind and constantly talk to Him about everything. ""Seek first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you,"" including material things to share. Do not expect to be blessed for ""hoarding"" gold, or anything. If the things of God are not the number one things on your mind, seek to change your priorities...
Pray that God would make you more passionate about Him and compassionate for the lost and suffering by sharing the gospel -- more than about anything else in the world -- and He will give you wisdom to do so.

, Oh, the world is tired of hearing Christians talk about homosexuality, but it actually comes up in the Bible a lot. Paul says ""men who have sex with men"" or women with women, will ""not inherit the kingdom of God."" It's interesting that he said, ""that is what some of you were."" There very well could have been people in the early church who were homosexual or bisexual, practicing any manner of sexuality before coming to Christ and now, once receiving Christ, becoming straight. There actually are several testimonies on YouTube of this happening to people.


If someone is homosexual, that person is not necessarily destined to be homosexual their entire lives. It is much as someone having a tendency toward alcoholism, it can be overcome. If God can remove an alcoholic from alcoholism, then God can remove the desire for homosexuality from a homosexual. God can do anything except fail or lie.

, Paul says that thieves will not inherit the kingdom of heaven. Joyce Meyer said once that she has even had people steal money out of her offering plate. People might need help with money, but stealing is not the way to get money.


Stealing is kind of the easy way to get money; being humble and asking for charity or a favor is harder. No one likes to ask for help. But be humble and ask for help; don't steal.
Also swindling includes conning people out of their money, or tricking them to give you their money. Or, it can be bookkeeping or accounting dishonestly, using ones ""confidence"" to get money away from a trusting soul. It is being a ""con artist"" by getting another to be confident, by faking and lying. Don't swindle people, obviously.

, When one thinks of greed it's easy to think of Mr. Scrooge in the Christmas Carol. He only cared about himself. He never wanted to share his money with anyone. But was he happy, with all the money he had? No, he was miserable. So it is when we are greedy. That is why the saying goes ""It is more blessed to give than to receive.""


Giving will usually make you a lot more happy than receiving. Satan likes to tell us the lie that receiving will make us more happy, but the truth is that the more we try to make ourselves happy, the less happy we are. Giving of yourself, not expecting anything in return, is the only way to find the bright, fresh, true joy in God (walking in The Way, the Truth and the Life).

, Does this include not getting drunk on the weekends? Possibly. We need to have everything in moderation. A little wine or beer every once in a while is okay, but going overboard ""is excess, which is sin"", just as much as over-eating is sin, etc. It harms you and others.

, To slander is to make a damaging statement about someone else. It's talking about people behind their backs, gossiping. It's telling other people things about someone that would seem to tarnish that person's character. It is trying to ruin someone's reputation. Don't do this.


Also, someone once said, if you gossip about others to people, they will probably talk about you behind your back, too. Talk nicely about other people. Don't slander anyone's character, including on wikiHow or elsewhere online, as email or texting (even though some may seem private, it can be seen by others), etc.
There can be a fine-line between ""sharing your story"" and gossiping about people. If you are ""sharing"" about what someone did to you, even without naming anyone, make sure the person you are talking to doesn't know that person. That is a general rule to follow on ""telling the truth with love,"" being a peacemaker.

, The peacemaker is blessed. Troublemakers live in trouble... spreading personal peace around, not being self-centered or lusting for revenge, or to teach a hard lesson.

Determine whether you are a Christian according to the Bible.,
Live for and affirm Christ as an individual -- probably including regular Bible Study and prayer, church attendance, witnessing/testifying of the Truth, helping others to see the light, etc.,
Respect and desire the best for your community, state, country, etc.,
As an individual, be honest above all, and keep in mind that your actions will be seen and interpreted not only as an advocate of your causes, or as an officeholder, but as a Christian advocate or Christian officeholder.,
Decide how and to what extent that you support the armed forces in keeping peace and/or fighting to make peace.,
Support public servants as best you can, ie: the courts, officials of the courts who are assigned or elected to keep law and order, including police officers -- and also the efforts of fire and rescue personnel in peace, disaster or war.,
Consider collaborating/cooperating together with others including other patriots, as much as possible: but you clearly will not agree on each and every facet of building your own community or extended community, state and nation.,
Show appropriate respect as seems right to you for the symbols of your country and the symbols of Christianity, for example:


Respect prayer, reverence God, bow your head when someone prays.,
Pray for your government leaders and authority that scripture says were put (or allowed) there by God.,
Examine factors that define you as a patriotic person as a Christian (subordinated to God) -- whether conservative, independent, liberal, or libertarian -- and decide whether you are a patriotic Christian by the indications of what you perceive as loving and devoted patriotism as you believe is right.",How to Take Action to Be a Patriotic Christian," That is: Be born again, believe and say that Christ is your personal Savior, pray and repent to the one, true God for salvation.


Salvation is explained here: ""8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. 10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."" (Ephesians 2:8-10)
And ""Patriotic Christian"" as an oxymoron is explained here: I Samuel 8.;
, Proceed to put on the whole garment and armor of God:


Be prepared for every eventuality explained/listed here: ""14 Stand firm therefore, having 'girded your loins with truth' , and having put on the 'breastplate of righteousness' , 15 and having 'shod your feet with the preparation of the Gospel of Peace' ; 16 in addition to all, taking up the 'shield of faith' with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 And take the 'helmet of salvation' , and the 'sword of the Spirit' , which is the word of God. 18 With all prayer and petition 'pray at all times in the Spirit,' ... "" (Ephesians 6:14-18), ie: your life is armored also with prayer.
Keep your life under the control of God's Holy Spirit. Yield and sacrifice your will and your ways to Him who is comforter, helper, guide and the Spirit of the ultimate judge of all things.

, ie: be patriotic. Consider staying informed about each of the political choices facing you.


Cast your vote whenever possible, for your candidates and issues that you have identified.
You might also consider running for a politiacal office.

, Build your efforts around God as your architect in what ever decisions you are called upon to make in the public sector.

, Consider whether you support war as a Christian if your military personnel must establish security, be peacemakers and maintain defense in time of war.

, This would include paying your taxes (following Christ's example in the New Testament).

, Be willing to and be fair and proactively work and fight fairly with other people. You probably will want to strive for ""peace, the Gospel, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" while taking responsibility for your own improvement, fortune, future and nurture future leaders.

,
Consider whether you will stand and place your hand over your heart when they play your National Anthem.
Treat your armed forces veterans and those who served at home as officers, as well as fire and rescue (men and women) with your kind of respect.

, Do not make railing accusations against those that may seem less Christian or less patriotic, but work to help to choose, elect and motivate them to be the best they can be.

, God seeks a ""peculiar"" or particular individual to serve him and the people, but not one off the beaten path of the Bible.

Go ahead: Support and vote for the right values (depending on individual work and effort) to reflect those in the Bible in local, state and national politics.,
Be involved in one-on-one working for God and the Gospel to guide and strengthen His values in your home area, workplace and school


,
Contribute to the local and national elections in many ways, as you donate, post signs, stickers, knock on doors, talk, phone, answer phones run for office, etc.

,
Uphold God's values in politics, but do not expect much of liberal politicians who may see God and the Gospel as mainly wooing members of some various organizations and getting their own influence without pressing the truth of the power or the ""reality of God."",
Remember the message of Jesus was for establishing freedom of worship and openness, with equal opportunities for all people.,
Model and expect outstanding individual morality like protecting life of the least of God's children (born/unborn) and using good values in every way (Like: find out and know who will choose judges who will not legislate from the bench!).,
Do not expect a successful politician to move your social/moral religious reform in the right direction even if one can get support from each of you--unless you each support and help the right people into the legislative branch and as elected judges--not just the executive branch (the president's office) where many judges are appointed!

,
Know what to expect of a candidate if their faith is guiding their decisions.,
Do your duty to win people to the Lord, and then humanists (liberals) who are called ""progressives"" now days can be faced without fear.,
Pray about the elections and especially pray about judges that are appointed who can rule and make law changes of many things by just handing down rulings, orders...

,
Do what you say that you believe, knowing that God will judge you and your nation rightly.,
Keep in mind the purpose of God's followers that should be winning the hearts of individuals and honoring God--not so much arguing or fighting for gimmicks like honoring Holidays!

,
Suppose the Church wins the gimmicks debates in the shopping and decorations, and the good ""words"" are put back in public places, and is keep on our money (while money represents greed to get ahead to many).,
Tell everyone that we need truth and real love that will never come from politicians; rather, it will come from you.,
Stir up the change.,
Expect a decline in all kinds of values, if you each one are not looking for the right kinds of changes.,
Be a good teacher.,
Study Christian political thinkers: Check at the library or a Christian and bookstores by a subject, author or title that you may see or hear discussed.

",How to Be a Christian Political Activist for Conservative Issues," Even if the wrong person is elected, do not fear. Try again in the next election.;
,,, Understanding politics will not save our way of life without conservative values!

, He was against corruption in the establishment, speaking against self-centered authorities and religious rulers of his time. We can now conserve such Christian values and seek changes that would improve lives of people.

, That is a part of each person's responsibility in the election process.

,, You need to see what guiding principles are active before deciding how to vote. Is it really the right change?

, Godly people such as yourself are busy mentoring another person in really believing and understanding ways of the Lord--rather than arguments that will not change moral and spiritual values but do this: be filled with the Holy Spirit.


American polls show that over 90 percent of Americans claim some form of Judeo-Christian faith. 61 percent of those (making 54 percent over all) state that religion is very important to their personal lives. This shows that most people want to follow God's will.The main way humanists will gain more influence in the arena political is to urge, confuse, intimidate and buy believers with promises of ""change"" and promising virtually impossible things that they actually do not clarify or explain very well. Then when elected they can say: ""Oh it is worse than I knew, and we can not afford to do those things. We'll do what we can."" Not much... of the promises.

,, You and your Church may continue losing influence by allowing politics, politicians and judges to set the moral and spiritual mood in your entertainment, work, school and society. They will not stop immorality or spiritual decline in the marketplace and streets like:


In political debates like putting Christ back into Christmas which progressives insist on calling an unidentified object--winter break or holiday. Tell your neighbor not just your legislators about what is the right change! Santa can not change that for you... God can!
""God"" as a word: God in our pledge of allegiance and on our money? Just thank God--not those symbols!
The Easter Bunny is a business gimmick, but it does not say anything versus the resurrection at Easter; you must tell it!

,, Who have you brought closer to God in the shopping centers, or can this simply anger people who must allow or submit to your values in shopping malls and the town street decorations? They do not submit in the soul, mind or core-belief system.

, When your telling the Good News and it has engaged another person, then that individual will change the world around him or her. This will change the moral and spiritual climate of any nation.

, Politics can not cause the right change ultimately; it is simply a reflection of the world view: politics which change. God does not change. He allows each to make his or her way and He will assist us as He will.


If the public view is looking for God's values, the politics of America can see some more Godly values.

, The spiritual revival and renewal of your nation and individual faith that you need in America will never originate from any human being.

, When the spiritual climate changes enough, then the politics will follow, but don't change your essential teachings with the changing political winds.,"

Always be patient with others.,
Remember to be kind to others.,
Don't envy other people for what they have.,
Don't boast or brag to others.,
Remember to not be proud.,
Always honor others; always show them respect.,
Don't be self-seeking.,
Try to not be easily angered.,
Don't keep a record of wrongs.,
Here is a final exercise that would be good for anyone to do.",How to Show Others a 1st Corinthians 13 Love,"


Know that God made each person differently. Some people might have strengths that you don't have, or you might have strengths that others don't.
Remember that not everyone is like you. You might naturally be a quick person and others are not, but don't expect them to be just as quick as you -- or get mad, if they aren't. They are not less than you, but different. In some cases, being slower is better, because one can pay more attention to details.
If people aren't up to speed with you in any area, be patient with them. If they aren't as far along in their walk with God, let them be where they are, instead of trying to rush along their spiritual growth. Everyone grows at their own pace with God.;
,


However your mom was with you, if she was generally a good mom, be that way with others. Be gentle with others.
A good trick for this is to imagine that everyone in your life is a little baby, or an elderly person. You might then be a lot more kind to them.
Also it helps to remember that everyone has battles they are facing in their own lives.
If someone is rude to you, try to understand where they are coming from. If you understand someone's past, it makes it a lot easier to be kind and merciful to any mistakes they make in the present. Amen.

,


The best antidote for envy is to be grateful for what God has already blessed you with. The more thankful you are, the less envious you will be of others.
Write a list of all the things you are thankful for knowing or having. The fall Thanksgiving season is a nice time to do so, and any time that you are feeling empty/sad.

, That is not loving. But, telling someone about lessons you've learned from events or mistakes can be worthwhile, if they enjoy your way to telling the stories (and parables just as Jesus loved to give shades of meaning which enlightened subjects in interesting ways, for those who could receive Him, it was Life).


Trying to get other people to be jealous of you is not love. Trying to show that you are better than others is not loving.
Our only boast can be in Christ, because without him in our lives, we would be nothing. Any good that we can do or accomplish, God enabled us to do it.
There really is no place for boasting for anyone. As the Bible says, ""Every good and perfect gift is from above.""

,


Love sacrifices for others. Love thinks of others before itself.
To be proud is to think of oneself as number one (above all). Pride is when a person ignores the needs/wishes of others on all sides, and focuses on oneself, ones little group and that's all. That is not love.
Pride can be seen in two opposite forms; either people have pride in thinking they are way better than they are, or people have pride in thinking overly lowly of themselves. The reason why the second one is pride is because they expect perfection of themselves, but when they fall short, they are depressed. No one should expect to attain perfection since no one is capable of it. On one side a person sets the bar too low so always thinks, ""I'm just great!"", and on the other side another one sets the bar much too high, and so thinks ""I'm horrible..."" Both are wrong.
Humility is in the middle of these two extremes. This is a principle of balance. Finding balance, in Christ, one can gladly say, ""I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me."" and ""So, when I am weak... then I am strong .""

,


Men are not the only ones that care about being respected, women do too. Children need their own measures of respect as well, to have them learn successfully and grow up confident and strong in the nurture and understanding of God's Love.
To honor someone, for example, is to speak well of him or her to others.
To honor a person is to treat him or her as a king when you are around that individual.
Always ask yourself, ""If this person was Jesus, how would I treat him or her right now?"" Jesus said, ""whatever you do to the least of these you do to me (to the Lord).""
And if the person is a Christian, that you do offend, you grieve God's Holy Spirit. So always honor and respect others.

,


Think about what other people might want or need.
If you are married, don't make one-sided decisions without consulting one another; such as picking the movies or restaurants that you want, but rather ask your spouse what he or she wants. Then as likely as not you'll get to choose the places and things that you both enjoy (that is peace and love).
In any relationship, it will be much better, if we ask others what they want. Seek to meet the needs of others and not just your own.

,


Don't be touchy. Don't be easily offended by what people say or do. Try to have a thick skin about things. Learn to not let people affect you as much, for happiness and fulfillment of those concerned.
Keep your cool in every situation, smile often, and enjoy being respected. But if one blows up or becomes defensive and becomes offended easily, those who experience your blowing steam won't have as much respect for ones character. And you don't enjoy being around anyone who gets all rattled, if anything does not go perfectly.
A good verse to remember is ""man's anger does not bring about the righteousness of God."" Amen.

,


Don't keep a running tally of how many times your spouse, etc. has said something disagreeable to you.
When you fight with someone, don't pull a list of everything wrong from the past 10 years. Let things go. You may think of it, but hold it; be forgiving by not reminding the other of it ever again (God is like that!). Don't hold something over someone's head for a second go around. Let it go; forgive, and move on.

, Try inserting your name before each of these traits in the verse in 1st Corinthians 13: ""Love is patient, love is kind..."" becomes ""___ is patient; ___ is kind"" and so forth. See whether you can in good conscience put your name in for each of those. If not, meditate on how you can and will get better in those areas. When an opportunity arises, practice your skill to make progress in some area of expressing Love.

Determine the size of the figure.,
Figure out the space required for the arms.,
Draw a big rectangle.,
Start with the detailing.,
Start with the facial features.,
Mustache and Beard.,
Make the robe.,
Do the shading.,
Outline the image.",How to Draw Jesus," Before you start drawing Jesus, you must know the relative length of the figure you want. Accordingly, you may adjust the figure on any given sheet of paper. It should not happen that the paper is too large and the figure too small or that the figure is too large that it doesn't fit the full figure well. This is to maintain a balance between the drawing sheet and the actual drawing. Sketch out a cross. This will serve as a guideline when you draw the body. But make sure do it lightly so you can easily erase.


The result after keeping the background and the foreground in mind will determine how the background and the foreground complement each other and shows your drawing at large.;
, You must consider how much space the drawing will take vertically and horizontally. The drawing of Jesus must fit on the paper and you must not end up with lesser space for the arms. In this figure the arms are extended horizontally. Hence a good size of paper is required. Sketch the head and hands. On the top of the vertical line, draw an oval for the head.


This oval is just for your reference as to how much space a part will take and within this space you must encapsulate the specific part. You may erase these ovals and lines when the actual parts are ready.

, The drawing must fit in horizontally and vertically. This rectangle will act as a guiding area within which the torso must be drawn.


With this you are ready to start with the features and detailing like the hair, eyes, nose, lips, beard and so on.

, You may start drawing hair. For this draw wavy or straight lines beginning at the top of the head. Typically you must start at the very center partition as Jesus has almost all His portraits with center parting. Start at this partition and work it till the shoulders. Do not worry if the hair strands don't look even. Since it is hair, it will look all the more original if it is not very straight or proper


Make the hair strands a little below the shoulders. Jesus's hair is a little longer than the shoulders.

, Make eyebrows a little below the forehead. Below the eyebrows you may start making the eyes. Add two stretched curvy lines which are pointed at both ends for the eyes. The top curvy line of the eyes can have another line. If there are two lines for the top line or the eye lid, it gives a more realistic appearance for the eyes.


You may make guiding lines for the eyes, nose and mouth as per your convenience.
Make 'u' shaped pupils inside. A perfect circle for the pupil gives the appearance of surprise or shock. A 'u' gives a calm appearance.
Once you are done with the eyebrows and the eyes you may make a curved line for nose. There will be two curved lines at first. First will be the long line for the length of the nose and the second will be the smaller curve to complete the nose.

, Make small lips. The lips could be curved slightly upwards to show a smiling Jesus or you may leave it straight for a simple expression.


Around the lips make the mustache and the beard but very lightly.
The mustache could be shaded vertically while the beard could be done horizontally.
The beard will start from the lips and extend to till the ears. Then you may draw the beard long. The beard appears like a triangle pointing down. But it is not a perfect triangle.

Remember, a little difference in the features will not be a big problem if you are planning to outline the drawing later on. The outlined image looks different from the sketched one.
The image changes appearance even after coloring it if you plan to color it later on.


Also for the hands you may make two ovals at end of the arm. Later you could create fingers which will be curved upwards. Remember to make the fingers slightly pointed at the end and thicker where it starts.

, With long lines sketch the robe.


Make the scarf on top accordingly. To make it look more appealing, draw extra lines on the clothing to show folds on the garment.

, You may shade the drawing as you progress or after drawing the complete figure as per your comfort.


The shading or the pencil strokes are darker and thicker when there is a fold. Eg. On the robe where it is folding. You may also shade darker at the end of each feature to make the features stand out.
You may hold the pencil or color you are using gently while shading. This will help you in increasing and decreasing thickness and intensity of the color too.

, Outlining a drawing enhances its appearance and adds a finishing touch to it. Outlining determines how the drawing will look hence it is best to be careful and keep your hands steady.


After you outline the complete drawing of Jesus you may erase all guidelines of the pencil.

Understand the Church.,
Understand the dimension of the Church.,
Sketch a shape that looks like a house.,
Add detailing to the Church.,
Draw the entrance.,
Beautify the Church.,
Color and outline.,
Create shadow.",How to Draw a Church," To make a good Church you must first understand the size of the Church. The Church must fit well on the drawing surface or paper. So justify your desired Church figure as to how far and wide it will stretch so it fits well.;
, The Church will not be visible from all four sides on a sheet of paper. Understand which sides of the Church will be displaying in your drawing. This sets the view or the perspective of the drawing. The front view will look larger and the back side of the Church will look narrow. This narrowness shows that the Church is small or big. The more narrow it gets from front to back, the bigger the Church appears.


Draw the lines keeping the Church's walls in mind. The lines of the walls will start straight and end in a slope depending upon your design in mind.

, This is like a rough outline for your understanding. Once you being drawing from a direction either left, right, top or bottom, you can develop on it as you draw more. As you progress, check the original Church image if you have one. If you are drawing a Church on your own with your imagination, then it will appear like your imaginative Church.


You may use stencils for drawing perfect shapes or just make triangle from the sides of a rectangle.

, Draw a tower on top. Add some windows to the walls. The windows could be well-shaped or ornate like in most Churches. Draw the rectangular door in front. You may make the door conical at the top.

, For the entrance you may make steps. Make a straight line on your sketch and create box like figures to add a third dimension to the stairs.

, Depending upon your requirement you may beautify your Church. It is seen that many Churches have colored glass on the doors and windows. You may make a colorful display on the doors and windows to make your drawing look more aesthetic and beautiful. Add some details on it. Create lines that will form different kinds of shapes for the window.

, You may try dark colors for the roof and light colors for the windows. You may blend different colors too for creating the illusion of depth and dimension. Outline the drawing with a darker sketch pen or charcoal pencil depending upon your choice of colors.


If you are not very proficient with coloring you may use crayons or pencil colors and make very light strokes.
As you color, you may play with the light and darker colors.
A hint to color well is to assign an area where light falls. Like sunlight will not be alike on the east and the west. Hence, one side will be dark, another will be lighter.

, Try to put some shadow on it and change the color of the outline. You may darken the areas at the joining of two walls. Make the coloring strokes either horizontal or vertical. If you make dark strokes of color which is showing horizontal and vertical patches of color, it may not look very appealing. Make the colors blend and maintain the coloring strokes in a flow.

Break a water fast with fruit.,
Slowly introduce vegetables when breaking a liquid fast.,
Eat snacks to return to regular eating.",How to Fast and Pray," A traditional fast involves fasting from food, but you can also fast from media or different habits.An absolute fast or water fast requires you to abstain from all solids and liquids aside from water.
A liquid fast requires you to abstain from all solid food, but you can still drink any liquid you want.
A partial fast requires you to abstain from certain foods or from all foods during a portion of the day. This fast is especially common for Catholics during Lent.
A traditional Lenten fast is a partial fast. You should abstain from meat on Fridays and Ash Wednesday. On Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, you should limit yourself to one full meal and two smaller meals that should not be large enough to equal the size of another standard meal. All drinks are acceptable.
A bread and water fast permits you to consume bread and water, but nothing more.
A media fast requires you to abstain from media. This can include all media, or it can include a certain form of media, such as television or the Internet.
A habit fast requires you to abstain from a certain type of behavior. This could be anything from raising your voice to playing cards. This is another fast commonly practiced during Lent.;
, You can fast anywhere from one day to several weeks. Settle on a length of time that is both healthy and spiritually challenging.


If you have never fasted before, it is recommended that you fast for no longer than 24 to 36 hours.
Do not fast from fluids for more than three days.
Consider easing yourself into an extended absolute fast. Begin by fasting from one meal for several days. After your body has adjusted, fast from the next meal, and finally, fast from all meals.

, In your prayers, ask God for guidance on what the objective of your fast should be. This objective will provide your prayers with focus and direction as you fast.


Spiritual renewal is a common reason for fasting, but you can also fast if you desire guidance, patience, or healing.
You can also fast for a specific cause that extends beyond your personal spiritual needs. For instance, if a natural disaster strikes, you could fast and pray for those impacted by the disaster.
Fasting can be done as an expression of gratitude, as well.

, Repentance is a key element to successful fasting and successful praying.With God's direction, make a list of your sins. The list should be as comprehensive as possible.
Confess these sins to God, seeking and accepting forgiveness.
You should also seek forgiveness from those whom you have wronged and express willingness to forgive those who have wronged you.
Ask God for guidance on how to make amends for your wrongdoings.

, That said, you can tell those whom you believe will provide you with spiritual support during your fast.


Pastors, significant others, and spiritual partners are usually good options.
Ask God for direction on whom to go to for support.

, In addition to preparing spiritually, you also need to prepare physically.


Start slow, especially if you are new to fasting. Eat small meals before your fast to prepare your body.
Avoid caffeine a full 24 hours in advance, as caffeine withdrawal can cause and intensify headaches.
Slowly remove sugar from your diet a week or so before an extended fast, since people who consume large amounts of sugar usually find fasting difficult.
Consider eating a strict diet of raw foods several days before an extended fast.

, While you can pray for anything during a fast, determining an objective for your fast beforehand provides you with a focal point to center the majority of your prayers around.


Be open to a change in focus. It is possible that you will feel called to fast for one reason, only to discover that God wants you to meditate over another objective, instead.

, You can follow a Bible study guide or turn through the pages of your Bible in whatever way you feel called to do. Take notes on what you read and pray for a fuller understanding of scriptural lessons.


Note that if you are not a Christian, you should meditate over whichever holy text lies at the heart of your faith.
You can also meditate over spiritual books that you are reading during the time of your fast.

, The majority of your prayers will likely be impromptu, personal prayers in your own words. When you are lost for words, however, consider switching to a scripted prayer in order to guide your communication with God.


One of the most common scripted prayers is the “Lord's Prayer,” also called the “Our Father.” Any scripted prayer can be used, however, especially if it calls to you.

, The use of prayer aides can be controversial for some faiths, but they are acceptable for many others.


Common prayer aides associated with Catholicism include rosaries, saint medals, and crucifixes. For non-Catholic denominations of Christianity, you could consider listening to instrumental versions of common hymns or using non-rosary prayer beads.

, While most of your prayers will likely be done on a personal, individual level, you can consider praying with others during your fast, as well. Praying in a group is thought to petition God to be among you, making group prayer a powerful tool.


You can pray aloud or silently. If praying aloud, however, avoid comparing your own prayers with those of the people around you.
Good prayer partners during a fast usually include the people you have informed about your fast and anyone who is fasting alongside you.

, You can pray at any time of the day, regardless of where you are or what is happening around you. During a time of focused prayer like a fast, though, it is important that you find silent time to spend with God in a one-on-one manner.


You could use a quiet spot indoors. A bedroom is often a good place, but any quiet corner of your home or office is appropriate. You can even pray when you find yourself alone in your car.
Alternatively, you can pray outdoors, as well. A quiet spot in the woods allows you to spend time in prayer with God while also admiring God's creation.

, Making a prayer schedule can be useful, especially for extended fasts, but you should not obey your schedule so strictly that you prevent yourself from praying spontaneously as the Spirit calls you.


Pray during your newly-created free time. The time you would usually spend on eating, watching television, or performing a habit you decided to fast from can be spent in prayer.
Make a point of starting and ending your day with a time of prayer.

,


Shower or bathe every day, especially during these first three days.
Brush your teeth more than usual during these first three days to ward off foul breath.

, Fasting is a time of close, personal communion between you and God. By appearing to others as though you are suffering, you invite pity and admiration, which could inflate your pride and make it difficult to approach God in a state of humility.

, You should not go more than three days without water.


You can abstain from other fluids, such as juice or milk, but you should continue to drink water during the majority of an extended fast. Otherwise, you run the risk of causing serious dehydration, which is likely to result in severe health problems.

, People who skip a meal tend to feel grumpy. As such, it is to be expected that skipping many meals will make you even grumpier. Mind your emotional state, and if you feel ready to snap at the next person who approaches you, find a solitary space to pray and reflect instead.

, Casual walks are acceptable and encouraged, but fasting drains you of a great deal of energy, so you need to rest as often as you can.


To the same end, you should also avoid any vigorous exercise.

,


Note, however, that you should not stop any prescription medications without your physician's approval and supervision.

, You may have learned a lot during your fast, but there may yet be other lessons you can take away from your fast that you can only discover after it ends. Ask God to guide you as you reflect and as you move forward so that you can make the most of your fasting experience.


If you committed to a partial fast, media fast, or habit fast, focus on your successes rather than you failures. Many people falter on these fasts at some point, especially if they are unaccustomed to fasting. Instead of deeming the experience to be a failure due to your weak points, focus on the lessons learned and spiritual strength gained during your strong points.
Express gratitude. Above all else, reflect an move forward in a spirit of thanksgiving. Give thanks to God for the completion of a successful fast and for any spiritual direction you received during your time of fasting.

, If you only fasted for 24 hours, you can return to a normal eating schedule the following day.


Similarly, if you only fasted from a certain type of food or from a single meal, you can safely reintroduce the food or meal into your diet without taking extra precautions.

, If you fasted from all food and liquid aside from water, you should gradually reintroduce food to your diet with solid fruit.Watermelon and other fruits that have a high water content are best.
You can also drink fruit juices to re-accustom your body to food matter other than plain water.

, If you continued drinking fruit and vegetable juices during your fast, gradually break your fast with a slow, steady intake of vegetables.


On the first day, eat nothing more than a raw salad.
For the second day, add a baked or boiled potato to your diet. Do not use butter or seasoning.
During the third day, add a steamed vegetable to your diet. Again, do not use butter or seasoning.
From the fourth day onward, you can reintroduce your normal diet in a way that feels convenient and comfortable for your body.

, As you return to regular eating, consume several small snacks or meals for the first few days instead of immediately jumping to large meals.

It might start some conversations.

Rest in the Lord.,
Never accept that you can lose your salvation.,
Don't buy into conditional salvation.,
Stand on the simplicity of Jesus Christ's completed work.,
Believe.,
Realize that your faith is your faith - nobody has the right to tell you that it isn't real, or that it isn't good enough.,
Accept that you may need to find a new church home.,
Listen critically and apply logic.,
Be the gay person in their lives.,
Remember that this is your Christian Walk.,
Maintain your sense of humor and humility.,
Remain a person of dignity, integrity,support, and faith.",How to Reconcile Your Christian Faith with Your Gay Life," Relax and have faith that Jesus loves you. Right where you are. ""Just As I Am"" is a hymn that captures this thought perfectly. You don't need to do a thing to earn His love, and none of us can ever deserve His love. Remember the Roman centurion who asked Jesus to heal his servant; Jesus didn't ask him to repent as a condition of answering the centurion's request. What impressed Jesus was the man's faith. Despite being wholly undeserving, incredibly, amazingly, we still have His love - never forget that, and He will always bring you Home to Himself.;
, Once you are born again, you cannot be ""unborn."" Jesus will never let you go once you have given yourself to Him. Anyone who tells you that being gay will cause you to lose your salvation is wrong. Remember the Prodigal Son. He rejected his father, asked for his inheritance before his father was even dead, took the inheritance - and left. Can you turn your back on someone any more than that? Did his father stop loving him? No. Does God ever stop loving you? NO. You may even fall away from your faith. When you come back, God will be there, still accepting you, still loving you.

, Are we supposed to repent and turn away from our sins? Absolutely. But must we? No. In fact we cannot be freed from all sin while we are alive. If it were really true that we had to leave all sin behind when we accept Jesus, and never sin again as a condition of salvation, then God's mercy would not need to be infinite. He knew that sin would be a fact of everyone's life, all of our lives. Jesus says that we should not only forgive the first time someone sins against us, but ""seventy times seven."" That's in Matthew, by the way. How many people would you forgive after they did the same thing to you, not once, not twice, but 490 times? And yet, that's what Jesus commanded. How many of the church people you know could say they would be willing to do that? Not many, if they were honest. Probably not even one could. Yet God will, and does. Even if you accept the idea that being gay is a sin (which most, if not all churches do), remember that it is just a sin - it is the same to God as any other sin (any sin is enough to keep you out of Heaven, if not for Jesus' vicarious atonement). You can take great comfort in knowing that Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient for you - there is nothing you have done, or ever will do that's big enough to keep you away from Him.

, As Jesus was dying on the cross, He said, ""It is finished."" But the Hebrew translation says, ""It is completed."" Either way you want to say it, it means the same thing - when Jesus gave His life on the cross, He paid the price for everyone's sin, once and for all. No one can add anything or take anything away from this work - it was completed by Jesus alone. No matter what else others may say is necessary for you to achieve salvation, remember that Jesus has already completed this work. Obey the 10 Commandments because it's smart, and because you want to follow the rules God set out for us. But doing that will not get you to Heaven - not without Jesus.

, Don't let those who would hang you up on loopholes or technicalities convince you that you aren't really saved. The Bible is very clear (they will tell you this, too, but they will mean something altogether different - don't let them scare you). It doesn't say, ""Do good works to your neighbor to be saved."" It doesn't say, ""First, get right with God."" No, it doesn't - read it yourself. Don't listen to others telling you what it says, not even this article. But we can quote a little here: ""Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that BELIEVETH on me hath everlasting life."" (Note that He says ""verily"" twice - that means it was important enough to repeat it. ""Verily"" means ""I'm telling the truth here."") That's from John 6:43-47. It also says, ""…and all our righteousness are as filthy rags."" —Isaiah 64:6. This means that you can do all the good things you want, but without Jesus, they don't mean anything to your salvation. Very simply put, you can do nothing to get into Heaven or to save yourself - except to Believe in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. When it comes right down to it, those people are really saying that what Jesus did was good enough to save them, but not to save you. Let them know that you don't plan to be the one to say that to Jesus Christ and see how they react.

, Christian faith is a deeply personal and intimate relationship between you and Jesus Christ. Sometimes, church-going people forget this, and instead become fixated on the dogma, or the rules, of their particular church denomination. Don't fall prey to giving too much weight to the opinions of other humans. Instead, rely on God, and remember that only God can put on your heart what He wants from you. As you grow in your relationship with Him, you will know what things He wants you to change or to work on. Again, listen to Him.

, Many Christian religious bodies, unfortunately, seem to feel that excommunication is necessary. First, they may pressure you to renounce your homosexuality. When you are unable to comply, they may inform you that you are no longer welcome to their fellowship. Never mind that Jesus would never do this - He insisted upon spending time and cultivating relationships with people the church despised. You're in good company. Find a new church where you can be welcomed and accepted for who you are.

, Most people are simply resistant to ideas they themselves are not familiar with. Be logical and remain calm - above all, don't buy into any hysterical exchanges about sinfulness, etc.

, Most of these people do know a gay person, but don't realize it. You have an opportunity to show them that gay people aren't contagious or perverted. If you can find it within yourself to help them see you as an individual of faith and value, you may be able to help others like yourself. Even if you are uncomfortable with their bigoted or ignorant questions and assumptions, you may be able to educate them.

, No one can walk your Walk for you. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't really saved, that your faith isn't good enough, or that ""even the devil believes in Jesus."" The devil may indeed believe in Jesus, but you have accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior - the devil has not. This is your Walk. Walk it your way, with a humble heart and your head held high, remembering that it is you who will stand before Jesus one day and answer Him as to whether you owned Him as your Lord and Savior - those people will not be able to answer for you. Have faith that He knows your heart and will know that your answer is true.

, People who don't have a gay person in their lives (or at least, don't realize that they do) may surprise you with their reactions. Try to maintain a sense of humor if they make clueless or homophobic remarks, and remember that you are as clueless about other things as they are about you - try to keep a compassionate perspective.

, Even if your present church refuses to accept you as you are, there will be others who will welcome you. Rather than crying forever over the things you have lost, try instead to focus on the blessings you do have in your life.

Treasure the present moment.",How to Please God," You need to look at your relationship with God in the same way that God does. This means viewing God as a Heavenly Father and not as an impersonal deity.Your relationship with God should be based on love and not on the blind obedience of rules.
Think about family relationships among humans, focusing primarily on the relationship between parent and child. Even someone who has had issues with a human parent can usually understand what healthy parental love looks like. The expectations God has for you are similar to the expectations a loving parent has for his or her child. The only difference is that God's love is perfect, so the things he desires of you and for you are perfect, as well.;
, In this context, ""faith"" means believing in God and believing that God will fulfill the promises He makes.It also means trusting God with every aspect of your life and having confidence in God's ways above and before your own.


Hebrews 11:6 (NIV) explains, ""Without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.""
Faith should be the foundation of your Christian life. Every good thing that God leads you to do and that you do for the sake of pleasing God should be a direct result of your faith. The more you strengthen your faith, the more earnest you will naturally become in your desire to do what is pleasing to God.

, All humans are born into sin and fall short of perfection, but through the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, humanity is offered grace and a clean slate. Accepting this sacrifice and following Christ into grace is a key component of pleasing God.God does not want you to be a slave to sin and death. Accepting the gift of salvation that God offers to you is the greatest thing you can do to please Him.

, You can either live by the flesh or live by the Spirit. If you live by the flesh, you let the ways and temptations of the world rule your life. If you live by the Spirit, you live your life centered around your dedication to God. Only living by the Spirit will allow you to be in the position of pleasing God.


As noted in Romans 8:7-8, ""The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.""

Walking in the Spirit does not mean that you will never sin again, of course. You will face temptation and stumble from time to time. When you do fall, examine your conscience, repent, and ask God to help you resist that same temptation in future.

, Fearing God does not mean that you should spend your days living in fear of divine punishment. In this context, ""fear"" is a sort of respect and reverence. To fear God, you simply need to recognize the power and authority He has over everything else.


As indicated in Psalm 147:11, ""The Lord delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love.""
The right kind of fear can remind you to stay accountable and help you resist temptation.
Realizing how much a being as powerful as God loves a being as weak as a human can also deepen your love and appreciation for God.

, God does not force you to love or serve Him; He merely gives you the freedom to do so. Once you understand that serving God is a privilege and a liberty, doing so out of love can become more natural.


Remember that your relationship with God should be centered on love. If you are serving God out of blind obedience or a desire to “look good” in front of your peers and family, your focus is off and needs to be adjusted.

,


Bible study, fellowship with other Christians, and quiet meditation are all tools you should use to deepen your relationship with God. Understand that God's approval does not depend upon how thoroughly or frequently you make use of these tools, though. God takes more pleasure in your faith and relationship with Him than in the exact tools you use to express that faith.
If you ever have to choose between doing good work in God's name and working on your relationship with God, choose the latter. If you allow your faith to become empty and shallow, even the best of your works will become meaningless on a spiritual level.

, In a broad sense, discovering God's will can be done by studying the Bible and seeking a deeper understanding of it. To understand God's will for your life, you also need to pray on it and look for signs of divine guidance in your own life.


Hebrews 13:20-21 states, ""Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory for ever and ever.""
Seeking God's will does not mean trying to look good. It does mean sincerely working toward spiritual maturity and union with God. Anything that brings you closer to God will ultimately produce consequences that please God.

, God does not issue commands and set down laws for the sake of restricting humanity. The laws given by God are done for mankind's sake, and following those laws will ultimately make you a better person and protect you from spiritual harm.


Since God loves humanity, He also takes pleasure in things that are good for humanity. As such, following God's law and improving your character as a spiritual being is a pleasing thing for God to watch.
Understand that God never commands the impossible. Following God's commands may mean that you will need to ignore your own desires and fears, but ultimately, God will give you the ability to do so.

, Sacrifices that are made for the sake of looking good are shallow and devoid of any real meaning. Likewise, those that actually reflect disobedient hearts also unwanted. Sacrifices made in love can please God, however.


As Hebrews 13:15-16 explains, ""Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise—the fruit of lips that openly profess his name. And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.""
From this passage, you can conclude that the sacrifices involved in giving genuine praise to God and those made in order to share good with others are pleasing sacrifices.

, Every human being is tainted by sin and falls short of perfection, so trying to be perfect will only lead to disappointment and frustration. If you focus on living an excellent life for God instead of worrying about each of your imperfections, though, you'll be able to live a happier and more meaningful life.


Doing excellent works in God's name is pleasing to God, of course, but the spiritual enrichment you'll experience in your own life as a result is also a source of pleasure.

, Devote the day to both God and the practice of resting. Like any of God's commands, honoring the Sabbath is for your benefit as much as it is for God's pleasure.


Spend time in God's company. Take the opportunity to meditate on His promises and presence, and step away from the demands of a busy world long enough to reconnect to your faith.
Commit to doing only activities that are relaxing and enjoyable. Too much work is stressful and unhealthy. God wants what is best for you, which means that you'll need to find time to rest.

, Aside from offering hope and salvation to humanity, Jesus also gave the human race a perfect example of the sort of life one should lead in order to please God. If you want to know what a life that pleases God looks like, you don't need to look any further than the example Jesus gives.


Study the teachings of Jesus and use them to guide your own actions.
Even though you will fall short of the perfection evident in Christ's actions and words, merely seeking to follow His example is pleasing to God.

, It's true that God wants you to support and give to others, but you need to cultivate an attitude of love and true charity if those gifts will have any pleasing, spiritual significance.


The next time you give a donation or tithe, meditate on the specific needs your gift will help fulfill. When you feel as though you are part of a solution, you may find it easier to give out of love and joy.

, Even when you don't feel love for those around you, you should act in love towards them. You need to love people who are both easy and difficult to handle.


Acting in love can be as simple as respecting someone you don't get along with or as complex as meeting a need someone has regardless of whether you like that person or not.

, God takes pleasure in a generous heart, but that doesn't mean you should accept every responsibility presented to you.


Consider the potential responsibility carefully. Ask yourself if it could cause stress, failure, or guilt. Most importantly, ask if accepting it will lead you closer to or further away from God.
Even if you want to do good by accepting the responsibility, the wrong responsibility accepted during the wrong season of your life can ultimately produce negative consequences, including a weakened relationship with God.

, Don't live in constant regret of the past or fear of the future. Treat each day as the gift from God that it truly is.


Each day is another opportunity to grow in faith and understanding. You'll please God simply in seeking Him day by day.

Most Christians do not read the Bible every day, so if all you do is go to Church, you will be a weak Christian. A few Christian growing passages are Proverbs 8:17-21. Psalms 1:1-3. John 14:21-27. James 1:2-8. I Thessalonians 5:16-18. II Timothy 1:6-7, Hebrews 8:6,10. Ephesians 6:10-18. Proverbs 4:20-23.;
, Realize that conversion is not simply one act but the beginning of a life-long commitment. Persistence and perseverance are continuing attitudes for engaging life with. Don't be hard on yourself if and when you fail, but admit it; pick yourself up; trust in God and move forward.

, James 1:22 - Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says."" Matthew 4:4 - Jesus answered, ""It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"" The bible also says that ""All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;"" - 2 Timothy 3:16.

, Ezekiel 36:26-27 - ""I will give you a new heart and put a new Spirit in you ; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws."" Ephesians 4:24 says ""and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness"". A true Christian, when converted, will immediately notice an unavoidable change in sensitivity to his daily routine. They will begin to question their taste in movies, music, clothing, even choice in friends! The Bible says ""Therefore, rid yourselves of everything impure and every expression of wickedness, and with a gentle spirit welcome the word planted in you that can save your souls.""(James 1:21)

, Do not allow others' attacks to weaken your faith. Have courage in your convictions and do well but don't judge others. 2 Timothy 3:12 - ""In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,""

, Make intercession for people who do not pray enough for their own development, i.e.: children, cousins, friends, enemies and family, etc. In Ephesians 1:16 Paul prays for a ""Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation"" I recommend that you say the prayer in Ephesians 1:16-23 for yourself everyday for one year and God will open up your spirit and develop your understanding.

, Of course, an answered prayer for peace for your enemies and that they would become blessed as children of God would help both you and them.

, Work on trying to forgive those who may have hurt you. You must learn to love your enemies. God loves everyone, and we need to, also. Say farewell to selective loving. If you have a hard time loving your enemies, pray to God to provide understanding through his Holy Spirit.

, Care for people who are in need If they are sick or in pain pray for them and when they ask for help. James 2:16 ""If one of you says to them, ""Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,"" but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?"" This is one of the things Jesus talked about in His teachings. Giving does not always having to be financial, it can be in the form of perishables or clothing.

, Even simple acts of kindness like holding a door open for someone are good deeds that can help you feel less paranoid--because then you feel that others should think well of you and of your testimony in Christ.

, 1Thesolonians 4:11 - ""and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you,"" Pride can imply that you are judging others falsely and is said to be the mother of all sins, because pride resides in each one of us. The source of all sin is ones' own selfishness (greed, lust, hate for others, murder, theft, etc.).

, Remember, living the Christian life through your actions will show others that God must be working in your life. Always stick up for your beliefs such as being conservative in good morals and liberal in giving your own goods--not being a Robin Hood or ""welfare-monger"" (profiting off poverty) or welfare-cheat, but planting seeds in others towards Christ by grace through faith, which always results in good deeds (which are a RESULT of salvation and NEVER a means to salvation).

, It is a wonderful thing that God wants Christians to unite in church and Bible study evenings--so do not think of others as hypocrites or hold yourself out as an example. Give the credit for any good that you may do to God and to God's blessing. You will find it a blessing to talk with Bible study members about the Christian life: but not sensationalism like argumentative opinions... This may be called being accountable--being open to share your views or any misgivings and weaknesses.

, How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.
, Volunteering is a great place to start for a Christian who is sure or unsure of what God wants them to do. For example, you could take a shift at a soup kitchen near you, or visit people staying in a nursing home.

Be humble, and admit that you have a problem.,
Pray.,
Confess your sin to others.,
Get in a support group, preferably at your church.,
Be honest, and take a moral inventory of your life.,
Work on your relationship with your partner.,
Work on your relationship with God.,
Be careful when you tell your partner about your addiction.",How to Overcome a Pornography Addiction As a Christian," You will not overcome anything until you first admit that it is really a problem, and realize that you do, in fact, want to be different and over it.


The first step in AA or any recovery program is to admit that you are powerless over whatever your problem is. You have to come to see that in your own strength, you can't do anything to solve your problem or overcome your addiction. It is not until you are able to admit this that you will be willing to get help from God and others.
You have to be humble, and see that you can't overcome your sin alone. The Bible says, ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me,"" but you have to ask Christ for that strength. If you think you can go it alone, God won't help you, because he does not force his help on us. Jesus said, ""You have not because you ask not."" You have to ask for God's help to get it.;
, The most important step to overcome any sin is to pray. And, don't just pray casually; do spiritual warfare in prayer and break the strongholds in your mind and in your life. Confess your sins to God, being specific to get victory over them.


In Mark 11:23 Jesus says, ""Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them."" This is how you need to pray, with faith, believing that God will help you in what you are asking for his help. If you believe that God will help you overcome your addiction, He will. But, you have to believe.
Also, the mountain Jesus is referring to is our problems. It is whatever seems to be a mountain in our own lives. That is what we need to have faith that we can overcome, with God's help.
Jesus said, ""According to your faith, it will be done to you."" How much you will be able to overcome anything will depend on how much faith you have that you can overcome it, and that God will help you overcome it.

, The Bible says, ""Confess your sins to one another and pray for each other that you may be healed."" You will not be healed of your addiction until you confess it to someone.


This doesn't have to be someone you know. You can pay a counselor, preferably a Christian counselor, who is paid to keep things confidential. Also, most churches have free lay counseling that you can get. You just need to tell someone. As long as your addiction stays secret and in the dark, it will grow. When we bring sin into the light, only then can it get better.

, Most churches have a Celebrate Recovery program, which is an amazing program. Or, just look at the website of the biggest church in your city, and they will probably have the program. The times should be listed on the website.


You can't overcome any addiction alone. You need people to hold you accountable to your desired recovery. You need people that will ask you the tough questions.
Ask someone to be your accountability partner, and ask them to text you every day, or as often as you need them to, and ask you how you are doing in regards to your problem. If you have to ""report"" to someone else, in a sense, it will make you a lot less likely to do the wrong thing. And, be honest with your accountability partner. Make sure you find someone that you can be totally honest with, whoever that may be.

, Ask yourself how viewing pornography has affected every area.


Here are some questions to ask yourself and possibly journal about: How has looking at pornography affect my relationship with God? How has it affect my relationship with my spouse (or partner)? How has it affected my relationship with my friends? How has it affected my job?

, Think about why you are looking at porn? Does it have something to do with your relationship with your significant other? If so, openly talk with him/her about things you might like to change in your relationship, such as being intimate more often, but do this with gentleness and respect. Don't demand certain things. Express your feelings about things that you might wish were different.


Forgive your partner for anything in the past, and make plans that both of you will strive for a better relationship in the future.
Watch marriage videos online; go to marriage seminars, etc. Get an older Christian couple to mentor you two, and tell you their stories in general terms, and how they learned things the hard way.. Don't give graphic or sensuous details about your addiction. Go to marriage counseling. Talk to your pastor, etc.

, If you are sinning a lot as a Christian, obviously you need to work on your relationship with God. Ask yourself how you view God and to what degree you want to follow Him. Do you really believe what the Bible says, that there will be consequences for sin? Do you really love God? How much do you love God?


Jesus said, ""If you love me, you will keep my commandments."" One of those commandments was to never look lustfully at another person, unless it is your spouse. Do you want to honor God with your life? These are all things you need to honestly ask yourself. See where you stand with God.
Paul said, ""If any man thinks he stand, take heed, lest he fall."" That means that you may think you are standing firm in the faith, but you need to not get too arrogant. It's possible that you think you are saved, when you are really not.
Jesus said ""Many will say to me in that day 'Lord, Lord, did we not....' I will say 'depart from me. I never knew you.' "" He said ""many"" will say that. Not just some, but many. So ""test yourself and see"" whether you are really in the faith or not.

, Depending on personality, one might file for divorce or break up with you as soon as you tell them. According to the Bible, any kind of marital unfaithfulness is grounds for divorce; this includes looking at pornography.


You might want to wait until you have been ""clean"" for many months or a year, for example, to tell them. He or she may need to see that you really are better first, if they are going to stick around. Marriages can be restored and healed after such things, but it is very, very hard. Once trust is broken, it is extremely hard to get it back.

It also needs to be sturdy enough to hold them up, especially if you are planning on using dimensional ornaments as opposed to paper print-outs.
, It can be a full-sized tree or a miniature tree. It can be real or it can be fake. If it's a full-sized tree, you can add the rest of your ornaments, garlands, and decorations to it on Christmas Eve. This will keep it from looking too bare, and it will help make it look more Christmas tree-like.Consider adding some Christmas lights to your tree. Use white for something simple, or purple for Advent. You can also add multicolor lights on Christmas Eve instead., Find a 2 to 3-foot (60.96 to 91.44-centimeter) tall bare branch with lots of twigs and no leaves. Fill a pot or bucket with sand, pebbles, or soil, then stick the base of the branch into it. If you want to, you can cover the top of the pot or bucket with green fabric to hide the filling.Consider painting the branch with white spray paint, then sprinkling silver or iridescent glitter onto it., Get a 2 to 3-foot (60.96 to 91.44-centimeter) tall branch. Tie fishing line to the top and bottom ends of the branch, then use it to hang the branch from hooks on your ceiling. The branch will hang horizontally 1 to 2 feet (30.48 to 60.96 centimeters) down from your ceiling, like a mobile.You can use a bare branch or a pine branch.

, Cut a tree shape with lots of branches and no leaves out of brown felt. Glue it onto a large sheet of green felt that is 24 inches (60.96 centimeters) wide and 36 inches (91.44 centimeters) tall. Let the glue dry, then pin the banner to your wall, or hang it from a cord with clothespins. Make matching ornaments out of felt, then secure them to the tree with Velcro., Draw tree on poster paper or cut one out of green poster paper. Pin or tape the tree to your wall. Draw the symbols onto paper, then cut them out. Attach them to the tree with double-sided tape.If you are drawing a tree, be sure to paint it green!
If you can't draw, find suitable symbols on the computer, then print them out.
Can't find green poster paper? Paint regular poster paper (or even cardboard) green. Let it dry, then cut the tree out.

, You will need 24 Scripture passages, one for each day of Advent. The passages should tell the story leading up to Jesus' birth, starting from the beginning, with Adam and Eve.Once you have selected your passages, read through them and try to find symbols to represent them. For example, you can use the Earth or an apple to represent Adam and Eve. Most stories will have several symbols to choose from.If you are having troubles finding Scripture passages, search online for recommended ones.
If you are having troubles finding a symbol, you can find ideas online.
Read through your list of Scripture passages, and pick out a meaningful or important object from it.

, You can find suitable images online and print them out, or you can draw the images yourself. Be sure to use sturdy paper, such as cardstock or poster paper, however. Cut the images out, then punch a hole through the top. Thread some colorful string or fishing line through the hole, then tie it into a loop.Laminate the ornaments to make them last longer.
If you are making this for a paper tree, place double-sided tape on the back of the ornament.

, Trace the basic shape of your symbol onto colored construction paper, then cut it out. Cut smaller shapes out of other colors and glue them on top for the detail For example, if you could cut a circle out of blue paper for the Earth, then glue continents cut from green paper on top.Punch a hole through the top of each ornament, then thread string through it so that you can hang it.
If this is for a paper tree, stick double-sided tape on the back of each ornament.

, If you made your tree out of felt, you can make matching ornaments out of felt or fabric. Begin by cutting circles out of felt. Cut the basic shapes out of felt or fabric, then glue them onto the felt. Add details using smaller pieces of felt, embroidery, glitter glue, or puff paint. Stick some Velcro (the hook side) onto the back of the ornament. You don't need to put any Velcro on the tree because the Velcro that's already on the ornament will stick to it.

If you are making these for a regular tree, use a yarn needle to thread some thin ribbon through the top of the ornament. Tie the ribbon into a loop, then hang the ornament.

, Try to use a lightweight, air-dry clay, such as foam clay or paper clay. Sculpt the ornaments, then let them dry. Once they are dry, you can paint them with acrylic paints. The ornaments can be flat or three-dimensional. Try to make them no bigger than your thumb, or they will be too heavy for your tree.Use a skewer to poke a hole in the top of each flat ornament. Once the clay and paint dry, thread some string through it.
Push a small hook into the top of a 3D ornament while the clay is still wet. Use a loop of string to hand the ornament. You may need to glue the hook back in if it falls out.

, For some ornaments, it would make more sense to use a pre-made item. This includes symbols such as a pair of rings, a bunch of grapes, a piece of wheat, and so forth.Plastic animals, such as doves, sheep, or lions can also be used. This is also a good option for those who don't have a lot of time on their hands to make 24 ornaments.

You will need to add a hook or looped thread to the existing items so that you can hang them on your tree.

, Take a look at the items around your home. Do any of them look like one of the symbols that you want to use? For example, a Styrofoam ball can serve as a nice base for a globe to represent God the Father and Creation. Simply paint the ball blue, then add green continents on it.Another option would be to take a blue ornament, then paint green continents onto it.Remember to add hooks or looped pieces of thread to the items so that you can hang them.

, This is a little more involved, but a great option for those who are creative or artistic. Use items around your house to make the ornaments, such as cotton balls, pipe cleaners, sticks, fabric, and so forth. For example:

Use pipe cleaners and cotton balls to make a rainbow for Noah's ark.Cut a piece of colorful fabric into a coat shape for Joseph and his coat of many colors.
Sheep can be made from cotton balls, black pompoms, and tiny googly eyes.Remember to leave holes in the items so that you can slip string or hooks through them.

, Place your tree someplace where it will be noticeable. If it is a small tree, you could put it on the mantle or table; if it's a larger one, you can put it in the corner of the room. If you made a paper or felt tree, you could hang it up on the wall behind the table or above the mantle. If it's a hanging branch, consider hanging it right above your table., The stories generally start at the beginning, with the story of Creation, and end with the birth of Christ. Advent begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas, but many people prefer to make things easier by starting on December 1st., If the ornament is too heavy for the tree, you can lay it at the base instead, right against the trunk. You can also hang the ornament up first, before reading the Scripture., This is a great option for families with young children.Ask the children questions about the Scripture that was read. They can be as simple as asking them what happened or what someone's name was. They can be more complex and ask about symbolism and deeper meanings."

Sure, everyone has tough days, and it's okay to admit it when you're struggling, but keep your overall attitude positive by reminding yourself that your job is a gift from God.;
, The highest value of the Christian faith is love. That doesn't mean you go around hugging people, it means you treat them with respect, value their opinions, treat them like you'd want to be treated. In his book The Little Red Book of Wisdom, Mark DeMoss offers this advice: ""In going about the work God gives us, we must treat every person well, regardless of station or potential benefit to us. Let us stay keenly aware of the endless ripple of just being ourselves."" (p. 75)

, And ultimately, everyone answers to God about the choices they make in this life.

, One of the most fundamental beliefs of the Christian faith is that each ordinary believer represents the faith as much as a pastor does. That doesn't mean you have to preach, but do your job with integrity. That means being honest, even if it costs you something. DeMoss writes: ""Even when it comes at a high cost, honesty is always a bargain."" (p. 61)

, Serving others without bragging about it is a sign a great strength. DeMoss writes: ""Great leaders are first of all great servants--and great service is modest, understated, in speech and action. Understatement is self-restraint, and self-restrain is hardly a sign of weakness. On the contrary, wisely used, few things carry more power."" (p. 29)

, It's not easy to live with integrity and to do your job with a good attitude. But God gives wisdom to those who ask, and will help you to live your faith, if you pray and ask him!

, Jesus gave himself to die on the cross to take the punishment for mankind so that you can be forgiven of every wrong thing you ever have or will do. You must ask God to forgive you in Jesus name. Just say, ""Jesus, forgive me for my sins and help me to make better decisions next time."" and ask God for the Holy Spirit as Jesus said to do in Luke 11:13., Here is a great scripture:""That if you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart (core-being) that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.""(Romans 10: 9-10)

Pray together.,
Point him or her to reading the Word of God, the Bible.,

Consider making a notebook for tracking progress.,
Be careful with the sensitive subjects and social issues.,
Help him or her learn how to deal with doubt and discouragement.,

If they haven't done this already, encourage them to get baptized.,
When they've got the hang of everything, you may step down as a teacher.,
When it comes to lifestyle, lead by example all the way through.",How to Help New Christians," Leading in a prayer is a great place to start because it's easy, requires no materials and can be done anytime, anywhere for any reason. Address in prayer any problems that either of you are going through. Ask for His guidance as the new believer begins the journey, and encourage your friend to add something to the prayer, if desired.


As far as the conception that prayer isn't allowed in public school, that's nonsense. It was only ruled that prayer couldn't be led by a school official or be mandatory, but if you want to pray alone or with others on your own time, you have the right to do so. Some schools have a club for Bible study, similar to any other school club.
Suggest making a habit of praying at a regular time each day -- not just when help is needed. Point out that it's okay to pray at awakening, after dinner or before bed depending on what fits ones schedule.;
, This is to get into a habit of doing daily, but it's a little harder than prayer because the Bible seems as mysterious as it is amazing. If your friend doesn't already have a Bible, advise picking one with helpful features at a place with a wide selection like the Family Christian Store.


Even though it's first, don't recommend starting off by reading Genesis because it's a rather long book and contains more history than teachings. It's still important, all of the Bible is, but there are other parts that are easier to start with. Since they're shorter and contain the words of Christ himself, recommend starting with the four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John). Acts, Romans, 1st -- 3rd John, and Proverbs would be good places to branch out from there.
Alternatively, you could focus on parts that center around a particular subject or use one of many Bible reading plans online. Bible-reading.com has a very good 52 week plan that alternates between different books to keep things interesting; it is highly recommended.
Offer a few of your favorite verses to help out, see 'Tips' for a few suggestions, and consider getting a good devotional book like TouchPoints. These are great because you can find verses for almost any concern you have.

, They should become familiar with the Ten Commandments, the story of creation, the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and salvation through accepting Jesus, for starters.

, Depending on the size of your church, you may have a wide or limited selection of activities, but there's bound to be something one can do. Volunteering to be of service to those in need and donations are also great because in the Gospels, Jesus emphasizes the importance of helping others and giving up things you don't need. Since showing love is made so clear as a command by Christ himself, being charitable should be a high priority for Christians. He said:
""This command I give to you: 'Love one another'."" and ""You have heard love your neighbor, but I tell you, 'Love your enemy'!"" We try, but we can not love perfectly; so, one must depend on God's grace and mercy, as always.

, Obviously, it will be the other person's job to fill this out, but seeing how far one has come can be very encouraging. Give praise for making improvements, being supportive -- and don't give up because God doesn't give up on anyone.

, These include gay marriage, evolution and other things where Christians often clash with non-believers as well as each other. The older the new believer is, the more likely one already has a definite opinion on these subjects, and you may or may not like it. You can say what you think and offer verses that reinforce your opinion, but make sure you're disagreeing with the idea and activity, not against the person. Whatever you do; don't make insults or act like you're better because of your position, as it's not your place to judge; that's God's job. If your ideas really clash -- or you feel an argument may ensue -- it may be best to avoid talking about these areas entirely, for the sake of peace.

, These are two of the biggest challenges for new believers, especially if one has non-religious family, a skeptical mind or both. There's a world of difference between being open to hearing other experiences or ideas -- and compromising your own beliefs. The more he or she experiences God working in lives, the stronger new faith will grow, but seeing events this way isn't in your control. You can provide encouragement and reinforce God's truth, but it's ultimately up to each one to not let differing views faze us.

, Jesus didn't send the Apostles to spread the Gospel until a few years after he began leading them in his ministry. Paul goes in depth on sending others and going out personally, in the books he wrote in the New Testament. Evangelism is one of the most rewarding aspects of Christianity, but takes time to mature into mastering this -- and is often considered a quite challenging part of helping new Christians.


Understand there are many forms of evangelism. One is lifestyle evangelism, showing your love of God through your actions and way of living, which is often very effective because it goes beyond struggling with words, in helping one grow toward more mature living, in faith. However, many Christians do this very directly in conjunction with open-air, door-to-door visitation -- or less directly by online evangelism, which are all sharing the word of God with others.
With more direct methods, offer to accompany another to provide support and encouragement because many of us find this hard at first. Praise their work when they do a good job -- and don't let it get them down, if people evangelized about faith resent the personal attention.
If you're witnessing to other people you know, it pays to keep in mind how interested they may be in what you have to say. Many non-believers have no problem with people being Christian, but find personal evangelism annoying and may say you are ""confronting"" them.
Above all, show respect -- not acting self-righteous, not saying veiled insults, making others feel that you see them personally as unacceptable or inferior for not belonging to your religion. This kind of behavior is a huge turnoff for many people and so non-believers begin to have problems listening to or receiving the plan of God.

, The Book of Matthew clearly states that Jesus was baptized through immersion in water and this is how many officially declare Him as their Lord and Savior. It may be a good idea to have this discussion with your pastor, who's very familiar with the process and has done baptisms before. They may ask questions as to whether the new believer is ready, so be prepared to answer questions and if need want to talk one-on-one at any given point, let them be. Offer to help make their baptism special, prepare for the ceremony and maybe give them a gift to commemorate the occasion.

, This doesn't mean you can't be a confidant, offer advice or be their friend, but the whole point of this is to help them get to a certain point. When that day finally arrives, you may go to bed with an immense feeling of satisfaction.

, Anybody can say that they're a Christian, but many don't demonstrate the character of one and even use it as an excuse to bully people. Such bad behavior is why many good Christians fear being labeled 'hateful', 'bigots' or 'close minded', even if that's not the reality at all.


Faith, hope and love are the big ones, but love is the most important of them all. Read 1 Corinthians to learn more about what Christian love is while keeping in mind that God is love.
Demonstrate other good character traits like respect, courage, kindness and inner strength. Try to model the behavior of Christ as depicted in the Gospels and the book of Proverbs is a very good resource of wisdom and character.

Know that any fights are generally caused by Satan trying to dis-unify you. Satan knows, that if the two of your are united, almost nothing can stop you. There will be almost nothing then that you two can't do for God's kingdom.
The Bible says, ""If two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them"" (Matthew 18:19) So Satan tries to get spouses to disagree, in order to take our power in Christian unity away.
Also, always remember the verse, ""For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms."" (Ephesians 6:12). In other words, the fight is not against people, but against those in power: Kings, unjust rulers, and Satan. Keep in mind that most of the time, if your spouse hurts your feelings, he or she did not mean to do that.;
,


If you do find yourself getting mad at your spouse and you are in the same room, go to another room until you cool down. If you are in a car, pull over, and take a walk, etc.
Sometimes you need to make yourself take a time out until you can think clearly and rationally.

, Nothing will help your marriage more than praying together. However, do not use it as a time to indirectly tell your spouse things that need to change. Pray humbly, in a united way.

, Calm discussion of your faith is good, argument is not. If you find that you cannot discuss these issues peacefully, leave the debates for your friends. It will dis-unify you and your spouse and cause issues.

,


Often times people go into marriage with way too high of expectations. Women might expect to swept off their feet like in Disney movies, and men might expect or hope their wives to look like Barbies all the time. Realize that reality is different than our dreams.
Don't put burdens on your spouse to do certain things or look a certain way. Learn to be content the way it is, and don't try to force a change or apply pressure.

, Ultimately the only person you can change is yourself. If you want your spouse to change on something, lead by example, and do it yourself, rather than picking on him or her for not doing a certain thing.


However, one can't know what you want to change unless you tell it. Tell your wish once per year, but don't make a big production out of it. More than that becomes nagging; less than that and you will grow upset about not changing something your spouse doesn't know about any need to change.

, Get dressed up just like before you were married on these nights. It helps to keep the romance alive.


Take at least one night every other week to go out, just the two of you, no kids, so you can talk and catch up. Talk about your dreams for the future and anything else you may want to discuss. Once a week would be ideal, but sometimes that just isn't possible. Kids get sick, work schedules get in the way, etc.

, You both deserves to have a nice, long break at least once a year.


Cruises are a great, cheap way to vacation and travel. Most families don't vacation because of thinking it will be too expensive, but you can find inexpensive cruises easily.

, Money is necessary for vacations, putting the kids through college, and more things that will inevitably come up. Cut back on buying excessive amounts clothes, televisions (and other expensive technology items), etc. so that you can have money for more important things.

, There is nothing wrong with having opposite-gender friends, but if you're secretive about what you two do and talk about, and spend a lot of time alone, suspicion and jealousy may breed.

,


Everyone loves their own parents, and no one wants anyone else talking in a derogatory way about their parents.
If you want to have unity with your spouse, show respect for the people who raised your spouse always.

, People can resent, if their spouses put on a lot of weight, or worry about their health. Exercising together is a good way to stay close: you can help support each other in this way, and it will transfer to other aspects of your life. Try going for runs or walks, swimming, playing basketball or another sport, going to the gym and working out side-by-side, doing anything else you might like, or even just taking the stairs. You don't have to look perfect, but it's great to look nice.

, If your spouse finds out, s/he might divorce you over it since that can be seen as being unfaithful. According to the Bible, the only reason for divorce is marital unfaithfulness. Looking at porn online is being unfaithful to your spouse. If you want your marriage to last, don't do it. It can make your spouse feel inadequate and upset.

, Don't always be serious. The best way to build unity and friendship is to have good times together.


Watch funny movies.
Laugh together at the silly things your children do.
Get a pet that can make you both laugh, etc.
Always remember to have fun with your spouse.

When you have done wrong, accept it in your heart that you have sinned against God.,
Scripture says, ""If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.,
Now, through a simple prayer, say to the Lord you're sorry for what you have done, and ask for His forgiveness.,
If you are a Catholic, add to this prayer by receiving the Sacrament of Penance (otherwise known as going to confession).,
If you really meant what you said/thought in your prayer, take 1 John 1:9 to heart.

,
Now avoid what may have triggered you to sin, i.e.",How to Move On After You Have Sinned," Even use Scripture to reinforce that what you did was sin.;
,""-1 John 1:9 (NASB) So, confess your sin, i.e. ""say the same thing about sin as God does; acknowledge His perspective about sin.""

, For example, ""Lord, I did ________. I am sorry. Will you please forgive me?""

, Catholics believe that this sacrament cleanses sin from your soul.

Do your research on the different branches of Christianity.,
Educate yourself on the different religious denominations.,
Consider the religion of your ancestors and family.,
Choose a church that aligns with your social beliefs.,
Determine how much time and money you have to dedicate to church.,
Pray to God for clarity.",How to Choose a Church1," There are three traditional branches of the religion that include Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestant Christianity. Each of these religions hold different beliefs and have different traditions. All of the religions believe in Jesus Christ and Scripture, but have differing views on whether the Pope or the Catholic Church hold any religious authority.Protestants concentrate on Scripture and the Bible to guide their faith, rather than a centralized church.Eastern Orthodoxy teaches the writings of the Deuterocanonicals and holds the belief that the Pope holds the same authority as other bishops.Roman Catholicism believes in the doctrines of Transubstantiation and Purgatory and the belief in the Pope as a Holy authority.Transubstantiation is the belief that during communion, the Eucharist or the bread and wine, are transformed into the actual body and blood of Jesus.Purgatory is the belief that you can make penance with God after death for minor sins and an allotted amount of time.

;
, Under the traditional branches of Christianity, many sects or denominations exist as well. There are also churches that are non-denominational or that are aimed to be accept people of all denominations of Christianity. Go to a library or look online for the various Christian denominations that exist. Researching them will give you insight into their differences and may point you in the right direction for which kind of church you'd like to attend.


Inter-denominational churches do not hold a specific historical creed.Members of the Baptist Church do not baptize members as infants and fully immerse adults under water through a ceremony called believer's baptism.Quakers reject ordained clergy and sacraments and are pacifists who aim to live quiet, simple lives.Sects of Protestant Christianity include Methodist, Lutheran, Pentecostal, Baptist, Presbyterian, and Evangelical., If your family was actively religious when you were younger, it's possible that you are already affiliated with a specific sect of Christianity. While you can always change your denomination, it may be a good idea to stick to your religion if you already believe in its teachings.


It's also possible that your family may have an established relationship with a specific church or specific nuns or priests.
Being active at church earlier in life can create stronger bonds with others in your congregation.

, After doing research on the major branches and denominations of Christianity, you'll be able to make a more informed decision on which doctrines ring true to you personally. Think about your stances on important issues like same-sex marriage, reproductive rights, or acceptance of different people who may be viewed as sinful to some Christian Churches.


For instance, some Protestant churches believe in reproductive rights. These churches include the Quakers, the Lutheran Church in America, the Episcopal Church, the Moravian Church in America, the Presbyterian Church, the Unitarian Universalist, the United Church of Christ, and the United Methodist Church.There are various churches that accept people in the LGBT community, such as the Alliance of Baptists, the Covenant Network, the Independent Catholic Christian Church, and the Reformed Catholic Church.Though the Pope has said positive things about the LGBT community, same-sex marriages are still a violation of Catholic beliefs., Prior to joining a church, decide how big of a role your faith plays in your life and how much time and energy you have to devote to worship and doing acts of good. Some churches are more active and call on members to help build the community while others concentrate on Sunday worship and teaching. In addition, other churches require you to tithe or contribute 10% of your income to the church.Take these things into consideration and choose a church that can match your schedule and budget.


Don't choose an active church if you don't like doing volunteer work or community service.

, If you're still unsure of which denomination or sect of Christianity that you should practice, you should ask God. God may be able to give you clarity on which path to follow. Ultimately, you want to choose a church that will allow you to worship in a way that makes you feel fulfilled and comfortable. You should not be anxious or stressed while making the decision.


You can ask God something like, ""I want to be the best Christian I can be, but I'm unsure of which denomination to choose. Please guide me on this journey of finding how to worship your word and live a good life.""

Start with a blank slate.,
Choose a topic.,
Make it manageable.,
List ""What I know, what I don’t know"".,
Use outside sources.,
Search the Bible.,
Use Bible study tools.,
Ask questions.,
Make notes.,
Summarize your findings.",How to Do a Topical Bible Study," It’s hard to go into a study like this with absolutely zero presuppositions or preconceptions, but that’s what you need to aim for if you really want the maximum payoff for your work. Be fair. Aim to learn, not “prove” what you already feel or think you know. If you go into this biased in any way, you may very well manipulate your findings to suit your agenda, so be careful.;
, Obviously you will need to choose a topic. You may already feel led, or drawn to a certain topic. If so, go with it because it will drive you crazy if you take on another topic instead. A Bible study group may get together and pray about a topic to study. Others, such as students, may have their topic assigned. The point here is to get one, and only one topic to work with.

, Some topics are simply so massive that they are not manageable. They need to be whittled down. “Men of the Bible” is not a good topic because it is too big. “Men called Men of God in the Bible” is much better, because this pertains to just a few personalities of the Old Testament. Sometimes you will discover your topic is too big during your study. The next step will help you decide which vein of the study you want to follow.

, It is very helpful once you have refined your topic to make a short list of what you think you know, and what you don’t know – or better yet, want to know. For example: If you are studying Biblical marriage, you already have a good idea it’s between a man and a woman. You may want to know who said that, what book that’s in, or even if there were any exceptions made. If you find your topic is too large, this list will help you further refine it mid-study without missing a beat.

, You may be very unfamiliar with what the Bible teaches about your particular topic, and even the Bible itself. It’s okay to use outside resources to steer your Bible study. If you are studying “the Unpardonable Sin”, you may not know what it is or where to find it. Search engines and topical Bibles (online versions available) are very helpful for getting started. Use these resources sparingly. They are to help you find and study your topic in the Bible, not instead of the Bible.

, This is where the rubber meets the road. Here, you will read what the Bible teaches about your topic. Context is extremely important, so you want to read chunks of text surrounding your topic. If you are studying “the Fall”, you will most certainly read Genesis 3:6, but to really grasp it’s meaning you will need to know the context. You will read all of chapter 3, and then may find it necessary to back up and read chapters 2-3 all together. It's also an excellent idea to read several different translations of the Bible. Some versions are more formal (like King James Version) and some are more functional (like New Living Translation). It's a good idea to read a few and compare/contrast. (Did I forget to mention in the introduction that you are going to be doing a lot of reading?)

, These are secondary. You will only use these to supplement your topical study of the Bible in the previous step, but you may use some of them concurrently. Study Bibles are usually equipped with notes, a concordance, glossary, topical index, and more. A Bible dictionary is an amazing topical resource. Commentaries are useful; especially those that concentrate on the Bible’s historical background and place it in its proper cultural context. An online search for “Bible study tools” yields a ton of valuable websites. Be careful not to get carried away here. Remember – these are secondary, supplemental resources. Use accordingly.

, During your study, you need to ask questions and write them down. Too many people are satisfied with barely scratching the surface, but if you ask questions and dig for the answers, you will find them. You will see more often than not, that something you thought was a New Testament subject has its roots in the Old Testament, and Old Testament topics point toward some New Testament ones. It would be a shame to dig for treasure and stop just short of it. So ask questions and find the answers.

, Also during your study you’ll want to make plenty of notes. Your reason for conducting a topical Bible study will dictate your style of note taking. For a group study, anything that helps you keep track of what you've learned will suffice, but you academics know that you need to cite everything – even the Bible. The main reasons for taking notes are to reinforce what you've learned and to have a path back to where you learned it. Do this. It helps. There’s nothing worse than that feeling of learning something and not remembering where it came from.

, This could be an optional step if you are conducting a private study, but if you plan to present your findings to anyone else you need to take the time to do this. Again, your reasons for doing to topical Bible study will dictate how you present them. You may rewrite a short page of ordered notes for your small group to discuss, or plug everything into an outline, storyboard, rough draft, and final copy for an academic paper to be peer reviewed. Either way, you will likely want to convey this newfound knowledge somehow. Don’t give 100% on the front end and only 10% here. Share this new knowledge in a way worthy of the study you put into it.

Ask.",How to Distinguish Mennonites from Amish," The Amish and Mennonites both came from a common root, the Anabaptists, a Protestant religious group that first appeared in the 1500s. The Amish split off from the Mennonites in the late 1600s because they believed that the other Anabaptists were not following Anabaptist beliefs closely enough. The basic ideas of Anabaptism are:


Religion is a choice for adults to make (as opposed to the custom of infant baptism in Catholicism)
Devotion to God
Shunning secularism (ex: pop culture, non-religious media).;
, Originally there were no Mennonites or Amish; there were only Anabaptists. However, in sixteenth-century Holland, a man named Menno Simons joined the Anabaptists and became prominent among them. About a century after Simons, a Swiss Anabaptist named Jacob Ammon began to preach that the Anabaptists were not following their founding principles closely enough. Thus followers of his ideas became known as Amish and separated from the Anabaptists. The remaining Anabaptists became known as Mennonites after Menno Simons.

, The Amish dress plainly in solid colors. Men wear black pants and shirts of a number of colors, along with straw hats, while women wear dresses and aprons with bonnets. Men typically have beards, and often have a bowl haircut, while women usually wear their hair in a bun. Mennonites, however, have mainstream clothes and hairstyles, and are often indistinguishable from anyone else.

, The Amish separate themselves from modern society. They don't drive cars or have electricity in their homes. They usually don't go on to higher education; typically they hold traditional jobs, such as farming or woodworking. They hold religious meetings in their homes, don't pose for photos, and often live in small farming communities. Mennonites are typically more integrated with modern society.

, While the Amish technically avoid modern technology, they often have telephones at the edge of their properties and other modern conveniences close at hand. Some, the New Order Amish, are near-fully integrated with mainstream society. And then there are the Old Order Mennonites, who observe their religion largely as the Amish do. If all of this seems confusing to you, don't be embarrassed.

, If all else fails, just ask. Be polite and respectful, and the person in question will likely be glad to tell you.

Be trained as explained: ""No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful.,
Put to death the lusts of the flesh.,
Learn to love self-control.,
Keep the focus on yourself rather than on the behavior of others.,
Deny yourself, and keep improving as Jesus said: ""If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me."",
Keep the end goal in sight.,
Understand the necessity of self-discipline and self-control.",How to Discipline Your Flesh As a Christian," Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it."" (Hebrews 12:11).;
, The Bible uses the term ""the flesh"" to refer to the tendency to sin. Innate sin nature passed down to us from Adam and Eve is referred to as the flesh. The flesh is always at war with the Holy Spirit within us. The flesh wants to do what is bad, and the Holy Spirit in your spirit wants to do what is good.


Live out your higher calling: ""If you live according to the flesh, you will die; but, if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live."" (Romans 8:13). Also Colossians 3:5 says, ""Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry."" Self discipline has to be active and continually done. This is not automatically done for us when we put our faith in Christ.
""The righteousness of Christ"" now covers us, as in that is how God now sees us, but we do not become righteous the moment we get saved. Paul says ""Not that I have already obtained all this or have already been made perfect, but I press on toward the goal..."" We receive the Holy Spirit when we put our faith in Jesus, who then guides us and helps us to put our flesh to death, but it is a partnering effort. We work at putting to death the fleshly lusts, and the Holy Spirit helps us.

, It seem like every person alive has an addiction to something. For some it's food and over eating, for others it's watching TV constantly, for others it's being workaholic, etc. The trick is to learn when you have reached your limit in any of these things. Learn to exercise self-control.


Learn to stop eating when you feel full. Learn to turn the TV off when you feel you have wasted enough hours of the day doing nothing. Learn to rest when you feel tired, and do not overwork yourself.
If we don't stop when we have hit what we know is a limit, the Holy Spirit will convict us. We can try to quench the Holy Spirit, as in ignore his promptings and convictions, but then we will only feel miserable. Paul says in 1 Cor. 6:12, ""'I have the right to do anything,' you say--but not everything is beneficial. 'I have the right to do anything'--but I will not be mastered by anything."" Don't let grace be an excuse for license, or you will become enslaved and mastered by sin once again.

, So often times, in order to distract ourselves from our own problems, we will judge and criticize others. This is merely a way of deflecting. We don't want the light shining on ourselves so we shine it on others. Or we attack them for something before they have the chance to attack us. But instead, we need to look inward at our own inner life.


The Bible says, ""Judge not lest ye be judged."" You may think that you are distracting the other person from seeing your own sin, but eventually, they will judge you and shine the light on you in return. What goes around comes around. If you are gracious with others, they will be gracious with you. But if you judge them, they will eventually judge you too.
Plus you need to focus on how you need to be a better person rather than thinking how they need to be a better person. And you can't change them anyway; the one and only person you can change is yourself.

, Learn to say no to yourself. The essence of self-control is being able to say no to yourself. You may have a craving or you may be tempted to do something, but success in the area of self-control is when you can tell yourself no. To not give into every whim or thought or temptation, that is true self-control.


In order to reach this level of self-control, you have to discipline your flesh, and deny yourself of whatever you might want. It helps to see the reality that your flesh always wants what is bad for you. ""If you live according to the flesh, you will die"" Paul said. So know that any bad habits and lusts of your flesh will eventually harm or kill you, or will at least lead to a shorter life.
Over eating will most likely lead to diabetes, heart trouble, and many other health problems. Watching too much TV may lead to a lack of intelligent interests and can cause relationship avoidance, issues of avoiding real life. Working too much will lead you to be over-stressed and may even cause you a nervous breakdown. Realize that your flesh is set against you, because Satan is in control of your flesh, but know that following God and the Holy Spirit will bring you ""life and peace.""

, Jesus said in John 12:24, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but, if it dies, it bears much fruit."" A person might diet and die to himself/herself in order to get a better body, but what about your soul? What about the fruitfulness of our hearts?


Jesus said unless you, being the grain of wheat, die, as in die to yourself, then you will produce no fruit. Your life won't have any meaning. You won't be helping anyone. But, if you can learn to die to yourself, to discipline your flesh, then maybe you can help Jesus change the world. Then maybe your life will have meaning, purpose and significance. To live for yourself alone will only make you miserable, but to live for, and love others, will bring more joy to your life than you can even imagine.

, Jesus said in Mt. 10:38, ""Whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me."" To call yourself a Christian means that you are willing to die to yourself. It means that it is no longer all about you; it is now all about Jesus.


Jesus said that unless you are willing to die to yourself, you are not worthy of him. Paul repeatedly says that we are to ""walk in a manner worthy of our calling."" Our worthiness does not save us. The Bible says that ""While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."" But, if we are truly saved, we will live in a worthy manner. Our lives will show evidence that we really are born again. We will be an entirely new creation; the old will be gone, and the new will have come.
Christians still fall into sin from time to time, but sin should not be allowed to be habitual or as your lifestyle. Sin should not be able to dominate you and control you as it once did, because Jesus has set you free. Jesus said that many will say to him on that day that they are real Christians, but he will tell them ""I never knew you."" Thinking we are saved is not enough, we have to act like it, and follow Jesus. Love one another. ""Show me your faith without (good) deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do."" Amen.

Visit a variety of churches.,
Decide if you want to go to a traditional or nontraditional church.,
Consider the church's music.,
Make your decision.",How to Choose a Church2," Determine the church's denomination and make sure that it matches with your religion. Check on the church's website or inquire with a staff member or pastor about any possible affiliations with outside organizations.Find a church that supports the same causes that you are passionate about.


For example, your church may be affiliated with youth organizations like Boy Scouts of America.If the church is affiliated with an organization that you oppose, consider choosing another church.
Churches that are affiliated with nonprofits that concentrate on doing acts of good may be a good choice.

, Some churches are small with only a few dozen members while others are large and have thousands of followers. Decide what kind of environment you want to worship in. While larger churches will have the capital for new infrastructure and amenities, smaller churches can provide a more personalized experience. Decide on which environment you like better and try to find a church that reflects that.


You may become closer to your pastor, priest, or minister at a smaller church because they will have time to speak with you individually., The doctrinal statement is the closely held beliefs of the church you're looking to join. Before making the decision, go to their website or give them a visit to see their doctrinal statement.Make sure that it matches with your closely held beliefs, so there are no conflicts once you join.


The doctrinal statement usually includes views on Scripture, God, the son, Mary, figures of authority, and the church., Amenities include things that you may need such as sufficient parking, wheelchair ramps, handicapped-accessible restrooms, or a sign-language interpreter. You must make sure that you have the ability to worship even if you or a loved one has a physical disability so choose a church that has access for you and your family members.

, Keeping a physical checklist will allow you to evaluate all the churches around you fairly. As you go around and visit different churches and watch different sermons, take note of things that you like and dislike so that you can make an informed decision. While you're unlikely to find a church that meets all your criteria perfectly, you can choose one that matches your needs the closest.


Things on your checklist could include: traditional worship, a powerful sermon, confession, singing the traditional hymns, or casual and open worship.
The things on your checklist will differ depending on your personality.

, A good way to get an understanding of the way that a specific church will worship is by visiting during a service. There, you'll be able to examine things like the church's traditions, the ministry, the sermon, and the congregation so you can get a better idea of whether the church is right for you. Get a list of churches in your area and visit each of them during service.


Pay attention to the preaching style during the sermon, as this is a usually big deciding factor for many people when choosing one.Take notice of the service and whether you feel engaged and inspired.

, Some churches are nontraditional, and the pastor or preacher will dress down, use technology, or use non-traditional instruments like the guitar during praise choruses.Other churches will stick to the denomination's traditions like a confession, communion, and instruction. Decide if you want a traditional church that will require you to dress up or a more casual church experience.


Some churches require you to wear a suit and tie or a dress during service, while others are more relaxed and allow you to wear casual clothes., Music remains an important aspect of the church. While the Catholic and Orthodox churches have more traditional worship styles and sing the traditional hymns, other churches prefer to take on a more contemporary music style, even incorporating styles like reggae and hip-hop.Many Baptist churches sing gospel music, which combines the sounds of jazz and blues with Christian hymns.Other examples of music include Christian rock, European cantatas, and African choruses., Take a look at your checklist and compare each of the churches that you were able to visit. Try to remember things that you liked and disliked about each service, and consider all of the things that you've researched. Think about the church's worship style, what is expected of you, and the type of clothing that you'll have to wear.


Ask the ministry questions that you can't answer by looking at their website.

"
Communicate with your ministry.,
Volunteer and become involved in good works.,
Become friends with others in your congregation.,
Visit the church and attend mass.",How to Choose a Church3," Talking to your priest, minister, pastor, or nuns will help bring you closer to the teachings of God. It will also give you the ability to ask questions that you may have or get spiritual advice. Find a church where you can talk openly about your experiences and how to avoid sinning.As technology advances so does the ability to speak to your pastor or minister. Many have an e-mail address and can be reached via phone.

, Volunteering at a church can fulfill you spiritually and will bring you closer to your church. You can help feed the poor, work on a community project, or become a missionary. If you choose to give more of your time, you may be sent abroad to help poorer countries., Get to know other families and people within your church and become friends with them. See if they want to share a meal or join you in volunteering. The more you get to know other people from your church the more involved and engaged you'll be. You can also share spiritual dilemmas or questions with friends in the church who hold the same moral values.


In Mark 12:31 it says, ""The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself. There is no commandment greater than these.”, The only way to truly know if you feel like you belong to an individual church is to go their mass. Just because you visit does not mean that you have a responsibility to that church. The most important thing is that you feel a sense of belonging and feel as if the church can lift your faith and help fulfill you. If you don't feel that way because of the church, the ministry, or congregation, then you should try going to Mass at a different church.

, Repent. Say this prayer from your heart (your core), savor the words:
""Dear Father, God in Heaven, I come to you in the name of Jesus my redeemer. I turn to You knowing that I am a sinner, and I am sorry for my sins and the life I have lived; I need your forgiveness. I believe and trust that your only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, shed His precious blood on the cross at Calvary and died for my sins, and I am now willing to turn away from my sin. You said in Your Holy Word, Romans 10:9, that 'if you do confess the Lord our God and believe in your heart (depths of your being) that God raised Jesus from the dead, you shall be saved'. So, right now I confess Jesus as the Lord of my soul. With my whole-heart, I believe that God raised Jesus from the dead. From this moment forward, I accept Jesus Christ as my own personal Savior and according to His Word: right now 'I am saved'. Thank you, Jesus, for your unlimited grace which has saved me from my sins. I thank you Jesus, that your true grace never leads to license/permissiveness, continuing sin, but rather it always leads to following Christ in new life. I must lay aside every weight and run the race. Therefore, Lord Jesus, transform my life so that I may bring glory and honor to you alone and not to myself. Thank you, Jesus for dying in my place and giving me eternal life and fellowship. Amen.""

, This preparation would include going to meetings and fellowship with like believers. Choose to associate with people who will support, but not hinder your walk.

, Pray and praise Jesus every time you feel the pull to drink, and your pain will come to an end, as you lay your life at Jesus feet as your gift/sacrifice.

,,, The Bible is the only book in all history and all world religions to teach salvation as the free gift of God for believers. This a true and powerful fact. Every other world religion teaches you must try to earn or work for it. God teaches us in His word ""salvation is the free gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast."" And then:


""You are saved unto good works which God has already appointed that you should walk in them.""

, Pray everyday! Pray when you go out and when you come in. Be brutally honest with God and tell him everything, unload your burden of sin of Christ. Your heavenly Father wants to take your burdens, for he cares and loves you. Pray always. When you pray you must understand that God is Father, and He understands that His children make mistakes, but He expects you to learn from them and turn/repent from them.

, Be persistent, never allowing doubt or fear to rule over you.

, Do things which aren't against any just law. Follow the Law of Love.

, You must find a good KJV Bible believing church, and get involved. God commands us to go to church because we have a need of the fellowship with other believers who can keep you accountable, pray and support you in your new walk and life in Christ.

, Where 2 or 3 are meeting, agreeing on anything, there I am in your midst. said Jesus, through the Holy Spirit. Many find attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) helpful. Don't talk about the wanderlust, carousing and the partying; that may cause someone to get an idea to go on a binge. Instead you might talk about how you are overcoming by following the plan and the help of the higher power/the Holy Spirit, Spirit of Christ. A supportive caring minister or dedicated counselor can/might be helpful. This can be as simple as keeping on going back, allowing/making yourself to be there for you, and to also to help others by agreement and the group dynamics. If you are constantly ""finding yourself up against a wall""; stand tall. Put forth the effort, but don't expect perfection.

, Persistence is more important than perfection. Realize you can decide and live a discipline of having only one potato chip, one cookie, one burger, one is a meal... not perfection. But, can you have one drink -- often not. Many say, ""not one!""

Take a deep breath when you are angry: Though that may sound cliché, you can literally take a deep breath, which will help to calm down.,
Take a step back from the situation.,
Pray about it.,
Realize that there is a spirit of anger that can get a hold of us.,
“Don’t let the sun go down on your anger, and don’t give the devil a foothold.” Anger can give Satan a foothold, or an advantage over a person.,
Resolve the situation calmly.,
Speak the truth in love when you are angry.,
Realize that several physical illnesses are caused simply from ones own anxiety, anger or bitterness.,
Try to not get angry about the little things in life.,
Always have grace with others and with yourself.

,
Realize that anger and stress can very negatively affect your health.,
Have boundaries with other people.,
If you are very angry at someone, express the reason to him or her.,
Remember to stay humble.,
Consider the needs of other people.,
Avoid pride of thinking that it’s ""my/our way or the highway."",
Remember that Jesus got angry; so, anger in itself is not a sin.,
Express your anger.,
Try to keep the peace with others at all times.",How to Have Anger and Be Christian,";
, If angry at a person, it generally helps to leave the room until you have calmed down. Don’t say something you will regret later: think about “I've hardly ever regretted anything that I didn’t say.""



Think about why you are angry. Are you misinterpreting the situation?

Ask for clarification after you have calmed down. See whether you misunderstood what was said to or about you.

, Ask God to help you with your anger.

, It doesn’t possess us, but it can oppress us and kind of control us at different times.


You can say boldly, “In the name of Jesus, spirit of anger I command you to leave. You are not welcome here.”
Or another good phrase to say aloud is, “By the power and blood of Jesus, 'Satan be gone!' ”
It may then feel like something that is controlling your mind and emotions left. There are demons or even bad attitudes that can control us in certain ways, if we let them.

, So always be very careful when angry. Anger can ""open a window"" to Satan in your mind and heart.

, Don’t just stuff your anger.


“Don’t let the sun go down on your anger"" means that you need to address what you are angry about.

, Jesus said, ""Love one another.' Love covers a multitude of sins (by forgiving).


Don’t just ""not speak"" the truth, even if you are afraid of how the person will react.
Tell the person who made you angry how you are feeling, but do it gently.
Even if the person doesn’t say ""I'm sorry"", forgive anyway. Why? Because God commands you to and also because holding onto bitterness won’t help you at all.

, Headaches are a well known physical result of anger and worry. Emotions affect the physical body; so if only for the sake of your own health, let go of your anger. Forgive whatever happened, and move on.

,


An example would be, someone cutting you off on the road.
You might also want to get angry at mistakes you make, like losing your phone, etc. But try not to. That will raise your blood pressure, your stress levels and cause you to not live as long.

,,


A lot of stress we bring on ourselves; we can cause much of our own stress.
Always remember, “It’s not about what happens to you that matters, but how you respond to it.”
We can control our own responses to things. If we determine in our minds that we will stay calm no matter what, then we can. Ask God for help to stay at peace, and He will help you.

,


There is a book by Cloud and Townsend titled Boundaries that may help you a lot.
Often times people get angry when they feel like a line has been crossed in some way. But, if other people never know what those lines are, how can you justify getting angry about it -- right? So you need to express to people what your lines or boundaries are.

,


Maybe you get mad easily, if someone is late, or if things are messy. Present your desires to people. Explain what areas you are more sensitive in or have more needs in. There may or may not be compliance with what you want. If not, then accept it and move on. But at least you will know that you tried to express yourself and what you wanted.
Often times anger builds up when we don’t express ourselves. We may feel stuck or trapped for some reason. Communicating about things will help bring freedom in any area. Anger or hurt may come when we feel ignored or disrespected.
Build more of a relationship through talking, showing interest and kindness; so you won’t feel ignored. Don’t expect people to read your mind or intuitively know what you need at any time; you have to tell them your ideas and needs. Listening and communicating is always very key to setting justifiable boundaries.

, Unresolved anger is not conducive to humility.


Often anger comes from one's own ego and pride, as when not getting ones own way and becoming angry. But remember, it’s not all about you, as there are six billion other people on the planet that have their own wants and needs too.
If what you want conflicts with what others want, sometimes you will have to let them have what they want.

, Everyone is not here to meet ones needs alone. Each person needs to take care of oneself, if competent.


Sometimes the angry person is on an ego trip. That is when a person shows/demands that everyone must cater to that person's desires by doing things his or her way.

, But, that may be for others or God to decide. No one but God is always right. No one can manage the universe, or be perfectly good.


Paul says in Romans 12, “Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment.” Often times anger comes when we have a high opinion of ourselves and the way we think things SHOULD be done. But no one is perfect. None of us has a perfect way of doing things.
There is a need to allow for differences in other people and different opinions on things. It is never one person is right and everyone else is wrong. Admit that sometimes you might be wrong too.
Always remember to stay humble and not think of yourself as perfect or better than you are. If you are able to see that you too make mistakes all the time, then you will have more grace for other people, and you will then become angry less often. Amen.

,


Jesus was angry many times, and yet he was without sin.
Getting angry is not the sin; how you handle your anger is what can become a sin. Gossiping about people is a passive aggressive way to act out your anger. It’s better to confront the person directly. When Jesus was angry at the Pharisees, he didn’t gossip about them with his disciples: He confronted them directly.

, Don’t explode, but don’t implode (cave-in) either.


Don’t stuff it and hold it in, because that does just as much damage to a relationship as exploding on someone. Both can limit the freedom in a relationship.
If someone shuts down or gets overly angry with you, you won’t feel as free to talk and be with him or her. Be open but gentle about your anger, by always “speaking the truth in love.”

,


Jesus said, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.” #*Likewise the apostle Paul said, “As far as it depends on you, live at peace with all men.” Paul also said, “Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life.” Those are some great verses regarding keeping the peace.
Another great verse is, “Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.” Amen.

Observe the characteristics of strong Christian, wholesome families in different societies around the world.,
Consider appropriate books: that you may find at such places as Christian bookstores and libraries on family and relationships.,
See what Dr Stinnet at The University of Nebraska found by doing exactly that and he discovered several common qualities in these marriages including:Be committed to the family social unit.,
Be able to use good communication skills within the family to not avoid or overlook the views and desires of each other.

,
Express appreciation for each family member.

,
Apply good problem solving skills in the midst of a crisis.

,
Have a commitment to a wholesome spiritual life.

,
Pray for your family daily.We must pray for our families according to the will of God.,
Understand that Christian families are definitely not perfect.",How to Have a Wholesome Christian Family," Instead of studying the dysfunctional family relationships, you may want to know: ""What are some strengths of a healthy family?"";
, Research those families that had two characteristics:


Those marriages that are considered happy and
Those that consider themselves satisfied in their parent–child relationships.

,






Spend quality time with your family.With our ever increasing busy schedules, it is easy to lose focus on spending quality time with our family and children. It is important to remember that even though our children are nearing adulthood, they still require parental involvement.







Communication breakdown has been cited as a major cause of parent teen conflict over the years. There are endless activities to share with a child. It is important to take advantage of quality time with your child. Take time to enjoy your family. They are never too young to start spending time with, in fact the younger the better the result will be.







,,,,, We all need prayer. Prayer is extremely vital for our survival. God desires the best for us and for our families. Besides praying for guidance, direction, wisdom, peace, and safety, we must constantly pray that our love ones will come to know Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior. We must pray that our love ones have a relationship with the heavenly Father. Mother Teresa once said, ""Prayer enlarges the heart until it is capable of containing God's gift of himself."" We must pray that our loved ones find and stay in the will of God!

, Every day you will fight for God, and peace in your household. Let the Lord give you strength. It will eventually work out.

Think about what you think about most.,
Consider how you spend your money.,
Realize that love is active.,
See how thankful you are for what God has done for you.,
See whether you keep God's commandments, as best you can.,
Consider how much you love your fellow man is how much you love God.,
Think about how much you respect God.,
Show your love for God by your love for your fellow man.,
Do good works to express your love of your neighbor and enemy as your love for God.",How to Devote Your Whole Heart to God (Christianity)," Are more of your thoughts about what you will eat next, or about sports or another person? It has been said that whatever consumes our thoughts is our idol. Ideally, God should consume our thoughts, or the realization that He is there, with us, all the time. The Bible says to pray without ceasing, meaning we should have an ongoing conversation with God that never ends. We should be thinking about and talking to God all the time, but if our minds are always elsewhere, we can then know how much we really love God.;
, The Bible says, ""Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."" Do you spend your money only on yourself? Then you might be your own idol. You might be your own god, in a sense. This is why the Bible talks about tithing, not because God needs our money, but because He wants our hearts. God knows that wherever our money goes, our hearts will follow.

, Put hands on and feet under your love. Think about what gets you the most excited. Love is not a feeling or some words to say repeatedly.


Where is your active passion? Do various kinds of entertainment, such as movies and sports paralyze you in a chair for hours at a time? Are your passionate actions about saving the lost and serving God? Or are you more passionate about being a spectator or even a player of football -- or going shopping -- than you are about spiritual actions?

, The more we love someone, the more thankful and appreciative we are for him or her. How much do you really appreciate God sending His son to die for you? How often do you thank God for all the little blessings in your life? One of the best ways to show love to God is by saying, ""Thank you"" as often as possible.

, Jesus said, ""If you love me you will keep my commandments."" If we are truly thankful for all God has done for us, we will see that the least we can do is live as He would want us to live. So, love your neighbor as yourself. Paul said, ""Offer your bodies as living sacrifices. This is your spiritual act of worship."" How we live our lives is how we show how much we love and respect God.

, Your love for the lost is a measure of how open your heart is to God.


Do you keep your fellow man at arms length? Do you not really trust God and so not let Him into every part of your heart? How often do you pour your heart out to God in prayer, worship, etc.? The degree to how much we do, shows how much we really love God.

, Do you ever use God's name in vain? We are meant to have the highest degree of respect and reverence for God. We need to see that He alone is the ruler of the universe, and the ruler of our personal universe. The Bible says that we are to fear God. This means that we are to have an awe of God. We are to fully realize how powerful He is and how holy He is. ""There is no one like our God."" He is unlike any other being that has ever lived.

, Why? Jesus said:


""This commandment I give unto you, that you love one another...""
""By this you shall know that you are my disciples, if you love one another...""
""You have heard love your neighbor, but I say to you love your enemy!""

, Devote your heart fully to taking God's love and the Gospel to others, and helping His family, because whom He loves is most deserving of our heart. Love is ____ (something-you-do). But, it is not like giving your body to be burned. *""...we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."" (Ephesians 2:10).

Get into God's written word.,
Get into fellowship with other Christians.,
Get into prayer.,
Practice what Jesus tells you to do.,
Understand that the predominant world view of materialism is a road that leads nowhere.",How to Be Stable in Life as a Christian," Read the Bible frequently; it's an amazing ""instruction manual"" for life. It will teach you how to develop a relationship with God/Jesus Christ; what He expects of you; and what you can expect of Him.;
, Attend church regularly; attend bible studies; attend church picnics, movie nights, and other functions. Spending time with other Christians will guide your thinking and behavior, so you'll be better able to model Christ-like behavior (especially important when you're in a secular environment).

, Prayer is conversation with God. You don't need to use special words or a special voice. When you invite Jesus into your life, and ask Him to live through you, amazing things start to happen.


When praying you might begin by thanking Him for the many blessings you have. It's also good to ask Him how you can be of service to Him and others. When you reach out to Him, He will reveal Himself and His plan for you in any number of ways. It may be that ""still, small voice,"" or a ""coincidental"" phone call or e-mail, or a shift in the circumstances of your life. People who are experienced at prayer will tell you that God tends to provide what you ""need"" rather than what you ""want.""
Be patient, and listen/observe carefully. And keep at it! Jesus tells parables about how important it is to be persistent.

, There is a scripture verse where Jesus says ""Why do you call me Lord, and not do what I say?"" He calls us to love Him, and love our neighbors. He tells us these are the two greatest commands. How do we love Him and our neighbors? By showing mercy, compassion and forgiveness.


Be a loving and considerate husband or wife. Be a good teacher and role model for your children. Focus on the rights and feelings of others, rather than your own.
Look for opportunities to be of service to your family, friends, co-workers, and community. You will stumble and sin; that's human nature; but as Jesus and His Holy Spirit takes you deeper into the process of transformation, you will do so less. The more you train with Jesus, the more ""Fruit of the Spirit"" you will produce. Empty yourself, so that you can be filled with Christ.

, You may be experiencing that firsthand. You can also read about that in the Bible - the book of ""Ecclesiastes.""


By making Jesus Christ the central character in your life (rather than yourself), you'll begin to experience a more stable existence and a life with much more meaning. Jesus promises us the ""abundant"" life.  
If you regularly complete steps 1-4, you will gradually notice some profound changes in your attitude and outlook upon life. It is the transforming power of the Holy Spirit that changes you. Life will start to make more sense. Jesus is the Good Shepherd. You will begin to know you are secure in His loving hands.

Read your Bible.,
Pray.,
Praise Him.,
Tell the world, or at least your part of it.,
Know that the Church is the Body of Christ.",How to Be a Real Jesus Freak," Reading your Bible is sometimes a way God talks to you. It doesn't matter who you are, what you do or how old you are. Reading your bible is very helpful in your walk with God, and if you believe He will speak to you through it, He will--if you give Him enough time. Don't have time? Get up earlier. Not a morning person? Stay up later. Got to get up for work or school in the morning? Read it at lunch. It's that simple. No excuses. You can also download e-Sword (see link below);
, Prayer is talking to God. The bible says to pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17). This doesn't mean heads down, eyes closed all the time. You can pray while you drive, while you're at work, while you're at baseball game, whatever, just talk to Him; He will hear you. If you're a writer, try keeping a 'prayer journal', and writing down your thoughts and problems, in a sort of letter to God. Leading a prayerful life means being a part of God, all the time. Constantly thanking Him, being with Him. God is everywhere- take notice! However way you choose to pray, tell God all your troubles and longings.

, Worship is an essential part of growing in Christ. Worship can be anything. Rocking out to your favorite song, holding hands with friends and praying, sitting around your dining room table and talking about the best part of being a part of the body of Christ. But bringing praise to Him doesn't have to just be praying and discussing Christianity--it is also living every single minute for Him. Obviously, we mess up, but He is willing to forgive if you are truly repentant. Try being more careful of your language, doing acts of kindness in His name, etc. All this brings praise to the Lord.

, Evangelism is a beautiful thing. You don't need to leaflet or memorize bible verses- just be prepared to share your beliefs and ideas with people who are interested. If you are truly living your life in a way that adores Christ, it will show through everything you do. The best sermons were lived, not spoken.

, The good news? You're already a part of it. If you are a Christian you're a part of the body of Christ. You can find fellowship anywhere. At a local church, at a local coffee shop, through concerts, family, friends - everything. The Church is absolutely everyone who believes in Christ. However, being involved and committed to a local church is critically important. Accountability can be found here, and so much of the New Testament is about staying with and loving fellow believers. If you don't have a church, talk to a few local pastors and see what they have to say about it.

Then start praying. You should start by praising God and marking him as authority. Then start thanking him, and pray for yourself, and others. Pray consistently and with patience. Whisper a prayer in the morning, afternoon and evening. Arrow prayers can be integrated in the day. If you have trouble remembering whom you need to pray for, have a notebook and write down whom you must pray for. Promise that person that you`ll pray for them and be sure to keep that promise. Pray with that person too, if they desire.;
, While this can make a nice difference in someone's day, if they aren't religious or have asked you not to include them you are disrespecting them, their wishes, and their beliefs, which is something a modern Christian girl should never do.

, No one, even people who are born again in Christ, is perfect. When we evangelize to others, we must be prepared to be open about our sins. It should be done in a modest way and for the benefit of others who are in difficult situations.

, When someone tells you something, don`t spread it around. Promise that person that you`ll keep it to yourself. However, if what that person told you is illegal or serious, such as that they suffer from an eating disorder, you need to tell an adult immediately. Pray to God for wisdom and guidance.

, Do what God tells you to do just like Moses did. God knows what is best for us and even if we don`t realize it now, we may later on. Use the bible for inspiration and pour your heart out to the Lord. Listen to him. Ask for forgiveness.

, If you know something is not right then be bold and don`t give into it. It may not be easy. It can help to trust in other believers and to trust God himself.

, In the Lord`s prayer and in the bible, it teaches us to forgive. God always forgives us when we sin so we should forgive ourselves and others. It may not be easy, but unless you are thinking of forgiving someone currently hurting you, it is the right thing to do.

, Only God has the authority to judge others. If we judge others, we will also be judged ourselves.

, You may run across people who tell you something and justify it with ""it's in the bible"" when in reality it is not. Similarly, you may run across people who twist what is in the bible for their own benefits or to hold against a certain group. Don't buy into what these people are saying!

, Don`t say one thing and do something completely opposite. This will cause others as well as yourself to doubt your faith and God. Admit your past mistakes, try to lead a godly life and walk with Christ.

, It can be anything. There is always something going on at church, so get involved! If you are worried that it might affect your studies or job, then pray about it. If there is no way to fit it into your schedule, as long as you aren't shunning Him, God will understand.

, Just remember when you dress how others will perceive you and what they will think about you simply by the way you dress. Is your clothing pleasing to God? Remember that you have a testimony to keep and although being stylish sometimes can also be modest it is not always and we Christian ladies should always be aware of how we present ourselves for the Lord.

, Babysit for someone, bake a cake for them, help someone with their groceries or shovel an elderly neighbour's walk. Try to help at least one person every day.

, Invite friends, family, and members of your church to a prayer meeting or other Christian event. If you have time, try to schedule at least one per month.

, When a person is unpleasant to you don`t make a big deal out of it. Don't sink to name calling or fist fights. Simply move on. If you are constantly being taunted by a classmate or coworker though, you should go to a teacher or your boss. They do not have the right to do this to you and getting help in making them stop is not ungraceful.

, Keep track of what you spend money on and then see if it is all really necessary. Start a budget and you will be amazed how much you can save! This money can go towards treats for yourself, others, and charities.

, Jesus calls us to be like this. We should treat others the way Jesus would and always be ready to help others.

, This is regardless of their background, nationality, sexuality, and religion. Everyone deserves to be treated equally, and as mentioned above, only God may judge.

, God blessed us with the gifts to develop our abilities. We should be use them in the right way. God has a plan for us all, he always knows what is best for us.

, It is good to have fun with other Christian brethren as long as the activities are wholesome and pleasing to the Lord. Remember to behave like a good Christian lady at all times.

, Will this person be hurt if you do this? Would you want this person to do this? Try to be a leader and a good example for others.

Don't view marriage as purgatory.,
Marriage can produce a paradise, or it can reduce a paradise to ashes by means of the fires of conflict.,
Avoid arguing.,
Respect the wife as a person.,
Be considerate.,
Be aware female needs to be appreciated.,
Acknowledge and don't take advantage of her birth abilities.,
Pray.,
Research Peter and follow his advice.",How to Be a Successful Husband According to the Apostle Peter," A girl once stood and defined purgatory as ""a state of terrible torment which those who enter are compelled to undergo for a time to fit them for heaven."" Her definition of the word was wrong, but her description of the experience of many in the state of marriage was right. Matrimony can be a purgatory rather than the paradise God intended it to be.;
, Marriage is a paradox. It can be the best or the worst state. We commit ourselves in marriage for better or for worse because both our equally possible. Conflict is just as real a potential as cooperation. There are those who tell us that even conflict can have its values, and there is truth in this perspective. What of the couple who reached the height of their argument, and the wife exploded, ""I wish I'd taken mother's advice and never married you."" The husband said, ""Do you mean to say your mother tried to stop your marrying me?"" She nodded. ""Well now,"" sighed the husband, How I've wronged that woman."" Whatever value was gained, it is doubtful that the quarrel can be counted a positive factor in marriage bliss, even if there are poets who claim it is so.

, There was a story of a wise man who quarreled with his wife during their 50th year of wedded life. He tucked this note under his wife's pillow. ""My darling bride, let's put off quarreling until after the honeymoon is over. Your devoted husband."" Here was a husband who took the high road to marital bliss by avoiding quarrels instead of the low road of squeezing some value out of conflicts.


Carlton could write, ""And if ever we meet in heaven, I shouldn't think it queer, that we loved each other the better, for the way we quarreled here. When we meet in heaven I should think it odd, if we loves each other better, for disobeying God.
What Paul wrote in Eph. 4:31-32, ""Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.""
Understand her. Peter has a high view of the perceptive powers of the male. The Gospel according to Peter is that wives can be understood, and not only by experts who study them and write books about them, but even by their husbands.

, Any wife whose husband treats her with the respect involved in what Peter says in this one verse will lavish upon him more devoted love than all the harem of Solomon.


Listen to her. God will not listen to the prayers of a man who will not listen to the pleas of his wife.

, This means that a husband is to care about what his wife needs as a person to make her life fulfilled. She is a person who has special needs and desires, and it is a husbands obligation to know what they are. To ignore another's needs is to lack respect for them as persons. Wives need to be treated as people worth understanding.

, Compliment and encourage her, and give her undivided attention. Sometimes, you can forget that she is a person who needs to feel loved and appreciated. She needs to talk and be heard. A wife needs a husband who makes her feel important. She needs to feel she has value, and only a husband can adequately meet these needs.


If a husband lives in respect for his wife as a person he will avoid many of those problems that develop because of indifference. In a moment of bitterness a husband said to his wife, ""You should have married a better man."" She replied, ""I did."" If a husband will respect his wife the way he did before they married he will be a successful husband. The way to get ahead is to go back to how you were when you first met. The second thing he must do is-

, A husband cannot produce life by himself, nor does he receive more grace from God than does his wife. The inequality she has of being the weaker sex physically is not a disadvantage for her, for Peter says that her weakness is to call forth greater honor from the husband. Just as you treat your china better than you do your everyday dishes, so a wife is to be treated with greater care because of her delicacy.

, Unanswered prayer is not always because God does not want it to be, but because it would be unfair to grant it to one who has little or no respect for the needs and desires of his wife. If, for example, you refuse to forgive your wife for some folly whereby she has offended you, you have no ground of hope in Scripture to believe that God will forgive you as long as you withhold it from your mate.


God will not put His stamp of approval on the husband who lives like the man in the moon. If a man is all bright and smiles before the world, but dark and cold toward his wife in the home, he injures his relationship to God, and is the stumbling block in the road to having his own prayers answered. Few husbands ever think of it, but Peter says a good relationship to your wife is essential to a good relationship with God. The bottom line of all that Peter is saying is that a man who respects his wife in the same way that he respected her when they first met will be a successful husband.

, Peter's advice will not only be a successful husband, but he will be an exceedingly happy husband.

Be more of an outdoors person.,
Be less self absorbed with your personal grooming.,
Rediscover the rewarding feeling of putting in a hard day's work, both physical, and mental.,
Make your own and do your own.,
Avoid modern day items that don't improve your life.,
Increase the opportunities for more peacefulness in your life.,
Marry for life.,
Love unconditionally but don’t spoil your children.,
Practice humility.",How to Adopt Amish Principles in Your Life," Modern life has many of us sitting inside all day, in front of computers, TV sets and game machines. Forgoing outdoor pursuits has seen an increase in obesity and diseases related to a lack of adequate exercise. By embracing an outdoor lifestyle as the Amish continue to do, you can restore health of mind and body, as well as gain a greater appreciation of nature.


Involve some form of outdoor exercise into your life every day. From taking a stroll around the neighborhood, to getting dirty doing some hard core yard work, find a way to burn some calories while being productive outside.
Get a pedometer and walk more. The Amish walk more than car-owning people do, and it benefits their health greatly. Amish men are thought to walk about 18,000 steps a day, while Amish women walk around 14,000 steps; this walking translates into very low rates of obesity.Invite the entire family to join you. Make outdoor play time one that involves every member of the family, even the youngest child and the most reluctant teen. Teaching children to appreciate being outside is important to helping them form these habits into adulthood.
Take time each day to notice and recognize nature’s bounty. Whether it be harvesting a new crop in your garden, to simply appreciating a new bloom on a flower. Make a concerted effort to notice at least one of nature’s gifts each day to bring peace and balance to the mind and spirit.;
, While it's important to look presentable and neat, being obsessed by the latest fads and spending a ton of money on beauty products is a sure-fire way to keep you dissatisfied with your appearance and to leave you hungering for more consumerist ""solutions"". Instead of being stuck on the treadmill of plastic surgery, Botox and faddish clothes, try a more simplistic Amish approach (although this isn't to suggest you don a simple smock and tie your hair in a bun every day!).


Invest time in finding what suits you rather than constantly chasing after fashion gimmicks and must-haves. Be budget-conscious when buying clothes––select quality over quantity and make your good clothes last through good care and maintenance.
Be modest. While the Amish women may wear very long dresses and the men wear dark suits and braces, you're not being asked to adopt their exact fashion. Rather, adopt the principle that modesty is more becoming than flaunting everything––wear clothing that isn't too tight, too flashy or too revealing. Wear clothes that fit your lifestyle and that are comfortable while still looking stylishly presentable.
Choose a hairstyle that suits you at your current age and maintain it. Avoid chasing the latest fad in hair styling or dyeing it until you can't even remember what your original hair color was.
Keep accessories and jewelry to a minimum, or not at all. Bling is definitely not in when adopting the Amish style and you'll save money, time and have less worry about losing it or having to match it all with what you're wearing.
Consider following one current hipster trend to dress simply and eschew accessories like the Amish––the simpler and less adorned, the better.Avoid wearing buttons, stick to black and white basics and keep all tailoring simple. A simple broad-brimmed hat completes the look and keeps the sun's rays from tanning your face.

, The Amish regard a hard day’s work as one of the most important contributions you can make in life and believe you reap what you've sown, so any notion of ""getting rich quick"" would never fly in Amish country.


Work hard, but also efficiently. Working harder doesn’t mean that you have to actually do you job the hard way. Integrate efficiencies in your day such as organization and planning in order to maximize your time in order to accomplish more tasks. Read books and websites about working smarter rather than harder while still applying yourself fully to achieving a good day's work, every day.
Don’t be afraid of hard work. Some people shy away from getting their hands dirty or putting in the extra effort because it could take a lot of additional exertion on their part. Instead of shying away from having to push yourself, embrace and welcome it. Consider hard work to be one of your most important contributions to society.
Switch off all distractions that cause you to avoid working in a focused manner. TV, radio, music, games, etc. can all be a source of distraction that can prevent you from getting things done. Either turn them off, or put them away for the allotted work time.
Commend and thank others for putting in a hard day’s work. If your child has gone above and beyond what was expected of him or her at school or on the soccer field, make sure you recognize these efforts with kind, reinforcing words.

, Rather than relying on the world of processed food and ready-made everything, start making, baking and nailing together your own lifestyle products.


Learn how to sew and knit your own clothes and share your sewing and knitting know-how with friends and family members. Once you're good at this, extend the sewing and knitting skills to soft furnishings, quilts, sheet sets and anything else sewn or knitted that you'd have bought in the past. Use scrap materials when possible, to make the most of everything.
Bake your own bread, cakes and cookies. You'll have the benefit of knowing what's going into them, as well as the reward of making something delicious and healthy. Plus, kneading dough is a great way to relieve stress!
Grow your own vegetables and fruit. Start digging up the lawn and turning it into your own edible garden. The work and effort will be worth it when you get bumper crops of organic, diverse and tasty fresh food. If you live in a small space or an apartment, investigate growing plants indoors, on your kitchen windowsill, or on a balcony.
Preserve your harvest. Get into canning, drying and preserving your harvest so that you can continue to enjoy it through the leaner months of winter.
Make your own take-out meals. Instead of purchasing take-out meals from various stores, save your pennies and make your own fast meals in bulk, then store them in the freezer for easy meals. You could make and freeze pizzas, macaroni and quality cheese, curries, stews, stir-fries, etc.
Make or conserve your own energy. Make candles, install solar energy panels and feed excess energy back into the grid, turn newspaper into logs to burn and challenge yourself to find as many ways as possible to keep energy consumption low in your household.
Make your own entertainment––you can make lots of things yourself, including toys, puzzles, books, board games, beanbag games, quoits, etc, Consider recycling and re-purposing items where possible.

, There's no need to forgo modern technology just because it's modern. However, it is important to reflect over what is really important in your life and what is either a massive distraction or isn't enhancing your life. For example, having three television sets may be causing your family to split up rather than spend time together, while encasing your foodstuffs in plastic may be causing plasticizers to leach into your otherwise healthy food. Become a conscious consumer and be aware of how products define or regulate your behaviors––if you let them.


For every item in your household, ensure that it is serving a useful or beautiful function. Clear out the junk that is just taking up space and giving you more things to worry about.
If your motto is ""he who dies with the most toys wins"", then use the Amish approach to having less to change your hoarding ways. Simplify and exist simply, discovering the greater depths in the company of others as well as allowing more time for self-reflection. Adopt the mantra that less is more––in your home and your life generally, you'll find that this will help you to live with greater clarity and happiness.

, The ultimate goal in the Amish culture is to be a peaceful, hardworking community. Although it may be difficult to find peace in a world with 24/7 news coverage, electronic gadgets at every turn and over crowding, you can take a few steps to help yourself find your own peaceful space.


Turn off the electronics. Spend the evening without having the television blaring or sitting in front of the computer and consider either meditating or curling up with a good book.
Reject violence. The Amish are forbidden from partaking in violence of any form. From turning off the television during violent shows to walking away from a situation that may become too heated if you keep pressing your point, you can adopt the same principle.
Practice techniques that encourage peace. Try meditation or yoga to set your body and mind at ease and open up to peace and tranquility. Learn and use non-violent communication techniques. Learn mediation or negotiation skills that help to keep the lid on frayed tempers.

, Although in the Amish culture the roles of the man and wife are more traditional, you can still implement some principles to a modern day relationship. In particular, view your marriage as a partnership that requires both of you to work hard toward maintaining the love and persevering through hard patches in which you may be tempted to call it quits or stray. Be prepared to stay together for the long haul and to use good communication techniques to work through your troubles together.


Have clearly defined roles established on terms that suit both of you. Even if you both work outside the home, sit down with your spouse and determine who will handle which area of the home in order to avoid communication breakdowns. You could also allot household responsibilities according to who enjoys them most or has the aptitude for them, rather than assuming old-fashioned gender divisions. Or rotate household responsibilities if neither of you much cares for them!
Take time to appreciate each other. In a fast-paced and busy modern world, couples can find it hard to take time for date night if they have a brood of children. However, just like the Amish, set down a daily time to show each other love and appreciation, whether it’s a quiet dinner at home or an evening by the fire. Always seek to eat one meal a day together, whether it's just the two of you or your family.
Avoid aggressive fights. While this may not work for everyone, when the Amish have a disagreement, the fighting volume is typically done at a whisper. In fact, some Amish will just not speak to the other spouse for a few days until he or she can resolve the conflict on his or her own. Before you consider trying something like this, discuss this technique with your spouse as this could possibly lead to further trouble and resentment if your spouse doesn't understand what you're doing. Alternatively, use skills of assertiveness and non-violent communication to clarify what you want and how you intend to help resolve challenges in your relationship.

, Many children in modern society equate parental love with receiving material items or having privileges they did not have to earn. The Amish demonstrate their love through consistency and discipline in order to shape their children to become productive members of society. Many Amish also let their teen children enjoy a period of freedom in their lives before making a final commitment to the Amish way of life––while you won't necessarily be asking your child to adopt your beliefs and/or profession, if you do want your child to be more invested in your values, give your child the freedom to explore values separately from you as he or she goes through adolescence, while reassuring yourself that the good modeling you have shown through deed and word as your child grew up will be well remembered.


All privileges must be earned. Instead of just giving your child a cell phone upgrade because he or she wants it, make it a privilege that must be earned. Aside from food, shelter and clothing, make all material items something your child can earn through good behavior, finishing chores or completing schoolwork. Not only will earning material items teach your child that nothing comes for free, your child will most likely be more appreciative and take better care of the item he or she had to earn.
Teach children to have respect for all people, including adults. Adults in particular are held in the highest regard in the Amish culture. Banish back talk and bad behavior around adults and teach your children to appreciate and give others the kind of respect he or she would hope would be delivered in return.
Discuss morals and values with your children. Find a lesson to teach your child each day. Whether it’s learning about how to be a better friend, or doing the right thing when someone needs help, teach your children the difference between right and wrong in order to bring more harmony and peace to their lives.
Show by example. Whatever you want your child to observe and learn from, ensure that you're modeling it at all times. The lessons best remembered are those done in the showing rather than the ""do as I say, not as I do.""

, In a gregarious modern-day, “super sized” society bigger or more is considered to be better, as well as exaggerating claims about yourself around others. However, the Amish practice just the opposite. To be a more humble person, start seeing your role in the world as one of facilitating the talents and stories of others, not always just about yourself. Ultimately, remember that you are not the only one around and that you belong to a community.


Never gossip. Gossip is looked down upon and is actually considered to be an offense against the Amish community.
Don’t brag. Although you may be thrilled that your child received straight A’s on his or her report card, bragging to the neighbors about how smart your child is would be considered to be too brash and negative.
Avoid being “showy.” The glitz and glamour of Hollywood would be a “no no” in Amish country. Avoid calling attention to yourself by wearing “blinged” out clothing, driving expensive cars or living in huge homes.
Don't avoid the labor of constant questioning and self-renewal. What you know is not be all there is to be known. Realize that others can always teach you something new.
Practice more gratitude. It is hard to big-note yourself when you're busy noticing what's worth feeling grateful about in life, especially for the people who help and support you. Take nothing––and nobody––for granted.

"
Read the Bible.,
Have passion for your faith.,
Follow the rules.,
Get the look.,Examples of Christcore fashion include Aaron Gillespie of UnderØath, Mike Hranica of The Devil Wears Prada, Mattie Montgomery of For Today, and Joel Piper of Confide.,
Listen to the music.,
Stand up!,
Support a band.,
Be a Christian outside of Christcore.",How to Be Christcore," The bible is the life-force of Christian ideology beyond Christian music. Having a grasp of the bible is great, start by reading The Gospel According To John and then read The New Testament in its entirety. Then read the Old Testament. Remember that Christianity revolves around the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.;
, Believe that Jesus came to save the world and is coming again. Find energy in reading your Bible. The Jesuscore social genre is not worn out or beaten. Be a strong, empowered young man or woman through the power of Jesus. Dance, sing, wave your arms, jump up and down. Pray often - real, true prayer. Talk to God. Tell Him about your day. Ask for guidance and love.

, Make sure you live by the ideologies of Christianity, make sure you put the teachings of Jesus in your heart. Don't immediately act like you know everything, 1Timothy teaches that new follower should not be the leader of a church, especially if you are new to Christianity as a whole. Do not drink, smoke, cuss, or have sex promiscuously, don't judge others and make fun of others. Christianity is about acceptance.

, Christcore adopts a ton of influences from many music-based fashion styles. Everything from hardcore punk, to scene, to emo, to metal. Pick and choose according to your heart. Example, Zao, a Christian band is more of a metal look, A Plea For Purging; a more hardcore look, and Confide is a more emo/scene look. Some of the items commonly worn:


Skinny Jeans
Stretched ears
Band Tees
V-neck Shirts
Slip on shoes
Cross necklaces
Various piercings and scripture based tattoos

,, The music of Christcore, varies from softer bands like Sent By Ravens all the way to harsh sounding bands like Texas In July and August Burns Red. Bands that are adored in the Christcore society today are Norma Jean, UnderØath, The Chariot, For Today, Haste the Day, August Burns Red, Impending Doom, As I Lay Dying, The Devil Wears Prada, Mychildren Mybride, Confide, Family Force 5, Agraceful, Texas in July, Blessed by a Broken Heart, Gwen Stacy, The Crimson Armada, A Plea for Purging, In the Midst of Lions, Inhale Exhale, and Maylene & the Sons of Disaster.

, Christcore is a highly criticized genre and group because of the fact it is Christian. Know why you're a Christian, and defend that because you will have people from every direction criticizing you. However do not insult them directly and pray they will find the love of God somehow., Christcore bands like UnderØath didn't sell millions of Albums by themselves, they did it with the help of their great fans. So find struggling Christcore bands and tell your friends about them. Do this with your band of choice and go to shows that they play. They need your help, buy their merch, give them a place to crash, give them money, etc.

, The goal of many of The Christians playing music now is that they believe that they have a calling to further The Kingdom of God and to save people and teach them the love of Jesus Christ. Attend Church, but especially if you are young, attend Youth Group and tell fellow youth about Christcore to further the musicians incredibly hard work. Put Christianity, and the morals that correspond to it into everyday life when it comes to interacting with people, love, family, friends, music, etc. Read the bible and Pray from the heart. Because what Christianity comes down to is seeking God through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and seeking to be a better person through the power of Christianity.

Make your spouse's life better than it was before.,
Take good care of your family.,
Be wise with your money.,
Be a hard worker.,
Be a generous and kind person.,
Look attractive but focus more on inner beauty.,
Cause your spouse to be respected.,
Be a confident woman.,
Be wise and give advice where needed.,
Cause your children and spouse to respect you.,
Do not take on more than you can handle.",How to Be a Proverbs 31 Wife," Proverbs 31:10-12 says, ""A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies. Her husband has full confidence in her, and lacks nothing of value. She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.""


It is interesting that it says, ""A wife of noble character who can find?"" meaning that it is very rare. But if you are such a wife, you are worth far more than rubies! That is some incentive to become a wife of rare quality, yes? If you are worth far more than rubies, then you are highly prized. That is always a good thing when it comes to marriage.
Why does her spouse have confidence in her? Because she brings him good, not harm; she is a good person. He has confidence that she isn't going to cheat on him or leave him because she is a faithful woman. He has confidence that she won't be lazy because she is a hard worker. He has confidence that she will always love him because she isn't selfish, and does rightly.
Contrast this with another verse in Proverbs, ""better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife."" (Proverbs 21:9) Many women can be quarrelsome, meaning they love drama, and they always want to start fights. Don't be a doormat, but don't be overly quarrelsome either. Obviously, if you try to fight with your partner all the time, that would bring him harm and not good. So seek to keep the peace, and bring him good instead.;
, Proverbs 31:13-15 says, ""She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands. She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. She gets up while it is still night; she provides food for her family and portions for her female servants.""


The equivalent of this today would be: keep your house clean. Do the dishes when they need to be done. Don't let the laundry pile up. Make sure you keep your spouse fed and don't let him stay hungry, etc. Yes, they can feed themselves; but if they are the ones working, the least you can do is cook for them.
It is interesting that it says, ""She gets up while it is still night."" This is a reality for any mother with small children already, but the idea is, you need to serve your family and not be selfish. Don't sleep, if a member of your family needs something, especially your children. Their needs come before yours, within reason. Don't completely neglect your own needs, but put their needs first. The mother is supposed to be the caretaker of the family. This is hard, if you are working as well, but try to serve your family when you are home in any way you can. Your family is your primary ministry in life.
If you are also a breadwinner in your household, you may need to hire help to do this (especially the cooking and cleaning). The important thing is that it gets done. Your extra income should more than balance out the extra money you need to spend on hired help.

, Proverbs 31:16 says, ""She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard."" Make great decisions when it comes to what you purchase. In our modern day, don't get fooled by advertisers who want to sell you anything and everything. Consider what you buy before you buy it, in everything. Be a good steward with your money and what you choose to buy.


There is a comical quote that says, ""Lucky is the man who can make more than his wife spends."" But seriously, don't overspend. Divorce is often caused by arguments over money. Your spouse worked hard for that money, so spend it wisely and only on necessary things. In regards to planting a vineyard, not many can do that today, but it means to do something productive with your time. Write, make jewelry, teach a class, get a different job, etc.
Verse 27 says she ""does not eat the bread of idleness."" Don't waste your time and be idle, doing nothing. There are plenty of jobs that you can do from home, if you are a stay at home mom, such as telemarketing, sewing, writing, and graphic design. You could even make a little extra income by selling stuff you no longer need or want (like toys your kids have outgrown, books and DVDs you've already read, electronics you've replaced, etc.) on eBay. Try to make good use of your time and be productive.

, Proverbs 31:17 says, ""She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks."" Don't be lazy, but enjoy the work that you do for your family. The Bible says, ""Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters."" (Colossians 3:23) You are working to serve your spouse and children, but primarily you are working to serve God. You may think at times that your family doesn't deserve your hard work, but you are not working for them, per se; you are working for God. Serve God by serving the needy and your family and children, teaching them to serve others.


Some say that motherhood is the most thankless job because you never get a promotion or public recognition. You just do all your tasks humbly and quietly. This is why some women get frustrated about the work they have to do, but always remember, you are working unto God. God will reward you for what you do, don't worry.
Jesus said in Matthew 6:19, ""Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal."" There may not be many rewards in this life, but you are building treasures in heaven with everything you do for your family.
1 Cor. 3:14-15 says, ""If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward. If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even though only as one escaping through the flames."" Whatever we build on the foundation of Jesus in our lives is what we will be rewarded for in heaven, even if it doesn't last. Every selfless deed, every act of love, we will be rewarded for in heaven someday. Amen.

, Proverbs 31:21 says, ""She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy."" A practical way of doing this is making sack lunches and passing them out to the homeless. Or, another thing you can do is buy an extra burger and a side order when you get fast food, and give it to someone you see that seems to need it. Donate extra income to charity, and give away old clothes and things you no longer need to charity as well. You can volunteer to tutor low income students for free who can't afford a tutor. Volunteer at a local shelter to lead a Bible study, and encourage everyone there; volunteer at your local hospital, or volunteer in other ways.

, Verse 22 does say, ""She is clothed in fine linen and purple."" So this Proverbs 31 woman is well dressed. But keep in mind verse 30, ""Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised."" The most important thing to keep attractive is your heart. Beauty is fleeting. Everyone ages, but you will have your heart and your character as long as you are alive. Work on cultivating your inner beauty more than your physical beauty.

, Verse 23 says, ""Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land."" Don't gossip about your spouse and tear down his character to others. Speak in such a way about him to others so that others will respect him.

, Verse 25 says, ""She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come."" Don't be overly stressed or worried about anything. Trust that God has your future in the palm of his hand, then you can ""laugh at the days to come."" Be a woman of faith, not fear.

, Verse 26 says, ""She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue."" In order to teach your children, seek to grow in wisdom. Read books. Listen to sermons. Read the Bible as much as you can. Pray for wisdom.

, Verse 28 and 29 say, ""Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: 'Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.' "" The main way to gain the respect of your children and spouse is to not have a temper. Seek to have self-control in every area of life. Also the more you are a hard worker, the more they will respect you.

, Although God will help you, God helps those who help themselves. If you take on what you know you can't handle, God may not help you with that. This could be having children when you know you can't provide for them, or don't want them (which would mean it would take an emotional toll on you greater than you can handle), taking on a greater workload than you can take, etc.

The fourteen steps to attain moksha are called Gunasthāna.,
Try to shed ignorance, i.e.,
Look out for the ""Fall"" from Right Faith.

,
Try to remove doubts about Reality.,
Become a samyagdrishti (true believer).,
Observe the Right Conduct.,
Observe the major vows (that of a homeless ascetic).,
Move on to observing complete self-control.,
Experience your passions occurring in gross form.,
Utilise meditation to further minimize passions.

,
Expect your passions to occur in a subtle form.,
Suppress every passion (here, you still do not possess omniscience).

,
Do intense meditation.,
Attain Omniscience (Kevala Jnana).,
Attain Moksha.",How to Attain Moksha,", wrong beliefs about reality. According to Jain Philosophy, the universe is made up of six simple substances and is therefore eternal.

,, At this stage, a person generally hovers between certainty and doubt on Right Belief. Knowledge of Seven fundamentals or truths (tattva) that constitute reality is essential. These areJīva, the living or conscious substance, i.e., the soul;

ajīva, the non-living, i.e., the unconscious substance;

Āsrava, i.e., inflow of matter into the soul;

bandha, i.e., bondage;
stoppage- obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul (called samvara);

nirjarā, the removal of matter from the soul; and

moksha, i.e., freedom.

, You will reach this stage when doubts are removed. The doubts may be removed by meditation or the instruction of a spiritual teacher. (Right Belief but no self-discipline) After developing Right Faith, Right Knowledge must be acquired. Knowledge can acquired through scriptures or meditation.

, Right Conduct includes:


Five kinds of spiritual purity:

1. Equanimity,
2. Penalties for faults arising from inadvertence, or negligence, on account of which one loses equanimity,
3. Refraining from himsā (injury)
4. Control of passions,
5. Contemplation of one's own soul


Observance of the vows:


Ahiṃsā- Not to hurt any living being by actions and thoughts. Out of the five types of living beings, a householder is forbidden to kill, or destroy, intentionally, all except the lowest (the one sensed, such as vegetables, herbs, cereals, etc., which are endowed with only the sense of touch).

Satya- Don't lie or speak what is not commendable.

Asteya- Not to take anything if not given.

Brahmacharya (Celibacy) - Refrain from indulgence in sex-passion.

Aparigraha (Non-possession)- Detachment from material property.

Digvrata- restriction on movement with regard to directions.

Bhogopabhogaparimana- vow of limiting consumable and non-consumable things

Anartha-dandaviramana- refraining from harmful occupations and activities (purposeless sins).

Samayika- vow to meditate and concentrate periodically.

Desavrata- limiting movement to certain places for a fixed period of time.
Fasting at regular intervals.
Vow of offering food to the ascetic and needy people.



, Some negligence is possible at this stage.

, No negligence is allowed at this stage (partial realisation of natural joy possible).

, Also, a new channel of thought opens here.

,, Very slight greed is left to be controlled.

,, Through this process, every passion is annihilated and delusion is destroyed.

, It is characterised by the destruction of all inimical (ghātiā) karmas. (Omniscience is with vibration).

, The soul destroys the four aghātiā karmas. It is marked by Omniscience without any activity. This is the last stage on the Path, Those who pass this stage are called siddha and become fully established in Right Faith, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct.


Right Faith (Samyak darshan)means ""Belief in substances ascertained as they are.""
Right Knowledge (Samyak Jnana) is the Knowledge of the substances (tattvas) without any doubt or misapprehension.
Right Conduct (Samyak Charitra) means being free from attachment i.e. not committing hiṃsā (injury).

"
Define what ""good"" means to you.,
Be good for its own sake.,
Be proactive.,
Consider the results.,
Consider the greater good.,
Be balanced.,
Give people the benefit of the doubt.,
Learn.,
Find a guide.,
Be a guide to others.,
Delight in goodness.",How to Be Good," Being good does not mean only by outer goodness. You have to consider being good straight from the heart (i.e, purely). Ultimately, you have to decide on your own code of ethics, and what matters is that you follow through with what you believe makes you a good person. At times, this may conflict with what others believe is good, and they might even accuse you of being wrong or evil. Consider their views - either they know something you don't, in which case you may learn something from them and update your morality, or perhaps their experience is limited, meaning that you should take their views with a grain of salt.;
, Don't try to be a good person because your parents told you to, because you want recognition or respect, or for any kind of reward except your own satisfaction in doing what you believe is good. Never act superior to anyone else or brag about your ""goodness"" or ""righteousness"". Your dedication to a particular creed, ideology, or set of guidelines does not make you better than anyone else. Do what you believe makes you a good person on your own terms, and remember that it's an individual journey - everyone's path is unique. Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame, said Alexander Pope.

, It's tempting to infer that as long as you avoid doing the things you know are bad (stealing, badmouthing, lying, intentionally saying hurtful things, etc.), then that means you are really good person, but there's more to it than that. By avoiding bad behavior, you've made a big step towards becoming a good person, but you've only just begun. In order to be good, you actually have to do good things, rather than just avoid doing bad things.

, Have you ever heard the saying that ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions""? It's not enough to want to do good, and to try to do good - you must also think about whether your actions actually had good results. Not every attempt to do good will end with good results, so when things don't work out, be willing to reconsider your actions and change them accordingly. As Isaac Asimov once said, ""Never let your sense of duty, loyalty, or obligation get in the way of doing what's right"".


For example, many parents feel that it's good to help their children in every way possible, but there are times when children need to learn lessons on their own and face challenges in order to achieve or to avoid mistakes in the future. A child who has been arrested on suspicion of drunk driving needs to bear the responsibility of his or her actions. If the parent bails the child out, then helps the child avoid consequences, s/he will only learn that the parent will be there to help even if s/he does wrong. The intention is good (wanting to help the child succeed), but the action might not be (removing all obstacles from their path).

, What might seem like a good idea in your situation might not have a very good impact on a broader scale (in the example above, the child won't have experienced punishment for the DUI and might go and violate the law again, this time possibly hurting or killing someone else). People often do right things for the wrong reasons, and wrong things for the right reasons. If you're playing a game with your team, for instance, it might seem good to try to score as many goals as you can to bring your team to victory. But look at the big picture. How will your teammates feel if you score all the points instead of helping set them up to score at times, never allowing them to get a shot in? How will that kind of victory affect the team spirit? Would you still feel good if your team won, but your teammates felt that it was an individual effort and they weren't involved? Consider the long-term impact of your decisions and what they might mean for others.

, In the struggle to be good, it's easy to swing from one extreme to another. However, any form of extremism can lead to closed-mindedness, a quality that can be found behind what most people can agree are bad deeds. In Buddhism, there's a term for avoiding extremism: ""the Middle Way"". Whenever you find yourself leaning towards an extreme, try to find the Middle Way before you act. This isn't going to be easy, but if being good was easy, wouldn't every good-hearted person be good? Here are some dilemmas you may encounter:


It's good to be humble and kind, but is it not good to be so humble and kind that you let people walk all over you to the extent that it damages your physical and emotional health, or lessens your ability to care for, spend time with, and provide for your family?
It's good to be responsible (pay your bills on time, plan for retirement, save up for your kids to go to college), but is it good to be this way to the point that you hoard away hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets and wealth for your own family's financial security without ever giving someone else (who wasn't fortunate enough to be born into your family) a helping hand?
It's good to be positive, but is it good to be so positive that you ignore risks and brush mistakes under the rug, never learning from bad decisions because you're always ""positive"" that it'll work out the next time around?
It's good to be honest, but is it good to be so honest that you hurt people's feelings unnecessarily, violate someone's privacy, or prevent someone from finding answers that they might need to find for themselves?

, To the extent that it doesn't jeopardize your safety (like getting in the car with a group of people you just met), assume each person you meet is a good person, and act likewise. If you see someone do something that you think bad, consider what they are dealing with in the context of their own life - don't jump to conclusions. Try to discover what motivated their bad act, and if appropriate, show them how it was hurtful by using nonviolent communication. Many times, helping someone else become a good person in a gentle, open-minded and unimposing way can help you learn and become a better person yourself.

, Constantly improve your understanding of what goodness means. Observe subtle or complex situations and consider how you would act in such a position. You can also learn from your own mistakes, from others, and from history.

, Seek out someone who you can talk to about these important things. Relationships are very important in life, and such a relationship can be invaluable in your journey of becoming a better person and doing good things.

, Sometimes, you can learn best by teaching. Make yourself available to help other people and foster a genuine desire to see them thrive. Believe in the power of your actions to influence others. When other people see you doing good deeds, they will be reminded to take more positive action themselves. Nurturing someone else and striving to be an example can help you see your own acts more clearly.

, Instead of focusing on the bad things happening around you, find reasons to dwell on the good. Notice small kindnesses that you find yourself or other people doing, and constantly remind yourself of the things for which you're grateful. Feeling like you are surrounded by good acts and nice people will inspire you to do more good yourself.

Take the time to pray.,
Find a good spot to pray.,
Know your purpose.,
Understand that prayer does not have to involve crafted, reflective silence.,
Get into your prayer position.,
Prepare for praying.,
Begin the prayer.,
Make the request, ask the question, or just make your voice heard.,
End the prayer.",How to Pray," No matter how you pray or whom you pray to, it can be difficult to find time for prayer during busy times. One way to deal with this is to make prayer part of your daily routine, such as praying as soon as you wake up in the morning, right before you go to sleep, or before every meal. There is no wrong time to pray.


Many people pray during emotional times, like when they feel sad, scared, or happy. You can pray at any time of day, and as much or as little as you feel is sufficient for your spiritual life. Some people make it their goal to maintain a state of prayer all the time by remaining conscious of their spiritual connection throughout the day.
Observant Jews pray 3 times a day (Shacharit, Minchah, and Maariv/Arvith) and Muslims pray 5 times a day.Still others pray completely spontaneously, when the mood calls or when certain occasions arise (for one's parents, before a meal, etc.). In short, do what you feel compelled to do.;
, You will find that you can pray anytime, anywhere, anyhow. It may help to be in a place where the focus is on spirituality (such as a church or temple) or where the environment reminds you of your spiritual bond (like a natural setting, or a spot with a big view). You can choose to pray in the presence of others, or you can pray privately.


For some religions, like Buddhism, meditation is a standard form of prayer (or, sometimes, prayer is a standard form of meditation). Finding a place where you can quiet yourself and feel connected to your spirituality is an equally respectable form of prayer. Whether an open field or a bowing congregation zens you, find your ""place of worship.""

, Often, prayer accompanies a ritual, giving purpose to the prayer. It can be a lengthy fire-burning ceremony offering sacrifices to ensure good luck the coming season or it can be a simple, thoughtful utterance in thanks for a meal. It does not have to ask, plead, question or thank; all it must do is appreciate.


Prayer can be a conversation, but it certainly doesn't have to be. Some religions relish prayer as an opportunity for intellectual contemplation. In addition, prayer does not have to have anything to do with you. Roman Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as ""acts of reparation,"" or amending others' sins.Once you know why you're praying, is there anyone specific you're thinking of to talk to? If you are looking to have a dialogue, who with?

, It can be virtually anything. Song and dance have long been parts of many religions' repertoires of prayer. Even some Christians pray while exercising their body!Whatever gets you closer to your spirituality, your God, can be an activity of prayer. If a runner's high gets you there, fantastic. If curled up in your sheets does, great. You can scream at the top of your lungs and dart for the hilltops if it makes you appreciative, full of wonder, or thankful.

, This depends on the belief you have, if any. Sometimes expressing your thoughts physically can make the experience more complete. People vary in how they position themselves during prayer: sitting, kneeling, lying down on the floor, hands folded, clasped, or raised high, holding hands with other people, head bowed, dancing, prostrating, whirling, swaying, and so on. Some people even pray with their eyes open; and some closed.


Every religious person has beliefs that feel right for them. What feels right for you? In addition to thinking about the position of your body, consider the position of your body in space. Some religions believe in facing a certain direction during the act of prayer (toward Mecca, for example). If there's a spiritual place in your life, consider its place relative to you.

, Dependent upon your belief, you may have a ritual way to prepare for praying. You may find that it gets you in the right mindset. Prepare in whichever way you feel is comfortable or appropriate.


All around the world, people are washing, anointing with oil, ringing bells, burning incense or paper, lighting candles, facing specific directions, making the sign of the cross, or fasting. Sometimes the preparation is directed by someone else, such as a spiritual friend, a group prayer leader, or a teacher of your beliefs. It can be in the few minutes beforehand (such as washing or the sign of the cross) or it can be for days or even weeks (in the case of fasting).
Many religions take your appearance into account. Certain clothes are deemed appropriate or inappropriate for prayerful gatherings. If for some reason you find your current dress distracting, opt for a presentation that is more reminiscent of you and your spirituality.

, You can pray by speaking out loud, thinking, singing, etc. Some prayers are recited from memory or read from a book, while other prayers are more like conversations. You may open the prayer by calling on the God(s) or Deity(s) you are praying to, and asking for help (or whatever your intention).


There is no wrong way to go about it. If a memorized prayer or chant delivers the point of your intended message, there is no need to go about searching for words. But if you have a specific thought, question, or concern in mind, any informal dialogue counts just as much.

, You can ask for answers, seek strength, send good wishes to others, or give thanks. Perhaps the most basic forms of prayer are requests for help in becoming a good (or better) person, and requests that your deity(s) direct your prayer.


There is no length of time necessary for a prayer. After all, the big guy upstairs (or one of the big guys (girls)) would certainly appreciate even a ""Hey, thanks!""
Clearing your mind and becoming silent can be a useful part of prayer. Don't feel the need to be constantly thinking, talking, or listening for messages. You may find a clearer mind that has the answers in contemplative silence.

, Some people end or close the prayer with a special word, phrase or a gesture, or simply by standing or sitting in silence for a minute or two, or saying ""Amen.""


You'll know when your prayer is complete. Remove yourself, still reflectively, from your position or location and go about your day, a little more spiritually than before.

Keep a gratitude journal.,
Turn your thinking around.,
Practice mindfulness.,
Practice meditation.,
Cultivate a healthy lifestyle.,
Take a break.,
Tell someone you appreciate them.,
Give back.,
Focus on intention.,
Just say thank you.,
Find the thankfulness in specific events.",How to Be Thankful," Reminding yourself what you have to be grateful for and recording your gratefulness each day helps to cement how thankful you are. It doesn't matter how difficult your life is at the moment, there is always something to be thankful for, some shining light of gratitude. Finding that will help you deal with the other parts of life.Record 3-5 things you're thankful for every single day. These can be things as simple as ""the sun was shining"" or they can be as big as ""my significant other proposed.""
Spend a little time each day reflecting on the things you're most grateful for, during that day. You may even find that you have more than 5 things you want to record.
When you're having a particularly difficult time, it can be beneficial to go back to what you've written previously. If it's a really hard time, find the smallest things that you can be grateful for. For example: if you have a terminal illness it's unlikely you're going to be able to be grateful for that, but you can be grateful for things like, someone else bringing you dinner, a warm bed, your cat snuggling with you. All these little things can make the trauma of the big thing (the illness) more bearable.;
, People who are thankful for the things in their lives aren't living an easier life than you. In fact, many of the people who practicing the most gratitude are the people who have had incredibly difficult things happen to them because they understand that it isn't the situation that's the problem, it's how you think about the situation that makes it easier or more difficult.


Use the right words. Using negative language and labeling can make a situation more difficult and make it harder for you to be thankful in general. For example: labeling it ""my horrible illness"" is going to make it worse than simply saying ""the illness that I have."" In the second instance not only are you not making the illness part of you, but you are also turning it into neutral language, rather than negative.
Bashing yourself and others is going to make you less able to be truly thankful. When you find that you're thinking negatively about yourself or another person, stop and turn that thinking around. For example you think ""I am so stupid when it comes to math."" Instead, say ""I am having some difficulty with this math problem."" This re-frames the problem so that the problem isn't you, it's that there is a disconnect between you and this problem and that is something that you can overcome.

, By being in the moment you are making it impossible for your brain to race ahead and worry or plan for the future, or become bogged down in the past. This is one way of practicing thankfulness because you are immersing yourself in the present and acknowledging and thanking the importance of the ""now.""


Practice mindfulness while you eat. This means, don't read a book, watch t.v. or check your phone. Instead, focus on the food that you're putting into your mouth: is it hot? cold? what is the texture like? the smell? is it sweet or sour or salty?
Do this while going for a walk, or simply sitting outside. Notice the color of the sky and shape of the clouds. Notice the color and shape of the trees and the plants. Use your nose to locate any smells, and listen to the wind in the trees, the sound of children playing, the sound of cars as they go past you.
Practicing mindfulness is a way of being present to each moment as it happens. It is one technique that can help ease mental health issues like depression or anxiety, because these tend to be caused by fear for the future and concern about the past., Meditation is another of those incredibly useful ways of dealing with mental health issues and a general sense of malaise in your life. It can also help to foster your thankfulness and gratitude practices.


Go somewhere quiet and meditate for 15 minutes each day. Seat yourself comfortably and start to take deep breaths. Your belly will rise and fall with each inhales and exhale. Focus on your breath. When errant thoughts demand your attention acknowledge them and let them go. If you find that you've strayed from the meditation, focus on your breathing again.
It can be helpful to set a breathing limit rather than a time limit so you aren't constantly watching the clock. Say something like ""I'll meditate for 50 breaths."" If you lose track, that's okay! It's probably time to be done, anyway.

, Being thankful is actually something that can greatly help make you healthy and keep you healthy. However, it does help to give thankfulness a boost by cultivating a healthy lifestyle for yourself by getting enough sleep, drinking water, and eating in a way that fosters your well-being.


Sleep is a huge component to health and to being thankful. While, it's certainly admirable to practice gratitude even during those sleepless, anxiety-fueled times in your life, getting enough sleep can help make thankfulness easier to cultivate. Try to get to sleep before 11:00 p.m. and turn off all electronics (computer, phone, iPod) 30 minutes before bedtime.
Get enough water. Since water makes up so much of our systems, it's a necessary component to making sure everything runs smoothly. Try for at least 8 glasses of water each day.
Get exercise. Exercise (especially things like cardio) releases happy chemicals like endorphins, which help to regulate your moods and make you feel better. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise each day. This can be something as simple as going for a run, or putting on some music and dancing for 30 minutes, or doing some yoga.
Make sure you're putting food in your body that will help your body run effectively and happily. Go for veggies and fruits (the darker colored, the more nutrients) like kale, red peppers, and bananas; good carbohydrates like brown rice, whole grain, oats; protein like salmon, nuts, lean meats, eggs. Avoid sugar and salt as much as possible. Focus your diet on the best, most healthy parts, with the occasional indulgence.

, Sometimes a good way to get you back on track and feeling better is to take a break. You'll need to create things to be grateful for, sometimes, and a break can be a good one.


At work (or school, etc.), go for a walk around your building or step outside for 15 minutes to breathe the fresh air. Spend this time musing on how thankful you are for the opportunity to take a break, to stretch your legs, to feel the sun.
Sometimes you just really need a vacation. If you have the ability to take one, you should! A vacation and taking a break from your usual activities can give you a greater appreciation for them, as well as recharge you to deal with the things that you're less appreciative of.

, So often life gets busy and you forget to tell people that they matter, that you've noticed what they do and it means a lot to you. People will remember you more fondly if you thank them. It will cultivate an atmosphere of thankfulness that can spread out gradually.


Talk about gratitude with family. Set aside a time, like the evening meal, to talk about the things you were grateful for that day. Let each family member have a few minutes just to discuss what made them thankful.Send a thank you note. it is really amazing what sending just a small thank you note can do. A thank you note acknowledges that they gave you something (time, effort, a gift) that they didn't have to and that you appreciate what they've done. You don't have to write a massive novel thanking them, just a few lines that let them know what they and their gift (a thing, of time, of energy, etc.) meant to you.

, Being thankful isn't just about telling people you are thankful, it's also about giving back to your community and to your friends. This doesn't mean that you give back so that everything is even and no one ""owes"" anyone anything. That isn't how gratitude and thankfulness work.Do something for the people in your life who have helped you. You don't have to tell them that you're doings something for them because they've done something for you. That comes across as self-serving. Instead, when they need an extra hand, you provide it. For example: helping your sister's family clean their house during a really busy season, taking your grandmother to her doctor's appointments, or giving your friend a hand moving into her new place.
Do something for people you don't know. Sometimes people do things for you that you can't easily repay (in the sense that you want to thank them and show how much it meant to you). Of course you should thank them, tell them how important their action or gift was. But you can also pay the kindness forward. For example: your professor helps you out in ways that you can never repay (writing letters of recommendation, being a mentor, reading your work), so you instead pay that forward and mentor someone else.

, When someone does something nice for you--gives you a gift, brings you a hot meal, offers to read over and edit your thesis--focus on how someone tried to bring something good into your life. Someone gave up their precious time, or money, etc. to do something for you.This focus cultivates an atmosphere of gratitude that is then passed on to other people through your actions and words, especially if you have children., Speaking the words aloud can help cement the feeling of gratitude in your life. Not only that, but it helps others to know that you are thankful for the things that they have done for you. It can, also, help get you back on track when you're starting to feel put-upon by the world, or anxious.


Use the words ""thank you"" as a sort of prayer or mantra. You can thank specific things, or you can just repeat the words over and over to yourself. For example: if you're on the bus to work, you could start quietly (or in your head) thanking the food that you ate that morning, the rain for watering all the trees, the bus for carrying you promptly to your destination, your rain jacket for keeping the rain off.
You should also remember to thank the people you see throughout the day. Thank the barista who makes your coffee, thank the person who held the door for you, thank the customer service person who helped you figure out why your phone wasn't working. Thanking people fosters an atmosphere of gratitude that will extend throughout other people's days, as well.
Remember, that it is impossible to be in a state of fear and appreciation. By cultivating gratitude (speaking it aloud) you can do things like ease anger, anxiety (even chronic anxiety), depression, and other health problems.

, Sometimes it can be really hard to be thankful in your life. Things like having a significant other break up with you, or make you angry, or when you really dislike your job. These are the times, however, when it is even more important to cultivate gratitude, because that will help you get through the hard times better than getting angry or upset will.


To cultivate gratitude for something like a difficult or boring job, make a list of the good things about the job: it gives you money so you can buy food and have a roof over your head, it gives you a chance to take the bus into the city and see the early morning sun, you brought a delicious sandwich for lunch that day. You may have to start really small to find the things to be thankful for, but it will put you in a better mood and when you're starting to get down or depressed about it, pull out that list and start adding to it.
For something like a relationship break-up, you should definitely allow yourself time to grieve and be sad (being grateful doesn't mean doing away with emotions like sadness, anger, etc. it simply means making them more manageable). After you've given yourself time to grieve, make a list of the things that you learned or are grateful for from the relationship (you learned you don't want to be a morning person, you learned how to compromise, etc.) and then what you are thankful for about the relationship being over (now you can leave your stuff wherever you want, now you can eat blueberries because your ex was allergic, etc.).
Basically, you can apply your thankfulness technique to any situation. There is always something to be thankful for, even if it's a very small thing (the sun is shining, etc.). Finding those things and acknowledging them can help you to lead a more fulfilled and content life.

Limit your fast appropriately.,
Make the fast an opportunity to step-up your spirituality.,
Pray before, during and after your fast.,
Close your fast with prayer.",How to Fast for a Religious Occasion," Fasting can actually be a cleansing opportunity for the body, but you don't want to make yourself sick. Eat a good meal prior to beginning your fast. Don't gorge yourself, but don't go into it on nothing but a snack-size meal.;
, If there is not a specific limit already set by your religious tradition, limit the fast yourself to 12-24 hours. Anything less is not much of a fast, and anything more could lead to serious physical problems. Remember that your fast should be a good experience, not a dangerous one.

, Set aside time to study scripture or other inspirational writings, and meditate on their meaning.

, Whatever your purpose for religious fasting, it can be a great opportunity for spiritual growth when accompanied by prayer. Pray with purpose, expressing gratitude and articulating both your needs and the needs of others. Pause to reflect and meditate on your prayer and your fast.

, If you were fasting with a specific purpose, take the opportunity again to express your purpose. Express gratitude for the opportunity to fast, and for being able to complete it!

The first noble truth is the truth of suffering.
The first bodhisattva vow is the vow to rescue living beings from suffering.
In Buddhism, suffering refers to the physical and mental suffering of all human beings.
The key to ending suffering is reaching nirvana, which can be done by living according to the Noble Eightfold Path (also known as the Middle Way).;
, The two staples at the center of Buddhism are the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. The Four Noble Truths can be understood as the belief behind Buddhism, and the Noble Eightfold Path is the discipline and practice behind that belief.Living according to the Noble Eightfold Path includes:


Right speech, action, and livelihood. The key to following these three elements involve living according to the Five Precepts.
Right effort, mindfulness, and concentration, which can be achieved by practicing meditation.
Right understanding and thought, which come about when you practice meditation, cultivate mindfulness, and live according to the Five Precepts.

, The second noble truth is a recognition of the cause of suffering, which comes from desire, ignorance, and the craving of pleasure and material goods.The corresponding bodhisattva vow involves vowing to end desire and craving.


Buddhist don’t believe that suffering and desire can be ended easily. Rather, this is a pursuit that spans many lifetimes, but you can do your part by following the Noble Eightfold Path.

, The third noble truth is the understanding that suffering can end, and this means suffering both in life and in spiritual terms. The answer to the end of suffering is learning, enlightenment, and action.


The corresponding vow for the third noble truth is to learn about dharma and how it affects suffering., The fourth truth in Buddhism has to do with the path that leads to the end of suffering, which was the path of the Buddha. Suffering ends when one finds enlightenment and nirvana, which is the end of suffering.


To obtain nirvana, you must strive to live your life according to the Noble Eightfold Path.

, The Five Precepts in Buddhism are not commandments, but rather undertakings that you should strive toward. The first precept, which is to abstain from killing living beings, can be applied to all creatures, including humans, animals, and insects.


In positive, this precept means to be kind and to love other creatures. For many Buddhists, this precept also entails a general philosophy of nonviolence, which is why many Buddhist are vegetarian or vegan.Unlike religions that say you'll be punished if you don’t abide by the laws and rules of the religion, Buddhism focuses on the consequences that your actions will have in this life and the next.

, The second precept is to abstain from taking things that aren't yours or that aren't given to you.Again, this isn't something you're commanded to do, but rather something you must want to practice. Free will and choice are very important principles in Buddhism.


This precept means don’t steal from friends, neighbors, family, strangers, or even businesses, and it could apply to money, food, clothes, and other items.
On the other side of the coin, this precept also implies that you should strive to be generous, open, and honest. Give instead of take, and help others when you can.
There are many things you can do to be generous and giving, including giving money to charity, volunteering your time, raising money and awareness for different causes, and donating gifts or money when possible.

, Another important notion in Buddhism is exploitation, and practicing Buddhists should undertake not to exploit themselves and others. This includes sexual, mental, emotional, and physical exploitation.Buddhism does not mean you have to be abstinent, but it does mean that you should be conscious of your actions. If you are going to engage in sexual activity, it should only be with consenting adults.
Traditionally, Buddhist teachings also indicated that a person should not have sex with a partner who was married or engaged.
Instead of engaging in sexual misconduct, strive to practice simplicity and being content with what you have.

, Truth, learning, and inquiry are also important ideas in Buddhism, which is why it’s important that people abstain from false speech. This means avoid lying, telling untruths, and hiding things from others.


Rather than lying and keeping secrets, focus on being open, clear, and truthful with yourself and others.

, The fifth precept, which is to avoid substances that confuse the mind, is related to the Buddhist principle of mindfulness. Mindfulness is something that you should strive to cultivate in your daily life, and this means being aware and conscious of your actions, feelings, and behaviors.The problem with mind-altering substances is that they confuse the mind, make you forget what's important, cause you to lose focus, and can contribute to actions or thoughts that you'll regret later.
Mind-altering substances include drugs, hallucinogens, and alcohol, but could also apply to other psychoactive substances like caffeine.

, Karma, or kamma, means action, and a large part of Buddhist philosophy is the importance placed on the consequences of your actions. The idea is that good actions are motivated by generosity and compassion. These actions bring about well-being in yourself and others, and they create happy results as a consequence.


To incorporate more good actions into your life, you can help people who need a hand, volunteer your time and skills to people who need you, teach others things you have learned, and be kind to people and animals.
Buddhists believe that life is a cycle of life, death, reincarnation, and rebirth. Your actions have consequences in this life, but they can also impact other lives as well.

, Unlike good actions, unwholesome actions are motivated by greed and hatred, and they bring about painful results.Particularly, bad deeds will prevent you from breaking the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, meaning your suffering will continue if you inflict suffering on others.


Unwholesome actions include things like being selfish, greedy, and refusing to help other people.

, Dharma is another very important notion in Buddhist teachings, because it describes the true reality of your life and the world. However, dharma is not static and unchanging, and you can change reality by changing your perception, by making different choices, and by choosing right actions.The term dharma also describes the path and teachings of Buddhism in general, so it can be thought of as the way you live your life.To practice dharma in your everyday life, try being thankful for the things you have, grateful for your life, and by enjoying life. You can show thanks through prayer, by making offerings, and by working toward enlightenment., Meditation is one of the most important practices in Buddhism, because it provides insight, stillness, quietness of mind, temporary reprieve from suffering, inner peace, and helps you on the path to enlightenment.


To meditate properly, it’s important to find a spot that’s quiet, and that will allow you to concentrate on your practice. A bedroom or other empty room is a good place.
Turn off your phone, the television, music, and any other distractions., Sit cross-legged on the floor or on a cushion if that’s comfortable for you. If you are not comfortable in that position, try kneeling, or sit on a chair.


Once you’ve found a comfortable seat, sit upright, hold your head straight, and relax your back and shoulders.Place your hands palms-down on your thighs or folded in your lap.

, You can close your eyes, keep them partially open, or leave them completely open for your practice. Especially when you're first starting out, find a position and arrangement that’s comfortable and that facilitates your meditation.


If you want to keep your eyes open or partially open, shift your gaze downward and fix it on something a few feet or yards in front of you., One of the most important parts of a meditation practice is the focus on your breath. You don’t necessarily have to breathe a certain way, but you do want to concentrate on the air flowing in and out of your body.


The focus on the breath is important because it helps you concentrate on the present moment without fixing your thoughts on any one idea.
Meditation is also about being mindful and present, and focusing on your inhalation and exhalation is a great way to center yourself and be present in the moment., One of the main goals of meditation is clearing your mind and finding calmness. To start, allow your thoughts to come and to pass without getting caught up in any of them. If you find yourself becoming fixated on a particular thought during, go back to focusing on your breathing.


Do this for about 15 minutes a day for the first week. Then, extend your sessions by five minutes each week. Aim to reach 45 minutes of meditation each day.Set a timer to so you know when you can end your practice.

Find a Tibetan Lama or Rinpoche to teach you even further than you could by yourself, especially if you want certain empowerments.",How to Practice Tibetan Buddhism," The most essential are ""Essential Teachings,"" ""The World of Tibetan Buddhism,"" ""Mind of Clear Light,"" ""The Art of Happiness,"" ""An Open Heart,"" ""How to Practice,"" and ""The Path To Enlightenment."" The Dalai Lama is one of the most scholarly, most humble and best Buddhist practitioners in the world, at least among those that are widely known.;
, The philosophical teachings in Tibetan Buddhism, especially the teaching on imputation by mind, are very subtle and difficult to grasp and will likely take years, or at the very least several months, of study and contemplation before they start to really make sense and apply to your personal experience in a real way. Keep going. Keep studying, keep contemplating what you've read and memorized (memorizing important quotes from Buddhist scriptures that the Dalai Lama quotes in his books is an important step to understanding and ingraining the philosophical ideas of Tibetan Buddhism into your mind), keep meditating.

, It doesn't matter so much what meditation you do. What is important is that you practice meditation every single day; the longer you do it within any given day, the better, but it's very important to realize that if you overdo it on one day you are likely to do less meditation on the next day (the Yin-Yang principle in action) so it's best to do the same amount of meditation every day, and increase the amount of time you meditate gradually if you want to do more.

, So you should start with ethics and do your best to start with the most basic teachings first and master them, or at least get a good grounding with them, before moving on to higher teachings.

, It starts with the foundation of the Hinayana for a stable base, then it builds on the Hinayana with the altruistic motivation of the Mahayana and its practice of the Six Paramitas, then it builds on the base of the Hinayana and Mahayana with the Vajrayana which is the pinnacle of Tibetan Buddhism and the main daily practice of serious Tibetan Buddhist practitioners. The way this works is similar to how the realization of impermanence, suffering, and no-self (wisdom) in Hinayana Buddhism is dependent on achievement of concentration which is itself dependent upon the practice of morality (keeping of the precepts).

, Tibetan Buddhism also deals with the subtle drops as well as prana in the practice of Vajrayana. This makes it similar in some respects to Hindu yoga which also deals with the drops (Bindu). No matter what kind of person you are, it is likely that there are teachings in Tibetan Buddhism that would be suited for your type of personality or mental/emotional/physical/spiritual orientation. Also, the different deities (Buddhas and Bodhisattvas) are for people with different types of spiritual inclinations or personalities. For those who are intellectual, the teachings of Manjushri are very appropriate; for those who aren't very intellectual but are very kind and compassionate, the practice of Avalokiteshvara would be very good; for women, practice of the deity Tara (a female deity) would be good; and for those interested in power, Vajrapani (who represents of the power of the buddhas) might be a good deity.

,, Tibetan Buddhism has a more clear definition of Bodhicitta than other forms of Mahayana, and Tibetan Buddhism also has more clearly defined and developed techniques for developing Bodhicitta than other forms of Mahayana.

,, You should try to get a teaching from the Karmapa or the Dalai Lama.

Consider the first five precepts below, then compare them to the next group and consider the differences and apply the group you see fit best to your lifestyle and goals.,
Consider the value of having precepts.",How to Keep Buddhist Precepts1," You might find that they are put in ways relevant from ordinary people up to more committed Buddhists.


Consider the extremes of each one. Buddhism is a ""middle path"" focus recommending to avoid extremes as they don't lead to a peaceful life. The first extreme is becoming obsessed by the rules or fretting over them. Its impossible (as per the first precept below) to walk around without squashing microbes, insects that you don't see underground etc. Its all about intention not to kill so if you find a spider inside, the option would always be to leave it alone, or gently scoop it in a glass and let it go outside.
The other extreme is trying to force or belittle other people who don't follow these ""rules"". There is a great danger (particularly on volatile subjects such as sectarianism, vegetarianism etc) for people to start aggressively pushing their views and essentially trying to get the other person to surrender their own, which is to the detriment of both people. It should be asked whether this is really what Buddhism and the path of letting go of stress is all about. Do what is skillful and abandon what is unskillful is perhaps the best guideline of all.

, The reason is, virtue or goodness is the key foundation behind the noble eightfold path. When you consider virtue (sila), mental development and training (samadhi) and wisdom (panna or prajna), virtue underlines them all. Without virtue, the mind will not settle or be flexible enough to work with to develop the mind. Without virtue, wisdom cannot be practiced or developed. The flipside is wisdom is needed to be naturally virtuous and mental development is needed to train the mind to not run off into unskillful actions. The balancing ended reason is that virtue promotes wellbeing as we are safer and feel safer with ourselves and others. Virtue is the starting block as letting go of harmful intentions is itself virtue, mental skills and wisdom.

Refrain from killing and taking life.,
Refrain from taking what is not given.,
Refrain from sexual misconduct.,
Refrain from false speech.,
Refrain from intoxicants.,
Consider now how and where you can apply these precepts.",How to Keep Buddhist Precepts2," The first part is easy enough to look at, but the second part refers to kidnapping, imprisonment etc. For this precept the goal here is simply to avoid harming anything.


Think about this: The important thing to be aware of is choice. You have the ability to both kill it, do nothing, or let it go. Killing is really surprisingly easy, but not killing it means you have care and respect not only for the life of another but for yourself. You have to be aware of your intentions and let go of the ones that will cause you and others harm.;
, Not stealing is the first meaning, but also there are other aspects such as not taking advantage of other people, or manipulating people to get something etc.


Here there is something of a caveat. Traditionally thrown away items or cast-offs are allowed to be recycled so intention again - if you know it's stealing or that it might belong to someone, simply refrain from taking it without asking.

, This covers the obvious things like rape, or any form of abuse but also as any indulgent activity. It also covers looking for a relationship with those who are protected by their family, partner, religion or government and using sex or gender as a way to manipulate people, all are seen as misconduct.

In the first 5 precepts, it technically does not mean absolute celibacy, even though you can be celibate if you want (see the 8 precepts), it means that basically don't do anything that you would regret now or later, or do any actions that may cause others to regret knowing you. It is always best to discuss this with a learned person if you want an opinion in relation to the tradition you follow.

, This is about refraining from lying and even white lies. It's also expanded further to not giving biased or false information.


This is where it gets difficult if you are in a position where you lie by omission or tell white lies to protect someone (such as ""So and so is in a meeting at the moment and can't take your call""). You should consider ways to re-phrase the message without being deceptive such as simply offering to take a message to pass on instead.
The simplest solution is if you want to say something but know it doesn't have any benefit and/or it's not the right time or place, then try to find a time when it is appropriate to say it or be discrete.

, Essentially this is anything that essentially makes you heedless or reckless. Simple examples are alcohol, drugs etc, but anything else that makes you lose control.

You can be the judge of this of how much is too much, but there are times going teetotal or detox is good for your health. There is apparently some argument to if this covers caffeine, but again you have the choice to have none, a harmless amount (illegal drugs aren't likely to fit in this however), or too much where you can do something you'll regret. You are your own criminal, judge and executioner. As alcohol is not always fully ""cooked out"" in food (such as adding wine to sauces), it is still seen as containing alcohol, it is wise to refrain from these foods as well.

, Remember that these are the five and are considered to be the basic starter-kit for avoiding things you'll regret. There is also a lot to be gained from this that you had the strength to do the right thing and know that you avoided doing something you'll be ashamed of at some stage.

"
"
The 8 are very similar and have some of the five but aren't exactly the same as the 5 are ""refrain"", the 8 are abstain.,
Compare the two groups.",How to Keep Buddhist Precepts3,"


Abstain from killing (etc much the same as above).
Abstain from stealing
Abstain from sexual activity. (This is celibacy essentially.)
Abstain from wrong or harsh speech, so not only false speech as above, but insults, swearing, shouting, manipulating etc
Abstain from intoxicants, also as above.
Abstain from eating at the wrong time, this is before sunrise and after noon. Traditionally it is 1 meal a day, but flexible places allow a light breakfast or supper such as a piece of fruit. This one isn't about starving yourself but is linked to the ancient monks were given their meals and are not allowed to prepare food, but the broader community was not expected to cater 24-7.
Abstain from singing, dancing, listening to music or other media, entertainment, games but also any cosmetics and accessories like jewelry.
Abstain from indulging in sleep, or sleeping in indulgent beds.

, You might see the 8 are far more lifestyle based and involved as the 5 are ""refrain"" or ""avoid"" these are more a promise to totally abstain. Some have expanded particular aspects, some are different altogether. It is certainly possible to do these 8 during the day to day life, but more often this is left to temple visits or a time someone wants to dedicate a period to observing the 8 while using the 5 as a basis.


Some interpretations of No. 7 also include abstaining from wearing indulgent clothing, wearing labels and corporate logos (etc) in preference for simple or ""plain"" clothes. Some communities further observe this by wearing white and abstaining from bold patterns & brightly colored clothing.

"
"
This group is usually left to novice monks or nuns, or those who want to go a little further for their benefit and the benefit of others.,
The final of the 10 is to abstain from handling or acceptance of money.

,
Evaluate all of these groups and see if they can work for you.",How to Keep Buddhist Precepts4," Its easier to learn these as the 10 are the same as the 8 precepts, but with precept No. 7 broken into two:


Abstain from singing and dancing (etc)
Abstain from using cosmetics, scents (etc).

,, Some of these seem over the top or impossible in day to day life, but their whole point is a way to go without doing things you and others won't feel bad about. It's a starter kit to avoid stress and to build a lifestyle that avoids regrets.

Choose a stable place to set the shrine.,
Make a stand or shelf to support the objects.,
Place the objects onto the shrine.,
If a suitable Buddha image simply cannot be obtained, a picture of Buddha's relics, a stūpa , a Buddhist holy book, a bodhi leaf or picture of the Buddha's footprints may be acceptable.

,
On the next level, you may place an image of a Buddhist teacher like the Dalai Lama or a small statue of the Chinese Bùdài (the Laughing Buddha, considered to be a manifestation of Buddha Maitreya.),
Place offerings on the lowest level or, if you wish, a Buddhist scripture or a bowl of water.,
Traditional offerings include candles, flowers, incense, fruit or food.,
Place a small stūpa on the supporting surface of the shrine, if you wish.,
It is traditional to change the offering water every morning, however, the old water should never go to waste.,
If you wish, you may offer incense at the shrine when you recite morning ceremony.",How to Create a Simple Buddhist Shrine," (Some people use a whole room.) It may be a table or a shelf, but be sure to have it at least above head level based on the usual use of the room.;
, A simple start is a wooden stand with three levels. This will be the main surface of the shrine, so you may want to put some effort into this.

, First you will need an image of the Buddha. You can have as many as you like. This will go on the topmost level of the shrine. It is considered 'bad etiquette' to place the Buddha (or Buddhas) lower than any other image in the same room. In the place of an image of Buddha, a mantra written on a piece of paper or similar is perfectly acceptable, and preferred in the Jōdo Shinshū (Pure Land) tradition of Buddhism and in Nichiren Buddhism. Some buddhist schools recommend certain standardized arrangements of images for their lay members, in Japan often as triptychs with the main Buddha surrounded by either bodhisattvas, dharma guardians or lineage masters. This is not necessary, even after Japanese standards, and Chinese-Taiwanese Buddhism is usually less standardized when it comes to home shrines.

,, Two guardian images may be an idea to consider: Either the 'lion-dogs' common at the entrance of South Asian monasteries or two dharmapalas/vidyarajas you feel familiar with (Chinese, Japanese and Tibetan Buddhists doesn't use exactly the same palas, and for persons into Tibetan Buddhism or Shingon there may be reasons to choose carefully).

, Some find a bell or singing bowl on a cushion useful.

, However, it is not what you offer that is important: it is that it is done sincerely with a pure heart. Since Buddhist monastics aren't allowed to eat after lunchtime, food, fruit and dairy offerings traditionally – and for symbolic reasons – occur in the morning or shortly before lunchtime. Offerings of water, non-dairy beverages, candles, flowers and incense may, however, occur at other times of the day.

, You can make a simple stūpa with a small pile of stones. There is no need to go out and buy a costly gold one; that defeats the purpose of Buddhism.

, Use it to water a plant or something. A new cup or bowl should be used for this purpose: glass or crystal is preferable, because the clarity of the water represents clarity of the mind. Some Buddhist schools use two water bowls: 'drinking' water and 'washing' water. It is far from wrong to let flowers remain even after withering has begun: The flowers serve to remind you of impermanence.

, Touch the tip to your forehead, then light it. See warning.

Start with the Foundation.,
Develop your generosity.,
Keep the Precepts.,
Practice Meditation.,
Practice Wisdom.,
Study the early texts.,
Study modern texts.,
Balance your Practice.,
Stay for a short period.,
Stay for a rains retreat.,
Find the simplicity.,
Ordain as a Monk or Nun.,
Practice kindness, not hardness.",How to Practice Theravada Buddhism," Buddhism of all traditions but particularly Theravada, often describes four foundational, integral qualities one should to keep to be able to develop a practice. For best results, one should place as much importance on each of the four. These are: dana - which means giving or generosity; sila - virtue or ethics; samadhi - meditation; and finally panna - wisdom or deep understanding.


Often people never really get their practice started because they try to bypass generosity and virtue, but these are like the fuel in the vehicle, or the walls of the house. Without these, the practice never develops and falls over very easily - meditation stays too shallow and wisdom too superficial to be of any changing value. Eventually, each one develops the other in a circular pattern, going deeper and more revealing.;
, This is never as simple as making monetary donations from a distance, but is a moment to moment practice of being generous of yourself to yourself and others both in helping and assisting them, such as volunteer work; donating support, such as food, clothing and medicines to those who are practicing higher virtue and wisdom; and finally being generous supporting those in need with your care, patience and kindness.


Your intention actually underwrites all of these practices, so the aim is to develop compassionate and wise intentions. It must also be both ways so that kindness extends to yourself as well as to others. For this, it is an expression of a heart that has been developed by virtue.

, For lay people, there is often the choice of five or eight precepts, five being the more common for everyday Buddhists. Although there is no harm in breaking precepts by accident or unawareness, the longer you can keep your precepts the deeper and more beautiful the practice becomes.


The functional role of precepts is fascinating because virtue builds a sense of confidence in life - essentially your lifestyle grows in a way where wise people praise your qualities and you're not a target for criticism. But its deeper role is a sense of having no regrets, which is incredibly powerful in meditation.

, Meditation is all about learning the true nature of your mind, as well as how to skillfully and wisely develop it to reduce the hardships of life. In the early Buddhist texts, it is stated throughout the canon that a practitioner should aim for both the deep states of stillness (known as Samatha), as a way into the deeper insights known as vipassana (or 'seeing clearly'). Stillness practices allow the aspects of the mind that prevent clear insight fade away, as otherwise it can be like looking through foggy or blacked-out lenses.


The Dhammapada sums this up very neatly - there is no jhana without insight, no insight without jhana. Having both, one is close to Nibbana.

, This ultimately means applying your understanding in each moment, and allowing your wisdom to grow, as every situation is different. This particular skill is a result of the other three aspects, so while it can be developed on a simple level by reading early texts, listening to good lectures and taking personal retreats, this mode flowers slowly, but is perhaps the most beautiful flower of the four.


Wisdom is often put into effect and boosted by generosity, since it is easy to follow one's innate preferences, but to be patient, kind and wise in challenging situations is an expression of a generous mind.

, The early texts tend to be the most simple and straightforward in their presentation, however over the last 100 odd years, there has been a great deal of research into which texts that may be recognised and determined as inauthentic. The complication is that these recent distinctions are not always known by those starting or keeping a practice, so teachers can often innocently present later ideas and concepts traditionally thought as being authentically of the Buddha. Fortunately it is becoming much more easy in the 21st century for every-day practitioners to be able to find out for themselves.


What distinguishes most forms of Theravada is an emphasis on the ancient teachings of the Buddha, rather than later interpretations and new goals of Buddhism, this is largely due to geographical distance between the schools. Therefore some of the characteristics of Mahayana and Vajrayana schools are not present at all. Theravada does have its own later ideas however, such as those found in the Abhidhamma and commentaries such as the Visuddhimagga, which were complied many centuries after the Buddha.

, There is a great deal of fantastic meditation and life manuals from all the three traditions of Buddhism, so when used as a way to learn tricks and skills to develop your practice, they are an excellent tool. The early texts function as a central point of reference of what the Buddha actually taught, but the later texts can give personal experiences of other practitioners in their interpretation of the early texts, that can be very inspiring.


There is usually no problem in reading non-Theravada texts as scholars have noted strong similarities, particularly between Theravada and Zen. But the practitioner should know the later doctrinal ideas so as to be able to recognise what is and what isn't of the Theravadan tradition and avoid complicating their practice.

, The early Buddhist texts do not seem to have any one-sided practices - such as awakening through study only, through meditation only, through virtue or confidence only. But they are all themes that can be more dominant as part of the whole. So it is the essence of the practice to reflect and study, to practice samatha and vipassana meditation, to develop generosity and virtue.


Exceptions to this case are actually very rare and are a result of conditions such as kamma, or (more often) the texts themselves have been proven to be late or corrupted.

, At the beginning, it is very useful to take the occasional weekend to stay at a respected temple or monastery. This does, almost invariably, involve volunteer work, such as helping the monastics around the grounds and buildings or with other volunteers and monastic trainees (often known as Anagarikas) in the kitchen, but is an important foundation of generosity as well as developing your ethical and wisdom skills when dealing with people.


Monastic life in good monasteries can be very demanding for monastic residents, generally because the temple functions as a central facet of cultural expectations and holy days, as well as offering services such as teaching, counselling, funerals and other services of what is more known as religious Buddhism. For this reason, secular or non monastic Buddhists can learn a great deal about how one can develop a strong practice in the face of high expectations and service demands in a confined environment, often with very little expenditure, that monastics have to meet 7 days a week.

, Generally, this is for more advanced practitioners staying for the whole 3 months of the wet season. Around the world many hundreds of people book for the retreats in their preferred monasteries, so it is best to make contact a year in advance especially for well known monasteries.

, Theravada, in an orthodox practice, tends to be very plain, simple, minimalist and down to earth. Cultural Theravada in contrast is often distinguished by routines, regular group ceremonies and chanting, as well as focus on technique based styles of meditation. For many people, Orthodox Theravada can seem very dry, un-engaged and boring, but that is because its focus is to make the practice take the priority.

, Ordinations, generally are of benefit after at least a year of keeping the 8 precepts, but the longer the better. Ordination in the more respected monasteries (which are now very rare in Southeast Asia), is often deeply confronting and challenging as it features few group or social activities and maximum time in seclusion to be able to develop a strong practice.


It is best to dedicate several years for the monastic practice, as in most cases the practice really only starts to take an effect after 5-6 years as a full monk (known as a Bhikkhu) or nun (known as a Bhikkhuni). Temporary ordinations alternatively are fantastic for a cultural experience.

, In a monastery, it becomes very easy to become strict and inflexible - especially for visitors. This quality of kindness is foundational to be able to develop your generosity, virtue, meditation and ultimately your understanding of the world.

"
Find a quiet peaceful place and relax into a meditation posture.,
Examine the physical properties of everything you experience, including the body.,
Examine things which are dependent on physical states, and see if any of the following things apply to it:


Sense organs - such as eyes, ears, nose (etc)
Senses - taste, hearing, seeing (etc)
Gender - For example, is the blood, brain, liver (etc) masculine or feminine, is furniture masculine or feminine (etc).,
Frequently ask yourself what is the purpose or function of these things.,
To develop it further it is important to extend these questions to everything.",How to Investigate the Materiality Aggregate," The Do Mindful Meditation page looks at the four types, but any are suitable - sitting, standing, walking or lying down.
Focus your attention on something, such as the breath or feelings in order to relax but also to build up the awareness & focus to be mindful.
For this meditation any posture is suitable, although sitting is typically the most popular. The benefit is this type can be done in day to day life by using normal mindfulness or awareness of the subject to see things as they happen.;
, Start to mentally divide & classify everything up into their physical states such as considering each aspect of the subject, some examples are:


Is it solid, liquid or gaseous,
Does it generate heat, have a relative temperature (etc),
Is it in motion, generating motion on its own or gain motion from other things.
Change-ability or impermanence, does it decay, evolve, erode, dissolve, grow, expand or change in anyway?

,
Is it alive? This is slightly more complex as you need to divide it further, for example we might say we are alive, but what part alive, is it alive in isolation or without conditional biological supports and processes?
Can it communicate? It doesn't just have to be speaking words, but body organs can send chemical messages directly to the brain or to its surrounding tissue which can then be felt or understood. A typical example is the stomach, that when too much food or too little has been consumed it sends a message that it is full or hungry. But other parts can do the same thing, when blood sugar is low, it sends a message to the brain to consume more to be able to address that issue.
Is it light or heavy? Malleable or brittle? Does it have an edge, skin or boundary?
Does it depend on food of some kind?
Does it grow or continue, change, die? etc

, Some things have absolutely no function whatsoever, but some do serve a purpose. For example, the nose has a clear purpose - to smell, to serve as an airway and to filter dust out of air breathed through the nose and a host of other purposes. Why we smell is also for a whole range of purposes, such as knowing if something is rotten and unsafe to eat, but there are lots of other uses.
But the nose is dependent on having lungs and muscles to breathe the air in. It needs moisture so it doesn't dry out. It needs scents to smell and a brain that can work out what the scent is and if it is important. It does continue to grow and change over time, it doesn't live on its own, but it is part of a living body and so on.
The subject meditation is to look deeper to see there is a lot more to things than first meets the eye. They are a lot more complex, interactive, inter-dependencies and so on, but because we seldom look at them in detail we are far more ignorant about what they are, why they are and so on. Once a practitioner understands these things - and indeed this can take some time, then they can look at how the mind is interacting with them and can act further to train the mind towards being more calm, happy and healthy.
This can be achieved by sincerely asking key questions that people typically don't ask:1. Is anything eternal, permanent and lasting? Or does it completely disappear without any trace when destroyed? Or does it change from one state to another, a river of phenomena through time and space?2. If it is a living thing, which part of it is its ""soul"" or ""entity""? Is there any real owner, self or soul in it? Or is there just a compact chain of events where the gaps just aren't visible.
Continue to examine more characteristics in order to gain a better understanding, such as:


Is it produced, formed, born or developed?
Is it visible, or invisible (eg. tastes and sounds are invisible)
Is it subject to external physics or cause and effect?
Can it get sick, damaged or injured?
Is it internal or external, is it near or far away?
Is it heavy or light?
Can it feel or sense anything?
Does anything claim it, or is it just a part amongst many?

, There are three main reason why studying Buddhism or its meditations does not give lasting results or ""breakthroughs"" to a practitioner:1.

That the information gained wasn't relevant enough for the mind to kick out the old fantasies. The mind still prefers the warm, cosy environment that self deception provides.2. That people did not look deeply enough for long enough. Its all about balance again as parts of the mind that are attached to its fantasies and physical things are too strong, so the parts of the mind that incline towards understanding have not been strengthened enough to balance the other side.3. People still have something to lose, so there may be a mix of both first and second examples where either they still choose to hang onto some attachments and some fantasies are still too strong for the practitioner to grow above it.
Sometimes a practitioner expects the meditation methods, or the knowledge such as simply hearing the Four Noble Truths to just do the work for us. But it is we who must make the changes until there is enough learnt, enough trained and enough trust for the mind to let go. The mind generally does not trust us so we must demonstrate we are capable of taking over. This is why virtue, wisdom and mental training (often known as sila, samadhi and panna or prajna in Buddhist circles) is so important.
With practice and consistent, calm observation the goal can be achieved. When the practitioner continues to do this meditation, eventually they can see what things are and that there are no more mysteries about how or why. There just is the here and now."

This is why the marble statue of Ba Chua Xu, meaning ""country lady"" is worshipped. In the festival, worshippers touch her statue and ask for her protection and benediction.
Ba Chua Xu Temple Festival is the biggest folk festivity of Southern Vietnam. The festival is held annually from the 23rd to the 27th of the fourth lunar month.

, The first ceremony is the washing rite of the statue of Ba Chua Xu. During the days of the festival, various rituals are performed.


On the first night, the statue of Ba Chua is bathed in perfumed water and she is also made to wear fresh robes for the occasion.
Then Ba Chua’s discarded garments are cut into little bits and handed out among the worshippers. These are considered lucky charms to keep the possessor in good health and drive away evil spirits.

, The Tuc Yet Rite commences after the ceremony of washing. During this ritual of the Ba Chua Xu Temple Festival, the worshippers appeal for Ba Chua’s recommendations to the heaven. A grand parade of dragon dance is presented along with it and is followed by a chanting ritual in Ba Chua’s temple. Lastly the Duc Boi rite is performed by a man from the village, who sings aloud for the well-being of the country and mankind.


Participants dressed in smart traditional costumes stand on the two sides and the master of ceremonies stands in front of the statue of Ba Chua. The offerings include a white pig, a dish of pig's blood and a little hair, called mao huyet, a tray of sticky rice, a tray of fruits, a tray of areca and betel, a dish of rice and salt, which are place on a table before the statue.
The master of ceremonies and notables burn incense on the altar.

, The Xay Chau rite is performed after the Tuc Yet rite. In order to prepare for this rite, people replace the table before the altar with a drum. The master of ceremonies holds two drumsticks and says his prayers before the altar. After that, he dips a branch of willow into a water bowl on the left of the altar, and sprinkles water on the floor. When he finishes the ritual, he put the bowl and the willow branch on the altar, and beats three salvos of drumbeat to begin the hat boi (classical opera) performance.

, The Chanh Te rite takes place at 4 am of the 26th with the rituals similar to Tuc Yet rite. On the afternoon of the 27th day, the four tablets are brought back to Thoai Ngoc Hau Mausoleum, marking the end of the festival.

, During the festival days, many traditional cultural activities are organised, including a unicorn dance, a dance with dishes and cups.

Be prepared for this to be an ongoing activity.,
Consider the first of the 8 and how you can apply it - ""Right Understanding"".,
Start to apply ""Right thought"" where you can.,
Practice ""Right speech"".,
The third to analyse is ""Right Action"".,
Consider ""Right Effort"" carefully.,
Examine ""Right livelihood"" and compare it with your own experiences and occupations.,
Also consider right ""Right mindfulness"" carefully.,
""Right concentration"" is developing the mind to support mindfulness as well as focus.,
Take note of this group and consider how each section not only relates to each other but can be practised for your own benefit.,
Start to incorporate these into your own day to day experiences and see how they work for you.",How to Free Your Mind," Freeing the mind is a really a continuous action that requires right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right effort, right livelihood, right mindfulness and right concentration. This is known as the eight-fold path and the word ""right"" is used as a term to denote skillful, or beneficial. Read through the list as follows and consider ways you can apply them to your own lifestyle as well as cases from your own experience where they can be of use.


It's much like a recipe, with the right ingredients you get the desired result, but when the mix is wrong or misses out important parts it never really makes the mark. Many of the ingredients both support and interact with other parts supporting each other to make the completed goal.
Another important point to consider is simply that there is right effort, by flipping it over implies that there is a wrong effort. This means simply that effort, mindfulness, concentration (etc) on their own are not enough. The Buddha's biography showed that he practice the 8 components in different forms, combinations and styles over time, but only when the application was right did they work together to give a solution.;
, This is largely exploring and understanding in depth the 4 Noble Truths of Buddhism, but in essence right understanding is developing awareness that all things change. It is because they change without our consent we cannot ultimately depend on them, expect them to be perfect or to give us lasting happiness.


Right understanding also understands the importance of being a virtuous person, practicing mental development and developing wisdom as these three aspects not only make up the 8 fold path, but also build and support each other.

, Right thought is encouraging thoughts of goodwill, understanding and non-greed, while abandoning greed, hatred and views, beliefs & delusions. Right thought needs right understanding to exist because without understanding, there is no basis of knowing the difference between skillful and unskillful thought chains.


In a practical sense the four ""divine abodes"" of goodwill, compassion, appreciation and equanimity (or acceptance) are good for balancing the mind. The knowledge of the four noble truths may seem to make life dry, sterile and unhappy, where virtue as a support and applying the divine abodes will not only counter unhappy feelings, but create happiness and well-being. In practice when you feel cravings, consider appreciation of what you already have, when feeling unhappy, look at compassion. Its the use of opposites that make it so effective. Consider this basic analogy: in mathematics, (-1) + (1) = 0, in this sense a negative emotion can be balanced with a positive to balance the other out in order to regain well-being when it is practiced with sincerity.

, Speech actually follows on from thought, when there is harsh thoughts, there is harsh speech, but when harsh thoughts are abandoned, harsh speech doesn't occur as it doesn't have the mental intention to be so. On the flip-side, when there is a positive mental state, a person can give more skillful and positive speech in a discussion.


In a practical sense, it also includes times when it may be inappropriate to discuss certain issues, so right speech takes this into account as well as being virtuous speech.

, This also follows from right thought in one sense because if we have thoughts of anger, it prompts action of the same theme. Right action & speech should be directed towards being harmless and letting go of stress.


The interesting thing to notice is that right action is also letting go of things that cause stress in the mind. Right action builds and supports right thoughts and also right speech, because it is not enough to just think about abandoning something harmful or practicing something beneficial, you need to actually step in and do it. This is another key way that the path components engage and build other parts of the same path.

, Right effort is just applying effort to be aware and to do the jobs that are not easy to do. It is largely a middle ground focus, not an over-kill effort to force the mind or a violent effort to destroy aspects of it (which is a fruitless endeavour), nor is it its opposite - no effort. It's a middle ground effort with the intention to not cause harm.


In a practical sense, right effort applies to all the other path components. Without effort there is no inclination to do skillful actions as its much easier to do nothing and let the mind run wild. But effort needs right understanding as its so easily misapplied and unbalanced.

, Right livelihood is about avoiding going into a job where you have to be brutal and harsh towards people and other living or non living things, or in any work that will compromise virtue, mental skills and wisdom. This is not always possible and it is the very lucky that have such jobs that are harmless and have choice in the kind of career they take.


In a practical sense, right livelihood is not a livelihood that ""owns"" you or that you claim to own. If you have a good job, then right thought comes into play with valuing what you have when you bear in mind that there is still slave labour in parts of the world. When you are in a job that is less than desirable, if at the end of the day you can leave your work & troubles at the door of the office and let goof the stress it may cause you, then that is the minimum to work for. Right effort and right action is also relevant as right livelihood is being a virtuous employee who earns their wage and doesn't involve themselves in office politics or shirking their duties.

, Mindfulness is the awareness of day to day activities as well as what's happening in the biological body and its feelings and the mind and mental feelings as and when they happen. Mindfulness is an ongoing activity that may involve mental noting, or just bare awareness and observation. But ideally involves right action and right understanding so when you see something, you know what to do with it and will do it. Just noting or watching does not remove the problem.


If you cannot be aware of what's going on, then it is almost impossible to apply right action in abandoning stressful thoughts and harsh intentions. With mindfulness you can also recognise and learn to distinguish stress (which is developing insight) as well as potentially harmful thoughts and intentions. But mindfulness needs understanding and effort to do, so it also dependent on the practice of these components.

, It can be in meditation or day to day activities. Without concentration, there is no effort or mindfulness. It is developed with time and right understanding, but also with right effort, without which concentration and mindfulness fall flat.


In certain contexts, concentration is directly linked or limited to meditative absorption known as Jhana or Dhyana. Absorption is an excellent skill to develop but it must be remembered that in isolation it doesn't do the job. It can also cause many more complications such as addiction to that peaceful state, more delusions and even panic or despair that the peaceful state doesn't last, or that absorption is never attained even with much practice. It is the majority of people who will never experience it.
Jhana can be used like a magnifying glass to see into the mind and is highly effective however this insight can also be done in non absorption meditation, but only with lots of time and dedication observing the mind day in, day out. Its other key virtues are that it deeply calms the mind for extended periods that are not developed in non absorption meditations as deeply or lasting as long, which is why insight meditation is often called dry, as it doesn't give deep lasting peace. It can also lead to higher mental developments which is another benefit, depending on right understanding. It should therefore be remembered that there are many who have attained the absorptions but still were not free of their problems, so it is a skill to develop but still a component. It needs right effort, right understanding and right mindfulness to develop.
Interestingly, Buddha taught those who can do Jhana to praise and respect those who can't do Jhana as they need strength, diligence, commitment and very deep understanding to be able to put down the burden. Those who can't do Jhana were taught to respect and praise those who can because it is a very difficult skill and is not something everyone can do.

, Many of them seem logical and common sense, but as always the proof is in the pudding. The important thing to remember is by and large we always end up at right understanding as the key foundation component that all the others depend on because without understanding, the others aren't as effective.

, The biggest benefits are when you start to measure them against your own past and present experiences by experimenting to see if it makes a difference and comparing with past experiences. This not only increases the speed at which they begin working, but also makes them easier simply because you understand their benefit - right understanding again.


Also take special care to note that there is no ""right culture"" or ""right traditions, rites and rituals"" in this group as they are really the ""wallpaper"" of life. It adds colour and interest, but while its not only non-essential it can be a major disadvantage if handled unwisely. The main reason so many miss the mark is that they are still attached to culture and identity, teachers, lineage and interpretations of things without either being willing to let them go or actually examining if these attachments or things would ever have led to mental freedom in the first place.
The Buddha put this in a simple analogy, after people have crossed the river, they don't carry the boat on their heads. Ultimately if you have crossed the river but are attached to staying in the boat on the other side, you haven't ever stepped off to continue your life's journey. These things can take you a long way, but you are standing still and going nowhere if you stay in the boat that has landed on the beach. By using mindfulness to recognise and understand things so you are no longer hoodwinked by our experiences and letting go of the ones of no value, you have set your mind free.

We have all made mistakes.,
Seek the company of arhats, wise people, and good dharma books.

,
Create time in your life to be conscious.,
Sit quietly and let your thoughts and judgments arise and dissipate by themselves.,
Make special note of the various odors you smell, the noises you hear, and objects you see.,
Practice meditation, which you can do anywhere, at any time by simply steadying the mind on an object of concentration in the present moment.

,
Read what others have written about enlightenment and spirituality in general.,Learn about the Noble eight fold path and understand the 4 Noble Truths

,
Always be mindful of the moment and take pleasure in all activities that you do during the day (eating, sleeping, even using the bathroom).

,
The steps listed here are basic possible helpful practices.,
The way to enlightenment as described by Shakyamuni / Gautama Buddha Himself is through developing virtue, concentration, and wisdom.

,
Enlightenment is not a state of mind that you can force yourself into.,
When approached with intent, sparking higher consciousness is natural.",How to Become Enlightened," That seems to be how we learn.' Repeating the same mistakes over and over is what is injurious to our own purpose. However we are free to do that as well. What we should ask ourselves is : ""What is the cause of pain and suffering and how can we uproot it at a deep level?"" Some say that it is only through excess, that one can know what is enough. Being Here-Now is thought by many to be the first step towards Liberation.;
,, Too often, we get so tense or stressed with our responsibilities that we forget to take pleasure in the moment.

, Remain in the here and now. Become calm and clear.

, Approach other everyday situations in the same way. Doing this often brings you closer to pure consciousness.

,, Many of the great philosophers such as Gautama, Jesus, Lao Tzu, Shunryu Suzuki, Mohammed, Dante, Francis Bacon, William Blake and others. The Doors of Perception has much to say about this subject, both directly and indirectly.

,,, A real ""step"" towards enlightenment would be to make something that is now an unconscious part of you conscious. i.e. ""integration"". Practical steps toward integration can be found in the related how to wikis.

,, We live by the eternal law of cause and effect, which is, if you do something bad you will get a bad result, if you do something good you will get a good result. What matters is the consciousness you experience regardless of what takes place.

, Walking can spark higher consciousness. Use walking meditation. Just like aspirants learn to count their cycle of breath to consume normal and allow higher consciousness to come forth. The cycles or steps in walking can serve this same purpose. This same thing happens in music with the rhythm, that is, normal consciousness is consumed, allowing higher to consciousness come flooding in for the musician, bringing forth the higher consciousness. Don Juan put the flooding of images into walking for Carlos Castaneda. Carlos hiked with Don Juan while having his eyes crossed in order to flood the vision and insure the total consumption of normal consciousness. This awareness of higher consciousness while walking will motivate more walking/meditation and ability to walk/meditate more and more.

Practice self-control to avoid such situations in future.,
Do not miss out on doing those 'small little things' that could supplement you in seeking forgiveness.,
Rely on the duas mentioned to seek forgiveness.",How to Ask Allah for Forgiveness," It is very important to realize when you have strayed from Allah's guidance. You should analyze what made you do it, how it is affecting you, and what kind of consequences it will cause around you. Have a clear mind, think openly and accept your mistakes. It isn't to make you feel bad about yourself; it is to make you realize and accept the bitter truth that you committed the sin. Never forget that Allah has created and sustained us and all He asks in return is for us to worship and obey Him.;
, Many people might guide you and tell you what's right and what's not, and if they know that you have committed a sin, they will suggest you to ask for forgiveness. But, it won't have any effect unless you sincerely repent and seek forgiveness. It will only have an effect if it comes from your heart, not someone else's.

, To seek repentance, you can't be like, ""I'll ask for forgiveness and do it again"". No, you shouldn't. You have to make it certain that you will never repeat the mistake. Don't feel like, ""I might do it, I'm not sure"". Then, be sure! Don't let a shadow of uncertainty spoil your desire for forgiveness or it will not be accepted and will attract punishment instead. Remember that a minor sin that is repeated becomes a major sin.

, The process of Tawbah includes the following factors :


Recognizing your sins and mistakes;
Feeling ashamed to having violated Allah's trust;
Making a promise to never repeat the mistake.

, Know whether your actions hurt others. If so, seek their forgiveness too.


If the sin violated the rights of any other person like right of money or property, then it is necessary to restore their rights.
If the sin consisted of slandering someone, then seek his forgiveness with all your heart.

, That said, He can, on occasion, be severe in punishment and we should never take His forgiveness for granted. Entering the period of repentance without being committed to your God won't do any good. Have belief on Allah and pray that he will make things right. Remember, Allah also says in the Quran,


“Indeed Allah loves those who repent and purify themselves.“ , 'Tawbah' has many merits, that are worth noticing.


'Tawbah' paves way for success.
Tawbah keeps us away from hardships and trials.
Tawbah helps clear our conscience.
Tawbah pleases Allah.
Tawbah is a life transformational process.
Tawbah makes our Duas more ‘worthy’ of a response.
Sincere Tawbah (repentance) leads to forgiveness of ones sins.

, Do your prayers with utmost sincerity and reverence toward Allah. Perform the five compulsory salaat. If you can, try to do them at a mosque. The calm and devoted environment might help you. Do not hesitate from performing additional Sunnah (recommended) and Nafl (voluntary) rakats. They will count heavily in your favour, especially if completed consistently.

, He says in the Quran, “And perform Salaat, at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night .” (Hud 11:114). This states the fact clear that Allah loves those who offer their prayers at the right time, with the right attitude and devotion.

, Seeking forgiveness could be a long path and could be tiring, but it is your only hope. Know that you probably won't be forgiven in a day, nor is He likely to forgive you after listening to just one or two prayers. It is a slow process of improving yourself from within.


The Prophet (S.A.W.S) said: “Allah, the Exalted, will continue to stretch out His Hand in the night so that the sinners of the day may repent, and continue to stretch His Hand in the daytime so that the sinners of the night may repent, until the sun rises from the west (start of day of judgment)”. .

, The most suitable of the names could be : Al-’Afuww (He who pardons), and Al-Ghafoor (He who forgives), and Al-Ghaffaar (The Oft-Forgiving).


“And Allah has the most excellent and perfect names, so worship and invoke Him by them” (Al-A’raaf ,7:180)

, It is the most important time for any Muslim to show his devotion towards Allah. Moreover, it is considered as the 'month of forgiveness'. Delve deep into sincerity and devotion.


Read make the most of Ramadhan for more guidance.

, Focus on doing good deeds that Allah appreciates, and stay away from those which Allah prohibits.


Prophet (S.A.W.S) said: “The five daily prayers and one Jumu’ah to the next, and one Ramadan to the next Ramadan, is expiation for what lies between them as a long as one refrains from the major sins.” , Zakat is a nice way to wash away your sins, which will not only make you feel light, but will also make someone else's life better.

, This is the best way to gain forgiveness. It is said that, all your sins would be washed away when we go on a hajj for the first time.


Read how to perform hajj for more detailed instructions.

, It might be a bit tempting to 'break the law' at times, but remember that Allah the Most Merciful has promised to reward those who exercise patience and restrain from behaving in a negative manner.

,


Respond well to the the Azaan. The Prophet (S.A.W.S) said, “He who says upon hearing the person calling the Athaan, ‘I also bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah alone without a partner, and that Muhammad is His slave and messenger. I accept Allah as a Lord, Muhammad as a messenger, and Islam as a religion’ – all his previous sins will be forgiven.” (Sahih Muslim).
Saying 'Ameen'. The Prophet (S.A.W.S) said, “When the Imaam says ‘Ameen’, say ‘Ameen’, because he who coincides with the angels when saying Ameen will get all his previous sins forgiven.” (Al-Bukhaari & Muslim).
Being around people, or in a gathering of people mindful of Allah. It is very important to be away from bad company or any person who distracts you from the holy path of Islam.
Following the Islamic dress code will help you remember Allah and remind you of the need for full obedience.
Praying two ra'kaah of Salaah attentively can also aid your seeking of forgiveness.The Prophet (S.A.W.S) said, “He who performs ablution properly, then prays any two rak’aah (of salaah) without being heedless, will get all his previous sins forgiven.” (Ahmad).

, Many duas have already been mentioned in the above steps, but there are many more which will help you seek forgiveness.


“Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If Thou forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers.” (Al-A’raf; 7:23) and Allah forgave him.
“……. And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful.” (Al-Baqara, 2:37)
Recite Astaghfirullah constantly. Say it 3 times after every salat and minimum of 100 times a day, as reported. It means, "" I seek forgiveness from Allah"".
Recite ‘SubhanAllah wa bihamdihi' 100 times a day & all your sins will be forgiven even if they were as much as the foam of the sea "

You can also try sewing your own robe if you can work a sewing needle or sewing machine.Making a wizard robe is simple. Fold a square of fabric in half and cut a hole the size of your head in one corner. You can then cut out sleeves in the other two edges of the triangle and sew them up. Make sure you leave a lot of room in your sleeves.
If you're buying a robe, or using a bathrobe, look for one in wizard patterns or colors. Darker colors, like blues and purples, work well. You can also look for designs like stars and moons.;
, If your robe is not already decorated, consider doing a little decorating yourself. If you, say, buy an old robe from a thrift store, you may have to decorate it in a wizard-like pattern on your own.Try cutting out stars with cardboard paper or felt or buying star-shaped objects at a local craft store.
Use some craft glue to glue the stars on your robe. If your stars are made of felt or fabric, you can easily stitch them on.

, In addition to a robe, most wizards wear capes. It's easy to make your own cape at home. You can also buy a wizard cape at a local costume store.You should strive for a full length cape with pleated shoulders. You can buy capes like this at costume stores. If there's not a costume store near you, you can buy one online.
Pick a wizard like color for your cape. Dark blues and purples are associated with wizard attire. You can also get a cape decorated with things like stars and moons to give it a wizard look.
As with your robe, you can always add felt stars or moons to your cape.

, Wizard shoes vary, but they should have a serious look to them. Black or dark colored boots can make for great wizard shoes. You can also try wooden clogs, as this has an archaic look that will remind people of a wizard.You can stop by a local shoe or department store and browse their selection of shoes, keeping your eyes peeled for wizard-like shoes.
You can also buy shoes online. Be careful, however, as shoe sizes vary by types of shoes. Consult a sizing chart before settling on a shoe.

, Wizards are known for long, loose belts. Opt for a knit belt or one made of fabric over a leather or plastic variety. The belt goes around your waist and not your hips, pulling the robe slightly towards your body.Most department stores and clothing stores sell long, loose belts meant to wrap around your waist. Look for a color that compliments your wizard robes.
You can also buy a belt online. If you really want to solidify the wizard look, you can buy a wizard belt from an online costume store.

, Wizards are known for wearing long, pointed hats. Most conventional hat stores and department stores do not sell wizard hats. Luckily, you can easily find a hat at a local department store.If there isn't a costume shop near you, you can order a hat from a store online.
Opt for a somewhat floppy, pointed hat with a wide brim.
If your hat is not decorated the way you like, glue or stitch on stars.
Pick a hat in similar color to your wizard robes and cape.

, If you're going to a costume party dressed as a wizard, a mask may help. Many people think of wizards as old and wise. You can buy an old man or woman mask at most costume stores or online. This can really help solidify the wizard look.However, not all wizards are old. If you want to dress as a younger wizard, you should probably forget the mask.

, Wizards are known to carry wands. Most costume stores sell fake wands you can buy for a reasonable price. You can also find a wand at toy stores, especially if they sell products from franchises like Harry Potter. You can also make your own wand if you can't find a satisfactory one near you.Pipe cleaners can be used to make a wand. Simply You can twist together pipe cleaners until you have a sturdy, thick wand. Then, attach a shape made of construction paper to the end of the wand. Something like a star or an orb would work.It can help to decorate the star or orb in glitter. This will give it a glowing appearance.

, Many wizards carry staffs in addition to or instead of wands. If you want to solidify the wizard look, consider carrying a large stick or poll with you.You can buy fake staffs at costume stores or online.
You can also get a large, thick stick from outside. Make sure the stick is free of bugs and dirt before bringing it into your home.

, You can buy a spell book online or at a local costume store. If you're going to a party dressed as a wizard, carrying a spell book around can help. It will give you the mystical look of a wizard.

, If you want an older look, you can whiten your eyebrows with white makeup paint. This can really give you the old, wise wizard look.Use a regular glue stick to cover your brows in glue. Allow the glue to dry. From there, cover the brows in a light foundation.
Then, use a makeup brush to dust some light powder over your eyebrows. This will make them look faded, making you look older.

, Many wizards have a darker, sinister look to them. If you want a darker wizard look, opt for dark eye shadows. Go for black, gray, or brown eyeshadow to look like a dark, spooky wizard., If you have facial hair, you should lighten it. This can make it look like you have a graying beard, giving you the look of a wise old wizard.Use a makeup brush to paint over your beard in light white makeup paint.
Paint everywhere where facial hair is visible in order to create an old wizard look.

, If you want to change your hair for the costume, you can invest in a wig. Most costume shops sell wigs with light gray or white hair. You can also buy a wig online.


If you don't want to use a wig, try using temporary dye to make your hair gray or white.

When choosing and eating foods, always stick to foods that are Halal.;
, Allah has forbidden Muslims from eating anything made from pork or swine products as it is considered impure.Bacon, pork lard, certain gelatin, pork grease, and other pork or swine products should be avoided.


Allah says in the Quran, “He has forbidden you only of the Maytah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine…” The downsides of consuming pork have been scientifically proven. Pork and swine products have been known to help the spread of cancer, stomach ulcers, allergies, and scabies.Pork also contains the trichinosis worm when eating it undercooked or raw, which is known to lead to skin rashes or even paralysis.In serious cases, eating pork may be a necessity. If you're in an area with no food available besides pork, and you believe you're going to die of starvation, eating pork would be acceptable in this case, for your survival., Animals such as dogs, cats, frogs, donkeys, mules, and so on should be avoided, since they are targeted to be companions rather than food. While it is not outright Haram to eat them if they're pure and cleansed, it is encouraged not to consume them.Vicious animals such as tigers, crocodiles, lions, rhinos, etc. should also not be eaten as well. It's encouraged to eat animals that are herbivores, such as cattle, sheep, rabbits, goats, etc., According to the Islamic law, when slaughtering an animal, you should begin by mentioning Allah's name by saying Bismillah (بسم الله‎‎), which means 'In the name of Allah'.It is not permissible to eat the animal if it's been beaten, strangled, or savaged when slaughtered. Instead, Dhabiha should be performed to make the slaughtering easy on the animal and less stressful or painful.Most meats that are slaughtered this way will state on the package that they're Halal.


Dhabiha is performed by killing an animal using fast cuts to the throat using a razor-sharp blade. It should not be done around other animals to avoid frightening them. The animal being slaughtered should be healthy and fed well. Following this method keeps the meat pure and fresh and helps keep the animal from being stressed or scared during the process., Any type of meat (besides pork and swine) is permissible as long as they are slaughtered correctly. The meat must be clean from any blood or filth before being cooked or eaten. Animals found dead are not permissible to consume.An animal that was slaughtered by being beaten or gored is also not allowed to be eaten.

, Alcohol is forbidden in Islam and it has been mentioned clearly in the Quran to avoid it all costs. Keep away from adding it in any of your meals such as in meat, vegetables, certain desserts, and so forth.If a recipe requires alcohol, substitute it with non-alcoholic sparkling wine or leave it out of the recipe completely.


Allah says in the Quran, “O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansaab, and Al-Azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order so that you may be successful.” , Any meat used should be thoroughly cleaned, especially if it contained blood. Keep foods clean and pure by washing them thoroughly with water is necessary. When cleaning fruits and vegetables, scrub them well with a brush. This helps remove any filth or dirt off of the food., Having a healthy diet is encouraged in Islam.Eat a variety of foods that are nutritious and good for your health. Examples include:



Grains. Grains are foods made from rice, oats, wheat, cornmeal, and other different types of cereal grains. Foods such as pasta, rice, bread, tortillas, oatmeal, and grits are good options of food that are made of grains. It is highly encouraged to eat whole grains, as they contain more fiber and vitamins.Fruits and vegetables. Strive to eat as many fruits and vegetables as possible. Pick a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to get plenty of different nutrients and health effects, such as lowering blood pressure, reducing the risks of certain diseases, and helping other parts of your body.Dairy products. Dairy products are made out of milk and provide plenty of calcium for your body. Some examples of dairy products include cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese, cream cheese, butter, and milk itself.Meats and poultry products. Besides pork and swine, plenty of meat and poultry products are great for the body and include protein, iron, vitamin B, and magnesium. Meats such as turkey, chicken, sausage, and beef are great choices for meals.Seafood. Allah says in the Quran, ""Lawful to you is from the sea and its food as provision for you and the travelers..."" Seafood such as fish, shrimp, crab, and lobster contain minerals and vitamins, and can also prevent strokes and heart diseases., Any types of beverages are okay to drink as long as it is not alcoholic or contains any alcoholic products. Beverages such as soda, lemonade, fruit juice, tea, coffee, smoothies, and milk are all acceptable drinks to enjoy. However, drinks like vodka, beer, wine, liquor, cocktails, and other alcoholic drinks are not permissible to drink.It is narrated in al-Bukhaari (5147) and Muslim (3736) from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Umar that the Messenger of Allaah (SAW) said: “Whoever drinks wine in this world and does not repent from that, he will be deprived of it in the Hereafter.”, Desserts such as cakes, chocolates, ice cream, and other sweet treats can all be eaten as long as they do not include any type of pork gelatin or alcoholic products., Before beginning to eat, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water. This not only has many health benefits to avoid germs from entering your food, but is also Sunnah by keeping clean. , Be aware of what you're eating before you take a bite. If you're not sure what the meal is, ask the cook or host about it. This can help you be aware of the food options so that you don't end up eating a food you dislike and offend the cook or host.Al-Bukhaari narrated from Khaalid ibn al-Waleed that he and the Messenger of Allaah (SAW) entered upon Maymoonah and found that she had some roasted lizard that her sister Hafeedah bint al-Haarith had brought from Najd. She offered the lizard to the Messenger of Allah (SAW), but he would barely stretch forth his hand to food until he had been told what it was. The Messenger of Allah (SAW) stretched forth his hand, then one of the women who were present said, “Tell the Messenger of Allah (SAW) that what has been offered to him is a lizard.” The Messenger of Allah (SAW) withdrew his hand from the lizard, and Khaalid ibn al-Waleed asked, “Is lizard Haram, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “No, but it is not found in the land of my people and I feel that I would have no liking for it."", It is Wajib (mandatory) to mention Allah's name before you put anything in your mouth. Mention Allah's name by saying Bismillah (بسم الله‎‎), which means ""In the name of Allah"" before eating. You may also want to recite the Dua or prayer before eating as well, but it is not obligatory and only Sunnah.


The most common Dua said before eating is ""Allahomma barik lana fima razaqtana waqina athaban-nar. Bismillah"", meaning ""Oh Allah! Bless the food You have provided us and save us from the punishment of the hell fire. In the name of Allah.""It was narrated from Umm Kalthoom from ‘Aa’ishah that the Messenger of Allaah (SAW) said: “When any one of you eats, let him mention the name of Allah. If he forgets to mention the name of Allah at the beginning, then let him say ‘Bismillahi awwalahu wa aakhirahu (In the name of Allah at the beginning and at the end).’”, In Islam, most daily tasks are done with the right hand. Shaytan (Satan) eats with his left hand, so all Muslims are required to eat food with their right hand to differ from him, and to honor the right hand over the left.In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that ‘Umar ibn Salamah said that The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: “O young boy, say the name of Allah and eat with your right hand, and eat from what is nearest to you.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5376) and Muslim (2022).In Sunan Abi Dawood (33), it is narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: The right hand of the Messenger of Allah (SAW) was for his purification and food, and his left hand was for using the toilet and anything that was dirty. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.A reason for not eating with your right hand is injury or sickness. If, for example, you end up spraining your right hand and it's easiest to eat with your left, this is an acceptable reason to use your left hand., Avoid reaching out to get food from the middle of the plate or food that is from other people's plates. It is Sunnah and better manners to eat what is directly in front of your plate. The Prophet (SAW) said to Umar ibn Abi Salamah, “O young boy, say Bismillaah, eat with your right hand, and eat from what is directly in front of you.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3576; Muslim, 2022), When eating finger food or using an utensil, it is Sunnah to eat using only three fingers. Eating with more than three is considered a sign of greed, and using only three fingers is the normal and common amount of fingers to use while eating a meal.Ka'b bin Maalik narrated that he saw the prophet Muhammad (SAW) licking his three fingers (after having finished the food). (Sahih Muslim Hadith 5039), Avoid laying down or reclining as you eat. Not only does this have potentially dangerous health effects such as choking, heartburn, and GERD,but it's also discouraged in Islam. It was narrated that the Prophet (SAW) said: “I do not eat whilst I am reclining.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5399)In some cases, eating while laying down is acceptable. For example, if you have a high fever and can't get out of bed but need to eat, eating while laying down in bed would be okay to do in this case for your well-being.

, If you mistakenly drop food on the ground while eating, pick it up immediately and blow it off to remove any dirt. Anas ibn Malik narrated that that the Prophet (SAW) said, ""If any one of you drops a piece of food, let him remove any dirt from it and eat it, and not leave it for the Shaytaan."" (Narrated by Muslim, 2034).If you happen to drop food and don't notice it until you're done eating, do not eat it. The food should be thrown away as it contains dirt and bacteria from the long timing on the ground.

, It is Sunnah to eat with a group, such as with your family. Eating together allows you to bond together and brings you together as you talk and communicate with each other. It's also a blessing to eat together and brings barakah (closeness of Allah) to the family.Wahshi bin Harb reported: Some of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: “We eat but are not satisfied.” He (SAW) said, “”Perhaps you eat separately.” The Companions replied in the affirmative. He then said: “Eat together and mention the Name of Allah over your food. It will be blessed for you.” ., If, by the time you set the table and everyone is ready to eat, the Athan (call of prayer) goes off, eat first. This is especially important if you're hungry and your mind is on food. If you're stomach is growling during Salah and you're thinking only about food, your concentration is not on the prayer. That's why it's highly encouraged to eat before the prayer.The scholars of Islam have stated that, ""Beginning by eating food (when Salah is present), is allowed at a time when a person is extremely hungry and he wishes to eat, but there is sufficient time for Salah. If this is not the case, then he must begin with Salah since this was the practice of the Prophet (SAW)"". (Umdatul Qari –Commentary of Sahih Al Bukhari)., After you finish eating, it is encouraged to praise Allah by saying Alhamdulillah (الحمد لله), which means 'Praise be to Allah'. The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: ""Allah will be pleased with His slave who praises Him (i.e., says Alhamdulillah) when he eats and praises Him and when he drinks.""You can also say the Dua when you're finished with your meal. The most common Dua to say after you're done is Alhamdulillah il-lathi at'amana wasaqona waja'alana Muslimeen. (Praise be to Allah Who has fed us and given us drink, and made us Muslims). , After you're done eating, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water. Clear the table and help clean up, if necessary. This is proper Islamic manners, especially if you're eating at someone else's house.

, While it's okay not to like every food, it's discouraged to criticize food on the dinner table. If you don't like the food you are given, kindly refuse it and say you don't want it. You don't need to outright say you hate it. This is the Sunnah of the Prophet (SAW).Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (SAW) never criticized any food. If he liked it he would eat it, and if he did not like it he would leave it. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3370; Muslim, 2046), Avoid eating until you're full, as this is not proper etiquette in Islam and is also unhealthy.Eat until you are no longer hungry, which is enough to help you last till your next meal.


Al-Hassan Al-Basri said: ""O, son of Adam, eat with one third of your stomach and drink with one third and leave one third of your stomach to breathe so that you may think ."", Hudhayfah B. al-Yamân relates that Allah’s Messenger (SAW) said: “Do not drink from gold and silver vessels and do not eat from gold and silver dishes, because indeed they are for them in this world and for you in the Hereafter.”Eat from normal plates and cups that are made from plastic, glass, or paper, instead.

, Avoid rushing when you eating and shoving as much as food as possible in your mouth. Take your time to chew and swallow as you enjoy your meal. Not only is eating too fast a health risk and choking hazard, it's not proper etiquette.

, Follow basic table manners when eating, such as not chewing with your mouth open, not eating too loudly, and not talking when you're eating. If you're eating with a group, be sure to let everyone have a turn to speak. Simple words such as ""Please"", ""Thank you"" and ""Excuse me"" go a long way as well and are a good example of table manners.


When eating with a group or with your family, avoid having a heated discussion that may lead to an argument. The dinner table should be calm and pleasant as you eat; it doesn't need to be a war zone with fights and debates.

, If your food is too hot to eat, wait patiently until it is cool. It is not permissible to blow on it to cool it off because Ibn Abbaas said: ""The Prophet (SAW) forbade blowing onto food and drink.” Let the food cool off until it's at a comfortable temperature to eat.

, Food should not be wasted in Islam and it is not permissible to throw it out in the trash. In Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (22/341) it was said: ""Leftover food must be saved for the next time or it should be given to the needy; if there are no needy people, then it should be given to animals, even after it has dried out, for the one who is able to do that.""


Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan said: ""It is not permissible to throw any food into dirty places or impure places such as washrooms, because that is a waste mistreatment of the blessing and a lack of gratitude to Allah."", It's Sunnah to share and serve your food with your family, friends, guests, and to others who are hungry and need it such as those who are poor. This small action of sharing brings a lot of blessing and Hasanat (rewards)."

This deity is called Mawu among the tribes of Benin and Bondye or Bon Dieu in the Americas.However, unlike the Christian God, the supreme deity of voodoo is seen solely as a transcendent figure who does not interact with his worshippers except through his intermediaries, the spirits (voduns).


This supreme being is addressed by other names, according to the aspect of his godhood that is being addressed. As the creator, Mawu/Bon Dieu is also known as Dada Sêgbo. As the embodiment of life, Mawu/Bon Dieu is also known as Gbêdoto. As a divine being, Mawu/Bon Dieu is also known as Sêmêdo.
Other sources use the name “Mawu” as the name for the moon, which, along with the sun (Lisa), are twin children of the creator god, who in this instance is named Nana Baluku.;
, Voodoo is a religion of dualities, with forces representing happiness and sadness, good and evil. Accordingly, there are two forms of voodoo magic, ‘‘rada’’ and ‘‘petro.’’


‘’Rada’’ is good, or white, magic. This form of voodoo is practiced by a ‘’houngan’’ (priest/voodoo king) or ‘’mambo’’ (priestess/voodoo queen). ‘’Rada’’ magic is primarily devoted to herbal or faith healing, but also includes dream divination, and foretelling the future. It is the predominant form of voodoo.‘’Petro’’ or ‘’congo’’ is evil, or black (or more correctly, red) magic.This form of voodoo is practiced by a ‘’bokor’’ (sorcerer/witch doctor). ‘’Petro’’ magic is the magic involved in orgies, death curses, and zombie creation. ‘’Petro’’ is actually practiced far less than ‘’rada,’’ but is the form of voodoo Hollywood movies usually present., The loa, also spelled ‘’lwa,’’ are the spirits. Some loa are the offspring of Mawu/Bon Dieu, while others are the spirits of the worshippers’ late ancestors. Good loa are roughly equivalent to archangels or saints (and may be worshipped using the figures of the Christian saints they most closely approximate), while evil loa are roughly equivalent to devils or demons. Some of the key loa are given below; some are more important in African vodun, while others are more important in Haitian and New Orleans voodoo:


Sakpata is Mawu/Bon Dieu’s oldest son, the ‘’ayi vodun’’ or spirit of the earth. Sakpata is the master of all diseases, with sons representing such diseases as leprosy, boils, and sores.Xêvioso (Xêbioso) is Mawu/Bon Dieu’s second son, the ‘’jivodun’’ or spirit of the sky and of justice. Xêvioso manifests himself in fire and lightning and may also be symbolized by the ram and the double axe.Agbe (Agwe, Hu) is Mawu/Bon Dieu’s third son, the “tovodun” or spirit of the sea. Agbe is revered as a source of life and represented by a serpent.(The serpent is also known as Damballah/Dumballah and Le Grand Zombi, which may or may not be other names for Agbe.)Gu (Ogu, Ogou, Ogoun) is Mawu/Bon Dieu’s fourth son, the spirit of war, iron, and technology. He is the scourge of evil and evildoers.Agê is Mawu/Bon Dieu’s fifth son, the spirit of forestry and agriculture who rules over land animals.Jo is Mawu/Bon Dieu’s sixth son, the spirit of the air. Jo is invisible. Lêgba is Mawu/Bon Dieu’s seventh son, the spirit of the unpredictable nature of life, home, travel, the crossroads,and, to many, the gatekeeper between the worlds of life and death, much like the popular image of St. Peter.His ‘’petro’’ counterpart is Kalfu. Lêgba is often depicted as an old man, although some versions depict him as young.Gede (Ghédé) is the spirit of sex, death, and healing, often depicted as a clown-like skeletal figure wearing a top hat and sunglasses.He may or may not be identical with Legba.
Erzulie (Ezili, Aida Wedo/Ayida Wedo) is the spirit of love, beauty, the earth, and the rainbow. She has the ability to divine the future from dreams and is noted for having a caring, genteel personality. She is identified with the Virgin Mary.Certain loa names are used as family names by groups of loa. Among these are Erzulie/Ezili, Ghede, and Ogou., Voodoo’s roots include the worship of ancestors, whether those who immediately preceded the living, or the founders of the clan (the Toxwyo) the living belong to.Voodoo practitioners believe that everyone actually has two souls. The greater soul, the ‘’gros-bon-ange’’ (great angel), departs the body immediately at death to present its case before Mawu/Bon Dieu)before it goes to Ginen, the “island beneath the ocean.”A year and a day after the ‘’gros-bon-ange’’ has departed, the person’s descendants may recall it and place it in a ‘’govi’’, a small clay bottle, by the ritual sacrifice of an ox or equally precious animal.(The Congolese word for the ‘’gros-bon-ange’’, ‘’nbzambi’’, is the origin of the word “zombie.”)
The lesser soul, the ‘’ti-bon-ange’’ (little angel),is roughly equivalent to the conscience and is believed to remain with the body for up to three days after death. During this time, a ‘’bokor’’ can supposedly convince the ‘’ti-bon-ange’’ that the body is not dead and use it to animate the body as a zombie.

, Voodoo temples, known as ‘’hounfors’’ or peristyles, are built around a center pole called a ‘’poto mitan’’. They may include a rough roof, but are otherwise outdoor settings., Both the ‘’houngan’’ or ‘’mambo’’ who lead the service and the congregation take full part in a voodoo service. Most of the worship is in the form of chanting and dancing to the beat of drums under the direction of a ‘’houganikon’’ with the assistance of white-garbed women called ‘’hounsi.’’During the service, the ‘’houngan’’ or ‘’mambo’’ may shake a beaded rattle called an ‘’ason’’ (‘’asson’’) made from a calabash or ring a handheld bell called a clochette.The service may run for several hours, as each of the loa is honored with its own song, starting with the good loa and ending with the dark loa., As noted above, the snake is the symbol of the loa known as Damballah/Dumballah, Agbe, or Le Grand Zombi.The serpent is identified with creation, wisdom, and the intellect, and is seen by some practitioners as a protector of the young, the helpless, the deformed, and the handicapped. Some even equate the serpent loa with that of Legba or Ghede as a gatekeeper to the afterlife.A ‘’houngan’’ or ‘’mambo’’ possessed by the serpent loa will usually hiss rather than speak. , During a service, one or more worshippers may become possessed (mounted) by loa. Usually, those possessed are the more dedicated practitioners, known as ‘’serviteurs’’, who fall to the ground. While channeling a loa, the worshipper is identified by the name and gender of that loa, not by his or her own name and gender.


After the loa departs the body of the serviteur, the serviteur may undergo a ritual head-washing (‘’lave tet’’) if it was the first time he or she had been mounted.If an evil loa possesses someone, it can be identified by turning the serviteur’s eyes red., In voodoo, animal sacrifice serves two purposes:


During the service, the life force released when the animal is sacrificed recharges the loa to enable them to continue their service to Mawu/Bon Dieu.After the service, the sacrificed animal provides food for a communal meal, which helps to bond the worshippers to one another.Not all voodoo practitioners practice animal sacrifice. Many American voodoo practitioners instead choose to offer their loa store-bought food; some are even vegetarians."

Study the Qur'ran.,
Strengthen your faith.,

Take a class.,
Treat Muslims with respect.",How to Accept Islam," An Imam is a Muslim religious scholar. They lead prayers in mosques, and they study the Qur'ran. You can talk to them about accepting Islam, and ask any questions you have about being a Muslim. Find a mosque in your neighborhood and ask to speak to someone there, or ask a Muslim friend to introduce you to an Imam.


Ask about anything you are curious or doubtful about.
If you are interested, ask to be referred to Muslim people with whom you have other things in common. You might benefit from speaking to Muslims of your age, gender, or cultural background.;
, If your research and your conversations have made you certain you understand what it means to be Muslim, you may be ready to recite the Shahada and officially become one. However, you must first be certain that you believe in Allah and the word of the Qur'ran. Spend time alone with the question until you have a strong feeling of certainty:


Ask yourself: Do I believe there is no God but Allah?
Pray, asking any questions you are left with.
Take a long walk.
If you feel certain you believe, make your testimony of faith as soon as you can.
If you are left with doubts, take your time. Do further research, and explore other approaches to spirituality. You may find yourself moved to make Shahada later.

, Ghusl is a ritual purification Muslims undergo before prayer. To perform Ghusl, take a shower or use any source of fresh water. Wash your genitals first, then your whole body. The exact way you perform Ghusl will depend on whether you are following Sunni or a Shia tradition, so consult with the Imam you have been in touch with.There are different schools of thought as to when a new convert must perform Ghusl. Some believe it should happen before you recite the Shahada, others say after. Some say it doesn't matter, while others say it is only necessary if you are in a state of impurity from sexual contact.
To determine what is correct in your case, talk to your Imam.

, To become a Muslim, you must make a testimony of faith. Once you have said the Shahada you are committed to Islam for life. You may say the Shahada alone, as it is a testimony to Allah who sees all things. However, to be recognized by other Muslims, it is wise to say it in front of witnesses, preferably including an Imam from the mosque you wish to join.The words of the Shahada are ""La ilaha illallah, Muhammad rasulullah,"" which means ""There is no true god but Allah, and Muhammad is His prophet.""
In this way, you pledge yourself to serve Allah and to follow the teachings of the Qur'ran.
You are pledging to worship the Creator, and not His creation. Neither other faiths nor worship of earthly things must interfere with your love of Allah.
You must understand the Shahada and mean it sincerely in order for it to be binding.
Pronounce the words correctly. You may choose to repeat after another Muslim, or you may find a recording here: http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/204/how-to-convert-to-islam-and-become-muslim/


, It is not required that you take another name upon accepting Islam, but it is an option. You may simply take on your new name in addition to your given name, or change your name to your Muslim name. Keep your surname as it is, or change it to ""bin"" (if you are male) or ""bint"" (if you are female) followed by the name of your father.That is, if your father is Richard Archer, you might change your name to ""Fatemah bint Archer"" or ""Fatemah bint Richard Archer.""
If your pre-conversion name is that of a tyrant or that bespeaks worship of another deity, strongly consider changing your name.

, Some males who are not circumcised become so after accepting Islam. Take your time making this decision, and consult an Imam and other Muslims you trust if you are having doubts., Pray at dawn, after it strikes noon, in the mid-afternoon, at sunset, and at night. The exact times will depend on the season, as worship is timed to the sun rather than a clock.


Pray at your mosque if you can.

, Ramadan is a holy month. Observe it by praying, fasting, and performing acts of charity. So long as you are physically able, you are required to fast during Ramadan.


Exceptions are made for children, the ill, and people who are menstruating or experiencing postpartum bleeding.

, As a Muslim, you are required by the Qur'ran to donate 2.5% of your earnings to the poor. This is called Zakat. If you are well-off, consider donating a higher percentage of your income.


Choose your charity wisely. Make sure it is handled well, so that it directly benefits the poor.

, If you are physically and financially able, you must travel to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia at least once in your lifetime. Prepare spiritually before making this trip, as it is a momentous occasion.


Go during the period of Hajj, between the 8th to the 12th of Dhu al-Hijjah. This is the final month of the Islamic calendar, and changes yearly based on the moon.

, Read the Qur'ran every day for a few minutes at least. You may read by yourself or with other Muslims. Consider taking a class on Islamic scripture at a mosque or an Islamic Center., Live with the intention of glorifying Allah in all your actions. Seek to uphold the faith of your fellow Muslims. Contribute to your community's efforts at fard al-kifaya, and contribute to charity efforts. Get involved at your local Islamic Center, mosque, or Muslim Student Group if you are a student.


Assert your identity by dressing with modesty, order, and elegance.

, If you are struggling with negative feelings towards Islam, this may be because it is depicted as an inherently violent religion by non-Muslims. In fact, Islam is as much about peace as any other Abrahamic religion.Muslims disapprove of violence. They do not consider violent jihadists ""extremists,"" but rather ""deviants"" from Islam, which preaches peace and kindness.
Right-wing extremists, white supremacists in particular, have killed more people in the United States than have Muslims.
Recognize that most mass shootings in the United States are by white Christian men., Look for mosques and Islamic centers in your area that offer classes on Islam for non-Muslims. Consider joining an inter-faith meetup group. Learn about the religion and get to know real Muslims. You will be able to ask questions and get answers in a non-judgmental classroom environment.If there is no class available in your area, consider taking a free class online, such as: https://www.mooc-list.com/course/islam-through-its-scriptures-edx


, Treat Muslim people with the respect and warmth you would extend to anyone. Never make jokes about someone's religion, clothing, or attitude of prayer. Do not blame a Muslim person for the acts of another Muslim, and never assume that one member of a religion holds the exact same beliefs as another.


If you are friends with Muslim people, consider asking if they would be willing to sit down and chat about your respective religions some time.
Some people might feel invaded if you ask them questions about their personal faith. Only discuss religion with someone you know well, and who says they are happy to talk with you.

Start fasting in Ramadan.,
Pay Zakaat if you are self sufficient.,
Perform Hajj:Pilgrimage to Mecca: Every able Muslim must perform once in their lifetime.",How to Act According to the Five Pillars of Islam," It is remarkable how much a simple recitation of the shahadah can help prepare you for the challenges of life. A reminder that Allah is Almighty, All-Powerful can be very encouraging and comforting.
Watch out for shirk. Shirk is the sin of associating partners with Allah and the only unpardonable sin in Islam. There are many categories and sub-categories of shirk including Polytheism . Watch out for them.


Shirk in Lordship is of two types. Shirk by association and shirk by negation. Shirk by association comes from believing anyone other than Allah to be God. Keep in mind, that people who say that intercession for forgiveness through Prophets or Sufi's is shirk are mistaken. An innocent child who died during childbirth, Hafiz (people who memorized the Qur'an), and martyrs all will intercede for their close ones. The most powerful person to intercede would be the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Qur'an mentions in various places (19:87, 20:109, 21:28, 39:44, 43:86, 53:26) that God gives power of intercession only to those who's words please Allah, in general. Shirk by negation comes from denying the existence of God either explicitly or implicitly. That is, in some cases God's non-existence is stated (Atheism), while in other cases His existence is claimed, but the way in which He is conceived actually denies His existence (e.g. Pantheism)

Shirk in attributes is, again, of two types. Humanization is the act of attributing human or animal attributes to God, while Deitification is the act of giving Allah's attributes to his creation, or claiming them. The former happens when God is portrayed like one of his creations (usually a human being), for example in paintings and idols, or he is said to possess human attributes like reproduction or the need of bodily organs etc. Deitification occurs when a creation is said to have, or claims to have, Allah's attributes, for example during the era of Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) there was a man in a region of Arabia called Yamamah, who claimed to be a prophet and took the name Ar-Rahman which, in Islam, belongs only to God.

Shirk in worship arises from worship directed towards someone other than God, or from seeking reward from the Creation rather than the created. This includes worshiping someone else besides Allah. Beautifying or prolonging prayer/fast prayers because someone else is watching is also shirk and comes under this category.

;
, Prayer, or Salaat is an obligation on all Muslims. Remember that missing prayer is excused only under certain special circumstances and is otherwise unacceptable.


Salat consists of five daily prayers according to the Sunna; the names are according to the prayer times:

Fajr (dawn)
Dhuhr (noon)
Asr (afternoon)
Maghrib (evening)
Isha' (night).


The Fajr prayer is performed before sunrise,Dhuhr is performed in the midday after the sun has surpassed its highest point,Asr is the evening prayer before sunset,Maghrib is the evening prayer after sunset and Isha is the night prayer.
All of these prayers are performed while facing in the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca and forms an important aspect of the Muslim Ummah.
Muslims must perform Wudu (""purification"") before praying.

, Sawm is the Arabic word for fasting, and becomes obligatory on every Muslim after puberty. Of course, as different people experience puberty at different ages, it becomes obligatory at a different time for everybody. You can leave a fast if you are travelling, sick such that you need medication or those with a medical condition such as diabetes, elderly people, and pregnant or breastfeeding women or that a lack of food will worsen your condition, or, if you are a woman, while menstruating. Diabetics using insulin might be able to fast provided that insulin timing is calculated carefully. You can make it up later by fasting when Ramadan is over.


Fasting starts at Fajr. The Fajr adhaan signals the start of the day's fast. It is preferable to eat a small meal before Fajr. Eating a few dates and drinking water provides enough energy for the day and this depends upon the body of the individual.
During the day, you are to abstain from eating food, drinking water, using foul language, and engaging in sexual activity. If you eat or drink by mistake i.e. you had forgotten that you are fasting, your fast is not broken. In case that happens, throw out whatever is in your mouth and rinse your mouth with water, and continue fasting as usual. If you break a fast intentionally by drinking, eating, or having sex, you either fast for 60 consecutive days, feed and cloth 60 needy people, 'or' free a wrongfully accused Muslim, and there are many nowadays.
You ""open/finish/end"" your fasting at the time of the Maghreb prayer. This time is signaled by the Maghreb azaan. Most Muslims would eat a few dates and drink some water, following the sunnah of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him), and follow it with a meal after the Maghreb prayers.

, Muslims with earnings above the nisab are considered to be self-sufficient. 2.5% of your earnings are to be paid annually to poor people, freed prisoners, those heavily indebted, or new converts to Islam, in certain cases. It is also good to use Zakaat to help out needy family members first. However, Zakaat can not be paid to some family members i.e the wife, children, parents, and grandparents, because their financial needs are already your responsibility. Please seek help from a religious expert for details on nisaab and zakaat to be paid on gold and silver (e.g. jewelry) and land e.t.c. Zakaat is paid on the money that you have had for a whole year and also returns earned during the year which is also considered as earnings.An amount can be free of Zakat only if the Zakaaath has been paid for it in previous years and no returns were received from it after the Zakat payment while it exceeds Nisab level .


There are 5 principles that should be followed when giving the zakāt:

The giver must declare to God his intention to give the zakāt.
The zakāt must be paid on the day that it is due.
After the offering, the payer must not exaggerate on spending his money more than usual means.
Payment must be in kind. This means if one is wealthy then he or she needs to pay 2.5% of their income. If a person does not have much money, then they should compensate for it in different ways, such as good deeds and good behavior toward others.
The zakāt must be distributed in the community from which it was taken



, Able is defined in terms of finances as well as physical health, so it is advisable to perform the Hajj when young, if able to.


Occurs during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah
Both men and women are required to make the pilgrimage to Mecca
After a Muslim makes the trip to Mecca, he/she is known as a hajj/hajja
The pilgrim, or the haji, is honoured in the Muslim community
The Hajj should be an expression of devotion to God, not a means to gain social standing
The believer should be self-aware and examine their intentions in performing the pilgrimage.
This should lead to constant striving for self-improvement.
A pilgrimage made at any time other than the Hajj season is called an Umrah(not mandatory) is strongly recommended

Becoming a witch is a personal journey that involves research, patience, study, and more research (seriously, for many witches, it's 20% spell casting, 80% taking notes). Depending on your interests, different schools of thought and traditions may be more appropriate or interesting. Some common styles of witchcraft include:


Wicca and “green” witchcrafts are popular in the United States, often revolving around Gaia-study and nature-based spells and meditation. The earliest Wiccans were followers of Gerald Gardner, a British magic scholar in the 20th century, whose ideas and works were popularized in the 1950s and 1960s. If you've got an interest in crystals, the use of herbs, rituals, and essential oils, this might be right for you.Neo-paganism and Druidism, or other ancestral witches are interested in history and tradition, specifically practicing in accordance with the seasons and with rituals. If you want to get back to the source of ""traditional"" witchcraft, these styles might be right for you.
Regional and esoteric witchcrafts, like Santeria, Stregheria, Fari, Pharmakos, and other cultural witchcrafts are also common, depending on where you live and your culture's traditions. If you've got a strong connection to place, research the local practices where you live.
Keep in mind that some religions/practices are closed. "" A culture or religion is considered “closed” if you are required to be born or formally initiated into it into order to be considered a part of that community or faith and to have the right to participate in their spiritual practices. Easy examples of this include Hinduism and the various Native American religions and cultures. Wicca, in its traditional form, is considered closed, due to the fact that is it a mystery religion and formal initiation into a coven is required. (Neo-Wicca, on the other hand, is an offshoot that is much more open and accommodates solitary and uninitiated practitioners who follow Wiccan principles and practices.) The best way to know if a culture is closed is to ask someone who is part of the culture. Generally, as with so many other things in life, it is best to ask permission before picking up something that seems exotic or mystical.
Secular Witchcraft, which is unaffiliated with any religion, philosophy, belief system, etc. Any person from any religion (or lack thereof) can practice secular witchcraft.

Witchcraft is for everyone. No one is prohibited from practicing witchcraft. Some people want to act as gatekeepers, but the truth is that other people don't get a say in your personal beliefs and practices, no matter what they say. There are Atheist witches, Christian witches, Jewish witches, Luciferian witches, Wiccan witches, agnostic witches, etc. The only person who can decide what works for you is you.;
, One thing the novice witch will quickly learn is that every adept practices differently. There’s no “bible” of witchcraft, no central guiding list of principles or rules for witches.Anything that claims to be is false. Your practice will be your own practice, no one else’s, so it’s important to take “expert” advice with a grain of salt. You can read some classics, but it should all go toward your own personal understanding of the arts and your own practice. Some classic authors and readings include:


Aleister Crowley
Colin Wilson's The Occult: A History


Malleus Mallificarum, an ancient text on witchcraft
Montague Summers’ Witchcraft and Demonology

Check out Wiccan writings by Gerald Gardner, Doreen Valiente and Scott Cunningham.
Nigel Jackson, Nigel Pennick, Carlo Ginzburg, Robin Artisson, Gemma Gary, Andrew Chumbley, have written widely of traditional witchcraft. (Be aware that many books and/or authors are coming from a Wiccan/neo-pagan viewpoint. There is nothing wrong with this, but if you are looking for information on, for example, secular witchcraft- that is to say, witchcraft that is not associated with any religion, philosophy, belief system, etc., then books on Wiccan witchcraft won't be as helpful).
Some authors are known to be, at best, problematic and mistaken, and at worst, willfully ignorant and deliberately misinformative. These authors often include historical inaccuracies (ranging from misunderstandings/misconceptions to outright lies), biased views on various subjects, and rampant cultural appropriation. Some authors to be wary of are: Silver RavenWolf, Raymond Buckland, Laurie Cabot, Margaret Murray, Edain McCoy, and D.J. Conway. If you do decide to read their works, be sure to fact-check anything and everything. These books can be useful, absolutely, but do your own independent research, and don't take anyone's word as gospel, no matter how popular they are.
Also keep in mind that some authors, while their works are incredibly useful, have been dead for a while, and so their information is likely to be a little outdated. Scott Cunningham is a good example of this. His books can be very helpful and informative, but remember to round out your reading with other sources.

, It can't be overstated: being a witch is a personal journey. There's no one way to go about doing it. This makes it important to learn what you can, take what you must, and write your own goals and your own path for yourself. It might be helpful to do some journaling, keeping a record of what it is you hope to explore, and what you hope to discover. A few guiding questions can be helping in getting started, but it's up to you to find the answers.


What do you want from witchcraft?
What types of spells and incantations do you hope to perform?
What do you hope to learn about being a witch?
How to do you hope that witchcraft can improve or change your life?

, Be wary of for-pay tutorials and online schemes. Developing a practice of witchcraft isn’t something that can be communicated in 25 easy steps for only $39.95 from Hot Topic. Witchcraft isn’t about following a pre-written list of rules and going from A to B to C in the proper order. It’s a personal journey of discovery that is different for everyone.


What it means to ""be a witch"" and to ""practice witchcraft"" will change drastically when you talk to different practitioners of magic. Try to take things with a grain of salt. If other witches don't want to help you learn, or disagree with a particular practice or reading that you find power in, talk to other witches. Find a group of like-minded practitioners and ignore the dissenters.

, To get started casting spells and practicing witchcraft, it's a good idea to get the basic tools. No, broomsticks and pointy hats are not necessary. Each witch will require different tools for performing particular spells, but the basics are more or less universal, though it should be stated that none of these items are required in order for you to be a witch.



Select a wand. Wands are often selected for their personal connection to the witch. It's a simple matter of finding and charging a stick, but it's also much more than that. Spend a lot of time wandering the woods to find a short stick that works for you, that you feel some connection with. You'll know it when you find it. Don't feel like you aren't a ""real"" witch, though, if you don't use a wand or any other tool that another witch uses. Your practice is yours alone and no one else can tell you what works for you.
Mortar and pestles are important objects for spell casting. Used to mix herbs and other ingredients into a heady potion, a mortar and pestle are available at any housewares store, and in most kitchens.
Herbs. Witch hazel, mugwort, sage, lavender, and many other herbs are commonly used in witchcraft. Scott Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs is an essential guide for the novice witch. You can learn about the powers and the uses of many different common herbs and how to use them.
Mineral spirit and salt. Used in cleansing and keeping your spell castings safe, mineral spirits and salts are common barriers against the world of the spirits. You can help to protect yourself by charging your tools with all-natural mineral spirits and circling yourself in salt.

, Wands, crystals, and other implements involved in heavy psychic incantations need to be cleansed thoroughly before and after spell castings. A good witch is in tune with her tools and keeps them charged and free of negative psychic energy. Use the traditions and techniques of your practice to charge and cleanse your tools.


Different traditions will offer different techniques for accomplishing this, but in general, many witches use lunar energy to charge or cleanse wands, letting the stone absorb the energy of the moon by sitting out in the moonlight overnight. Wiping your wand down with mineral spirits is also a common practice to cleanse and clear out any bad psychic energy.

, Spells and circles don’t need to be cast in the middle of a dark wood at midnight, and magick rituals can be performed just as effectively in the comfort of your bedroom. Choose a safe space where you’ll be comfortable and undisturbed. Select a place where you can remain uninterrupted for as long as it will take to complete the ritual.


Meditate for several minutes, according to your practice. Offer a prayer of protection, requesting that evil spirits and negative energy stay away, and invite positivity and light into your circle. Meditate on the task to come.
Light candles and prepare other objects that will be necessary for the ritual that you're going to perform. If other people are around to perform the ritual with you, gather together, hold hands, and complete the cleansing prayers together. Join as one.

, Different traditions use different objects and methods for casting a circle, but it's not important whether you want to use candles, stones, chalk lines or sticks to create your spell-casting circle, what matters is intent. The circle is a physical or psychic barrier in your safe space, that will allow you to channel the deities, powers, and energies necessary to do your work.


In many traditions, a circle must contain candles at each of the four cardinal directions–North, South, East, and West. It's also a good idea to keep a representative of each element in the circle with you. A handful of earth, a glass of water, the fire of a candle, and other elements should all be present.

, Welcome the elements and the deities you’re invoking and state the Purpose of the ritual aloud. Specific invocations or prayers should be recited, and spells should be cast at this time. A comprehensive online database of spells can be found here.Raise and release the energy you're invoking. The purpose of a spell is to make your circle a conduit, through which you contact the unseen world of energies and spirits. When you connect with those energies, you've got to contact them safely and detach yourself from them safely as well.

, Thank the Deities (if present) for gracing you with their presence. Thank the elements for aiding you and supporting you in your spell. Close or open the circle, depending on your tradition.


Wiccans practice what is called the Law of Three: ""Evermind the Rule of Three, What Ye Sends Out Comes Back to Thee."" The law of three states that anything you do comes back to you threefold. So please, be wise, and think about your actions and how they affect others. Keep in mind, though, that not all witches are Wiccan, and non-Wiccan witches are not required to believe in or follow Wiccan guidelines. Do not bash or bully anyone else for their practice just because it isn't the same as yours.

, Since it can be so overwhelming for the novice, it's important for witches who are just starting to explore the world of witchcraft to get help. Find other more experienced witches who will help tutor you in the dark arts, recommend readings, and show you a thing or two about spells.


Never lie about your experience or your expertise in witchcraft. If you don't know a wand from a cauldron, don't Try to cast yourself as an experienced witch. Others will respect you less and will see through it. It's better to be honest about your knowledge and be willing to learn., When you first get started in practicing witchcraft, it's a good idea to start your own book of shadows. Again, it doesn't need to be bound in ancient leather and stained with goat blood–just get a composition book. Adorn it as you would a journal, with images you find powerful, moving, or full of witchy wisdom. Use the book to record spells, observations, and incantations as you pick them up from your readings and research.

, An altar doesn’t need to be elaborate, or feature the bleached skull of a 12th century mystic (although that would be awesome). An altar is simply a place where you will practice. It should prominently feature personal totems and inspirational objects, things that are essential to your practice. That may mean crystals, stones, herbs, pictures, and any number of other objects that are important to you. Adorn your alter with important objects.


If you're a green witch, or a Wiccan, it might be a good idea to put laurels, dead flowers, dried herbs, and other natural things on your altar. Find stones that speak to you, strange seashells, or other objects of power and beauty.
If you're a druid, or another type of traditional witch, keep lots of pictures of your family, your ancestors, on your altar. If you don't have any, include very old objects–photos of Civil War soldiers, or old pocket watches, things that remind you of the past and help you connect to it.

, Many (but not all) witches find it beneficial to be in tune with the changing of the seasons, and with the transitions from one phase to the next. Attune yourself to the moon’s phases and practice your spell casting in accordance with the lunar changes, the equinox, and other essential signifiers of changing time. Get an astrological calendar and learn about the shifting planets. Pay attention to the changing of the seasons and your emotional, physical, and psychic responses.

, As your Book of Shadows grows and swells with spells, it's a good idea to keep your cabinets and your altar growing. Collect herbs and essential oils for use in your spell casting and keep growing your collection of powerful herb and oils. Practice using them and learning about their distinctive uses. Collect precious stones and crystals and meditate with them to find out which you connect with and which you can use in your practice.


Herbs and stones are available for purchase, but it's a good idea to learn more about foraging and collecting fresh herbs to dry for yourself. Connecting your practice as much as you can with the earth is an excellent idea. Get a local field guide for greenery in your climate and go out frequently to find useful magick herbs. Go foraging around creek beds to find precious stones."

Black magic is considered a dark art because you use it to get what you want by means of controlling someone else.If your aim is to help others or bring about some form of peace and justice, look into white magic instead. If you want to practice magic for personal gain, black magic is what you should use. Here are common reasons why people use black magic:


To keep someone bound in place. If someone is harming you and you wish to stop them, you can use a binding spell to stop the person's actions.
To cause someone to be attracted to you. Love spells are among the most popular when it comes to black magic.
To achieve immortality or improve your health.
To communicate with the dead.;
, The ritual you use to perform black magic will depend on your desired outcome. There are different rituals for everything from casting a spell to gain wealth to raising the dead from their graves. Most rituals involve the following elements:


A site is chosen for casting the curse or spell.
A circle is drawn on the casting site, and a pentacle is drawn inside the circle. This is called a circle of power.
Candles, herbs, crystals, charms, and other materials are employed to help draw out the spirits.Words of power (relevant to the particular outcome you want) are repeated three times.

, Aside from conducting a classic black magic ritual, there are other ways to perform black magic. Placing a curse or hex is done as a way to bring ill fortune to another person, or to make them do what you want them to do. Be very careful about using curses and hexes. It's up to you to determine whether your reasons for wanting to bring misfortune to another person are valid. You must use your power wisely.

, Awakening the forces of darkness can be a serious move and should not be done lightly.The threefold law (Wiccan Rede) states that what you put forth comes back to you threefold. Do you feel so strongly about using black magic that you're willing to suffer should the magic come back to harm you? Be sure that the outcome you are hoping to obtain is completely worth it.

, This powerful symbol is present during most black magic rituals. It is traditionally drawn in the ground using a wand hewn from a hazel tree. You may use a stick or another implement to draw the symbol if Hazelwood isn't available. Choose a strategic location that will give your spell the best chance to work.


Spirits will have a harder time visiting a location that's populated by a lot of people, so choose a place in the woods or another area not frequently visited.
Graveyards are a classic place to choose if you're planning on conjuring the dead.

, Once inside, gather your concentration and energy. You will need all the energy within you to complete the spell. Don't let yourself get distracted.

, Each spell has different words of power that are recited to achieve the outcome you want. If you are summoning a demon or some other spirit, you must learn its true name before the spell will work.


There is no one spell that will work to bring true love, give you immortality, and so on. Do research to find a spell, or write your own if you'd like.

, A grimoire is a sort of textbook for spells, with instructions on how to use black magic.

, If your spell works, the outcome you desire will take effect. Prepare for this, and also prepare for the evil that may come.


If you have summoned a demonic beast or spirit, treat it with respect. These creatures do not necessarily have loyalty to their summoner.

, Choose a piece of black cloth and cut two layers in the shape of a small person. The shape should look vaguely similar to the person on whom you want to place a hex.Sew the edges together but leave the top of the head unsewn.


Black cloth is best, but if you don't have it on hand, you can use another color.
Your poppet should be created from all natural materials. Avoid using polyester fabric or other man-made fabrics; black magic is not as easily conducted through manmade materials.

, Fill it up with earth, a few powerful crystals, and hair and nail clippings from the person you want to hex. Sew up the head to close the poppet.

, Draw a circle using chalk or a stick, then draw a pentagram inside it. Alternately, you may draw a sacred circle on a piece of paper large enough to stand on. Light candles around the circle before you step inside.

, Repeat the words of power three times. Here are a few examples of words you can use to place your hex:


To cast a binding spell and prevent the person from taking actions, repeat ""I bind your feet from bringing you to harm me. I bind your hands from reaching out to harm me. I bind your mouth from spreading tales to harm me. I bind your mind from sending energy to harm me.""Say this while wrapping the poppet in black ribbon.
To cast a love spell over someone you desire, say the words, ""Bright the flame. Light the fire. Red is the color of desire.""

, Once they have burned completely, the hex has been cast.

Purify yourself before any spell.,
Purify your space.,
Setup a circle or altar.,
Invoke the divine.,
Focus your energy on your desire.,
Recite your incantation.,
Seal the deal.,
Give thanks and clean up.",How to Cast a Spell1," Before attempting to perform magic, you need to get into the right frame of both body and mind and cleanse away any doubts, demons or spiritual impurities that might distract you or make the spell go awry. Ideally purifying yourself should be a ritual in and of itself, and should leave your body relaxed and your mind nuclear.


Bathe. Take a long bath, getting your skin completely clean and soaking the tension of our your muscles.
Dress appropriately. If you have robes or other special garb for doing magic, put that on. Otherwise pick simple but formal clothes that feel light, comfortable and clean. You are asking the divine forces for a favor, so try to dress with a certain amount of reverence. If there won't be anyone around, some wiccans swear by performing magic in the nude.

Meditate until your mind is clear. Do some basic deep breathing to improve your focus and discard distracting desires.
Anoint yourself with the proper oils. Different essential oils can be used for different purposes, so if you like find one or more that seem appropriate and dab a little with your fingers on your forehead, and perhaps your hands, hair, face and chest as well.;
, If you are going to be working inside, make sure you won't be disturbed and tidy up the location where you intend to perform your spell. Visualize negative and distracting energies dispersing as you clean.


When the space is clean physically, purify it spiritually by burning some incense, sprinkling some salt water or holy water, or playing a few clear notes on a musical instrument.

, You need a consecrated space to perform your ritual. This can be either a circle to protect you from the interference of negative spirits and energies, an altar to focus your dedication to a specific deity or element, or some combination of these two. You will perform your ritual within the circle or in front of the altar.


Draw a circle big enough to sit in, or a five-pointed-star within a circle (called a pentacle). You can draw it physically or just trace it in the air with your finger or a wand. Visualize protective energy coming out of your arm as you draw, sealing off the circle from in a bubble of light. You can mark the cardinal points on the circle or the points of the star with candles, stones, or some other set of significant objects.Create a small raised platform on which to place a figurine of a deity or some other symbolic representation of the divine. It doesn't have to be complicated: a stack of books will do, if you treat it reverently. Consider adding candles, crystals, an incense stand, or a couple objects close to you spiritually, such as a small heirloom or your book of spells.

, Verbally call on a higher power to bless your spell. This can be a general prayer to call on the help of some deity or force, or something specific you wrote for this spell. Your invocation can also include gestures, music, dance, or ritually lighting candles or placing objects.

, Visualize the object of your spell and imagine light flowing from you into it. Visualize your wish coming true. The more vividly you can see these energies in your mind's eye, the realer they will be.

, For each spell, write a short verse describing your wish and asking it to be granted. It doesn't have to rhyme, but rhymes, alliteration, cadence and other poetic structures help with focus and memorization.Speak the incantation clearly and confidently while you visualize.

, A good spell should have some element of ""casting off"" an item to represent your will going out into the universe. Tear or burn a piece of paper with your wish (or a symbol representing your wish) written on it; toss away a stone or symbolic object; snuff out a candle; or pouring out or drinking a potion.

, Say thank you to any specific deity you invoked. Ground your excess energy by visualizing it flowing into the earth. Undraw your circle, if necessary, and dismantle your altar if you aren't going to use it again. Gather up your tools and leave the space. Your spell is finished. Consider doing something mundane, like having something to eat, to center yourself.

Know how Lord Shiva is called.,
Be aware that Lord Shiva is present in each and every element that comprises this universe, and Mahadev is the only God who is present in every human being (that is why they say Har Har Mahadev; it means every one is mahadev, since he is present in every one).,
Pray to Mahadev from your Chitta (chitta is termed as the mind-stuff or mental substance).,
Chant the panchakshari mantra (five letter mantra) "" namah shivaya"".,If you have an audio or video of the vedic Rudram mantra, play that as well, since it creates a huge positive vibration.,
Do 'abhishekham' to Lord Shiva every Monday with water, honey, turmeric powder, sugar, curd etc.

",How to Worship Lord Shiva," Lord Shiva is often referred as "" MAHADEV "", meaning God of Gods.


God refers to: G - Generator (Lord Brahma, the creator); O - Operator (Lord Vishnu) and D - destroyer (Lord Shiva destroys with his third eye). In this regards, it may seem that Lord Shiva has the third eye and he destroys in anger. But the truth is mahadev is bhole shankar ('bhola' means innocent), he is the only God who is pleased by mere chanting of his name and fulfills all wishes of all people. 
The other popular names associated with Lord Shiva are Mahesh, Maheshwar, Shankar, Shambhu, Rudra, Har, Trilochan, Devendra (meaning Chief of the gods) and Triloknath (meaning Lord of the three realms).
Shiva means ""the One who is eternally pure"" and he is untouched by any thing. ;
, When a person is alive and when the person dies, even then he applies the ashes of your dead body all over his body. That is the greatness of Mahadev.

Tie a knot in the thread and cut it.",How to Make a Voodoo Doll," Start drawing your pattern with a pencil, so you can easily erase any mistakes. Start by drawing half a head. Then draw a shoulder, half of a torso, and a leg. When you finish, you should have half of a humanoid shape, from the top of the head to the groin.Once you’ve finished drawing this shape with a pencil, you can trace it over with a marker.
The kind of shape you make is entirely up to you. You can make a voodoo doll with longer limbs and a more human torso, or make something a bit more cartoony.;
, Lay a piece of tracing paper over the half doll you’ve just drawn. With your pencil, follow the line until you’ve replicated it.

, You should essentially see a complete humanoid shape. Half of it will be on the sheet of paper underneath, while the other half will be on the tracing paper., With your pencil, trace over the marker line. You should essentially be connecting the points on the tracing paper until you’ve completed a full humanoid shape.

, Using scissors, carefully cut along the lines. This will give you a human-shaped template, which you’ll need for the following part.

, Make sure your felt is large enough to comfortably contain the template. You can leave a bit of extra felt sticking out from under the template. Stick two pins into the paper template and through the two pieces of felt.


You can stick the pins through the torso to ensure a more secure hold., Cut carefully along the template. Once you’ve cut all the way around, you should be left with the paper template, two pieces of felt matching your template and some felt scraps. Put the felt scraps aside.

, The felt piece you set aside at this juncture will be the back half of your voodoo doll. Make sure to keep it separate from your felt scraps and the front half of your voodoo doll.


While sewing details on your voodoo doll is optional, voodoo practitioners believe these details are crucial. If you decide to add detail, it must be done before sewing the two halves of the doll together.

, Tie an overhand knot in your thread. Then pass the thread through the needle’s eye until the knot catches. You’ll know it’s caught when you can’t pull the thread through the needle anymore., There are two ways to give your voodoo dolls eyes. You can either use a button, or simply sew a cross. You can use either method for two different eyes, or use one method for matching eyes.


Button eye. Cut out a small round piece of felt, slightly larger than your button. Lay the button on top of this circle and over the front half of your voodoo doll. Start with your needle underneath the felt, and poke it up and through the hole in the button. Pull until the knot catches, then poke your needle through the button’s second hole, pulling until the thread comes over the button. If your button has more than two holes, continue this process, alternating between coming up from underneath and poking down through the felt.
Cross eye. Starting from underneath the felt, poke a hole through the head with the needle, about where the corner of a person’s eye would be. Pull until you can’t easily pull more. Poke your needle down through the felt, about ¾ of an inch away from your first hole, forming a diagonal line. Repeat this process, poking two more holes and making a line that crosses your first line., If you’ve chosen to give your voodoo doll eyes, you can use the same thread you’ve used to sew on the eyes. Starting from underneath the felt, poke your needle up (towards you), where the corner of a person’s mouth would be. Pull the thread through until it catches. Poke your needle down through the opposite corner of where the mouth would be, pushing until the thread is tight.


This step will result in a simple line for the mouth. You can add a bit more detail by adding small perpendicular lines that cross over the mouth. This will make the mouth look slightly like a star, giving the voodoo doll a more creepy appearance., Before doing this, you’ll need to cut a small heart out of felt. Lay the heart over the front half of your voodoo doll, where the heart would be on a person. Poke your needle up from underneath the felt and through the heart, a few millimeters away from its edge (the needle should come towards you). Pull until the thread is tight. Poke the needle down, through the voodoo doll’s body but NOT through the heart. The result should be a line of thread that comes up through the heart, over the edge and through the voodoo doll’s body.


Repeat this process (up through the heart, down through the body) until you’ve gone all around the heart., After you’ve sewed off your last detail, you should tie off the thread. Run your needle under the last stitch you’ve made, and pull until the thread until you create a small loop. Pass your needle through the loop, pulling on the thread until it creates a small knot. Cut the thread from the needle and tuck it under the front half of your voodoo doll.


You don’t need to cut too close to your knot. Whatever thread is left will be hidden inside your voodoo doll., Tie an overhand knot in your thread. Then pass the thread through the needle’s eye until the knot catches. You’ll know it’s caught when you can’t pull the thread through the needle anymore., Make sure that any details you’ve sewed on are facing up and towards you. Line up the two halves so the edges are completely flush.


You can push pins through both felt halves to secure them to one another. This will ensure they don’t move around as you sew.

, Start under one of the voodoo doll’s armpits. The needle should be coming towards you, from underneath the felt. The resulting hole should be about three millimeters away from the edge of the felt. This ensures the felt won’t tear. Pull the thread until it catches.

, You should always be poking your needle upwards, from underneath the felt. Each hole should be separated by two to four millimeters. Always bring the thread over the edges of the felt; this is what will secure the two halves together., This should leave an opening somewhere between the voodoo doll’s armpit (where you started your stitch) and its leg on the same side. It’s crucial to leave this opening, otherwise you won’t be able to stuff the doll.

, You can choose just about any soft material as stuffing, but polyester stuffing is generally best. It can be found at fabric stores rather cheaply, and has a good range of textures. Some stuffing is crunchier, while other types are more squishy.Insert stuffing through the voodoo doll’s opening until it gets nice and plump, without pulling at the stitches too much.


You can use something long and thin, like a pen or the back of a small paintbrush, to push the stuffing into the doll’s arms and legs.While you can stuff a voodoo doll with the same stuffing as a stuffed animal, voodoo practitioners will usually fill their dolls with spanish moss., Using the same stitching method as before, close the opening on the doll’s side.

, After you’ve sewed off your last detail, you should tie off the thread. Run your needle under the last stitch you’ve made, and pull until the thread until you create a small loop. Pass your needle through the loop, pulling on the thread until it creates a small knot. Cut the thread from the needle and tuck it under the front half of your voodoo doll.


You don’t need to cut too close to your knot. Whatever thread is left will be hidden inside your voodoo doll."

Watch the heavens.,
Coordinate your colors.,
Use herbs, oils, stones and natural objects.,
Cozy up to higher powers.,
Have faith.",How to Cast a Spell2," Many magicians consider the phases of the moon, the time of day, and other astrological configurations to be of great significance in the effectiveness of any spell. For instance, a spell seeking some kind of new beginning should be cast during a new moon, so your wish can come to fruition as the moon becomes full. Some occult research will help you figure out how to optimize the timing of your spells.

, Colors have different meanings in different magical systems. Once you look up their significance, pick one or two colors that match your intention and use colored candles or crystals to involve them in your spells.

, For expert occultists, all these items have some sort of magical significance. Go to your local new age store to pick up materials that will give power to your spells.

, Different occultists call on all sorts of different deities and religious figures to work their magic. Find a system of spiritual symbolism that works for you, and invoke those characters in your spells. Just be careful—some of these spirits have ideas of their own and can twist your intentions if you can't control them.

, In the end, casting a spell is all about directing your mental energies towards a goal. Whether or not something supernatural occurs because of your spell, stating your goal clearly and in a ritualized way can help you focus, give you confidence and make you work harder to make it happen. The more you believe in the power of your spell, the more likely it is to have a positive effect on you.

Use it to put your intention out into the universe by calling on the power of the waters and the moon., You can draw your own symbol, or you can look up different symbols that are related to your area of desire (love, family, health, success, and so on). Draw it on the surface of the shell with chalk, charcoal or something else that will wash off in the water.<bra><bar>

, Set it in a spot where the waves will eventually wash over the shell when the tide comes in. The symbol on the shell should be facing upwards—towards the moon.<bar><bar>


Note the phase of the moon when you do this. Use the waxing moon if you wish to gain something and the waning moon if you wish to get rid of something

, Your shell should be the center of the triangle.

Meaningful phrases and words may be drawn into the sand as well, as long as they are in the triangle. Alternatively, you can write these directly onto the shell.

, Focus on your wish and try to say the spell with reverence and conviction.Goddess of Moon, Earth, and the Sea
Each wish in Thy name must come to be
Powers and Forces which Tides do make
Now summon Thy waves, my spell to take

, As the tide moves in, the shell should wash away, and your wish will be taken by the universe, to the Old Ones or whichever gods you believe in. You should notice results in 7-28 days.

Recognize suffering.,
Replace the chase for earthly desires with a single longing to be one with God.,
Remember God throughout the day by speaking His or Her Names.,
Recognize God, or the Dharma (spiritual teachings), in everything around you.,
Give up all types of intoxication.,
Give up the need to control others.,
Live as simple a life as possible.,
Give up ambition and ego.",How to Stop the Cycle of Reincarnation," The quest to stop the eternal cycle of births and deaths begins with an internal realization that one is weary of chasing youth, beauty, wealth, status and power. We have done this in so many lifetimes and found earthly rewards to be fleeting, temporal and shallow.;
, For a Hindu this is believed to be the will of God. Buddhists develop a single longing for Nirvana, the end of suffering.

, It doesn't matter what you choose to call Him or Her - Christ, Allah, Jehovah, Krishna, Devi, etc. Buddhists remember the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.

, Stop frequently throughout the day and bring to mind how God or the Dharma explains the world around you and whatever situation you currently find yourself in.

, Excesses of all sorts, (even good food is bad in excess), and other bad habits all interfere with the energy of both your body and mind. Treat your body as a living temple!

, Whether it is holding onto family, friends or anyone else, you need to let them live their own lives. This is not to be confused with relinquishing your obligations towards your dependants, such as young children, spouses or parents. Each cycle in one's life has a purpose, and when one has dependants their needs have to be met first. Renouncing them to seek God is a serious dereliction of duties that will result in further rebirths.

, Reduce your belongings and debts to the bare minimum and learn to trust that you will receive what you need.

, These are the two biggest obstacles to ending the cycle of reincarnation. The less you want, the less draw earthly life has on you. As the desire to acquire evaporates, greed, jealousy, ego and the need for power all disappear, leaving the path and mind clear to focus on God.

",How to Plan and Attend Holi Festival in India," All Hindu festivals are planned according to the lunar calendar as only the lunar calendar can decide the changes that occur at different times each year. Thus the date keeps varying each year.;
, There are many different events linked to it. The farming communities of North, Eastern and central India link Holi to the harvest of the winter crop, even though now the green revolution has allowed a harvest anytime of the year but the day still holds this value for the farmers. Overall, Holi signifies the official onset of summer and is mainly celebrated for the downfall of Holika, who was a demon who was killed by Lord Vishnu who burned her to save his devotee Praladh from her. Though she had the boon to not die in fire, the Lord still overcome her boon to save his devotee. This is the main reason.

, In the majority of the country, colors are prepared and then along with water, people engage themselves to a war, a war of water and colors. But the processes are different in different areas. The southern regions do not enroll themselves into much of the fun play while there are week long celebrations in the central part while the north celebrates with great valour.

, As it is always done, the process of prayer is done in each house . In this process, the idols are wrapped in a flower garland and then a small lamp is lit. This lamp is revolved around the idols at about a distance of 2 feet (0.6 m) from the idol. Then all the food items are brought in front of the god(s) in small quantities, just like it is served to any other family member. At this moment, everybody closes their eyes and bows their heads with their hands folded. They wait for about 10- 20 seconds in this posture before opening their eyes. Then everybody prays and the food is mixed with the offering, known as 'prasad' which everybody must get, thus it is mixed. After this it depends whether you eat food or celebrate.

, Greetings and wishes are distributed amongst all and then the next house is visited. After visiting all in the locality, all the members in the locality team up and then throw colors and splash water at each other.

, The day is then celebrated till night by the families. The amount of celebrations vary and the prayers are more intense in the south.

, People have a great dependence and value for this festival.

, There is no harm and no need to feel awkward in offering the prayers even if you are not a Hindu.

, Avoid too many sweets if you are not accustomed to heavy eating.

Don't even try to earn Christ's love.,
Be thankful!,
Talk to God: Talk to the One who's always around.,
Ask for the Holy Spirit  : because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.,
Trust God; have faith.,
Be the person that you believe God created you to be.,
Get this: God loves everyone and will accept you no matter what you have done or will do in life.,
Understand the nature of God by living your life by the Bible--that's the only way.,
Don't expect to get some kind of ""blessing"" that will solve all your problems.,
Most importantly, watch and listen for the leading of the Holy Spirit.,
Attending church is great but even church organizations need people to help others: you can help strangers, family, friends, organizations, youth services, Sunday school: volunteer to help.

",How to Get the Love of Christ," He's already given all of His Love and proved it by dying for you. So, just believe what He said: I will in no wise cast out anybody who comes to me for salvation. So, be saved by believing that God is who he says He is and that He sent Jesus to pay for all of your sin. Repent for your sin (turn your heart and actions away from it) --and ask Him to save you from eternal Hell and He will; simple! Ask for forgiveness because all of us commit mistakes -- small or big, but that doesn't matter because Christ don't look for flaws and mistakes. He's after what's inside each of our hearts.;
, Appreciate both the big things and the little things in life. Be grateful--even through the low points--remembering that the sweet would not be quite so sweet without the sour.

, Pray, asking for guidance, and listen for the Holy Spirit to answer. There are many ways to listen, whether it's through coincidences, or insights, or whatever way makes you feel like you're being drawn in a particular direction to do the right thing! Be sure that your spirit does not go against Bible truths...

, Romans 5:5

, The Bible says that without faith, it is impossible to please God. A fact will not satisfy you or save you: there is always the need for your faith to really please God.

, Seek God and read your Bible! God reveals Himself through the Bible, which is His Word. Make sure you use a sound bible... King James is the closest to the truth without man's sinful influence. Take time to learn from it. You will find that it reveals more as you grow. Other versions make you feel good at first but are not good for you in the long run. Better to feel the heat at first and grow in truth than to feel good now and find out you fell short of the mark in the end.

, He promises if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. He delights in you. ((Hebrews 10:17 says that God does not remember your sins. Proverbs 8:17, ""I love those that love me."" Jeremiah 31:3, ""With an eternal love have I loved you.""))

, Just because a pastor, like a priest, says something doesn't automatically mean that it's right. The ONLY way we know what God wants/thinks/says is through His Word... the BIBLE!

, God gave you intelligence, use it. On the other hand, God will teach you all things. John 14:26, ((""But the helper, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you ALL things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said unto you."")) I John 2:27, ((""But the anointing which ye have received of him abides in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him."")) Hebrews 8:6,10, ((""But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as Christ is also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.""))

, If you are saved, He will speak to you through your spirit, you just have to listen and decide to obey. Jesus said, in Mark 16: ""15 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;... 20And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following."","
"
The first thing is provisional acceptance of the concept.,
Read the books written on namasmaran.,
Select one place in your residence.,
Continue without expecting anything miraculous.,
Gradually you will get over this phase and enter into the realm free of the shackles of subjectivity, superficiality and pettiness.

,
You will then feel like sharing your experiences selflessly with others.,
Namasmaran is simple and inexpensive, does not require any gadgets, does not require any change in culture, does not have any external glamour and glitter, does not give any tangible gains and hence usually quickly started but then also quickly given up.",How to Practice Namasmaran," Hostility or submission are not conducive to build conviction based on sound foundation.;
, This would give you the idea about the simplicity of the process and also why people start it and also give it up rather too quickly!

, Select a particular suitable time when you are not tired. Sit in any suitable position. Start remembering any name of God you are familiar with, belongs to your tradition, your religion, or simply you have reverence about. Practice for about five minutes every day.

, In fact initially you experience restlessness and feeling of wastage of time. This happens because we are used to think, feel and move unknowingly, mechanically and many times inadvertently in response to external and internal influences. Hence namasmaran, during which this thinking, feeling and moving activity is restricted, makes one feel suffocated, empty or useless.

,, You may happily do it but without discontinuing your namasmaran.

, Hence persist on namasmaran irrespective of anything --- because namasmaran takes you beyond everything tangible but transient, towards ultimate freedom.

",How to Get Involved at Your Church,";
, Below is a list of some of the ways you can get involved.

,,,,,,,,,,,,"
"
Avoid thinking of yourself as a victim in life.,
Choose good actions in Christ to get good results.,
Learn how to work with other people without being paranoid or sensitive.,
Have hope for the future.,
Muster the courage to fulfill your potential.,
Understand that you can bless or curse other people with your words.,
Look for positive patterns.,
Work from your sweet spot.,
Be consistent in making your wisdom agree with the Bible.",How to Get Osteen Wisdom," Choose a positive vocabulary of winning words. Osteen says, ""You must make a decision that you are going to move on. It won't happen automatically. You will have to rise up and say, ‘I don’t care how hard this is, I don’t care how disappointed I am, I’m not going to let this get the best of me'."" But, we can say with Paul:



""My testimony of God to you is not with brilliance of speech or wisdom. For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified."" (1 Corinthians 2).;
, If we choose to not let common, daily chores overwhelm us, they won't. Work out your own future in Christ. We can choose what will happen to us, to a great extent.


Say, ""I can handle this,"" whatever it may be for you. If you think, and take action as if you can handle something, you eventually can. If you withdraw, or back away, thinking you can't, then you won't be able to. Like the famous quote says, ""He who says he can, and he who says he can't are both right.""

, Osteen says, ""Keep in mind, hurting people often hurt other people, as a result of their own pain. If somebody is rude and inconsiderate, you can almost be certain that person has some unresolved issues inside.""


This can help you to have compassion on those you may have otherwise not tried to understand. If you consider where they are coming from, which Osteen talks about, you will be much more able to give them grace.
Rather than focus on what someone did to you, ask yourself instead WHY he or she did that, as in what is the person's motivation or past experience. This will help tremendously for you to bring peace with you, and for you to be better at being a peace-maker.

, Osteen says, ""God knows your value; He sees your potential. You may not understand everything you are going through right now. But, hold your head up high, knowing that God is in control, and he has a great plan and purpose for your life."" Often times, things happen to us that we don't understand. It could be easy to think that there is either something wrong with us, or that God does not really love us. But, sometimes God causes, or lets things happen for reasons that we might not understand until 20 years from now.


We need to trust that God really does have a great plan for our lives and that he will ""work all things together for good for those who love the Lord"" as the Bible says that He will.

, Learn to bounce up in life. Osteen says, ""No matter how many times you get knocked down, keep getting back up."" Dust yourself off; shake off self-centered self-criticism, and try again to walk in Christ.


Select a winning chosen attitude. Your attitude can be an internal enemy, opposing you and trying to sit you out of the game of life. But, don't let your feelings keep you sitting on the floor or warming the bench.
Replace bad choices with good ones. Be active and don't let the water of life stagnate within you. You can let it flow through you, with God's help.
Share your positive emotions with others. Smile and be cheerful; choose joy. Overcome by passing your blessings forward, making assists for others to make a goal, and so multiply your own contributions in your family or any team in the game of life.

, Osteen says, ""It is important for a husband to understand that his words have tremendous power in his wife’s life. He needs to bless her with words."" And vice versa -- behind every good/bad person there is a good/bad woman, whether it is the mom, grandmother or wife...


This goes for any relationship in life. We need to know that our words have creative power. We can either speak life into people, or we can blow or suck the life out of them with our words. We can speak Truth of them and so bless them, or we can gossip about them and put them down, and so curse them.

, That changes what we see. Look for your positive futures/good goals in work or play. Contribute to the futures of others to an extent, simply by the the words you say and what you do, good or bad... Choose what God did -- as when He spoke, the world was created. Every human being is made in God's image, and our words, setting goals, working toward our goals all have great power over, under, around and through our entire lives.

, Limit distractions from thinking. Put the phone, TV, radio, music and candy bowl away. Be present in your life's sweet spot. Be available to yourself. Plan. Decide. Start. Arbitrarily decide to be wise. Arbitrarily choose to be happy and contented by always improving and making progress.


Get a notebook and a pen, or a recorder. Be still and stare into space for a few moments to let your brain draw connections to insights and creativity. Write it or record it. By being still, you make a place and time to hear something important emerging in your thoughts. The Lord says, ""Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth."" (Psalm 46:10).

, Change your thoughts to positive ones, when gloomy thoughts come -- replace them. Think on good and better thoughts. Reject the bad ideas.


Expect positive wisdom; don't be surprised by it, and allow it to flow as much or more than you prepare for. God's word can be, and is, near you -- even in your mouth. Write or record good thoughts. Read over or listen to your thoughts and see what else flows from that.
Apply good ideas to your life, in a pattern or plan. Make it count. Don't jump around and skip important issues.

Spend quality quiet time with Jesus.,
Attend church regularly.,
Receive the sacraments.,
Read the Bible.,
Talk to Jesus through prayer.",How to Get Closer to Jesus," Quiet time can involve you reading various gospel oriented books or listening to devotionals or even Christian music. Just taking some time off to sit and think about certain verses or passages from the Bible would also amount to quiet time. It's frankly just isolating yourself from this noisy world and letting God know that you are waiting on him. So quality quiet time would surely make you feel closer to Jesus.;
, It doesn't matter what church, as long as it is Bible based and teaches the Bibles truths. Be sure when you are attending you try to engage yourself in the mass. When hymns are being sung, sing along from the heart, when scripture is being read listen intently and focus your attention on the words. Being engaged in church can have you leaving much more fulfilled and feeling closer to Jesus.

, If you belong to a church that has sacraments (Roman Catholic church for example) talk to a priest about receiving the sacraments. And before each one, study what their meaning is and how they will affect your walk with Jesus. Whether it be your first communion (receiving Jesus's body) or Confirmation (confirming that you will follow Jesus), think about Jesus and pray to him to prepare yourself. Be sure to read your bible (as stated in the last step).

, The Lord has blessed you with the Bible so that you can get to know Him better, among many other reasons. So, take advantage of having this great book with you by exploring it and enjoying it. Try to also follow some of the instructions He has given you in the Bible. Try to analyse how each verse or passage can be applied in your life.


For instance, Psalm 46 verse 1 says ""God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble."". So next time you see trouble brewing at your workplace or college or wherever, you can look it in the eye and recite this verse aloud. This will surely bring you closer to Jesus and you will feel his presence even more.
Live by the Bible. Don't add to it nor subtract anything––what is in the Bible,was meant to be in the Bible.

, To Jesus you are his precious child. He loves you no matter what problem you are facing. Tell him what you are up to or what your plans are or why you are sad or what you need and so on. He is your Father. He wants what's best for you and most of all he wants you! Go to him for everything and you will feel closer to him in no time. He wants you to pray in the Spirit as well as in the understanding and He wants you to pray for other people so that they will repent and so that they will be healed.

",How to Get Closer With God Our Holy Father," But, before the cross, and the rising from death -- Adam became the first man to ""fall"" representing all of mankind as sinners. A while earlier, Adam had been lonely, for he did not have any companion on earth. So, God had put Adam into a deep sleep, took a rib from Adam, and made a woman named Eve (not a clone!). They had a good life together in the garden for ""a time"" (how long -- no one knows!). We are told that there were many trees and fruits (i.e.: representing love, peace and togetherness), or the tree of ""Knowledge of Good and Evil"" (not a temptation but forbidden). God seems to say, ""You may take an apple from the love and peace tree, but do not eat of the tree of 'Knowledge of Good and Evil'."" Yet, Satan tempted Eve, then Eve took that disallowed fruit and she tempted Adam, and they both ate (i.e.: disobeyed the ""Law of Love""). Then they found themselves to be naked, made clothing out of leaves, but it did not work. So, they attempted to hid from the Lord! Then the Lord banished them out of the garden(!), though they still loved God, very much.

, All men (according to The Bible) were evil except one family. Once again, before sending Jesus, God reached out to a young man, to be His (God's) friend and his God. And, told him to build an ark and put pairs of every animal on that ark and take his family with him. God said, ""I am sorry that I created man!"" on the earth because people were being cold-hearted and corrupt (everyone but Noah and his family). Noah built the ark, put the animals on there and his family just like God said to do. Then when everyone was on, God shut the door and flooded the earth! They were on that boat, 40 days and 40 nights! Everyone died except the ones on the boat! Adam sent a dove out, and finally after a while he came back with a tree branch! The water was going down! And when they got off, life was back!

, The Lord, himself, made Mary pregnant and said to Mary. ""You will have a son, and his name will be Jesus!"" Then said to Joseph ""You will marry Mary! And, love each other for as long as you live!"" At that time, a woman who was pregnant before marriage, could be stoned to death. So, Joseph believed God and married her, and took her from her home and Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, Joseph's hometown.

, Later in Jesus' life, life itself depended upon him. Ah, God and Jesus must love us very much, God gave his son to willingly hang on the cross and die for us, to pay for all sin and save our lives! Jesus himself, gave up his life (as God's only begotten son) for us! -- and Jesus (though tempted) never rejected God. He hung on the cross, next to two others, and the one on the right said ""Why don't you send your angels to minister to us!"" ""No."" said Jesus. And, there they remained hanging until death, but a little later, some ""prophets of old"" were seen in the streets (risen from death)! And one of the local people requested Jesus' body. Then he took the body and buried Jesus, and put a big boulder over the entrance. Roman soldiers stood watch, so that no one would take His body. Yet, as people arrived the next morning, the boulder was rolled away; the soldiers were gone, and Jesus was gone, also! Nothing was there except his burial garments! They thought someone stole the corpse, but they left because there was nothing they could do, and soon they met Jesus who was alive again!

, He will see that you know he's there, and that you Love him! Love is the key! ""By this you know that you are my disciples, that you love one another."" said Jesus.;
, Kids may read ""children's Bibles"", and they tell so much and are understandable to children, but adults and intermediates should be reading more adult like passages.

Travel and consider devoting time to mission work.",How to Follow Jesus," Christ and His followers were common men, associated with laborers, helped outcasts such as lepers, and brought hope to other ostracized members of society. They lived on the road, often without a roof over their heads, and spent much of their time in learning, quiet contemplation and preparing to take The Good News to all. While you don't necessarily need to hit the highway and live like a minister, a full time disciple, student or missionary to follow Jesus, it's important to know that you also don't need to be a person of wealth, status, speaking skills or other achievement. God uses the basics, the truth -- simple words and messengers. The less self-centered trappings of the material world, the less distracted you'll be from your message of Jesus: the way, truth and the life. When Jesus says I am the way He is talking about in Heaven. you have to call on Him to forgive you to make it to Heaven.


Take little steps. Simplify your life. You don't need to adopt a life as a mission or join a ministry team as a minister, necessarily--but get a Bible and study Christ and the Acts of the Apostles and the writings of Paul (much of the New Testament). Instead of entertaining or watching television in the evening, contemplate a particular passage that speaks to you. Pray on it. Think more and do more for Christ, and His people/family/friends.A common area to work on among Christians, in/of religious traditions, can be laying aside self-righteousness, not showing vanity. Followers of Jesus shouldn't feel proud of their humility, or boast of their ""spiritual"" life. As a follower of Christ, focus, and center your life -- but not because it makes you feel ""better than"" others: You may choose how to follow because it gets you ""closer to"" God and to appreciating other believers more, ""God's family""; you are one of Jesus' brothers and sisters, ""joint-heirs with Jesus Christ"".;
, He, despite often communicating in cryptic stories (parables) to the general public, was a direct and completely honest talker to followers, having nothing to hide, and having total confidence in His words, full of the Holy Spirit beyond measure. With friends and accepting coworkers, family and loved ones, be forthright, honest, and direct. Your life will uncomplicate itself as a result.


Speaking with hidden motives (wink, wink) and trying to manipulate others is too common in the workplace, at home, and in many interpersonal relationships. Even if you're dissenting nicely, speak your mind with love. Most people respect honesty and decency.

, So, do not be unnecessarily harsh or judgmental toward others: there is one true Judge. Since ""Love never fails"" and ""God is love!"" -- find the kindness in others, being a friend to them: expecting their best, and cultivating positive relationships with people. Don't think more highly of yourself than you ought. Assume you'll enjoy the company of new acquaintances, and learn everything you can from others. Bear your load, and help others bear theirs; tell the truth, and hear the truth, being as happy, patient and kind as possible, through it all. Actively make time for reasonable people who are different than you, having different experiences, who may believe very different things. Listen to them with an open heart, as: ""I see what you mean, also have you considered this ___?""

, Before He went around preaching the gospel, Jesus spent many years in the trade of Joseph, Mary's husband, practicing carpentry. Devoting yourself to a craft, a trade, or skill, can be helpful in allowing you to humble yourself and live more simply. Be good at what you do, and devote part of your life to providing service for your fellow man, Christian and non. Be useful and reliable.

, Who lacks voice in your world? Who needs to experience real, open channels of communication and fellowship with others, in less privileged circumstances? Jesus sought out the marginalized and associated with the downcast to share His message, and to help in real ways, not just platitudes but action.


Expand your mind and your capacity for empathy by spending time with those less fortunate than yourself. You might consider volunteering at soup kitchens, shelters, or donating your time to other organizations that help those in need. Spend time with people, be friendly and learn from them. Don't be a tourist in their bad times and suffering; help some.
Charity. You don't have to be a big donor. Your gift need not be money.
Offer transportation, bus fare, a car ride, accompany an elder or sick neighbor to the doctor, or help an unemployed person find low priced or free groceries.
Visit widows and orphans in their need. Surprise your grandmother with a call and a visit, with little warning.
Cook dinner for a friend having a rough spell and get someone to deliver it anonymously and never bring it up.
Write letters of support to children or soldiers overseas, and let them know you care, sending some small gifts.

, Work with church charities. Some churches give a lot of weight to donations, mission-work, and other community operations.

, You don't need to be a martyr to a great cause to follow Jesus, but you do have to fight your struggles for yourself but never alone. Give yourself up to some calling greater than yourself. Stand up for others' benefits in ""the good fight"", spiritual battle, wherever you find one. Be a watchman for community standards.


Christian believers will experience the issues of doubt. No believer is without it. Even Christ endured 40 days of temptation in the desert, clouded by human doubt. He was 100% man and tempted like we, without fail. Even Christ cried out on the cross, ""Father why have you forsaken me?"", ""It is finished. Into your hand I commit myself!"" That conflict was ended. Victories over sin, death and the grave came fast behind. You can deal with weakness, temptation, and doubt with patience, and come through as refined gold from the trying of your faith, covered by God's grace.
Approach difficulties and struggles with persistence and focus: this defines your life as a person and as a follower of Christ., Bring some balance into the lives of serious-minded Christians. Soldiering on in blind devotion to tradition or dogma, while merely warming a church bench does not make you a Christian. Think hard about supporting your beliefs. Weigh them constantly. Thanking God in it all. Struggle and stand for the teachings of Jesus and making them an integral part of your daily life.

, To the lay person, the tangle of different churches, branches, doctrines, and denominations can be completely overwhelming. There are various specific doctrines to distinguish between the basic modes of thought; however, you can start exploring your options and visit local churches to find a community of which you'd like to be a part.



Protestant Churches. If you're interested in the teachings of Christ, in cultivating a personal relationship with Jesus, but less interested in tradition and formality, you're probably interested in a protestant branch of the Church. The most common protestant denominations, each with their own practices and messages, include United Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Assembly of God and Episcopal branches. Non-denominational Christian churches are also common, particularly in the United States.Protestant churches split from the Roman Catholic church in the 16th century, because of various theological disagreements

Roman Catholic Church. If you're interested in the Church Jesus Christ established on Peter, a community of sinners seeking Christ in the real presence of Eucharist, and falling deeper in love with Christ through the sacraments He instituted, you might explore Roman Catholic churches in your area. The Catholic Church is a global church, family oriented, and a home for all searching for peace, faith, forgiveness, and mercy through Jesus.

Eastern Orthodox Church. If you're interested in traditional and historical ties to Christ, the Orthodox church is conservative and serious. The Eastern Orthodox Church maintains apostolic succession, valid sacraments, and great communities for genuine devotion to Christ. The Eastern Orthodox Church is primarily based in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and across Russia, and split from the Catholic church in the 11th century.

, Try attending a few different churches and talk to the members you meet. One of the most important aspects of following Jesus and developing a personal relationship is in sharing beliefs and relationships with others. Finding a community of like-minded believers can be a comfort to followers of Jesus, giving a sense of community, family, and tradition.


Don't be afraid to visit lots of churches. Feel it out. Find out if the ministers or preachers have open office-hours during which you might visit and discuss your desire for community. Ask for assistance. Churches are generally thrilled to gather new members.
Talk to other members and church staff about the process of joining the church, once you've decided on one you like. Typically, you might need to attend a short class and complete a baptism .

, Depending on which church you end up wanting to join, your membership will likely be symbolized with a public baptism. The process itself is relatively simple--the pastor may immerse you (or in some denominations sprinkle your head). Baptism symbolizes a new life and being baptized as Jesus himself was, has significance in following Jesus, which is huge for Christians. This can be a powerful and moving commitment of your life to Jesus. If you want to follow Jesus, baptism is an important step in that journey.

, Now you've signed up, gotten baptized, and are a card-carrying member of a church. This is an achievement, but your life in Christ has only just begun. It's good to go to church twice a week, say your bedtime prayers, and read your Bible. But, following Jesus is a full life that no amount of routine can define.


Only you can develop a personal relationship and a personal following of Jesus. Spend time in deep contemplation of His teachings. Read widely and variously. Spread the word. Live the challenge of yournew life in Christ and let your mind be transformed.

, In the Bible, the story of Jesus appears in the four gospels -- the books Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John -- which all tell the story of Jesus with somewhat different ordering and content. According to these gospels, Jesus is the son of God, immaculately conceived to a virgin, Mary, and born in a stable/manger. He was baptized in the river Jordan by the Baptist St. John, after which He became more than a prophet of God and a leader of men. He was crucified at Golgotha, laid in a tomb, and reborn after three days to ascend to Heaven. Christians believe Christ paid for the sins of humanity, that we may be saved by believing in His provision. Most Christian theologies and doctrines separate the life of Christ into five stages:



The Baptism of Christ is recorded in Matthew 3, Mark 1, Luke 3, and John 1. The Baptism is important because it marks Christ's public beginnings as a prophet and a teacher.

The Transfiguration refers one of Christ's major miracles, in which His followers observe Him radiate holy light on the top of the Mountain of Transfiguration, after which Moses, Elijah, and God communicate with Him. The episode appears in Matthew 17, Mark 9, and Luke 9, but does not appear in the Gospel of John.

The Crucifixion refers to the arrest, torment, and execution of Christ. He was arrested in Gethsemane, charged with blasphemy, crowned with thorns, beaten, and nailed by the hands and feet to a wooden cross, His side pierced with a spear, and He died. Christians believe His crucifixion was voluntary or at least a willing laying down of His life on behalf of humanity, of the entire Earth, not for one nation or people. The crucifixion appears in Matthew 27, Mark 15, Luke 23, and John 19.

The Resurrection refers to the rising of Christ from His tomb, three days after having been laid to rest. He appeared over a period of 40 days to His followers, during which His body was no longer subject to the laws of nature. This event is celebrated by Christians on Easter Sunday, and recorded in Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, and John 20.

The Ascension refers to an event in which Jesus called His disciples to the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, spoke to them, and ascended into Heaven, promising to return and restore the Kingdom of Heaven. The event is recorded in Mark 16 and Luke 24, as well as in Acts 1, and the first book of Timothy chapter 3.

, During His life, Jesus traveled and ministered to crowds of thousands and to individuals, and His teachings are found in the Biblical Gospels and in some other books of the Bible. His teachings mostly appear in the forms of parables and stories, which are often cryptic, poetic, complex, and beautiful. The book of the Bible in which Jesus speaks and teaches the most is Matthew.Some of the most important teachings of Jesus include:



The Sermon on the Mount, which appears in Matthew 5-7. This contains the Lord's Prayer and the Beatitudes, which feature prominently in Christian discipleship in terms of theology and belief. If you want to know what Jesus and His followers believed, this is an important chapter to read.

Be Baptized with Holy Spirit: Acts 1:4 ""Gathering them together, Jesus commanded them to wait at Jerusalem, until they receive what the Father had promised, "" 'Which,' He said, 'you heard of from Me; 5 for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.' ""

The Mission Discourse, which appears in Matthew 10. This describes Christ's expectations of the behavior of His disciples, instructing them in their behavior and worship. It's a very important chapter to read to learn how to be a good follower of Christ.

The Parables, which appear periodically throughout all the Canonical Gospels, specifically in Matthew 13, Mark 4, Luke 12-18, and John 15. These are deceptively-simple stories told by Jesus, featuring complex metaphors, and dealing with a variety of a topics. Famous parables include the ""Good Samaritan,"" ""The Leaven,"" and ""The Two Debtors.""

The Farewell, which appears in John chapters 14-17. These record Christ's address to His disciples the night before His death, following the Last Supper. It's one of the most moving and powerful series of passages in the Bible. He promised to abide with you always, John 14:16-17 ""I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever; 17 that is the Spirit of Truth (and receive The Holy Spirit), whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides with you and will be in you...""

The Olive Discourse, which is recorded in Mark 13, Matthew 24, and Luke 21. This is a prophecy told by Christ, in which he predicts the end times, times of great tribulation, and describes His return. Interpretations of the prophecy vary widely.

, Jesus, a leader of men with humble beginnings, appears not only in the Christian Bible, but in other historical records and religious traditions. Roman historians Josephus and Tacitus made record of His existence in the early Christians, disciples who formed and taught shortly after His death. Josephus wrote that Jesus was a ""wise man"" and a ""learned teacher,"" and both recorded His execution as a major historical event.Born at some point between 2 and 7 B.C., in a small town in Nazareth called Galilee, most historians agree that Jesus of Nazareth was most likely a carpenter, who experienced visions and was accepted as a teacher and healer in the community.His Baptism and Crucifixion are generally accepted as historically certain.
Christ appears in other religious traditions as well. Islam claims Jesus as another in the line of prophets to Mohammed, while practitioners of Hinduism place Jesus comfortably as one of the avatar incarnations of Vishnu, depending on the specific tradition in practice.

, One of the most difficult things about understanding the teachings of Jesus is trying to understand the ancient world described in the Bible. Somewhere in all the ""thous"" and ""thees,"" the message can get a little muddied. This makes it important to try to place Jesus in your world, imagining what he would have to say about your life and the world at large. Jesus has a lot to say about how the world could and should be, addressing greed, charity, and--above all--love.Perhaps more than any other figure throughout history, the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth have been misquoted, misinterpreted, and misrepresented. If you want to follow Jesus and allow this devotion to reshape your life in the image of Christ, you need to learn about Him in the Bible, not on cable news specials, street tracts, or the sermons of a preacher. Go to the source. Study His words. Struggle with them. Bring them into your life.
The Christian Bible, taken by most Christians to be the ""Word of God,"" is a document with a fascinating and a storied history worth studying. It didn't appear out of thin air in 20th Century American English. The more you read in previous translations, the closer you may be to the real messages of Christ in the Bible. Be careful whose revision (interpretation) you accept and believe.
Interpreters word choices can change the sense, feel, and impact of crucial texts and make a text seem more casual. Are these new, subjective interpretations, with shades of meaning, when you want trusted, objective translations? Jesus had no guile/treachery in Him (but interpreters?). Scriptures tell us of Jesus who said ""I am the truth, the life, the way."", and also promised peace and freedom, saying: ""the truth shall set you free"".

, If you're just starting to learn about Jesus and want to deepen your understanding and your relationship, start praying.


There's no right way to do it: you don't need to do it out loud, but you can if it feels right to you. You could look into getting a Christian prayer book if you like formal prayers, but explore meditating and reaching out to Jesus to see how it feels. Confide, communicate, and question.

, When you feel more confident and learned in your beliefs, share it with others. Don't hide your belief, but wear it as a badge.


If others are unwilling to listen or learn, don't thrust your belief onto them. Too many arguments occur as a result of an unwillingness to listen. You don't have to convince someone that you're right, or that they're long. Talk about your relationship with Jesus, and what you've learned from your studies. That's the best you can do, and the most honest approach.

, Churches can only exist and flourish with small donations from the attendees. Try to share a bit with your church, and donate some time to help it be successful.


Invite others to your church to grow the fold. You don't have to guilt people into it, but rather treat it as a fun activity and invite people: ""Would you like to come to church with me this weekend? I'd love to have you visit with me.""
If you're a tradesman, consider donating some of your time to the upkeep of the church. If you know about electrical work, that's one less thing that'll need to come out of the till. If you can lead a prayer group, that's one less thing for the pastor to worry about. Take on responsibilities to become a stronger member of the church.

, As you expand your belief and your relationship with Jesus, it's important to avoid getting stagnant in your way of life. It's easy to think we've got everything figured out, that all our problems are solved. We've got Jesus! It's easy to become small-minded.


To avoid ruts, get out of your comfort zone every now and then. See other places, read other types of books, embrace counter-arguments and other ways of thinking. Be a thoughtful and righteous person in the world.
Many churches organize mission trips, often with Habitat for Humanity, building houses or performing other services in many regions of the world. Consider organizing a mission trip at your church, or participating in one. It can be a moving experience.

, You will never have been so happy in your life. Why not jump into the arms of a loving God? Though the storms rage high and the dark clouds roll, you don't need to worry. You'll be sheltered, safe within the arms of God.

Perhaps you have recently joined from another church, and you want to be baptized according to your adopted tradition. The reasoning behind your choice will determine many of the details.


Remember that you are doing this for you. An adult baptism can deepen your relationship with God, and it can act as a lodestone for your faith. If it feels like the right choice, then perhaps it is the right choice.If you are joining the church from a different Christian denomination, but you have already been baptized in the original denomination: you may not need to get baptized again, depending on the denominations in question. The United Methodist Church, for instance, recognizes prior baptisms from all other Christian denominations except for Mormonism., Set a date. Invite friends and family. Decide whether you want a big, fancy event, or an intimate affair.

Read the Bible and study it daily with an open mind.,
Do not rebel against God's straight and narrow way: Being rebellious, people may see the light, but love darkness instead; they might seek teachers who never remind them of their own ways and things that they do -- as they continue in the ""wide"" path to destruction.,

""The path of the righteous is level; O upright One, you make the way of the righteous smooth...""Remember, this will not be easy.,

""Rebellions comes in many forms: if you know what is right in the eye of God, as revealed by his word in the Bible, for example, and fail to do them, it is rebellion; if you know what is wrong, and continue to do so, it is rebellion.

, God's way is narrow and few there are that find it, whereas the road to destruction is wide, and many there are that walk therein.
Also, it is written that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. To find the narrow way, you must dismiss all things that block the way.

(Matthew 3:5, 6, NKJV)

, Many believe that it is not enough to merely confess your sins – you must truly repent for what you have done. Think about what it means to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior.Ask your priest for help. If you aren't sure how to make the step from confession to repentance, ask your pastor/priest or a knowledgeable member of your church for advice.
On Pentecost after the resurrection of Jesus, many people were amazed by the Holy Spirit. When they asked Peter what to do, he replied, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.” (Acts 2:38, NKJV)., The final prerequisite for baptism is that you really, truly believe. Search deep within yourself to make sure that you are ready for this decision. If you believe that you are ready, then you are ready. Express your intention to become a fully-baptized Christian.There are no age restrictions for baptism. In Christianity, any human being who has not yet been baptized can receive the sacrament of baptism. It is said that baptism leaves a permanent mark on your soul, such that you never need to be ""re-baptized."""

Enjoy the mental health benefits of Sahaja yoga.",How to Meditate in Sahaja Yoga," Self-realization is the foundation of Sahaja yoga. It is based on an experience called the “Kundalini awakening,” which can occur within all human beings. After going through the various steps, you should encounter a transformation that makes you a more moral, united, integrated, and balanced person.If you successfully accomplish self-realization, you should be able to feel the divine power sweep over your body in the form of a breeze that passes over your hand and head.
It is believed by its practitioners that this experience has been witnessed by hundreds of thousands of people in over ninety countries worldwide.;
, The subtle system is made up of nadis and chakras. Nadis, or channels, carry energy throughout the body while chakras, or “wheels,” are the centers of energy located in the body. There are three primary vertical channels of energy and seven major chakras. This system can only be activated with a Kundalini awakening. The Kundalini awakening simultaneously cleans and balances the system and enlightens and purifies the chakras.Each chakra has spiritual abilities. The chakras always exist in the body and can never be destroyed but they do not manifest themselves until the Kundalini is awakened.
When the Kundalini rises and nourishes the chakras, our bodies automatically become dynamic, creative, confident, and very humble.

, Chakras are called wheels because this is where the energy spins with frequency, similar to a galaxy of planets spinning on their axis. Chakras are located along the spinal cord region and supervise and maintain the perfect operation of the bodily system. What attracts and disturbs the chakras influences their sensitivity and performance. Self-realization will enlighten the central nervous system, allowing you to feel each of the seven chakras.The mooladhara, or first chakra, will help you rediscover your innocence, and innate and intuitive wisdom.
The second chakra, or swadisthana, your creative instincts will be stimulated.
At the nabhi, third chakra, the realization of your accomplishments will be satisfied
Your heart will be opened along with compassion for family and friends during the fourth chakra, or anahat.
Good communication, a sense of perspective, and a balanced approach to stressful situations will be summoned during vishuddhi, or the fifth chakra.
At the sixth chakra, or agnya, your forgiveness will allow you to move forward with life without grudges or hatred. You will be able to identify with your freedom and power of your inner self.
Finally, the last chakra, sahasrara, will allow you to have a transformative connection that enables you to understand a deeper and truer meaning and purpose to your life.

, There are three main nadis: the central channel (Sushumna Nadi) also known as the “middle path” because it resides and is located along the spine to the highest chakra; the left channel (Ida Nadi), also called the “moon channel,” is located along the left side of the body providing the conduit for the energy of our desire; the right channel (Pingala Nadi), or “sun channel,” runs along the right side of the body and is responsible for active energy, and our mental and physical activities.The central channel coordinates the nervous system activities. It is not until the awakening of the Kundalini and its travel through the central channel and out through the top of the head that recognition occurs of the vastness of the subtle system.
The left channel is responsible for your state of joy, which is often blocked, covered, or tarnished because of the emotional and physical injuries experienced during your lifetime. The practice of Sahaja yoga is instrumental in removing these tensions and recovering the joy we experienced as small children growing up.
The right channel is easily blinded by ego and the need for more power and energy. When this happens, the left channel becomes weak and you take actions that dominate or disrupt the lives of others. Sahaja yoga will remove this negativity and restore balance between the channels and the chakras.

, Sahaja yoga provides the conscious awareness of subtle energy found in the body through true meditation. It is a natural awakening that has measurable beneficial effects on the body’s well-being without side effects, special exercises, chanting, or mantras. As Sahaja yoga has become more popular around the world, it has proven to be effective in people's lives everywhere, regardless of age, , sexual orientation, occupation, race, color, or creed.Find a comfortable place to sit down with little distraction. During the experience, your left hand will remain on your left lap with your palm facing up.
Your right palm will be used to touch certain parts of your body on the left side.
As you make the motions, keep your eyes closed during the entire experience so that you can keep your attention “inside.”
It is recommended that you take your shoes off since Mother Earth drains all negative energy through the feet.

, The divine power is easily awaken inside all of us during the performing of Sahaja yoga. During the experience, one can feel the divine vibration in their hands. You will also be able to feel a cool breeze on the top of your hands and head. These “vibrations” are believed to be divine energy so real that it can be captured on film.Put your right hand on your heart and then ask the Kundalini inside of you three times: “Mother, am I the spirit?”
Place your right hand under the ribs on the left-hand side of your body and ask the Kundalini three times: “Mother, am I my own master?”
After that, place your right hand on your left side just below the belt , gently press and ask the Kundalini inside your body six times: “Mother, please give me the pure knowledge.”
Then, put your right hand under your left ribs and say ten times: “Mother, I am my own master.”
Place you right hand over your heart and repeat to the Kundalini twelve times: “Mother, I am the pure spirit.”
Next, put your right hand between your neck and left shoulder while turning your head towards the right. Repeat sixteen times to the Kundalini: “Mother, I am not guilty at all.”
While placing your right hand on your forehead, bend your head down and say a few times: “Mother, I forgive everyone including myself.”
Then, put your right hand on the back of your head, push your head back and say, “Oh, Divine Power, if I have committed any mistakes, please forgive me.”
Finally, open your hand fully and press on the fontanelle bone area on top your head. Move it slowly clockwise seven times, moving your scalp in unison with your hand. Each time repeat: Mother, please give me my Self-Realization.""

, After you completed the meditation, take a moment to absorb your environment and to experience your feelings. By the time you finish, your feelings should be relaxed and your thoughts should have disappeared.This is considered the first step of meditation, or “thoughtless awareness,” when you were completely cognizant without thought, in a pure state of peaceful consciousness.
Now that you have reached this stage, you should feel the sensation of the cool breeze on the top of your hands and head. This is the Kundalini energy purifying the chakras in your body.
If you fail to experience the breeze, the most likely cause is you did not forgive everybody. Therefore, say “Mother, I forgive everyone” a few times and check for the cool breeze once again.

, Nourishing chakras produces lifelong improvement of your own personal qualities. Consistent Sahaja yoga practice will help you concentrate on which specific chakras need attention and how to develop the specific qualitative aspects associated with each chakra.Over time, you will develop into a more spiritual, subtler person with heightened awareness of the important virtues of life.
As you strengthen the state and condition of your channels and chakras, you will simultaneously recognize how your relationships, creativity, focus, productivity and decision-making ability all improve.
Taking control over your energy sources and the paths they travel through in your body will allow you to manage ill thoughts and feelings, regulate self-damaging emotions, and feelings of worthlessness. You will be better equipped to problem-solve.

, The inner calm that is part of the Sahaja yoga experience boosts your emotional resilience. This ensures your ability to cope with stress now and in the future. Sahaja yoga also helps to restore balance internally and externally in your life. It helps build self-esteem in relationships and accomplishments, repairs any negative feelings, and brings peace and contentment.Kundalini energy extends beyond the meditation period and into your daily life. Thus, you benefit from meditation, yoga, and self-realization.
Sahaja yoga helps you to self-regulate your attention and concentration on the present. It enhances your openness and curiosity.
You will quickly realize how you take time to make good decisions by analyzing your thoughts, feelings, and sensations as they occur resulting in increased self-awareness.
Communication with others will improve as your levels of compassion and empathy increase for yourself and for others. You become more cognizant of the flow of energy in the environment, in your mind, and through the eyes of others.

, Evidence from several clinical and neurobiological studies demonstrate the impact that meditation has on influencing brain chemical activities that regulate attention, mood, and emotions in positive ways. Studies indicate that Sahaja yoga increases positive emotions, reduces negative emotions, improves emotional flexibility and coping skills, and overall psychological stability.Cognitive improvements were also found in self-esteem, self-awareness, mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and self-realization.
Sahaja yoga also relieves anxiety, improves blood pressure,may help manage asthma,and may relieve depression.Stress relief is the base-level benefit for Sahaja yoga practitioners and some clinical results have confirmed that belief. It is believed that thoughtless awareness significantly improves the ability to cope with difficult events by reducing stress and boosting positive emotions.
Sahaja yoga confronts addiction and substance abuse by rewiring the old pleasure-reward-motivation patterns that the brain has learned over a lifetime. This helps eradicate bad habits.

Think about which components of wellness you want to work on, such as strength, flexibility, stamina, anxiety, and depression. You might also want to practice for your general well-being.
Consider writing down your goals for your practice. Update your goals frequently and add new goals to keep yourself challenged.For example, you could have a goal such as “practice more often” or “I want to master Lolasana.”;
, There are different styles and ways to practice yoga and there will always be more experienced yoga practitioners than you. It’s important to remember that yoga is neither a competition nor a traditional sport, but a personal practice of mindfulness, relaxation, and physicality that is meant to enrich your life and body.Anyone can practice and benefit from yoga. Integrating yoga into your routine can help improve your physical and mental health, even if you only practice for 10 minutes a day.It can take some time to find a specific style or school of yoga you enjoy. Similarly, finding the right teacher for you and your goals can take some trial and error.
Practice keeping an open mind and non-judgmental attitude. Instead of thinking, ""I'm not flexible, I'll be bad at yoga,"" realize that ""Yoga will help me improve my flexibility."" Remember that there is no competition in yoga. Every person has different abilities and the goal of yoga is to focus on yourself, not what others are doing., At a minimum, you will need a yoga mat. Consider having props such as a yoga belt, yoga block, and a large blanket or bolster, too.These pieces of equipment can help improve and deepen your yoga practice as well as making it more comfortable.You can buy mats and props at sporting goods stores, yoga studios, or at online yoga retailers.

, You'll want clothing that is comfortable and breaths easily. This can help you better achieve a full range of motion and flexibility and also keep you from tugging at overly tight clothing.


You don’t necessarily need special yoga clothing, but try wearing something comfortable that isn’t too tight. Women can wear leggings, a tank top, and a sports bra. Men can wear a pair of athletic shorts and a t-shirt.
As you try more complex poses you may want tighter pants and shirts that won't fall or move, distracting you in the process.
If you are doing Bikram yoga, which takes place in a heated room, or athletically intense yoga such as Jivamukti, make sure to wear light, breathable clothing that absorbs sweat.

, If you’ve decided to give yoga a try at home before going to a class, find a comfortable and quiet space in which to explore your yoga practice. Make sure you’ve got plenty of room to move and someway to close yourself off to the outside world.You’ll need a few inches on each side of your mat so that you don’t run into a wall or anything else.
Make sure the place you practice is quiet and calm so that no one can disturb your focus. You’ll also want someplace that is comfortable: a humid and chilly basement may not be the best option, for example.

, Doing a few rounds of sun salutations, or Surya Namaskar, can effectively prepare your muscles and mind to practice yoga.There are three different variations of sun salutations. Do 2-3 rounds of Surya Namaskar A, B, and C to warm up. These different sun salutations can engage and condition your muscles and can help ensure a safe and more pliable practice., There are a wide variety of yoga poses, or asanas, that one can practice and they range from difficult and strenuous to simple and relaxing. Start your yoga practice by learning a few asanas that you can enjoy, feel comfortable executing, and which also fit your yoga goals.There are four different types of yoga poses: standing poses, inversions, backbends, and forward bends.Try one or two from each type to balance your practice.
Standing poses include mountain pose (Tadasana), tree pose (Vrksasana), and the Warrior Series (Virabhadrasana I, II, and III).
Inversions include handstand (Mukha Vrksasana) and headstand (Salamba Sirsasana.

Forward bends include seated forward bend (Paschimottanasana) and star pose (Tarasana).
End your practice in corpse pose (Savasana), which can help you enjoy the benefits of your yoga session.Hold each asana for 3-5 breaths.Always balance out asanas that favor one side by doing them on the opposite side.WikiHow has an excellent series of video tutorials for beginners here, and you can find thousands of poses online with a simple internet search.

, Yogic breathing, or pranayama, is one of the core skills of any yoga practice. Focusing on your breathing can deepen your asana practice, tune you into your own body, and allows you to relax.


Pranayama can help your body distribute oxygen to its different parts. The goal is to breath deeply by inhaling and exhaling completely and in a balanced manner through your nose. For example, you would inhale for 4 breaths, hold for 2 counts, and then exhale completely for four breaths. You can vary the counts according to your abilities.You want to get the most out of your yogic breathing, so sit upright, with your shoulders back, and refrain from slouching. Breath slowly and evenly by focusing from your stomach, pulling in your belly to expand you lungs and rib cage.You can also try Ujjayi breathing, which can help you flow through your practice more effectively. You do Ujjayi breathing by inhaling and exhaling evenly through your nose and making a slight sound like the sea when you breathe.

, No matter what Asanas, Pranayam, or goals you choose for your yoga practice, it helps to practice as often as you can. Even if you can only spare 10-15 minutes, the more often you practice, the more you can learn and reap the benefits of yoga.


Try playing music, lighting a candle, or going outside to relax yourself and forget about other concerns., Yoga has evolved into a many different styles and practices, each of which has a different focus. Try different types and instructors until you find the ones you enjoy the most.Ask yourself what you want to achieve through yoga, considering various questions and potential practices that can help answer them.Do I want something that can strengthen, tone, and condition my body? You might want to try Vinyasa, Ashtanga, or Jivamkuti.Do I want something to stretch tight muscles? Try Bikram, Iyengar, Kundalini, or Hatha.Do I want to relax my body? Try restorative, yin, Sivananda or Jivamukti.Do I want to invigorate my mind?

An instructor should have a positive and inclusive attitude and energy.An instructor should possess a well-developed knowledge of the philosophy, practice, and history of yoga.
An instructor should offer constructive feedback and guidance when it is needed or requested., Every yoga studio offers styles of yoga as well as a different energy. Some studios offer food and tend to be more social, whereas some studios of groups may leave more time for introspection.Consider the level of the other members. Do you want to be mentored by the other, more experienced students in your class or would you like to learn together with other people at your level? A good studio will offer different levels of classes for every type of student from beginner to advanced to even pre- or post-natal.
Most yoga studios let you take your first class for free, so experiment with the different studios near you to find a studio and instructor that you like. You also don’t have to limit yourself to one studio or instructor. Varying your yoga classes can also help you improve.

, Many yoga studios offer free classes for people who agree to sit at the reception desk, sweep the studios, or clean the locker rooms. Inquire at your local yoga studio if they allow these arrangements -- they are a great way to save money and become a part of your local yoga community. , While the feedback and motivation provided by a class is one of the best ways to learn, you can learn new poses and techniques through a wealth of online sources. Yoga specific sites and apps contain thousands of videos detailing any type of yoga practice you can imagine.


A quick internet search will reveal poses for every skill level for free.
Make sure to check the qualifications of any online teachers or services. You want to find a class that is taught by a certified instructor.
Some sites offer one-on-one instruction with a professional yoga instructor through a web camera if you cannot make it to a yoga studio.

, A solid yoga practice includes setting an intention. By taking a few seconds to dedicate your practice to something or someone, you may have a more fulfilling practice.


Lightly touch the bases of your palms, then the palms themselves, and finally your fingers to make prayer hands. You can leave a small space between your palms if you like to let energy flow.
If you don’t know what your intention is, consider something as simple as “letting go.”

, After you feel comfortable with your yoga practice, try extending the duration of your practice by holding each pose a bit longer and flowing seamlessly between asanas. Add new and more challenging poses as you are able.Many yoga classes are between 60 and 90 minutes, so you could set your practice around that length.

, You may want to strengthen the intensity of your practice as you become comfortable with your routine. This can be done easily by holding each pose a little longer and by challenging yourself to sink deeper into challenging poses.


Poses that involve lunges or squats can be taken a bit lower.
You can increase the speed of transitions between asanas to create more intensity.
You can also integrate more difficult asanas from each of the four types of poses. For example, you may want to try tripod headstand (Sirsasana II) instead of regular headstand., One of the best ways to deepen your yoga practice is to increase the number of days you practice. You can safely build up to 5-7 days per week.If you make yoga a part of your daily routine, its positive effects can benefit your physical and mental health., Many people like to begin and their practice with a chanting or meditation session. This can help dismiss distracting thoughts, focus on your breath and energy, and raise your awareness of your mind and body.Consider starting your meditation and/ or chant with an ""aum"", which is the most elemental sound.
If you chant, you can feel mantra’s vibrations in your lower belly. If you can’t feel this sensation, try sitting more upright.
You can choose other mantras as well. Maha mantra, which is also called either the great mantra or Hare Krishna, can help you achieve salvation and peace of mind.Repeat the entire mantra as many times as you like. It’s words are: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.Let your thoughts come and whenever they arise. This will teach you to focus and let go of anything you can’t control.
Any time you need to refocus your mind, you can repeat “let” with every inhalation and “go” with every exhalation.
Meditation takes consistent practice and is an important part of yoga. You will have good days and bad days and accepting this is part of the journey.

, If you started doing yoga with a single goal—to become healthy or to find a mindful way to de-stress—try integrating another purpose into your practice. If you have been focusing on either the body or the mind, try to start focusing on the body and the mind together.


You may want to add chanting or meditation to your practice to help you focus more deeply on your practice.

, Yoga has countless benefits and with by sticking with it, you can reap them. Keep in mind that yoga is a personal practice: it is not about whether or not you can do a particular pose exactly like the person on a video or in a picture. It's about the journey towards the asana, enlightenment, or whatever your goal is. Keep an open mind and heart at all times."

Do not eat meat, fish or eggs.,
Do not gamble or accumulate money.,
Do not engage in illicit sex life.,
Do not take any drugs.",How to Contact Krishna2," These will pollute your body, which is a temple. Your body is badly affected by these, and the true devotee abstains from all bad foods to purify his senses. To take the first step on the path, one must only consume healthy food and drink in order to purify the body that Krishna resides in, and resides within Krishna.

, Live a simple life. This means finding enjoyment in the smaller things in life; a walk in the park with a loved one, thunderstorms on a summer night, a trip to a vegetarian restaurant. These are all gifts from Krishna that we should enjoy rather than living beyond what is essential. Much joy is a result of this path, for He will provide all you need. In order to take the third step on the path, one should stop buying things that do not benefit your spiritual growth, give freely, and offer all excess wealth to Krishna.

, This means abstinence from all sexual activity outside of married life. This path only ends in sadness and is only a distraction on the path to God. To overcome lust for the first time is the third step to find Krishna.

, This includes alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine. These not only have physically adverse effects, they also cloud the clear mind we all seek. Abstain from anything addictive. As the oracle at Delphi states, ""Know thyself. Nothing to excess"". Removing these harmful substances from your life is the fourth and final step on the path to Krishna.

Associate with devotees of Krishna.,
Devote your actions and the results of your actions to Shri Krishna.,
Do no harm to any living being.

",How to Contact Krishna3," More advanced devotees will guide you to the right path. Find a guru, or teach yourself of the path of devotion to Shri Krishna.

Sacrifice the ego (Shaucha -Purification/cleaning).,
Practice self discipline (Tapas).,
Read daily (Svadhyaya).,
Be Happy and content (Santosha).",How to Do the Ten Ethic Principles of Patanjali (Yoga Sutra)," That means no killing other beings. Be meek. Be peaceful.;
, Practice truthfulness (Satya). Live in the truth. Basically, be honest with yourself and others. Also no little lies of convenience. A lie is permissible only in well justified situations, for example, if you save with a lie the life of another human being. A Yogi is silent in doubt . Those who consistently lives in the truth radiate truth. Their fellow men trust them.

, That means not stealing, not cheating. A Yogi is in professional life generally honest. He does not seek unwarranted advantage, but he is looking for fair trade.

, Live in the spiritual focus (in the light/in God = Brahman). Do not serve the money (outer luck) but the inner happiness (God, Brahman, enlightenment). Be centered in your inner happiness and peace.

, Be moderate in external enjoyment and consumption. A spiritual person lives modestly outwardly and inwardly rich. A Yogi uses his energy not in outer actions, but lives so peaceful that it turns inward and cleanse his body from the inside. One day, he lives permanently in the light (the cosmos energy).

, Thus we do not lose our spiritual path, it is necessary that we remind ourselves again and again to our spiritual goal. We can worship an image (Goddess, Shiva, Patanjali), we can bow before a statue (Buddha, Jesus, Shiva) or speak a mantra (prayer). What is your spiritual goal? Send light to all beings, and wish a happy world.

, The way into the light passes through the crucifixion of the ego. Without a crucifixion there is no enlightenment. True sacrifice is an art. He who sacrifices too much braced themselves internally. Who sacrifices too little, does not solves his tensions. How do you get inner peace today? ""I let go of my false desires. I take things as they are. My sacrifice today is ... ""

, Have a clear goal, a clear life plan and a clear way of practicing. Tapas means to lead a disciplined life. Follow your inner wisdom and you'll win on your spiritual path.

, Sit straight up. Put your palms together in front of you with your fingers pointed upwards. Close your eyes lightly., Start by inhaling your breath. Break your inhale into four parts where you’re able to fill your lungs completely on the 4th part.One inhale broken into four parts means that you pause during your inhale four times. Your inhale will seem like four inhales, but without any exhales in-between.

, Once you’ve filled your lungs, start the exhale. Just like the inhale, break your exhaling breath into four parts. You’re lungs should be empty by the 4th part of the exhale.One exhale broken into four parts is the same as the inhale. While exhaling, pause four times so it seems like you’re exhaling four times, but without any inhales.

, Every time you do a part breath on both the inhale and exhale, pull your belly button area in towards your spine. This means you’ll do this movement four times on an inhale and four times on an exhale., Each breath (an inhale and an exhale) should take a total of 7-8 seconds. Continue breathing using this method for up to 3 minutes before relaxing., If you’re having trouble concentrating on your breathing because you’re distracted, add a mantra. The simple mantra “Sa - Ta - Na - Ma” can be done once for an inhale and once for an exhale. Each syllable of the mantra would coincide with a part of the breath.Because this is a breathing exercise you won’t be able to say the mantra out loud, instead just say it in your head.
The mantra “Sa - Ta - Na - Ma” means “Infinity - Life - Death - Rebirth.""

, After you’ve done the breathing exercise for about three minutes, end by doing one last big inhale. At the same time push the palms of your hands together hard and hold them together like that for about 10-15 seconds.Pushing your hands together while breathing inwards should make your body feel tense. This is done on purpose.
Relax your hands and exhale with force.
Repeat the inhale (with hands pressed together) and exhale one more time each.

",How to Do Savasana (Corpse Pose)," Keeping a peaceful mind is key to correctly performing Savasana. You should look for a quiet, dark place that will allow you to focus on your breathing and meditation.You might need to move to another room than the one you used to perform your previous poses if you have many distractions or can't relax. If you are in a class, your instructor may darken the lights in the room as you relax.
Make sure the room is a comfortable temperature. Extreme temperatures in heat or cold could distract you from the mental benefits of the pose.
You must also have a comfortable surface to lie on. Generally, you will need a yoga mat or towels to give you a buffer on hardwood floors. You might want to avoid practicing this pose on concrete or tile floors without a mat.;
, You will have to lie down fully in the Savasana pose. This might mean your legs will extend past your mat. Make sure you have enough space to complete the pose.If you are in a crowded yoga class, test lying down on your mat before the beginning of the class so you will know where to position the mat.

, While the Savasana pose has been shown to have wonderful benefits for the back and abdominal muscles, you shouldn't just complete this pose for the physical benefits.


Remember the mental benefits of Savasana as you perform this pose. Yoga gives you the power to control and minimize negative thoughts that can lead to stress, anxiety or depression., As you recline on your yoga mat, place your feet spread slightly apart from each other. Put your arms at your side with your palms facing up. Your fingers should be curled up naturally.Close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Breathe from your diaphragm, which is in your lower belly. Push out the muscles in your diaphragm as you inhale. Inhale for five counts. Then exhale for another five counts.
Repeat the breathing sequence until you feel relaxed., Inhale deeply as you tense your body. Tighten your buttocks and raise your legs slightly off the ground.

Be sure not to put extra pressure on your lower back; lift from your thighs and calves instead.
Clench your fists and raise your arms as well.Tense your forehead and suck in your cheeks. Imagine your are compressing all of the energy in your body into your extremities -- toes, fingers, and your nose.

, Exhale, breathing inward as you release the pose. Lower your legs and unclench your fist as you relax.


Let go of any anxious, stressful or negative thoughts while you are performing this pose. Imagine your mind emptying like you are pouring water from a jug.Although you should try to relax your body all at once, don't feel pressure to rush into relaxation. Gradually breathe out and feel your body relax into the floor.
There is no time limit for this pose. If you have completed 45-60 minutes of yoga exercises, try relaxing in the Savasana pose for 10 minutes to fully appreciate your session.It is not unusual to fall asleep in this pose, but make sure that you do not have an important meeting or event afterward. Set a timer on a phone or nearby clock if you have to stop by a certain time.

, Begin by wiggling your toes and fingers. Open your eyes last.


Imagine that you are opening up to a new body as you come out of the pose. Savasana should give you a sense of renewal and rebirth., Pull your knees into your chest, wrap your arms around them, and give them a squeeze.


This pose is also meant to stretch out your muscles after your have tested them with a long yoga session. It is especially effective at protecting your knees from injury., Turn onto your right side. Then, slowly push yourself to an upright position using your right elbow.Maintain your breathing so you exhale as you push up onto your right elbow.

Look within yourself.,
Inner joy appears in a person when the tensions (Samskaras) in body and soul have been dissolved.,
Vary your routine.,
Meditation can be practiced either in a sitting position or lying down.,
Strive to get rid of inner conflict.,
Learn the five activities.,
Meditate.,
Read spiritual books.,
Exercise.,
Do good...for yourself and others.,
Enjoy your life.,
Get rest.,
Again, look within.",How to Be a Hatha Yogi," Spiritually, humans can be compared to onions. Tensions and inner conflicts (inner stress) must be dissolved layer by layer. When one layer is peeled away, the next quickly appears at the surface until the inner core is revealed. At this point, a lasting inner joy is found, and the Yogi or Yogini lives in light.;
, We need exercises for the body (Yoga, Meditation) and for the soul (reflection, Positive Thinking). Buddha developed a very simple yet genius practice. This consisted of “sitting, going, and thought practice.” This is the center of a successful Hatha Yoga Practice. You need body work (Yoga, walking), mental work (reflection, reading, praying, mantra) and meditation (sitting or lying). And everything in balance, in the right moment and with the right technique.

, When one varies one’s activities between body work, mental work and meditation, the inner conflict and tension can be done away with. When a person only meditates, the spirit becomes dull and listless. Routine movement makes the spirit clear, keeps the body healthy and gives the person inner energy. If you only go or do Yoga asanas, the mind is restless. Inner happiness comes from inner peace. If the body is kept very quiet, you can get into deeper dimensions of meditation.

, Some people can meditate better when sitting, others when lying down. Those who fall asleep easily when lying down, should meditate by sitting. Those who cannot sit straight for a long time should practice meditation lying down.

, In addition to periods of sitting and relaxing in combination with movement, working with the thoughts is important in getting rid of inner conflict. A Yogi or Yogini should develop his or her thoughts with love, wisdom, and self-discipline. He or she should learn to bring the thoughts into stillness, until the thoughts are always tranquil. Then he or she only thinks when thinking is required.

, This basic model of stress resolution can be extended to the way of the five activities. The five activities are: lying down (or sitting and meditating), reading, walking (or Yoga asanas), doing good for others (work), and to enjoy life.

, There are two levels of meditation. The first level consists of purifying himself through visualizations, mantras, and breath exercises to activate the Kundalini energy. Then you stop all thoughts. The spirit comes entirely to rest. You let the thoughts and feelings come and go as they would. Suddenly, peace and happiness appears.

, Reading spiritual books helps to cleanse the spirit by helping let go of inner conflict. Everyone can read books to obtain spiritual inspiration. There are thousands of spiritual books available.

, Another activity of those seeking enlightenment is movement, particularly cardiovascular sports such as walking, running, biking, swimming. Yoga is also a good form of movement. Even the Dalai Lama rides a stationary bike every day, for a half an hour. Swami Shivananda likes to take walks. There are appropriate exercises for everyone. Yogis living in caves developed the very well-known sun salute, for example.

, The fourth activity is that of Karma Yoga (doing good). Karma Yoga opens the heart, gives inner power, and develops the consciousness towards all-encompassing love. Karma Yoga can be practiced one to six hours per day. Swami Shivananda recommended one hour, while Sai Baba is for six. Yogi Nils found three to four hours per day to be a good amount for him. Karma yoga can also be practiced by working people, but of course money is needed to exist in today’s world.

, The fifth activity consists of enjoying life. We should bring joy into our lives. That opens our hearts, and brings light inside us. Everyone is predisposed towards something. You can listen to music, eat something delicious, read a good book, watch a movie, find time for your favorite creative hobbies, and so forth. It is important though, to pay attention to the amount with which we busy ourselves with enjoyment. Too much of a good thing is not a good thing, too little makes life sad.

, Also, too much direct contact with other people during the development of inner happiness should be avoided. A yogi should find out how much contact with others is good for him or her. At a certain point, physical rest can cause the energy of a person to go inward. The person no longer has to direct oneself towards outer activities, and puts more worth on the inner spiritual cleansing, the dissolving of inner conflict, and the development of inner happiness.

, This turning point must be discovered by each yogi for him or herself. It is difficult to find and difficult to hold onto. Life energy tends toward an excess of activity or towards dullness. Both need to be avoided with daily exercised self-discipline. When we keep inner calm, inner happiness appears. We can develop our true selves, and our sense of life.

Study the Bhagavad Gita.,
Read the Vedas.,
Understand the four principles.,
Practice Bhakti Yoga.",How to Become a Hare Krishna1," This is the primary text that you must study. This text is a dialogue between Arjuna and Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna explains the duties of being a warrior and answers questions about various topics such as:The soul
One’s relationship with God
Bhakti Yoga
Karma Yoga
Gyaan Yoga
Hatha-yoga;
, The Vedas were written by Lord Vyasadeva and cover a wide range of topics such as medicine, yoga and meditation techniques, science, government, etc. Four main books (Rig Veda, Sama Veda , Yajur Veda, Atharva Veda) make up this text. The Vedas provide you with knowledge that has been passed down from masters to disciples.The Vedas are filled with hymns of praise to the gods and instructions and details for making sacrifices and the purposes of the sacrifices.In addition to Vedas, there are Upavedas (sciences that are not directly related to Vedic study) such as holistic medicine and music that you can read.

, The four principles should not be seen as restrictions but as a path of freedom and development. These principles guide how you interact with other people and the world. The principles are cleanliness, mercy, austerity, and truthfulness.Keep your mind, body, and soul clean through daily hygiene practices, reading the scriptures, and chanting.
Be merciful and kind to all living things.
Only take what you need and never take things using violence.
Never lie or gamble.

, Bhakti yoga means the path of dedication and love. The Bhagavad Gita describes physical exercise of yoga and the spiritual nature of yoga. Bhakti Yoga moves beyond the physical and is focused on living a life of dedication and service to Lord Krishna. Bhakti Yoga is developed through:Chanting
Studying sacred texts
Spending time with other Hare Krishna devotees
Upholding the four principles
Eating a vegetarian diet

Recite the Maha Mantra.,
Use japa beads.,
Prepare an altar.,
Attend temple.",How to Become a Hare Krishna2," Chanting the mantra gives you peace and connects you with Lord Krishna. Say the following words, “Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare.”The three forms of meditation are japa, kirtan, and sankirtan.


In japa, you meditate quietly alone with your beads.
In kirtan, you meditate by singing the mantra and with musical instruments.
If you perform kirtan in a group, it is called sankirtan.

, Japa beads are similar to a rosary beads. When you chant alone, the japa beads can help you focus and count the number of times that you have chanted the mantra. A strand of japa beads has 108 small beads and head bead. As you chant the full mantra, roll one of the small beads between your thumb and middle finger. Begin the mantra again as you roll the next bead. Repeat this process 108 times until you reach the head bead again. You will have completed one round of japa once you reach the head bead again.Work your way up to chanting 16 rounds per day.
It is important that you chant every single day. Even if you can only complete one round of chants, try to commit to one round a day.
Your beads are sacred and should never be placed on the ground on anything that is dirty. If you want to carry them with you, place them in a special bag.

, An altar is not required, but it can enhance your japa and kirtana. An altar is a special place that you set aside for meditation. Imagine where you would seat a guest that you really loved and adored. This is what your altar should look like. Some items that you might use to decorate your altar include:A picture of Srila Prabhupada (the spiritual master/guru)
A picture of Lord Chaitanya (the incarnation of God for tis age) nad his four associates
A picture of Lord Krishna
Any items that you find beautiful
Comfortable chairs and pillows

, Going to temple allows you to participate in congregational worship and sankirtan. Worship service is usually on a Sunday night. Visit the ISKCON website to find a temple near you.There are some devotees that live in the temple. However, you can still live outside of the temple, yet live out Krishna’s teaching in your everyday life.

"
"
Become a vegetarian.,
Spend time with other devotees.,
Follow the guidelines.",How to Become a Hare Krishna3," As a Hare Krishna, your relationship with food is influenced by the principles of compassion, non-violence, and balanced living. Because of this, you should not eat meat, fish, or eggs. Killing animals for food produces bad karma. By not eating meat, you are stopping some of the karma associated with violence.In addition to being a vegetarian, you should also encourage others to be vegetarian and support the ethical treatment of animals.
Also avoid overeating. Only eat what you need., It is important to spend time with other like-minded individuals. It will help you grow spiritually and be a source of encouragement. You need to be able to study the sacred texts and chant with other people.Spending a lot of time with non-devotees can slow down your progress.
You can find other devotees through Facebook, Krishna Conscious discussion boards, or by visiting the ISKCON website.
Going to a temple is the best way to meet other devotees.

, Do not have illicit sex, gamble, or use any intoxicating substances. These things are more focused on physical pleasure and get in the way of your spiritual growth. Your spiritual needs should always be more important than your physical wants and desires.


Illicit sexual activities include any sexual enjoyment outside of marriage that is not for procreation. You should also be married to another devotee. The only allowable sexual activity is vaginal sex without the use of any contraceptives.Gambling includes playing cards, lotteries, dice, casino games, betting, and wagering. When you gamble, you are trying to beat the odds. However, Krishna has already set everything in order. When you are trying to beat the odds, you are actually trying to question the order that Krishna has already established.
Do not take any substances that can alter your mind or body such as alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, illicit drugs. These substances only are used as a form of escape and only offer temporary pleasure.

Decide what type of hatha yoga you would like to teach.,
Research different schools.,
Find a local teacher.,
Complete a program.,
Get certified.,
Apply at a studio or gym.,
Figure out other places to teach.,
Start your own studio.,
Make a budget.,
Don't quit your day job yet.,
Expand beyond group classes.,
Find your niche market.,
Take some business and marketing classes.,
Market yourself.",How to Become a Hatha Yoga Instructor," Hatha yoga is a broad term that describes most of what is considered yoga in the United States. In other words, hatha yoga refers to the type of physical yoga that involves moving from pose to pose. Within hatha yoga, you'll find a wide range of sub-sects that you can specialize in.Hatha also sometimes refers to the most basic type of yoga, if a class is advertised as ""hatha."" You can focus on that type of yoga, but most schools will want to take you through other types of yoga, too.
To figure out what type of yoga you want to specialize in, consider taking classes in different styles. For instance, Bikram yoga is done in a room heated to 105 degrees Fahrenheit, where you go through a set series of 26 poses, while Iyengar focuses on finding the right alignment when doing poses.
Vinyasa, on the other hand, focuses on the flow from one movement to the next, while restorative yoga helps students find poses through more passive means, such as props. These types are just a few of the ones you can study.Specializing can help you find a niche in the market that isn't filled. With so many people turning to yoga instruction, it's important to be doing something a little different to draw people in.;
, Most cities have places where you can get certification to teach, but you can also journey to the US headquarters for the type of yoga you've chosen, which are located throughout the United States. For example, the main school for Ishta yoga, which integrates hatha, tantra, and ayurveda yoga, is headquartered in Manhattan.Once you've chosen the type of yoga you want to do, try to find the headquarters for that type of yoga in the US.
If you can't travel to one of the main schools, you can take classes with a local teacher.

, An alternative to going to one of the main schools is finding a local place where you can get training. If you live in a major city, you should have a number of options available to you for being trained as an instructor, as many yoga instructors also teach other people wanting to become instructors. However, don't be afraid to shop around. The main objective is finding a teacher you connect with, so you can get as much out of your yoga training as possible.Try taking classes at a few different places to find someone you really like. Look for people that teach both regular classes and instructor classes, so you can find someone who can teach you.
Most teachers and studios advertise yoga training programs. However, if you find a teacher you like, you can just ask if he or she teaches training programs. You could say, ""I really connect with your teaching style. I'd also like to become a yoga instructor. Do you teach instructor classes?""

, Whichever type you choose, you need to complete a program and become certified. Usually programs range from 200 to 500 hours that you must complete. You start with the 200 hour program, which enables you to teach at most studios. Once you've taught for awhile, you may want to continue your training with a 500-hour program.Most programs cost about $3,000 or more.
You can complete your time in an intensive training program, over the course of a couple of months, or choose one that spreads it out over half a year or longer.
Make sure the place you do your program is a Registered Yoga School (RYS), which is a certification through the Yoga Alliance, the main yoga certification agency in the United States. This means you are paying to have your name placed on a teachers registry and the name of the school is also on that registry. There are many other yoga teacher registries in the U.S. ,Yoga Alliance is not the only one.

, The main certification in the United States is through the Yoga Alliance. Basically, once you complete your program at a RYS, you can apply to be nationally certified as a Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT). The certification is important if you want to teach at a yoga studio.Mainly, you present the Yoga Alliance with your certificate of completion from your school.
You also must pay a fee to be certified.
If you're completing the 500-hour program, you'll need to also complete a review of your school to receive your certification.

, Most gyms and studios are always looking for new instructors. All you need to do is go in, talk to the manager, and drop off your resume. However, in some areas, there's an overabundance of teachers, so you'll need to get more creative. This means finding a studio, and becoming a serious student. Most studios will also have you do karma yoga, where you put the time in teaching for no payment. There is an equal exchange as you donating your time to gain experience and perfecting your teaching and this also helps out the studio. Check what different studios offer as far as pay. Some pay a flat rate, while others pay per student. Others may offer a combo of the two options. New teachers may be asked to put in karma teaching. Be ready for an odd schedule. You'll likely teach a number of early morning classes, as well as quite a few after-work hours classes.
You'll also probably be running from one studio to the next, so be prepared to be on the go., You don't need to be connected to a studio to teach classes. You can teach a wide variety of other places with the blessing of the organization. For instance, art museums, churches, parks, retreat centers, homes, and offices all make perfectly acceptable places to teach. You just need to put yourself out there.When it comes to some place like a park, you may need to reserve space, depending on the park.
As far as places like churches and art museums, you need to approach the person in charge of events for the organization. Have a prepared speech about what you're willing to offer, such as a discounted rate to attendees, in exchange for use of the space.
You may need to pay for some spaces, but other places, such as offices, may let you use the space for free because you're providing a benefit for the employees. You could even offer a flat rate for the office, and pitch it as a benefit the boss could pay for. Come prepared with statistics about how yoga can improve focus in the office.

, Another option is to start your own studio. However, the initial costs can be fairly prohibitive, since you'll need to rent or buy a space to use. On the other hand, you can hire other people in the area to work there, and you'll be in control of how it's run.If you decide to run your own studio, understand that it may take you quite a while to get back the money you invested. If you don't have the money upfront, consider applying for a business loan to get the financing you need.
A good in-between option is setting up a studio in your home. You might need to make some slight renovations or at the very least, move stuff around, but it can be much more cost effective.

, It's important to know how much exactly you need to survive. Start by sitting down and figuring out what you need to live. Gather all your bills, and add them up. Make sure to add in gas and food, as you also need those to live.Once you have a total, add 30% on top of it account for emergencies and yearly expenses you may have forgotten about.
Don't forget to add in money for things like clothes and house or car maintenance.
Once you have your budget, figure out what you need to do to make that budget. See how many classes you'll need to teach or what other opportunities you'll need to create for yourself.

, You won't be instantly making the money you need to make to be a yoga instructor full-time, so it's best to keep your day job going while you can. You can still start teaching classes in the evening or before work, but you won't be completely dependent on your new source of income, which will help you cut down on stress.It takes patience to build up classes. Even if you're with a studio, people have to find you and figure out they like you. It may take you a year or more to build up to classes that are sold out., Many yoga instructors do not make enough to live on off of group classes. Therefore, you need to expand to other types of related instruction, such as private classes.Another option is teaching others for certification purposes, which can also be lucrative.Other options include offering things like retreats and workshops to your community, which can help boost your income.
You may also consider writing a book, which you can self-publish for a bit of side income (or even try to get published in a more traditional manner).

, Part of being successful as a yoga instructor is finding an area that no one else is filling in your community. For instance, you could offer yoga classes for moms and kids or for pregnant women. Maybe your niche market is yoga for elderly people, or a particular type of yoga that no else is doing. Figure out what's not being done in your area, and make a class that fills that need.


Look at which people are not being served. For instance, see which age groups don't have yoga specifically for them. Maybe certain parts of the city don't have an easily accessible yoga class.
Also consider what types of yoga aren't being done. If you can specialize, you may draw a bigger crowd.

, Once you have your certification, you can't just expect people to flock to you. You're going to need to draw them in, especially if you want to have your own studio or work out of your home. It's important to have the business and marketing skills to make your business work, and taking a few classes can help you in that area.Check with your local community college for business and marketing classes. Most of them will have basic classes for relatively cheap.
If you can't commit to semester-long classes, look to see if there are seminars or workshops in your area for marketing, which may only be a day or two.
You can also try taking free online courses. Many websites offer free courses taught by actual professors, such as Coursera or Princeton.

, You're also going to need to figure out how to market yourself, even if you are teaching at a studio. You can't just open a class and expect people to find you, especially if you're in a nontraditional space, such as a church. You have to let people know that you're there.You can use social media to your advantage by setting up accounts focused on your yoga practice. Start building relationships by interacting with other people, reblogging other content, and posting your own (useful) content before you start plugging your business. Keep plugging your business to about 10 percent of your posts.
You can also start a blog where you talk about yoga and the ways it can help people. If you're giving people useful content, they will eventually notice you.
Try advertising in newspapers, putting up fliers on community boards, and even buying booths at large events like craft fairs to get your name out there. At a craft fair, you could have a small yoga demonstration or just a place for people to come and relax and talk about yoga and meditation with you.

Change up what you chant.",How to Practice Yoga Daily," If you want to practice yoga every day, always have your yoga gear ready to practice at home or in the studio. This can help you from finding excuses to not practice daily.


You will need a yoga mat and may want props such as a yoga belt, yoga block, and a large blanket or bolster at hand, too.These pieces of equipment can help improve and deepen your yoga practice as well as making it more comfortable.You can buy mats and props at sporting goods stores, yoga studios, or at online yoga retailers.
You don’t necessarily need special yoga clothing, but try wearing something comfortable that isn’t too tight. Women can wear leggings, a tank top, and sports bra. Men can wear a pair of athletic shorts and a t-shirt.;
, While there is no best time to do yoga, many people like to practice at the same time every day. This can help you ensure that you practice every day.


Some people like to practice yoga first thing in the morning. Not only can this energize you, but can also keep you from making excuses to not practice later in the day. Others prefer practicing in the evening to help them sleep.
Some people find that keeping to a routine of the same time and same place each day is most beneficial. Your mind and your body will associate that time and place with yoga sessions, which can serve as great internal motivation. Be sure to pick a time when you know there will be no interruptions or distractions, such as early in the morning or late at night.
You can practice yoga for however long you like. It might be anything from a few rounds of sun salutations to a full 90 minutes session. You might consider practicing for different times each day so that you don’t burn out.

, Set a specific time for your yoga practice every day. Make sure all that electronics are turned off or unplugged, no one is coming over, and everyone in your household is either not home or otherwise occupied. Be clear to everyone that your yoga practice that is for you and you should not be disturbed except in an emergency.Many yoga classes are 60-95 minutes, but you may not be able to make that much time. Even if you only have 10 minutes per day, you can still reap the benefits of yoga.If you have children, try to find someone to watch them while you do your yoga practice. You could also do yoga during their naps or even consider inviting the kids do yoga with you! Even if you only have 10 minutes per day, you can still reap the benefits of yoga., You can try yoga at home or a in a professional studio. Either way, it’s important to find a designated space so that you can comfortably and easily dedicate yourself to your daily practice.


Make sure the place you choose to practice is peaceful and still so that no one can disturb your focus.
You can try different types of studios and yoga groups if you don’t want to practice at home.
Experiment with the different studios near you to find a studio and instructor that you like. You also don’t have to limit yourself to one studio or instructor. Varying your yoga classes can help you establish your practice and keep it from getting boring.
If you want to practice at home, make sure you’ve got plenty of room to move and a way to close yourself off to the outside world., Daily practice will start to flow through in evident changes in your life but it won't happen immediately. Sometimes you might feel as though you’re not progressing at all. Give it time and suddenly you may realize that your daily practice is beneficial and having a positive impact on the rest of your day.


Don't make a huge issue out of missing a day here and there. It happens, just pick up from where you left off. Body memory is powerful, so let your body ease back into it without allowing your mind to infect it with anxiety over missed practices!

, It is better to practice yoga every day for a few minutes than to push yourself into a long practice on an irregular basis. Do whatever asanas you like and perfect them before moving on to move difficult poses. Remind yourself that it is better that you're doing some yoga than none at all.


Avoid adopting a negative mindset in which you tell yourself you ""can't"" do certain poses. You can, it just may take some time. Practice regularly and build-up poses that lead in to the more difficult ones.

, “Sequencing,” or putting together asanas that make up a yoga practice, is one of the most difficult parts of practicing yoga, especially if you are doing it at home. Set up different sequence for yourself every day based on the basic formula that most yoga classes follow to help yourself get the most benefits from a practice and keep you from getting bored.Start your practice with a short meditation and chanting exercise to calm your mind and center your thoughts.Set an intention for your practice just before you begin to practice.Move from a warm up of sun salutations to standing poses, then progress through inversions, backbends, forward bends, and end with savasana, or corpse pose.Always end your practice with a final relaxation pose.
Consider having a mixture of easy and difficult sessions, as well as short and long practice times.

, You do not have to be able to do every yoga asana in existence to have an effective daily practice. Incorporating and mastering different poses from each of the four types of asana can help you put together a daily practice which won’t get boring or routine.Make sure to start with easier asanas and move on to more difficult poses as you master basic ones.Do asanas from each type of pose in the following order: standing poses, inversions, backbends, and forward bends.Add a twisting asana to neutralize and stretch your spine between backbends and forward bends if you like.Hold each asana for 3-5 breaths.Add standing poses such as vrksasna (tree pose) or the Warrior Series, which is known as Virabhadrasana I, II, and III.As you progress, you can incorporate other standing poses such as Utthita Trikonasana (Extended Triangle Pose) and Parivrtta Trikonasana (Revolved Triangle Pose).Add inversions including mukha vrksasana (handstand), on a wall until you have enough strength to hold yourself up.Gradually add forearm balance and salamba sirsasana (headstand) as your practice improves.Add backbends including aalabhasana (locust pose), bhujangasana (cobra pose), or setu bandha sarvangasana (bridge pose).Work up to dhanurasana (bow pose) and urdhva dhanurasana (full wheel or upward bow).Add a twist if you need a balance between backbends and forward bends. Twists can get quite deep, so start off with simple variations such as Bharadvajasana (Bharadvaja’s twist) before moving on to more difficult asanas such as ardha matsyendrasana (half lord of the fishes pose).Add forward bends such as paschimottanasana (seated forward bend), janu sirsasana (heat of the knee pose), or tarasana (star pose) and hold them each for 8-10 balanced breaths.Finish active practice with closing postures such as salamba sarvangasana (supported shoulderstand), matsyasana (fish pose), viparita karani (legs up the wall pose).End your practice in savasana (corpse pose) and enjoy the benefits of your yoga session., If you enjoy chanting mantras before or after your yoga practice, change up which mantra your singing to either mirror your daily intention or how you’re feeling that day. Each mantra has different vibrations and you want to find one that corresponds to your intention.


Repetition of mantras can help you disconnect from stress you may feel and also help keep you focused on your intention.
Some examples of powerful mantras include:
Om or aum is the most basic and powerful mantra you can chant. This universal mantra will create powerful, positive vibrations in your lower abdomen. It is often combined with the mantra “Shanti,” which means peace in Sanskrit.You can repeat aum as many times as you wish for your chanting.
Maha mantra, which is also called either the great mantra or Hare Krishna, can help you achieve salvation and peace of mind. Repeat the entire mantra as many times as you like. It’s words are: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.
Lokah samastha sukhino bhavantu is a mantra of cooperation and compassion and means “May all beings everywhere be happy and free, and may the thoughts, words, and actions of my own life contribute in some way to that happiness and to that freedom for all.” Repeat this mantra three or more times.Om namah shivaya is a mantra that reminds us of our own divinity and encourages self-confidence and compassion. It means “I bow to Shiva, the supreme deity of transformation who represents the truest, highest self.” Repeat the mantra three or more times."

Purify yourself and become happy.",How to Be a Yogi," You are a yogi or a yogini if you practice yoga for health, beauty, strength, relaxation, or healing. You are a yogi or yogini if you practice yoga for inner peace, happiness and enlightenment. You are a yogi or yogini if you are enlightened. Enlightenment means to live in God, in the light, in a cosmic consciousness. , In modern yoga, your religion can be your preference. Yoga teaches the unity of all religions. You can be a Yogi and a Hindu, a Christian, a Muslim, a Buddhist or an Atheist. An Atheist can be a yogi, if he or she wants to realize inner peace and happiness.


You can be a Christian yogi if you want. The most important Christian yogis were the Desert Fathers and Mothers . Their enlightened master was the Holy Antonius .

, The three great books of yoga are the Yoga-Sutra from Patanjali,the Hatha-Yoga-Pradipika from Goraksha,and the Bhagawad Gita from Krishna.Therefore the basic yoga techniques are positive thinking (Patanjali), meditation (Patanjali), body work (Goraksha), praying (Krishna), and loving all beings (Krishna).

, Important modern yoga masters are Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Jaggi Vasudev , Swami Sivananda,Anandamayi Ma,Sai Baba,Amritanandamayi (Amma),and Mother Meera. They teach the basic features.

He or she will open the doors of your enlightenment energy (kundalini-energy).However, realize that you have to practice and realize your enlightenment on your own. And have patience – enlightenment will appear when the time is right for you.

, Spiritually, human beings can be compared to onions. Tension and conflict must be dissolved layer by layer. When one layer is peeled away, the next quickly appears at the surface until the inner core is revealed. At this point, a lasting inner joy is found, and the yogi or yogini lives in the light (in spite of the reality that there is still much to be done).

Make inner happiness, not outer happiness the center of your life.,
Do the following meditation to solve your tensions and find inner peace:


1.,
Practice daily your positive qualities.",How to Be a Karma Yogi (Religion of Love)," For some people it is important to live in the outer peace, to achieve the inner peace. Basically, the inner peace is the result of a calm mind. A calm mind happens when you focus on yourself spiritually. By focusing on your own qualities, you focus on god, as Hindus embrace the term Aham Brahmasmi(one is inherently a part of god). This godliness is found by working continually to master your negative qualities, addictions, fears and aggressions, while simultaneously enhancing your positive qualities.;
, Those who live in the inner balance, save their energy, their physical, and their mental health. If you strengthen not only the calmness in your life, but also focus on your inner positivity and love, you will grow into the light. Replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Constantly practice positive thinking, positive speaking, and positive actions.

, When you facilitate the desire for a happy world, then you grow further towards enlightenment. The secret to this wish is the connection from the inner to the outer world. You are not spiritually separated from other beings. Their happiness affects yours. When you visualize other beings as happy, then you feel happy too. Those who encourage the goal to a happy world creates positivity within. When you send light to all beings, then one day light will come through to your soul. When you do something good for the world, the world will reward you with a positive psyche.

, If you follow the two principles of spiritual practice and love for all beings, you will transform your mind. Your inner tension will dissolve and happiness will appear. The longer you live and the longer you practice Karma-Yoga, the more you grow into the light.

, Globe = Visualize the earth beneath you, rub the earth with your feet and think, ""May all beings be happy. May the world be happy.""
2. Television = Which person on television today touches you negatively or positively? Clean the energetic connection, visualize this person as a Buddha or an angel. Give him or her a positive sentence. Think of the sentence as a mantra until you have overcome all attachment or rejection. Everything you see outside makes a knot in your soul. Create harmony in your mind. The first step to happiness is to create a positive world in your mind. Move a hand and send all the people in the television light: ""I send light to .. I wish him / her wisdom, love and happiness. May all people on TV Buddhas, yogis and angels.""
3. Goddess = Rub your hands before the heart chakra. Visualize yourself as a Buddha, Goddess or Christian: ""I am a Goddess (Buddha, Christian). I go the way of the positive. I live in peace, love and happiness.""
4. Enlightened Masters = Rub the hands over your head and ask the enlightened masters for guidance and help. Connect yourself spiritually with their energy, ""Om all enlightened masters. I ask for guidance and help on my spiritual way.""
5. Mantra = Put your hands together in your lap, move your feet and think many times the mantra ""Om Shanti"" in your body, your legs and in the whole world. Stop every thought for a minute. Relax. Live as a Karma-Yogi in peace, love and happiness.

, Be an angel for the world, ""I send light to ... May all people be happy. May the world be happy.""

Harness the energy of your meditation.",How to Meditate on the Third Eye," You need to be in a place that you will be undisturbed and quiet. It’s also a good idea to have a place where you consistently meditate so your body and mind get used to the place and position and you can more easily activate the third eye., Like the location, most practitioners of meditation benefit from meditating at the same time every day. Think about when you would be best suited to meditate, be relaxed, and free your mind. Don’t do it immediately before or after eating. Many people prefer to meditate in the morning, but any time of day that you choose can work if you keep at it consistently., By getting out some of the kinks in your body, you will be able to sit for longer and more comfortably as you meditate. Doing this every time before you meditate can also help you get into the mental framework you need for meditation. Try each of these for about 30 seconds each:Bending over and trying to touch your toes
Stretching your arms above your head
Laying on your back with your feet in the air – your legs at a ninety-degree angle with the rest of your body

, For most people, the ideal position would be to sit relaxed and cross legged. If this is uncomfortable or difficult, experiment with other positions that make it easier to focus on your breath and meditation. Work up to sitting cross-legged on the floor.


Keep your chest open and your back straight.
Place your hands in your lap or on your knees -- whichever feels better.
Keep your head upright and your eyes gently closed.

, Allow your body to settle. Breathe in and out. Be mindful of your body and how it feels. If there are aches in your body, work on relaxing those before you begin.


Focus on each part of your body in turn as you sit and relax
Begin to move your mind away from your worries and get ready to focus on the present moment
Feel your body expand and contract with each breath

, Breathing is the key to all meditation. Be aware of how your breath goes in and out. Try to focus entirely on your breathing. Take a deep breath (inhale for the count of three, the out for the count of three), repeat with two other deep breaths, and then begin.

, This is the point at which you will begin to start focusing on the third eye, the center of your forehead. Under your eyelids, move your eyes toward the third eye. Keep them focused there throughout the meditation. Begin counting backward from one hundred as you focus. If you aren’t able to get in touch with the third eye immediately, don’t worry. Meditation can take a while to get used to, and activating the third eye even longer., By the time you have reached the end of your counting backward from one hundred, you should be ready to access the third eye. When you focus well, then you sense everything is dark except at the third eye chakra. If your third eye is activated, your brain will be relaxed but functioning at a new level. Both sides of the brain will be working together and you will be aware of the energy around you.You will know you have accessed the third eye when your body feels a new level of energy both coursing through it and around it
You can also tell if your third eye has been activated when you are able to focus strongly on one object or image and your mind is completely consumed by that object or image.

, People have different reactions to the activation of the third eye. Some people experience the mind flashing different visual effects, like images of nature, waterfalls, people, trains, and other scenes that you might have seen. Some people describe it as being able to see your thoughts, almost as if they are scrolling by on a blackboard., It is common to have a headache during your first attempts to activate the third eye. Don’t worry -- as you continue to practice the headaches will go away. To train yourself to more fully appreciate the third eye, try focusing on one particular image. It could be a number, it could be an object -- just try to keep your mind centered on whatever image you have chosen., Move your eyes away from the third eye. Stay relaxed, but become more aware of your breath. Be mindful of the way that your breath goes in and out. Sometimes counting helps to put more focus on your breath as you are coming out of your meditation. Slowly open your eyes., It will become easier to activate the third eye as your meditation practice continues. Work on focusing on different images when you are meditating to help your concentration improve and keep the third eye activated.

, Meditation on the third eye is a part of the larger practice of Hatha Yoga, which integrates both physical movements with meditation and energy work. The chakras, or energy centers of the body, are all linked -- the ajna chakra or third eye is the one that is highest on the body. To work on activating the others would require a practice using the body, not just meditation., Since the third eye is a chakra, you can work on making your body feel better and become more in touch with your inner, intuitive self. But this does not come immediately -- keep practicing your meditation and working on greater levels of focus within it. You might find yourself becoming more in touch with your body and the energy that flows within you and around you -- this is the point of meditation on the third eye.

Find a spiritual role model you love and you trust.,
Find a picture, representation or statue of your role model.,
Send forth the energy of love to all people.,
Always begin your yoga exercises with a mantra for your role model and for all-embracing love.,
Feel connected with your role model while doing your yoga exercises.,
Practise yoga with wisdom, love and joy.",How to Do the Yoga of Love," In Indian yoga, people usually pray to Shiva before starting with their yoga exercises. In so doing, they connect with the energy of Shiva when performing yoga and this energy transforms them. Modern yoga teaches the unity of all religions––this means that you can incorporate the belief you follow:


Find a role model that suits your belief. You can believe in the power of nature and pray to the sun. Many yogi perform the sun salutation and get by this into a life in the light. You can pray to God, to Jesus, to Buddha or to an enlightened Master if you want.
If you believe your role model is enlightened, your belief will activate the enlightenment energy within you. If your role model really is enlightened, he or she can help you with his spiritual abilities.;
, It helps to have a clear vision of what he or she looks like. Forming this picture can include reading or listening to the works of your role model regularly, reading yoga tales, praying or working with an oracle.


The energy transfer is known as ""darshan"". A real darshan consists of the three points seeing, hearing and touching. The energy of love can flow into you when you see a picture, statue or a real enlightened person who has significant meaning for you.
The teachings of your spiritual role model must touch you inside. You have to feel the love or trust. When this happens, the energy of love will transfer to you.

, Wish that all people be happy and that the whole world be happy. This selfless wish will allow the light of your role model to flow through you into the world. It fills you with love. You will feel consciousness of unity with all other beings, which is an essential state for enlightenment, inner peace and happiness.

, For example: ""Om, all enlightened Masters. Om, inner wisdom. Please guide and help me on my way."" ""I send light to (name). May all people be happy. May the word be happy."" You may formulate the mantras in your own words. Christians can pray to God and for all people. You can also connect yourself with a special enlightened Master such as Buddha, Jesus, Shiva and so on.

, Think or speak mantras. Do yoga for yourself and as a way to connect yourself regularly with spirituality, wisdom and love.


Draw the power for a life in love and truth from your daily spiritual exercises.
If you lack the time for yoga at any particular time, you can instead start or end your day with a prayer, mantra, reading or a puja (spiritual ritual).

, Yoga brings you health, beauty and happiness. If you connect with the enlightenment energy (God and the enlightened Masters), your life will be filled with light and love. Persevere––the grace will come to you by its own; it is only a question of time. Everybody on the yoga path will be filled with bliss, if he or she goes with the power of love.

Behave.",How to Pray in Hindu Temples," Hinduism is both polytheist and monotheist. That means Hindus believe in many gods, but that they are all parts of a single god. This means that Hinduism is both diverse, with an array of gods and rituals, but also united in the belief of a single god.Hinduism has thousands of gods and many of these gods manifest themselves in different forms.
Brahma is the leading god and represents both existence, and non-existence.
The three most important manifestations of Brahma are Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Roughly speaking, Brahma is the creator god. Vishnu is the responsible for preserving creation. Finally, Shiva is the god of destruction or nonexistence.;
, Mantras are sayings that are repeated to gods, sometimes specific gods, as a way to ask for a specific outcome.You can repeat these mantras to one of the deities at the temple. Verify that the mantra is appropriate for the god to which you are praying.


One of the most popular mantras is “OM Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya.”, Japa is a way to clear your mind by focusing on a holy passage or the name of a god. Instead of asking for something, you are devoting yourself to the truth of what you are saying to accept the wisdom and serenity of mind that comes with it. You should count the repetitions of the mantra with a mala, a string of beads similar to a rosary.A mala has 108 beads and you should try to do either one full rotation or ten. There is one particularly big bead, known as the head bead. Start at the bead directly after the head bead and roll it around with your thumb every time you repeat the mantra. When you reach the head bead, you have completed a full rotation. One good pose for performing japa is Padmasana. This is a basic cross-legged position in which you keep your body posture upright and your feet on top of the thigh of your opposite leg.Face north or east while preforming the japa.
Sit on a rug.
Do not hurry through the chant. Perform the chant slowly, concentrating on it, timing it with the slow pace of your your breathing.
Avoid distractions. Focus intently on the meaning of the mantra. Your goal is to clear your mind.

, Bhajans are songs that are sung in groups, in front of an image of the deity. You will need to arrive at the temple when the priests are leading a bajan. Sing along with the group.A bhajan is sung in a group, not alone, so you will need to coordinate with others to perform one.Temples will typically publicize times on which they will be performing a bhajan. Some will even include records of the bhajan, so that you can practice in advance. Review the website for information., In accordance with religious beliefs, avoid showing too much flesh. Make sure that shirts and tops have sleeves and that shorts and skirts fall below the knee. Women should avoid wearing low cut blouses and fasten all buttons. Don't wear clothes that have offensive slogans or sexual overtones.


It is typical for men to wear slacks and a button up shirt. Typical business casual attire should suffice.
Women are more inclined to dress up in traditional Indian attire. This is not mandatory, however, you might feel out of place without it. Consider a long kurta top with leggings or pants.
For women wearing western attire, consider a long, loose dress. You should be comfortable sitting cross-legged in the dress.
Hinduism is a large, diverse religion, so attire can differ from one temple to the other. In some temples, it Is much less common to wear western attire. Western attire is banned in some parts of India.Do not wear animal skin, including leather. , Refrain from speaking or laughing loudly. Public displays of affection are inappropriate. If you are offered food, watch others first. Observe whether they say prayers and, if so, do the same before taking the food., You will need to take your shoes off at the temple. Therefore, you should consider footwear that is easy to remove. You might, however, keep on your socks. So be sure that your socks are clean and presentable., You can visit to pray throughout the day. However, temples will perform rituals several times a day. Try to research the schedule in advance online. That way, you can time your visit to either be present or not be present during one of these rituals., It is important to remove you shoes before entering a temple. Upon entering you should be directed as to where to deposit the shoes and informed of any other requirements for your attire.In Bali, you will also be required to wear a sarong. Upon entering, you will be given the sarong. Someone will help you put it on as well.You might also see a foot wash area and a sink. You are not required to use these, but might want to if you need to clean up., Upon entering, turn to your left and find the first statue of a god. Pay your respects by either assuming the Namaste pose or going prostrate. Continue until you have gone around the temple and greeted each god in this fashion.


For Namaste, put your hands together in front of you in a praying motion. Bend your head down slightly.
Alternatively, you can go all the way down to your knees and bow your head to the ground.
The gods will likely have their own alcoves, little spaces cut out in the wall that act like their “homes.”, If there is a gathering of people, they priests might be performing a ritual. After greeting each of the gods, you can join the group. Before joining, however, you should check to see if the group is divided between men and women. If so, join the group appropriate for your gender.


Some temples divide services up by gender, but others do not.
Pay attention to what others involved in the ritual are doing and repeat their actions.
Also, observe how people greet each other. Often, instead of saying “hello,” they will say “Hari om” or “Sai Ram.”, One common ritual involves priests walking in front of the crowd with lamps. For this ritual, you will want to hold your hand out over the lamp as it passes and then bring your hand back to your eyes. Do this three times and on the third time brush your hand over the top of your head.


This ritual represents bringing the spirit of the fire inside of yourself., The priests might walk around with bowl of liquid or fruit. Hold your hands out in a cupped position, with your right hand over your left hand. When the priest provides you with the liquid or fruit, consume it immediately.


After drinking the liquid, rub anything remaining on the top of your head.
Watch what others are doing to make sure that you are following proper decorum. Rituals can vary somewhat from place to play.
These offerings are considered a blessing from god. They are formally known as either prasadam or prasad., The priest might walk around marking heads with kumkum, ash, or turmeric. This is a blessing of your third eye. Simply allow the priest to touch your forehead, possibly bending forward slightly to offer your forehead., Be sedate and respectful and avoid loud conversation and laughter. Don't make comments criticizing the religion or culture. Always bear in mind that the temple is a sacred space for those that are there to worship.


Extinguish cigarettes before entering and don't bring any food or drink inside the temple. Don't chew gum loudly and always dispose of trash in a trashcan. Turn cell phones and pagers to silent or turn them off completely.

",How to Do Hindu Prayer," Mantras are Vedic in origin. The teachings of the Vedas consist of various Mantric chants or hymns recognized by different seers or Rishis from the Cosmic Mind. Since the Vedas are impersonal and eternal, the exact historical date of the origin of Mantra chanting is hard to arrive at. For example, every Mantra in the Vedas, Upanishads and various religious traditions (sampradayas) within Hindu religion begin with Om or Aum - the primordial sound, the sound that is said to have its origins at the time of the creation of the cosmos - also referred to as the 'Big Bang'.


""Mananaat traayate iti mantrah"" (That which uplifts by constant repetition is a Mantra.);
, The Beginning & the End. The Bible (John 1:1) says: ""In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God."" Modern Vedic philosophers have interpreted this teaching of the Bible, and equated Om with God. Om is the most important of all mantras. All mantras generally begin and often also end with Om.

, The chanting of Om has now received widespread recognition. Mantras can be used to treat tension and many other difficult diseases that are yet to come.

, There are many schools of thought on the methods of chanting. A Mantra chanted correctly or incorrectly, knowingly or unknowingly, carefully or carelessly, is sure to bear the desired result for physical and mental well being. It is also believed by many that the glory of Mantra chanting cannot be established through reasoning and intellect. It can be experienced or realized only through devotion, faith and constant repetition of the Mantra.


According to some scholars, Mantra chanting is Mantra Yoga. The simple yet powerful Mantra, Om or Aum harmonizes the physical forces with the emotional forces with the intellectual forces. When this happens, you begin to feel like a complete being - mentally and physically. But this process is very slow and requires a lot of patience and unfailing faith.

Set a time of day for chanting.,
Decide how long you will chant.,
Find a calm place to sit in a comfortable position.,
Think about what Om represents before chanting.,
Relax.,
Breathe normally.,
Pronounce Om.,
Draw the sound from your navel.",How to Chant Om1," The ideal time to chant Om is first thing in the morning. However, you should choose a time when you believe you’ll be the most relaxed and not in a hurry. Sunrise and sunset are great times for deep meditation.Avoid chanting right after a meal.;
, How long you choose to chant is up to you. Set a timer so that you are not focusing on the clock. Be determined to continue chanting until the timer goes off.For example, you may choose to chant for five minutes, ten minutes, or half an hour.

, Make sure the place will be free from distractions. A good position would be to sit on the ground cross-legged, or on your bed. Hold your back straight throughout. Close your eyes and keep them shut.Consider arranging an area specifically for meditating, such as a corner of your bedroom or a separate room.

, Om is said to represent the whole universe. It’s considered to be the source of all creation. Om encompasses all time periods, from the past through to the present and into the future. Om is eternal oneness of mind, body and spirit with the universe., Don’t worry about chanting perfectly. Om is considered to be the vibration of the universe that no human voice can replicate exactly. The most important consideration is to chant in a relaxed way. Try to do this effortlessly; the more you focus on your effort and technique, the less effective it will be.You may need to exert effort at first to clear your mind of thoughts until you master effortless Om chanting.
Om is about feeling rather than thinking. Feel like peace, bliss and happiness are enveloping your whole body.

, Repeat Om in a slow, rhythmic way when you exhale. You don’t have to chant with every exhale. Match the length of each chant to the duration of your natural exhale.For instance, you may chant Om, take a breath or two, and then chant again.

, The “O” sounds like the “a” sound in the word “saw,” combined with the “u” sound in the word “put.” Blend the “m” into the end. These sounds should all merge together into a single sound similar to the “ome” in “home.”Om is composed of four sounds: “a,” “u,” “m,” and the silence that follows.
Give equal measure to each sound. For example, “Ooommm” rather than “ommm” or “ooom.”

, Allow the vibration to rise upward gradually until it rings in your nostrils. Try to do this easily and naturally."
"
Meditate anytime, anywhere.,
Chant as long as you feel like chanting.,
Chant with or without moving your lips.",How to Chant Om2," Safety permitting, you can chant Om silently in just about any situation. For example, outside or at work. Sit comfortably and keep your body still. Relax your mind before you begin., Whereas chanting aloud is usually a long and premeditated practice, chanting mentally is typically short.For instance, you may chant Om for just two minutes while sitting inside your car in a parking space.Silently chant Om whenever you feel like you need peace and centering.

, Consider the situation you are in. For instance, if you are in a movie theater, you can move your mouth with the silent chant. If you’re in a board meeting, it’s advisable not to indicate with your facial expressions that you’re meditating.If you’re going to move your lips, open your mouth wide for the first two syllables. Then purse your lips together for the rest.To chant without physically forming the word, repeat the mantra silently to yourself. Don’t move your lips or tongue.

"
"
Find a group to chant with.,
Join your voice with the others.,
Lead a chant.",How to Chant Om3," There are over 500 Om chanting groups around the world. Look for a group by searching online for “find an Om chanting group.” Or, enter your city or state and add the keywords “Om chanting group.” Facebook and Meetup are a couple of places you can find such groups locally.Look for Om chanting workshops where attendees sit in a circle and meditate together.
Look for yoga classes near you. Some yoga classes chant Om before and/or after each yoga session and some don’t, so call or email either the organization or the instructor, and ask if the group chants Om during class.

, Try to feel relaxed but confident so your voice doesn’t waver. Blend your voice with the chant of everyone so that it is one collective chant.Have an open mind about pronunciation. If the group pronounces “Om” in a different way than you’re used to, go with it. There is no incorrect way to pronounce “Om,” as it differs based on factors like dialect and location. The aim is for everyone to match in tone for a group chant.Approach the chant with a sense of reverence and surrender. This will help you to merge into the vibration of the group chant., Tell the participants that if they aren’t comfortable chanting, they can meditate silently during the chant, or simply listen. View chanting as a connection to the meaning of the chant, rather than a performance. Take a few breaths before chanting and summon the positive feeling of the chant.Try practicing alone before leading group chants.
Add instrumental background music for the group chant if desired. Alternately, you can bring a recorded group chant to play in the background.

Place haldi (turmeric) and kumkum (vermillion) into two small bowls (usually special ones are available for this, but you don't need to have special ones).,
On one plate or a serving tray (metal is better), place the haldi/kumkum at the top.,
Offer haldi/kumkum to married women and unmarried women.,
Pick up the flower and give it to the woman.,
Pick up the coconut with the betel nut leaf, nut and money and offer these to the woman.,
If the person receiving the haldi kumkum is older, do namaskar to the person to receive blessing.

,
Repeat as needed.",How to Do Haldi Kumkum," Also add flowers, betel nut leaves, betel nut and  coconut (one per female).


In addition, you may also choose to give bangles, sweets, small novelties and money or gifts.;
,  Place money, coconut and betel nut on the betel nut leaves. Bangles can also be placed with the coconut.

, A married woman would take the haldi, but an unmarried woman will only  take the kumkum. 


Note: In some customs, haldi/kumkum can be placed on the woman by the person offering it.

, She should accept the flower with both hands extended and should wear the flower in her hair.

, The woman should accept the coconut by holding out both of her hands.


If there are more things to be offered, they can be offered now.

,, You can now repeat the process with the next person.

Acknowledge that you are as imperfect a person as the one who has hurt you.,
Try to understand the other person; ask yourself what kind of suffering has occurred in his/her life; what kind of struggles has this person gone through that has made him or her hurt you so badly.,
Recognize that as long as you stay angry at this person, he or she will have power over you.,
Ask God to help you in this process.,
Forego any desire for revenge.,
In forgiving, you are not agreeing with what happened.,
Understand that forgiveness and reconciliation are separate concepts.,
The Bible does not allow personal payback: ""Vengeance is Mine, says the Lord; I will repay"", but promoting justice is a separate issue from personal forgiveness.,
Know that Jesus promises rewards to those who overcome feelings like wanting to be unforgiving: ""But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you... For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?""",How to Find Forgiveness through Christ," You too are in need of being forgiven by people you might have hurt in some way. You too need forgiveness from a perfect God.;
, Perhaps this person was abused at some point in his or her life.

, This person might long have forgotten the injury inflicted on you, while you are allowing anger to seep the life out of you.

, Think of the forgiveness He offers you through His son, Jesus... a totally free gift, which neither you nor I deserve! He asks us to pass this forgiveness on to our fellow human beings; not an easy task, yet He asks it of us and He knows that if we do that, we will find incredible peace and freedom! Cast your care onto the Lord.

, It is God's domain. Only He knows what this person actually deserves. Inflicting revenge will only make you feel better for a fleeting moment. Ultimately, it will make you feel much worse. Remember that people usually reap what they sow.

, You are not saying that what was done is OK. You are not saying you are in agreement. You can still condemn the sin, but you are placing the sinner in God's hands. You are affirming that only God is equipped to rightly judge his or her soul.

, The Lord requires us to forgive, so that our hearts can be clean before Him. But we can only trust again and reconcile as it might be appropriate (""As much as it depends on you, be at peace with all men"" - Rm 12.18). For true reconciliation, both parties have to take responsibility and do their part. Otherwise we would be in an unhealthy ""unequal yoking"". Sometimes it's best to forgive, but to move on and let your peace return to you. Getting back together with the other person may not be a good option.

, If the offensive behavior is criminal it may be appropriate to notify the authorities. This becomes especially important when the behavior is ongoing and others are at risk. Each situation has to be considered on it merits, including your safety. Remember that forgiving sometimes just doesn't stop behavior. God may take you through a difficult time, not necessarily end it because you have forgiven.

, God sacrificed his only son so that you could enjoy your life.

You should be in a relaxed state of mind when dowsing.,
Grasp your ""L"" rods in the palms of your hands, curling your fingers and thumb around the plastic sleeves lightly, yet firmly.,
With the rods correctly griped, place your elbows along the side of your body for stability, and extend your lower arms and the rods straight out/pointing forward, roughly at shoulders length.,
Now that your arms are in the search position as noted above, and the rods in a neutral position, slowly walk around the search area while concentrating on the item you are looking for.,
Congratulate yourself once you are successful in your finds.

","How to Use ""L"" Type Dowsing Rods"," If you don't succeed at first, relax, maybe try to meditate a bit, then try again. Practice makes perfect, of course some studying won't hurt either.;
, Neither the long top of the rods nor the bottom curved part should touch your hands in any way while holding them, and they should be free to swing without any interference.

, You should ideally hold the rods level for maximum movement and sensitivity, though you may drop the tips of the rods very slightly to dampen the movement in breezy conditions for further control.

,


To start out dowsing, you should lay out cards numbered 1-5 face down and in a line with about 6 inches (15.2 cm) of separation between each card. You should shuffle the cards up so they are in a random order. Start at one end by asking a question, like ""Show me where the card labeled 4 on it by crossing the rods as I walk by"", walk slowly until the rods start to move. Once you get a positive confirmation, flip the card to see if you are right. Practice this until you get the hang of it.

Consider that God gave us the Law to show us our need for a Savior.,
Read Galatians, where Paul talks about faith being the only way to God.,
Make time for God.,
Accept that no one is perfect, or a ""good Christian"".,
Realize that any pastor or leader of a congregation who thinks he or she has all the answers is personally misled.,
Don't abuse your belief as an excuse for sinning.,
Continuing from the above point is an insightful quote from DC Talk.,
He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?",How to Find God Beyond Christian Law," Paul tells us that the Law is good if it is used lawfully. It is just a mirror, not a to do list. Scripture says the Law is a schoolmaster to lead us to Christ. It doesn't save us it just shows us we need saving.;
, He completely dismisses the notion that following the old Jewish law is necessary for salvation. The law is summarized by Jesus as loving God and loving your neighbor as yourself. Faith in Jesus is the only way to be saved. Reading the Bible for yourself is a wonderful way to come to know God your father better.

, God delights in being with you, and always has time to chat. Making time for just you and Him is important.

, No matter how much a person has tithed (i.e., paid ""church taxes""), this does not make the person better than another. God does not care about literal actions alone. What truly matters is motives in your heart and soul. Even if you donate a vast amount of money and time to a great Christian organization, if you do this with a mindset of glorifying yourself, God does not favor it. ""To do what is right and just is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice"" (Proverbs 21:3, NIV).

, Nobody wins any more favor with God than anybody else, all humans are special creations. We are all equals, no matter who we may be or what we have done and none of us has all the answers.

, Jesus' death doesn't mean it's alright to go out and sin. Jesus' death may have freed Christians from the heavy bonds of sin but it's not time to go out and collect some more for Jesus to wash away. It is time to live out your life of freedom before others. And to share your talents, skills and love with others. This way Jesus may draw all people to Himself through seeing what you have. The whole point of His death was not so that you could sin more and bathe in His grace, but so that he could free you and turn you away from your slavery and bonds to the evils of sin. Its important to remember the purpose of your freedom, as described in Galatians; showing love to others.

, ""The single biggest cause of atheism in the world today is CHRISTIANS, who acknowledge Jesus with their lips, and deny him by their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable.""

, Micah 6:8 (ESV)

"
"
Realize that Jesus has set you free for good.,
Receive that you really are a ""new creation"" in Christ.,
Take every thought captive.,
Understand that there is now no condemnation in Christ.,
Understand that as a Christian you are not required to be ""nice."",
Love others, and ""exceed nice by a mile..."": Here is one of the things Jesus said to the Pharisees, ""You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires.,
Submit to one another as to the Lord.,
Be free from anarchy.",How to Find Freedom in Your Christian Life," When Jesus died on the cross, He broke the power of sin and death.


On the cross He said, ""It is finished."" What he meant was that the price/wages for sin is finished, and that any human who puts faith in Him will not longer be a slave to sin/death. The power that sin had over a Christian, before they came to know Christ, has been conquered and finished by Jesus. The thing we have to do is put our faith in him and believe He is the Son of God. ""If you confess with your mouth, and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord, you will be saved.""
You may have a head faith, but make sure your heart/innermost-core believes, too, as in you fully trust God, and would do anything for Him, etc. Once we believe deep in our hearts, we become his child, and He sets us free from anything and everything. There are countless testimonies of people coming to faith in Christ and then no longer having any desire at all for drugs or alcohol, etc.;
, Jesus changes lives, and if you are his child/brother, He has changed your life. The Bible says, ""If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has gone, the new has come!"" Live out what is already true of you. You are free! You are a new creation. It's true. If you really believe it, it will be more accessible and real to you.


Jesus said in Mark 11:23, ""Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them."" Believe that you are free of a mountain of fear, anger and doubt -- and you will be. Amen.

, 2 Corinthians 10:5 says, ""We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ."" Amen.


Don't let your mind run wild and think about just anything. ""Listen to and think about what you are saying and thinking about"", and control what you are speaking or thinking about. Joyce Meyer always says that we need to talk-to/discipline ourselves a little more, as ""self talk"". We need to put ourselves on time-out sometimes, or tell ourselves that certain things are not okay to do or to think. Tell yourself to stop or to go. This is called self-control.
Learn to control your own mind with your own thoughts. One thought replaces another. ""Take captive every thought, and make it obedient to Christ."" Don't let yourself think anything that Jesus Christ/God would not approve. Guard your mind. Subject your thinking to the law of God and the teachings of Christ, always, always. Don't get lazy about this. Every single thought, you have to force it to be in line with ""whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things."" That is the only way to truly be free in your mind. Amen.

, Paul says in Romans 8,""Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.""


We are no longer under that law as Christian, because Jesus has saved us. That does not mean the law is not important anymore, it means that now we follow the spirit of the law as opposed to the letter of the law. As Jesus said, ""All the law and the prophets are summed up in this one commandment, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"" As long as you are doing that, you are following God's law.
Since Jesus died for us, we are set free from ""the law of sin and death."" There is now no condemnation, because Jesus paid the price in full for us. Through him, we are justified and righteous in God's eyes. So, don't let anyone try to condemn you about anything. Only God is your judge, not people, and He says that the Redeemed are justified and that you can be so free.
The movie ""The Great Debaters"" has a comical scene about this. Denzel Washington keeps asking his debate team, ""Who is the judge?"" And they respond ""God is the judge"" -- and not people. Always remember what that entails.

, At least not in the sense that the world defines what ""nice"" is. This realization can really be very freeing.


The Bible says that we are to ""hate what is evil."" You can't hate something, like pornography for example, and be nice about it at the same time can you? No. Look at the character of Jesus; He was not ""nice"" about half of the time that He was here on earth.
For one, everyone knows about the time when He cleared out the temple with a whip. He was a carpenter, and very tough. When it came to his enemies, the Pharisees, Jesus was extremely bold, confronting them, and insulting to them as ""serpents, hypocrites and whitewashed tombs, full dead men's bones"". Yes, we are to love our enemies, but we are by no means supposed to let them walk all over us. Yet, Jesus said

""If they sue you for your coat, give them your shirt, also. If a soldier asks you to carry his load for one mile, carry it two. Give to him who asks, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow..."" (Matthew 5:40--42).

, He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."" That's direct and confrontational, and it's not very ""nice"" is it? But He was without sin.


Therefore, know that it is okay to stand up for the Truth as a Christian and not be pushed around by others. Don't let other people try to dominate and control you in Christ. Jesus has set you totally free, that includes freedom from the attempted domination of any other person.

, ""People can only have power over you -- if you let them."" So don't let anyone have power over you to control you. Yes, you are free from the absolute control by anyone. But, you are to give submission, freely ""as unto God"" which is your duty. ""Submit"" means to ""set yourselves below,"" pay attention, listen, be observant. ""Obey"" means do what is instructed or asked of you rightly. Know that, ""Whatever you do or refuse wrongly, to the least of these, you do it as to God."" Be submissive thus unto:


Fellow Christians: ""Submit yourselves one to another in the fear of God."" (Ephesians 5:21).
Authority: ""Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:…"" (Hebrews 13:17).
Bosses: ""Employees/Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable."" (1 Peter 2:18).
Husbands: ""Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church,..."" (Ephesians 5:22).
Elder: ""Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder. Yes, all of…"" (1 Peter 5:5)

, Anarchy is unruliness, not being subject to authority. Freedom means you are out of the ""condemnation that is due to children of disobedience"", and free from rebellion which is ""sorcery/witchcraft"". You are free to listen and to learn.


Listen to those of lesser station, when they have the orders that you need.
Take the advise of an experienced worker. A fool refuses good counsel.

There is still an incredibly wide variety in the types of traditional shamanism practiced across the world.;
, In the 20th century, the historian Mircea Eliade and the anthropologist Michael Harner separately argued that many varieties of spiritual traditions around the world could all be defined as ""shamanism,"" with core principles at the heart of different practices and beliefs.This directly led to many new traditions, mostly started by white Westerners, such as ""core shamanism,"" and many types of ""neoshamanism"" or ""New Age shamanism."", Traditional shamanism, in its hundreds of different forms, is still alive today, and its practitioners (as well as scholars of religion) have a range of reactions to more recent shaman traditions. There are many sides to this discussion, and not all types of shamanism or individual shamans agree with all of these points, but you may wish to be aware of as you begin exploring shamanism:


Although it is not uncommon for shamans to charge for services, some new ""shaman businesses"" are often considered cynical.Most new-style shamans use traditions from other cultures. This can be done respectfully and knowledgeably, or in an uninformed or incorrect way that many find offensive.Western shamanism is often taught as a self-improvement technique, while many older traditions cause harm to the shaman, include ""evil"" or ""grey area"" practices, or focus on helping the community., If you decide you would like to learn more about a modern shamanism tradition, you can find many materials online or in mass-published books. Most of these are unique theories and practices developed by a single person, but a few resources listed below are examples of especially influential voices. You can also read more about general trends in these movements in the section below on practicing shamanism.



The Foundation for Shamanic Studies promotes ""core shamanism,"" claiming to teach the essential principles at the core of shamanic traditions worldwide.

Cleargreen Incorporated practices a 20th century pseudo-Mexican shamanism called ""Tensegrity.""
Terence McKenna was an influential supporter of shamanism in the 1990s, tying it to many New Age theories and psychedelic experimentation.

, The method of becoming a traditional shaman varies from culture to culture, but typically involves a sudden supernatural event, inheriting the position, or training as an apprentice.If you do not belong to a culture with shamanic traditions, you may need to visit an indigenous community to study under a shaman or someone in a similar role. You can also learn more about these traditions by reading books by anthropologists and other people who describe shamanistic practices of a specific culture:



This interview and description of an Oroqen shaman in northeastern China.
The book Ancient Land, Sacred Whale by Tom Lowenstein describes the rituals and myths of the Alaskan Tikigaq whale hunters.

This article describes thriving shamanic traditions across Nepal, and discusses how they are different from other ritual practices.

, Entering the spirit world, or discovering another reality next to our own, is one of the most common shamanic practices. One of many ways to do this is to enter a trance. Try blindfolding yourself and beating a drum with a steady beat for several minutes, or until you enter a different state of awareness.

, Another way to enter a trance, or to become in touch with your inner self, is to practice meditation. Many people consider it a solid foundation for any spiritual path, and a source of health benefits that match well with some shamanic tradition's message of self-improvement. There are many schools of meditation, but it all begins with closing your eyes and sitting in a quiet place.

, Dreams are often important to people practicing shamanic rituals. They may be holding great truths, revelations or some other spiritual significance. Keep a dream journal so that when you wake up, you'll be able to write or draw some of the images down.


The images you draw may hold power. Be wary if you do not know what they represent.

, There is no universal way to encounter these entities, but in many traditions, you cannot be a shaman without doing so. During a trance, a meditation, or a sudden, unexpected experience, you may encounter another being. This may be a nature spirit, a spirit in the afterlife, or even entities that some consider gods. There is no single pantheon or worldview that can explain what you encounter, but an experienced shaman can help you identify them and teach you how to make deals with them, serve them, or master them, depending on the traditions you follow.


Be aware that some of these entities may be malevolent or tricky to deal with. Often, rituals that involve drugs, sacrifice, or other sources of power attract potentially more dangerous entities.

, While you can develop your own shamanic practices, almost everyone finds the guidance of a teacher of a fellow journeyer helpful. This could be a shaman practicing the traditional shamanism of her culture, or a shaman from a ""neoshamanism"" tradition. This step is recommended before trying any of the steps below, or if you have a dangerous or frightening encounter with spirits.

, Entheogens, or substances that ""generate the divine within,"" can be powerful allies in affecting our consciousness, but they are not always necessary.Learn how to hone your own abilities as a Shamanic Practitioner before integrating these into your practice, and learn how to use them with trusted, human individuals watching over you.


Plenty of legal substances are used in shamanic traditions, such as tobacco. In the United States, drugs such as peyote and ayahuasca are legal or in a legal grey area when used by people who can prove they are part of a traditional culture., Healing is a major duty of many experienced shamans. The exact ritual varies, and is usually passed on by teachers. This can involve many techniques:


Dancing, singing, or playing instruments to attract spirits.Making offering to the spirits of food, drink, tobacco, and other substances. (Sometimes, the spirits are brought inside your body first.)Drawing the sickness out of the body and into an animal, object, or symbol.
Traveling to another reality to intercede with the spirits on the sick person's behalf.

, Many New Age shamans use divining rods, séances, crystals, or other divining implements. Some attempt to see the future, while others use these tools to seek guidance for their own life, or to communicate to spirits in the afterlife.

Get rid of clutter.,
Clean the place thoroughly.,
If you have just moved to a new home that has a bad aura or a very negative feel, wash any wood surfaces and floors with mild witch hazel diluted with water: 10 to 1 mix.

,
Move in a circular motion through your home.,
Make sure to sweep the doorways and steps of your front and back entrances.

,
Put one of the following into the soapy water you use to mop your floors.,
Seal your home against negative energies by doing one or more of the following:


Using a wand, sketch a pentacle in the invoking direction at each of your home's entrances (windows, doors, etc).",How to Perform a Cleaning Ritual," Clutter is one of the major offenders when it comes to blocked or sluggish energy in your home. Recycle that collection of old newspapers and magazines (and consider canceling subscriptions), clean out your closets and drawers (get rid of anything you haven't worn or used for more than a year), and weed through your collection of books, music, and other media.;
, Dust and dirt have an effect on the psyche. Break out the vacuum cleaner, the broom, the dustpan, and the mop!

,, Now that you've gotten rid of your clutter, it should be easier to clean the floors -- always a good starting point for a thorough housecleaning. You may choose to move in either a clockwise (deosil) or counter-clockwise (widdershins) direction through your home. If you move clockwise, concentrate on bringing in lightness, peace, clarity, serenity, prosperity, or whatever positive energy you wish for into your home: the emphasis for this direction is on invoking, or inviting in. If you move counterclockwise, concentrate on banishing dirt, old memories, dustiness, mustiness, and blocked energy: the emphasis is on banishing, or pushing out.

,, If you have carpets, consider making a small mixture and sprinkling or spraying it on the floors after vacuuming. Just a few drops of the essential oils will suffice: Salt (purifying and grounding); Sage essential oil (purifying); Lemon essential oil (gives energy and a clean smell); Patchouli (brings prosperity -- go extra light on this); Pine (brings prosperity and love)


Don't forget to wipe down surfaces, clean mirrors, and de-clutter your bureau and desk. If necessary, get a box and place all your old mail and bills in it. You can go through your papers later, but looking at them night and day can be a constant source of stress.
Once you've gotten rid of all the dust and clutter and your floors and surfaces are shining and clean, you should already be feeling better. Use one or more of the following methods to clean out any lingering stagnant energy:* Burn white sage and waft the smoke around your house in a counterclockwise motion, banishing old, stuck energy from your home. Always burn herbs with a fire-safe container! Ring a bell or a rattle through your home, again in counterclockwise motion. Yell, clap your hands, stamp your feet, and laugh.
When you feel that your home has been thoroughly cleansed, say in a strong, clear voice, ""My home is cleared of all negative energy. Let it be a place of peace, serenity, love, and prosperity.""

, Don't forget the door to the basement or garage!
Sprinkle salt water around the outside walls of your home.
Place a penny (right side up) in each of the outside corners of your home.
Place a protective symbol--such as a mirror, a household god, or a broom - at or near your front and back doors. It's best to use the symbol most closely aligned with your own ethnic heritage.

Thank the energies.",How to Perform a New Moon Ritual," New Moon rituals are typically practiced by those who associate themselves with magic, paganism, witchcraft, yoga, meditation, or any other kind of spiritual awareness. The location you choose will ideally be outdoors. Being outside means you will be connected to the outside world in a way that will make it easier to harness the energy of nature.If being outside isn't possible, make sure you are in a comfortable room where you will not be disturbed.;
, Cleansing the area is important to ready it for the new moon ritual. You can do this one of two ways. One way is by smudging the location – sage is ideal as it's associated with the moon. You can also cleanse the location by lighting incense. Some effective incense types that are associated with the new moon include lavender, lemon balm, and calamus scents.To smudge the area, simply light the end of the sage stick and blow on it until there is a visible smoldering glow. Wave it around your body and around the space where your ritual will be performed., You can decorate it as much or as little as you wish; it’s all up to your own personal preferences. Put a pretty tapestry on the ground with a pillow around it for each participant in the ritual. Create your altar on top of the tapestry. Include things that connect you to nature (like flowers) and things that make you feel at peace (like incense or some nostalgic trinket).Use something to correspond with the elements: a feather or incense for air; a shell or small bowl of water for water; a stone or small amount of soil for earth; and, finally, a candle (white or silver for the moon) to represent fire., Candles are an important part of the ritual itself because the flame symbolizes your own inner light and allows you to visualize this in a more tangible way. Different colors of candles symbolize different energies and desired outcomes. Choose the color that best fits your intentions for the ritual.
Red symbolizes action, green symbolizes abundance, yellow is for health, white represents purity or spirituality, and pink is for love.

, The New Moon is a great time to make a new beginning, to ask for a new love, to begin a process of healing, or to renew your commitment to an old resolution. Write down a couple of words or phrases that reflect what you hope to get out of the ritual., If you wish, you can prepare or research some words that you will say during the ritual. These words can be an offering of gratitude or a hopeful wish for the future. Say whatever you want. The point is to connect to nature and to the people around you.


If you want to offer up your gratitude to nature, try saying something like this: “Dear Mother Earth, she that gives life and light to all of us, thank you for the abundant blessings you have bestowed upon us.”
If you want to ask for a specific desire to become reality, try saying something like this: “I come here today to offer up my request to the universe so that it might become my truth.”
If you are performing the ritual with more than one person, you should give each participant an opportunity to discuss their intentions in this way.

, During your New Moon ritual, you want to feel inspired and energized. Reciting a poem or singing a song is a great way to enter into the right mindset for the ritual.Try reciting this poem by Rumi for inspiration:
“Let us fall in love again
And scatter gold dust all over the world
Let us become a new spring
And feel the breeze drift in heaven’s scent.
Let us dress the earth in green
And like the sap of a young tree
Let the grace from within us sustain us.
Let us carve gems out of our stony hearts
And let them light our path to Love.
The glance of Love is crystal clear
And we are blessed by its light.”

, Call upon the energy of each element and its corresponding direction. Fire is in the South, Water in the West, Earth in the North, and Air in the East.Note: The corresponding directions vary depending on your precise path.
Say something like, “I call upon the energy of the elements to assist me in my journey. Fire in the South, Water in the West, Earth in the North, and Air in the East.”
Consider reciting a text that celebrates the things you associate with every direction., When you have reached a place of peace, now is the time to read or say a few words that reflect your intention. If you wish, you can burn the paper on which you wrote those words/phrases in the flame of a candle. As it burns, imagine your words/intentions being carried up and out with the smoke into the universe.


If you are not able to reach a place of peace because of something that is troubling you, now would also be a good time to acknowledge this. Imagine the thing that is causing you pain or worry and is being carried away from you by the smoke from the candle.
If you are performing your New Moon ritual in a group, give each person an opportunity to read their intentions and burn the paper in the candle’s flames.

, This is a great addition to acknowledging your intentions because it allows you to physically visualize the thing you desire. Create the symbolic act yourself and feel free to get creative.If your intention is to become a published author, write this intention down on a piece of paper that you tie to a helium balloon and release into the sky.
If your intention is to find love, put lavender and a rose quartz in a small pouch along with your ideas about what your ideal partner should be like. Write your ideas down on a piece of paper to include in the pouch.
Each participant should be given the opportunity to perform a symbolic act of their choosing.

, If there are other people present at your New Moon ritual, take a moment for everyone to share some of their intentions with the group. This will help you connect to one another, but it will also give more energy to each person’s intention., This will help you close the gateway on each of the elements you have called upon. Each group member should close the ceremony in a way that feels appropriate for them. An ideal way to close a ritual is to recite one of the following phrases:


“And None it Harm, Enhance My Charm.”
“By the Power Of Three, So Mote It Be.”
“Blessed Be.”

This gives you a close connection to mother nature. However if you don't have a garden or this is impractical you can have an indoor altar. If your altar will be indoors, choose a room to have it in. Many choose a bedroom because this is a private room that is easy to relax in.;
, East facing altars are common because east is where the sun rises. You can also have your altar in the direction of your element. So air for east, fire for south, water for west, north for earth and center for spirit.

, You can keep your altar on a dresser or table if you want a permanent one or one with lots of heavy items. Other places are drawers, bookcases (though this means you can't have candles under the wood), trays, tree stumps and windowsills. You can also have an altar box, so your objects are kept safe and private from others if you live in a busy household. You can take the items out and place them on top of the box when in use. Choose somewhere that feels right for you. Use your intuition.

, If you are heavily influenced by Celtic paganism then maybe you will use Celtic deities like Brigid. If you have native American beliefs with your Wicca practise then you may choose some of their symbolism on your altar. Consider your personal practise and how your altar reflects you and your spirituality.

, The goddess side represents the moon, divine feminine, left brain, unconscious and night time. Items used for the goddess may be:


A semi large candle with a color you best think represents the Goddess. Cold colours like blue, green, purple and silver are often used.
A statue that represents the Goddess. This can be any goddess: Isis, the moon goddess, or statues from a Greek goddess like Hestia; it depends on what goddess calls you. You can also use totem animals of the goddess like a hare, cat, owl or other lunar animals.
Something that may represent feminine elements. For example, water = chalice or bowl of water, seashell, cauldron, sea glass or mirror, earth = green/brown coloured objects, stones, plants (leaves, flowers, etc), salt, soil, bones or pentagram.
Crystal ball or divination tools.
A few objects that are sacred and special to you.

, The god side is symbolic of the divine masculine, sun, elements fire and air, yang, daytime, conscious and right brain. Things that you might want to put on the God side would be:


A semi large candle which color you think bests represents the God (e.g. warm colours like yellow, gold, red, orange)
A statue which represents the God, such as the green man, Lugh, Osiris, herne, solar imagery, or masculine totem animal like a stag or goat
Object for the 2 masculine elements. For example, fire = red/orange colours, wand or athame/boline (if you have a wand for fire than your athame would be for air and vice versa), candle, incense, teeth, claws (but don't hurt animals to obtain it!), ash or oil burner; air = yellow/white/silver colours, Athame, Boline, wand, incense, feathers.
Any divination tools
A few other objects that are sacred and special to you

, You can have:


Your matron/patron deity you work most with. If you don't know your deity yet then you can just put the ones you are currently working with.
Spirit element. White/purple/violet/rainbow colour. Crystals, skulls, candles can be used. Choose something powerful and very important.
Pentacle (put on goddess side if it represents earth or middle if symbolic of all 5 elements)
Book of shadows
Athame (can be put on god side)
Wand (can be put god side)
A candle (red, blue, yellow, or green, depending on your zodiac/element sign)
Stones or Crystals.

, You could also have:


Loose herbs or potpourri. This can be nice to use special types for Sabbats and to sprinkle on altar. You can make this yourself.
Crystals.
Tarot/Oracle cards. These have pretty images on them and are good to use in meditation.
A spell/altar box. If you have a big altar you can put a small box on there and put rites or sacred things in it.
Spell objects. Witches ladders, witches bottles, puppet magic, etc.
Talismans and Amulets. Magickal jewellery!
Anything meaningful and divine to you.
If possible you could hang a charm, dreamcatcher or witches ladder for good energy and protection above your altar.

Select a location.,
The easiest way to set up a lararium is to reserve a small one-tier wall shelf, or a table or cabinet as an altar.,
Equip your lararium with these essential tools:


Incense, an offering to the gods.,
A lararium traditionally includes a representation of a snake, considered to represent a guardian spirit.,
After it is set up, you have a duty, as an ongoing act of devotion to the deities, to keep your lararium clean.",How to Make a Lararium," A good place for your lararium is in a front room or near the kitchen area as was done in antiquity, but this is not essential. The important thing is that the lararium be placed somewhere that isn't so remote that it will be ignored or forgotten, or in a place so obtrusive it gets bumped into and knocked about during the course of the day.;
, A trip to a hardware store, a department store or an antique shop will usually yield something workable. A lararium may be decorated to taste in classical style if one wishes, but it need not be any special style or color.

,

Acerra—a container for incense. It should close tightly.

Turibulum—an incense burner.

Salinum—a container for salt.
'Gutus—a container for milk or wine.

Patera—a small, shallow offering dish.
'Lucerna—a sacred lamp. An oil lamp or a candle is fine.

, A simple painting or good quality photo of a snake is fine.

, Just dust it and and wash objects within and around the lararium, and properly dispose of food offerings.

If you're lucky enough to have a pet, perhaps you interact with animals sometimes, but a lot of people spend almost all of their time with other humans. Making the natural world a bigger part of your life opens you to the possibility of connecting with a spirit animal.


Don't go out searching for a spirit animal; that's not the way it works. For now, be open to learning more about all non-human creatures.
Look for inventive ways to spend more time in nature. If you don't live near wilderness, go to a state or national park, or a city park.
When you spend time outside, remove your headphones and cut out any distractions. Become aware of your surroundings and notice things you might usually overlook: a bird peeking out of a bush, or a caterpillar walking across the sidewalk.
When time doesn't permit a long trek outside, make your inside space more open to the natural world. Turn off the air conditioner. Open the blinds and the windows. Listen to the wind and the crickets instead of playing music.;
, Spending more time in nature, especially around animals, will help you start to think of them differently. Notice their habits, the ways in which they communicate with one another, and the elements of their behavior that surprise you. Animals have intelligence all their own, different from but equal to that of humans. If that's difficult or impossible for you to see, it will be hard to find your spirit animal.


Intelligence is about more than being able to solve math problems. Think about what type of intelligence different animals have. Migratory birds, for example, can fly thousands of miles to a pre-planned destination without a map.
Don't anthropomorphize animals. They are not human, so don't expect them to express themselves the same way. It's important to respect animals for who they are, rather than assuming they'll communicate on your terms.

, Finding your spiritual animal is a spiritual and supernatural exercise. Perform a meditation or prayer session during which you concentrate on being open to communications from your spirit animal. Do it in a natural place like a meadow or a beach, or somewhere man-made, such as a park. Trust your instincts.


If you want a concrete answer to a yes or no question, you probably won't find that in a spirit animal. It's not about getting what you want; it's about forging a deeper connection to nature, which will eventually lead you down the right path.
Seek out your spirit animal if you're ready to be open to a different kind of wisdom and intelligence, and connect more deeply with the natural world. Remember that this has to be a mutual connection; you can't ""conjure"" the spirit animal at will. You gain most by being open to all possibilities.
If your meditations and prayers seem fruitless, don't force it. Try again during a different season, or when your mind is in a different state. In the meantime, work on being more open and spiritually aware, by spending even more time out with mother nature.

, Have you ever had a day, or week, when the same symbol seemed to keep coming to the fore? Perhaps you saw a mural of a wolf painted on the side of a building, and it struck you as beautiful so you stopped to take it in. Later you looked down to see a wolf tattoo on a woman's ankle in the coffee shop. That night you went home, turned on the TV, and if you look hard there might be a chance that an animal you see often to be on TV. The recurrence of animal symbols can mean your spirit animal is trying to get in touch.

, Spirit animals often appear to people at night in their dreams, when the mind is at rest and the subconscious is at work. If you tend to dismiss or forget your dreams, make a point of paying more attention. Take note of animals you encounter.


Sometimes the appearance of a spirit animal isn't straightforward. You may dream of an animal in a painting on the wall, or a conversation in which the other person makes mention of a certain animal. All references to animals are worth noting.
Write down your dreams and pay attention to patterns over time. What message do the animals seem to be communicating? Keep an open mind and try to interpret them.

, Many have reported encountering their spirit animal in physical form. Don't dismiss it if an animal comes close to you, makes sustained eye contact, runs ahead of you, hangs around your yard, or otherwise appears to be trying to communicate something.

, Some animals may come and go, and some may stay. Keeping a journal of your interactions with these animals will help you learn more about yourself and your animal totem.

, These spiritual mediums may have methods or advice for finding your spirit animal. Be aware that finding a shaman in your neighborhood isn't as easy as doing a Google search or looking in the phone book. You may have to ask around or investigate on your own.

, What does it eat, and where does it live? Read about its history, behaviors, and the way it is portrayed in literature and the media. What does this animal represent?


An animal's particular wisdom is called its ""medicine,"" or power. This medicine can be used to help during a time of need. For example, a hawk's medicine might be its ability to see clearly when others can't.
If possible, spend time near your animal's habitat. Don't be disruptive, but try to learn as much as you can about how the animal exists in the wild.

, Take what you have learned and use it to help you deal with making big decisions, confronting difficult situations, and reaching your goals. You can draw on your animal's wisdom in everyday life, too, in your treatment of others and the earth.

, Pay close attention each time your animal appears to you in any form. Do your best to interpret the messages the animal seems to be sending. Remember, the messages won't be straightforward, since animals don't communicate the same way humans do, so you'll have to do some deep thinking to understand. Here are some questions to ask yourself:


What emotions do you feel when the animal comes?
Does the animal seem to be a sign of foreboding or comfort?
Does the animal seem to be leading you in a certain direction?

, It is believed in shamanism that you gain a deeper connection with your spiritual animal by honoring it. In doing this, you're letting it know that its assistance in helping you with your life is appreciated. You can do this by standing up for the environment and animal rights, and in particular the well being of your spirit animal. Remember that each time an animal species goes extinct, we lose the wisdom of that animal.

Take the Bodhisattva Vows.",How to Become a Buddhist Monk," Begin your path to becoming a monk by understanding the basics about Buddhism. Check out books from the library, do research on line, and if possible, take classes from an instructor who has been ordained as a monk. The Buddha doesn't force anyone to believe, but asks disciples to prove the tenants true based on their own investigation of the religion. Here are the fundamentals you should know:


Study the Eightfold Path, which is the way to the end of all suffering. The path consists of the right understanding, right speech, right intention, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right action and right livelihood.
Learn the four noble truths, which contain the essence of Buddhism. A simple version of the four noble truths is that suffering exists, it arises from attachment to wants, the condition stops when the attachment to desire stops and freedom from suffering is possible through the Eightfold Path.;
, The Buddhist religion is worldwide and temples exist in almost every country. Practicing Buddhism as a layperson will give you valuable insight into what it's like to be part of a Buddhist community, which is central to becoming a monk. You'll want to become a regular part of the community for months, or even years, before you take the next step to become a monk.Check your phone book or look online for a Buddhist center near you.
Be an active participant of the temple. Some sanghas offer introductory courses where you can learn more about Buddhism. Others schedule retreats to help you grow in your faith.
Not all Buddhist communities are alike. Like other types of religious institutions, some are more traditional, while others have changed with modern times. Find a community that fits with your views and is appealing to you.
It may also be helpful to visit Buddhist temples in other cities or even other countries to get a well-rounded view of the Buddhist community.

, Learning from a mentor is a very important first step in becoming a monk. One-on-one instruction allows you to delve deeper into Buddhist teachings and gain a more complete understanding of what will be expected of you as a monk. Begin working with someone who can teach you everything you need to know.To find a mentor, ask people in your Buddhist community for recommendations.
Often, a temple will invite Buddhist leaders to come and speak to the group, and this gives you a chance to make contact with potential mentors.

, Becoming a Buddhist monk requires daily meditation and a conscious effort to change how the mind works. When you live in an abbey, much of your day will be spent in meditation. This takes practice.


Buddhism incorporates different kinds of meditation, including meditation that focuses on breathing, meditation that focuses on transformation and meditation on the Lamrim. Mediation can also include certain postures.
Start with five minutes of meditation two times a day. When you become comfortable with five minutes, increase your meditation time by a few minutes every day until you can meditate for 15 minutes two times a day. Some monks meditate for hours at a time.

, Becoming a Buddhist monk requires you to follow the Vinaya, a code of conduct, which stipulates that Buddhist monks and nuns do not work a normal everyday job to support themselves. In some cases the abbey you join will provide for your basic necessities, but in other cases you'll need to have enough saved to support yourself.

, Monks live as mendicants, meaning they possess only what is required for a very simple quality of life, nothing more. You'll be provided with clothing, sundries, and other items you need to stay comfortable from day to day. However, electronic devices, expensive clothes or shoes, and anything that could be considered a luxury item is not allowed. Monks are not allowed to possess items that could inspire emotions like greed, envy or possessiveness., Once you join a monastery, your life will be devoted to your Buddhist community. Your days will be spent in service of others, and your focus will be on those who need your help. You will have little contact with your family, and will be encouraged to think of your Buddhist community as your new family.


Before pursuing ordination, you may want to discuss this with your family and let them know what is to come.
Some monasteries don't accept candidates who are married or have other strong relationship ties. Single people are more able to devote themselves to the teachings of Buddhism, since they don't have outside forces pulling their attention away.

, Monks do not engage in sexual behavior of any kind. In some cases male and female monks (or nuns) are not allowed to communicate with one another about matters that aren't related to everyday business. It is wise to practice chastity before becoming ordained so that you can find out whether you're suited to a chaste life. The idea is that the energy you'd normally put into sex is directed to matters greater than the self., In some traditions, ordination is meant to be a life-long commitment. However, there are other traditions in which it's perfectly fine to pursue ordination for a limited number of months or years. In Tibet, for example, many men complete two or three-month ordinations to develop their spiritual identities before eventually getting married or pursuing careers.


Make sure the monastery you're interested in joining offers the level of commitment you want.
If you're not sure, it's possible to do a two or three-month ordination, then pursue a longer-term ordination later.

, If you're convinced that you want to become a monk, you'll be ordained at a specific abbey. It will be necessary to meet the requirements outlined by the abbey in order to be ordained there. In some cases an offer to become ordained must be extended by an elder who has decided you're a good candidate to become a monk.

, The ceremony will mark your decision to become a Buddhist, and can only be performed by an ordained monk. During this ceremony, the monk will transmit to you the three Jewels and the five Precepts. You will also receive your Buddhist name.


If you're following Shin Buddhism, you'll have an affirmation ceremony, rather than an ordination ceremony. The affirmation ceremony serves the same purpose as ordination.

, If you partook in an ordination ceremony, your teacher will usually be the ordained monk who led the ceremony. You will receive instructions specific to the monastery you are joining.

, A Bodhisattva is a person who devotes his or her life to the Buddhist way. The vows focus on doing compassionate deeds, striving to benefit every human being and seeking enlightenment. The vows serve as a way for you to embody your highest aspirations. They commit you to a life of selfless service, and you will recite them on a regular basis.

Listen to teachings; and 'renounce' (not abandon) the conventional world with its ideas, motivations etc.,
Contemplate the teachings.,
Meditate on the teachings.",How to Become a Buddha," This includes reading books, attending Buddhist community events, browsing forums, asking questions, propitiating the religious community, the immaculate Buddha, and all the holders of the Dharma. Perfect beings don't need to teach you, so you have to ask them to teach you. Mahayana Buddhists are bound by compassion to teach you. Essentially, prepare yourself as a vessel into which the teachings can be poured. The perfect vessel to receive the teachings has 3 qualities: 1) It is not already full or upturned. One must give up pride in what one already knows in order to receive the teachings and willing to receive teachings. 2) It is not dirty. One must not try to mix the teachings with what is already in the vase. This will only lead to confusion. 3) It is not broken. Remember what is taught, otherwise the teachings fall straight through the vase.;
, Don't simply accept the teachings, investigate them thoroughly. Always consider the teachings in their context and try to clarify all doubts and misconceptions you have. This can be done, again, by reading associated material, visiting discussion forums and asking true Buddhist Masters.

, The teachings are a vehicle for you to achieve lasting peace and happiness. They are not a means for themselves. Accumulating teachings and not integrating them into your life is like baking a cake and not eating it. Without meditation, the subtle points will be missed and realizations will not arise.

Create a winter altar.,
Plan a ritual.,
Plan a special Meal.,
Make a traditional cake or pudding.,
Give gifts to loved ones.",How to Have a Wonderful Yuletide," This can contain candles, special symbols, gifts you have received in the winter before or photographs of those deceased or living far away. Some people make a tiny winter wonderland with homemade snow, evergreen trees, animals and whatever else. If you are going to spend effort on any part of this celebration, make it this part. When you pray, pray over the alter and keep it all through the winter. Be sure to put decorations of holly, mistletoe and wreaths around your house, too. These are symbols of life and endurance through hard times.;
, Some people make cleansing water by boiling it and adding herbs, some people pray together for strength in the winter months. One idea from greenspirit.org is to pass around a bowl of water. As it gets to you, say what you'd like to leave behind and make a fresh start for in the spring. When all the wishes are collected, poured it on the earth in the garden. Getting together in ritual is also an idea. There is a gathering at Stonehenge on the Sunday before Christmas. See sources below for information.

, You might want to have a meal to celebrate midwinter. Whether this is at lunch, dinner or later in the evening is up to you depending on how you want to organize your day. Whether you're having a meal or buffet It might be a good idea to use seasonal vegetables such as leeks, parsnips, turnips, sprouts and potatoes to respect that seasons produce. You may hold a great respect for nature so be sure to regard the ethics of what you use. Buy free-range meat, game or have nut roast or stuffing balls instead. For some more ideas visit the links in sources below!

, This is entirely up to you. You could have the traditional fruit cake or perhaps a chocolate yule log. Some people make Yule loaf. See the guide 'How to make Yule loaf' for more details. Have wassail or eggnog or punch as a traditional winter beverage.

, To make it more special some people make their own gifts for your loved ones such as a homemade chocolate brownies, a homemade story book or story CD for children or adults. For more great ideas visit the link below as well as a link to Yule cards. If you don't like the prints you can always make your own!

Consider traveling to China to study at a Shaolin Temple.,
Gain acceptance as a disciple at a Shaolin Temple.,
Adhere to the strict requirements of Buddhism.,
Think about taking the path of a Lay Monk.",How to Be a Shaolin Monk," Before you do anything, you need to read extensively about what it actually means to be a Shaolin Monk. This includes the duties, responsibilities, requirements, and other qualifications that Shaolin Monks must have. Kung Fu is studied, not to teach fighting, but to discipline the body and for the beauty of emulating the movements of the animals, which brings you into harmony with nature. There are many books you can read that will teach you about the philosophy, about Buddhism and about meditation.


Understand the history of Shaolin Kung Fu, and its 1500 years of development.
Know that not all Shaolin monks are the greatest warriors. They are essentially Buddhist monks who have studied the technique of Shaolin.
Understand the strict requirements that Shaolin Monks are held to today.
Understand the philosophy and spiritual aspects of Shaolin Kung Fu.;
, Shaolin is a complete worldview and lifestyle geared toward creating a balanced and strong individual who is at ease with his or her world. The martial arts aspects of Kung Fu are just physical manifestations of a complete spirituality that you will need to learn and live by as a Shaolin Monk.


Shaolin Kung Fu is an outcropping of Buddhism.
Shaolin Kung Fu requires intense training, self-control, and self-reflection.
Shaolin Monks must possess a complete and utter dedication to their way of life., Buddhism is the basic foundation of Shaolin spirituality. In order to truly understand what it means to be a Shaolin monk, you need to also understand what it means to live as a Buddhist. Before you continue on your path to become a Shaolin Monk, you should dedicate yourself to learning about Buddhism. If the idea of being a Buddhist excites you, continue on your path. , Now that you’ve learned the basics and understand what it means to be a Shaolin Monk and what it means to be a Buddhist, you need to make the life choice to commit yourself to living as a Buddhist. This is your first real step in your journey toward becoming a Shaolin Monk. As a Buddhist, you will have to life by “The Four Noble Truths.”


Suffering is a part of life.
Desire for physical positions and pleasures is one of the greatest causes of suffering.
We can escape suffering by rejecting desire.
We can find happiness or “Nirvana” by following a specific path in our daily life (the 8-Fold Path)., The 8-Fold Path is really the nuts and bolts of Buddhist and Shaolin daily existence. The path is intended to overhaul how you live and how you see the world. It will change your interactions with your friends, family, and with strangers. For more information, visit: http://www.buddha101.com/p_path.htm

, You need to embrace a diet that is in line with Buddhism and Shaolin Kung Fu. These dietary requirements are part of both Buddhist belief and Shaolin commitment to self-control and self-restraint. They might be very challenging for many people.


Reduce how much you eat. Avoid overeating at all costs.
Eliminate meat completely from your diet.
Cut out simple carbohydrates.
Consume raw food. While some monks do this for every meal, you should begin with one meal., Depending on where you are, there might be practitioners of Shaolin Kung Fu in your area. These teachers will be your best resource for learning more about Shaolin Kung Fu and the steps you will need to take to get on the path toward being a Shaolin Monk. For those in the United States, there are a number of Shaolin temples and organizations that will be helpful. It is highly recommended that you talk to one of these teachers or monks before you continue your path to becoming a monk yourself. Consider:


The USA Shaolin Temple in New York City.
Other regional Kung Fu Centers.
If you don’t have a practitioner in your area, you might have to travel.

, After your preliminary education, visiting a shaolin temple will be your next step on the path to becoming a Shaolin monk. Here, you will meet individuals who have trained as disciples of Shaolin. The masters at many temples in the United States received their training at the principle Shaolin in China. However, training at a temple in the United States will probably not be as immersive and complete as training in China., If you don’t want to train at a temple in your home country, you can travel to China. China is the home of Shaolin Kung Fu, and as a result there are many Shaolin Temples there that take in students. Learning in China can be the best way to move toward becoming a Shaolin Monk. But consider the following:


Training is full time. You won’t be able to work, socialize outside the Temple, or spend much time doing much else. Your life will be devoted to training.
It could be costly to travel and train at a temple.
There are a wide range of Shaolin Temples in China, varying on quality, so do your homework before you decide to make the trip., The most important part of becoming a monk is gaining acceptance into a training program at a temple. If you can meet up to the rigorous requirements of the program, you’ll eventually be graduated as a Shaolin Monk. After you’ve been graduated, you’ll find a place as one of many types of monk. Types of monk include:


Clerical monks. These are monks that perform the day to day religious rites.
Scholarly monks. These are monks who commit themselves to knowledge and scholarship.
Warrior monks. These are monks who focus on the martial arts aspect of Shaolin., After you’ve graduated as a monk, you’re going to have to adhere to strict requirements of Buddhism. Your life will completely change. There are a lot of things you’ll have to give up and a lot of things you won’t be able to do anymore. Consider:


Shaolin Monks commit to a life of celibacy.
Shaolin Monks can’t consume animal meat.
Shaolin Monks don’t drink or smoke cigarettes.
Shaolin Monks reject a life based on material possessions, conspicuous consumption, and consumer culture., There are some Shaolin monks who have been trained as monks but do not adhere to the strict requirements of Buddhism—these are lay monks. Being a Shaolin Lay Monk might be right for you if you can’t commit your entire life to such requirements.


Lay Monks can marry and hold down an outside job.
Lay Monks may smoke or drink cigarettes sometimes.
Lay Monks might even eat meat."

Get the help of an enlightened master.,
Find your personal role model.,
Find your sangha (spiritual group, friends).,

Proceed with optimism on your way.",How to Be a Bodhisattva (Buddha of Love)," The greatest way of happiness is to be enlightened. An enlightened person is hundred times happier than an unenlightened person. And his or her happiness lasts forever. It is independent from outer circumstances. And if you go the twofold path of enlightenment and all embracing love, you will be hundred times happier than an enlightened person. And your way to enlightenment will much more easier. In Christianity this way is called the love to God (to a life in God, in the light of God) and to your neighbor. In Yoga we speak of Karma-Yoga. In Buddhism it is called the way of a Bodhisattva.;
, Find your way to inner peace. Meditate, do kundalini yoga and work on your thoughts. Think positive. Train the five qualities of wisdom, peace, self discipline, love and happiness. Live with a daily spiritual plan. Bring as much spiritual exercises in your life, that you grow spiritually.

, See what you can do personally. Look at your living environment and your possibilities. Find your task in your life. Make your job to a way to do all people good. Do every day a good deed.

, Don't work as much that you loose your energy. Then you end in depression and not in enlightenment. Grow in your energy. Stay in rest. Live out of the rest. Do little, but with the right motivation. Do what you love. Find a task in your life that you love, that makes you happy.

, Find your enlightened master. Copy his or her picture on your desktop. Watch his or her videos on the internet. Read his or her books. Take his or her personal darshan (blessing, energy transfer). Visualize your master over you in the sky. Pray every day to your enlightened master. Put your hands together and mentally say: ”Om enlightened master. Om inner wisdom. Please guide and help me on my way.”

, There are many Bodhisattvas and Buddhas of love. There are many spiritual ways. You can orientate yourself on Buddha Amitabha, Avalokiteshvara (Chenrezig), the Goddess Tara (Kuan Yin) or someone else. Visualize yourself as your role model and think, ""I am a Bodhisattva. I live in the light (enlightenment). I go the way of love. I wish a world of love, peace and happiness.""

, To get enlightenment it is helpful to have a spiritual role model (Buddha, Bodhisattva), a spiritual teaching (practice) and a spiritual group. If you have no group, you can find a group on the internet or see all spiritual people as your group.

, The beings suffer from hunger, war, illness, death, sorrow and unwisdom. Take other people more important than yourself. Develop compassion. There is a way to overcome the suffering in life. This is the way of enlightenment. Send light to the whole world, move a hand in blessing and think, ""May all people be happy. May the world be happy."" This exercise will transform your life. You will grow in love and bliss.

, Relax in meditation.

, Get a fulfilled life. Plan your life as a spiritual winner. See your goal and your way to this goal. Do every day the necessary step. So you will succeed.

There are many different pantheons throughout history, the most well-known of which are Greek, Roman and Egyptian. Wiccans' worship any gods or goddesses they choose.;
, Most (but not all) witches follow the one rule: An it harm none, do as ye will. This means that they can follow any path, as long as no one (including the self) is harmed. However this does not forbid doing harm. It is advice. there are a set of laws known as the 161laws.

, These could include belief in the sacredness of nature, the existence of male and female in all things and the Wheel of the Year (celebration of the seasons).

, In many countries it is illegal to prosecute someone for practicing witchcraft.

,, Witches believe in many deities, Gods and Goddesses but usually only work with two deities; the God and Goddess.

, Some witches believe that anything they send out comes back to them times three. For this reason many witches avoid curses or bindings. This is not an official Wiccan law, however, some believe this.


Ever mind the rule of three; what thou givest return to thee
This lesson well thou must learn
Thou only get-est what thou dost earn

, It is believed to be an energy that exists within everything, which can be changed with intention to cause something to happen. It could also be described as physical manifestation being affected by force of will. Spells and rituals make use of this idea.

, It shows that you care enough to understand what their religion actually is.

, Try libraries. Websites can also be helpful. Triumph of the Moon, or anything by Gerald Gardner is a good place to start. If your friend is truly of the Wicca, they'll have these books, or know of them. Amber and Jet is a good mailing list to look up, and your friend would find the information they have valuable as well.

, Your friend is going to be Wiccan. Shouting, predicting, and similar things will not help. Conversion is very unlikely. Do not discriminate or act like your friend told you that he or she was from a different planet. Encourage your friend to do research into the religion. Remember, all Wiccans' are pagan but not all pagans are Wiccan!


Do not let it come in the way of other things. Religion is normal, and your friend is still the same person he/she always was.
Your friend told you this out of trust. This is no time to gossip.

Choose a place that is far away from buildings and trees to light your fire. Make sure the area is free from debris and sheltered from gusts of wind.The bonfire can be the beginning of your evening of communing with your departed loved ones. Invite friends and family to join you, and hold hands around the fire. You can also sing and dance. This invites the spirits into your celebration.
You can also tell stories around the campfire. This is a great time to share memories of your loved ones who have died.
Check with the local authorities to make sure the location you have chosen is a place where bonfires are legal.
If you can't build a bonfire in your area, you can use candlelight to observe the ritual of lighting a fire to welcome the new season.;
, A silent, or ""dumb"" supper is part of Samhain celebrations around the world. This dinner honors the dead, and the participants are mainly silent. This dinner is one of the more somber aspects of Samhain celebrations.Make your dining area a sacred space. You might want to smudge the room with sage. You should also remove cell phones, televisions, and other electronics.
Many people choose to leave younger children out of this part of the celebration, as they typically have a hard time remaining silent for an entire meal.
Set a place at the head of the table but do not have one of your guests sit there. Reserve this place for the spirits you wish to honor.
You and your guests should remain silent throughout the meal until you all leave the dining room.

, The main purpose of Samhain is to remember the departed and acknowledge that everyone will eventually face death. In addition to a silent dinner, there are several ways that you can honor the dead during your Samhain celebration. One way is to create an altar.A ritual altar is somewhere that you can place items dedicated to the deceased. Some common items are photographs or personal items of the person you are honoring.
You might also choose to offer apples or pomegranates. To Wiccans, apples are the fruit of death, while pomegranates are the fruit of life. This represents the balance between the two that Samhain celebrates.

, The colors orange and black are traditionally used in Samhain celebrations. Black represents death and the fading of light. Orange represents the dawning of light that will occur when God is reborn. Dressing in orange and black is a good way to add these symbols into your celebration.
You can decorate with orange items that are found in nature, such as pumpkins.
Many people choose to light a black candle, which will then have a flickering orange flame.

, Since Pagans celebrated Samhain, costumes have been part of the celebration. Traditionally, they involved animal parts, such as skin, fur, or horns. While that is no longer common, many who celebrate the day still have fun creating costumes.Masks were also a traditional part of Samhain costumes. They were thought to disguise you if you were out participating in mischief, and also believed to confuse any malevolent spirits.
Have fun creating your modern version of a Samhain costume. You can create a beautiful mask out of many materials. You can also channel tradition by adding an animal element to your costume.

, Dancing has long been a part of Samhain celebrations, and it is one of the most joyful. Many cities with large Wiccan communities, such as New York, hold annual Samhain galas. People dance, feast, and make merry into the wee hours of the morning.Check to see if your city has a Wiccan organization and find out how they celebrate Samhain.
If your community does not hold a dance, you can throw your own ball. Invite friends and family to gather to dance and celebrate the memory of your departed loved ones.

, Many Wiccans seek divine guidance through a variety of methods. Samhain, with its inherent spirituality, is the perfect time to practice your favorite form of divination. You can use Tarot, runes, or Scrying to seek guidance.Take notes of any messages or inspirations you receive during your ceremony. Take some time during the evening to reflect on the guidance you received.
Carry the spirit of Samhain with you. Choose something from the divination ceremony and act on it. For example, if you felt divine guidance to strengthen your personal relationships, spend some extra time with your friends and family.

, Samhain is a celebration of the changing of seasons, so it is appropriate to honor nature on this holiday. Try taking a meditative nature walk during the day. Use the time to reflect on those who have passed, and your relationship with the physical world.Gather some objects on your walk, such as leaves or vegetables. Use these to decorate your home for your Samhain celebration.
Gourds, apples, and acorns are excellent items to incorporate into your natural decorations.

, Samhain is a time for making connections with others, both living and dead. Invite people to your home for a potluck Samhain celebration. Or find out if their is a local Wiccan ritual that you can join.Today's modern celebrations often include giving back to others. One popular idea is to have a Samhain coat drive. Since the day signals the coming of winter, it makes sense to think about those who might not be able to keep warm in the coming months.

, Your Samhain celebration will have deeper meaning for you if you understand the history of the holiday. Samhain was an ancient Celtic feast held to honor the dead. It also marked the beginning of the new year.Traditionally, Samhain celebrations involved divination rituals. This day was thought to be the best time to connect the physical world with the spiritual world.
The modern Halloween celebration includes many traditional Samhain elements, such as costumes and pumpkin carving.

, There is a large spiritual element involved in the celebration of Samhain. Although it is a time for celebration, it is also meant to be a day of honoring the dead. Samhain celebrations should include time to think about the deceased, and also reflect on the meaning of death.Fire was considered a sacred element, which is why the bonfires and lighting of candles are so significant in modern celebrations.

, It is wonderful to use Samhain as a day of celebration and reflection. The day can take on even greater meaning if you carry the spirit of Samhain with you throughout the year. For example, use the guidance from your divination ceremony to help guide your life in the following months.Becoming more attuned with nature is another way to continue the celebration of Samhain. Try planting a herb garden in your kitchen. This will allow you to have nature in your home throughout the year.

Use this spell to distance a person from you or to stop their negative behavior toward you.,
Retrieve an item owned by the person you wish to bind.,
Bind the item in silk ribbon.,
Find a body of water with a current.,
Toss the item over your shoulder into the river.",How to Use a Binding Spell2," This spell is used to bind a person away from you. Despite popular belief, it is not black magic, and it does not cause any harm to the person it was cast upon.

, This could be an item of clothing, a comb or hairbrush, a book, or any other object the person frequently uses.


Since the person won't be getting the item back, try to find something small that they won't miss. A hairpin, pencil, eraser or another school supply item might be a good choice.
Since the item is going to end up in a stream or river, try to choose something that isn't going to pollute the water. A small piece of paper or cloth will eventually break down, a bit plastic object won't.

, Wrap a long piece of ribbon around and around the object to bind it. As you work, recite these words: ""(Name of person), I bind you from causing harm to me, to others and against yourself."" Repeat the words until the item is completely bound.

, Go to a river or creek and face away from it so your back is to the water and the current is flowing away from you. Don't attempt to do the binding spell in a lake or pond, because the item will just sink to the bottom instead of getting carried away.

, It is imperative that you do not look back. Walk away from the spot where you tossed it and reflect on the binding spell. If you performed it correctly, the person would be bound to stay away from you or stop the behavior that has been bothering you.

After lighting the candle, pick up a piece of rope.,
Say, ""I stop your work."",
Say, ""Your spell is gone, your work destroyed."",
Know that this is only one example of a binding spell you could cast.",How to Use a Binding Spell3,", Focus. When casting any spell, it is good to have a clear purpose before you start. This way, you avoid a lot of mistakes later. Do you have a justifiable reason for casting this spell (something besides personal gain)? For what are you casting your binding spell? Is there anything you need to set up beforehand to cast the spell correctly?

, This will vary depending on your spell.

, Most spells start with a chant. An example for a binding spell that protects you would be: ""I bind you (name), your work, your voice and your chants. The work you did against me will not affect me.""


For the spell that completes the above chant, light a red candle or a white one. You do not need both; the red candle is preferable if you have it.

, Say, ""I bind you; I stop your spell."" Tie one knot in the rope.

, Tie another knot in the rope.

, Blow out the candle. Imagine the spell cast on you is vanishing with the smoke. It is gone.

, Its purpose is to protect you. Every spell will be different, with a different purpose, but most will begin with lighting a candle and end with blowing it out. Most will require something like the rope to hold what you are binding. The chant varies depending on what you are binding.

All Wiccan spells are positive by nature, as Wiccans don’t believe in casting hexes or curses.Wiccans are also known for:


A belief in a divine Goddess and God
The creation of charms and potions
The ritual celebration of astrological events, such as the summer solstice;
, Druidism is a flexible form of Paganism that focuses on the divinity of nature. Druids commonly celebrate the changing of the seasons with rituals and believe that nature should be preserved at all costs. Additionally, many Druids believe in the existence of the Otherworld, a spiritual realm where your spirit rests before reincarnating.Many Druids celebrate multiple religions. For example, it’s not uncommon to meet a Christian Druid.

, The word “Neo-Paganism” is a broad term for contemporary Pagan religions, including ancient religions that are still practiced today.The majority of Neo-Pagan religions are polytheistic, meaning that they worship more than one deity Neo-Pagan religions include:

Learn the Wiccan Rede.,
Read modern Wiccan literature.,
Join a coven.,
Perform a dedication ritual.,
Create your Book of Shadows.,
Cast spells and create potions.",How to Be a Pagan2," The Wiccan Rede is an ancient poem passed down through generations of Wiccans that details the spiritual ideals of Wiccans. This poem can be found online or on the first few pages of most Wiccan literature. There are two basic tenants: harm none, and the rule of threes.To “harm none,” avoid doing harm to other people, animals, nature, and yourself.
The rule of threes refers to witchcraft and spiritual energy. Whatever you put out into the world, you receive threefold.
Some Wiccans memorize the Wiccan Rede. However, many find this unnecessary and choose to internalize the teachings instead.

“Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner” by Scott Cunningham
“To Ride A Silver Broomstick: New Generation Witchcraft” by Silver RavenWolf
“Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment” by Laurie Cabot

Many covens require any aspiring Wiccans to complete a training period before they can officially join. The training varies greatly between each coven.
When looking for a coven, look for groups with a belief system that is similar to your own., If you join a coven, you will perform a dedication ritual when your training has finished. If you’re an independent witch, you can perform the ritual whenever you feel ready. Dedication rituals can be found in most Wiccan books and spell manuals.You can also create your own dedication ritual. For example:


Begin with a spoken promise to the God and Goddess to live ethically and “harm none.”
Give the deities an offering, such as a glass of wine or a plate of food.
Finish the ritual by performing ritual purification. For example, burn sage incense while you pray to the god and goddess.

, Also called a Grimoire, this book is an integral part of your spiritual journey. You can either buy a large blank journal online or make your own book. If you buy a book, make sure you feel a sense of attachment to it before purchasing it. In this book you can record:

, Seek your coven members, assemble the coven's grimoire, start planning your first gathering.

, If someone says they don't want to do something, they may be uncomfortable with it and by forcing them to do it will give you a bad name. Never make anyone do dangerous or just plain stupid things to get into your coven. Respect everyone and everyone will respect you.

, Most Wiccans choose to stay in the broom closet because modern day society doesn't support Wicca very well. Don't let them bother you too much, but if it gets out of hand, get some help from the local authorities.

, Candles, herbs, crystals, etc. They're always good to have around, donate some to the Treasury if you have spares you don't want. These are good to have in case someone forgets something for a ritual.

, Decide which Sabbaths and Esbats to celebrate. Write some charges or rituals to do with the coven. Perhaps someone can bake some special food for the celebration.

Be patient.,
Learn the guidelines and rules.,
Be prepared for abuse from people who don't understand.,
If you decide you want to become a Wiccan, learn more about the practices and beliefs and Wicca in general.",How to Start the Journey of the Wiccan Faith," Most Cowan (non-Wiccans) are keen on the ideas of Wicca to cast spells and gain power over others. They have seen the make-believe versions of witches over bubbling cauldrons and brewing sparkling potions. They initially want to gain power, and wave their wands, and exercise control over nature, people and the world.;
, Wicca is probably more and less powerful than you can ever imagine. Wicca isn't about power over another. The Wiccan Rede severely restricts Wiccans' spells and rituals. It prohibits manipulation, harm, and coercion. Spells must be used for the good of all, and they cannot harm anyone or any living being.

, A spell to be more responsive to opportunity. A spell to heal your body, mind, and spirit. A witch cannot cast a spell to manipulate someone to fall in love with her/him.

, A Wiccan is not something you can become overnight. It takes time, dedication, mental and spiritual training, just to become proficient. The learning never stops and spells become more powerful as you follow the path.

, Wicca has few strict rules and guidelines of behavior. One finds one's morals within oneself. Wiccans try to cast their spells with the everlasting thought that it must not harm anyone, including themselves.

, Wicca has been wrongfully associated with Nazis, Satanists, and dark worshipers, while there are some places in North America where Wiccans can be open about their beliefs and practices, there are other places where verbal abuse and harassment are prominent.

Learn the basics of a curse.It’s important to understand what a curse is and is not.,
Look for the signs.,
Accept that you may not be dealing with a curse.",How to Reverse a Curse1," Unlike a physical attack, a curse is believed to be a psychic attack on a particular person. Negative energy is used to cause harm. If you know of someone who envies or dislikes you, or if you’ve angered someone recently, it’s possible that you might be a victim of a curse.


Have you been threatened directly by someone? Do you suspect the person might dabble in witchcraft?
Some people think there are many different kinds of curses in magic, but they consider all of them to have one thing in common – malicious intent.;
, In order to possibly reverse a curse, you need to know what signs to look for. Are you not sleeping well? When you do sleep, are you plagued by unusual nightmares? Have you recently found yourself in dangerous situations or narrowly avoiding a serious injury? Have plants and shrubbery around your home sickened and died? Has your pet been acting strange or ill? Are you experiencing any kind of sudden insect infestation? Have you experienced an inexplicable illness that you aren't recovering from?If you are dealing with three or more of these issues, a curse might be to blame.
You will probably have a gut feeling that something is very wrong.

, If you are only dealing with one or two of these signs, you probably aren’t being psychically attacked. If you haven’t angered someone recently, or if you can’t think of anyone who might be jealous of you or bear you some kind of ill will, consider the possibility that you aren’t cursed. Sometimes accidents happen and everyone experiences a run of bad luck now and then.Look for a reasonable explanation for these occurrences.
Attempt to address the symptoms you’re experiencing in normal ways.
Knowing that someone dislikes you isn’t reason enough to think you might be cursed.

Gather your tools.,
Cast the circle.,
Close your eyes and picture the water illuminated with bright light.,
Allow the candle to burn until it is level with the water.Once this happens, the water will snuff out the candle’s flame.,
Bring the bowl of water and the broken candle outdoors.",How to Reverse a Curse2," You will need a single taper candle and a simple holder for it. Usually a black candle is used, which represents the dark magic you’re reversing. If you prefer to be more specific, use a red taper to represent the hatred aimed at you, or a green taper to represent the envy behind the curse. You will also need a glass or bowl, approximately the same height as the candle, water and salt.Water from the tap will work fine.
Table salt can be used, especially if that’s all you have on hand.

, Place the taper candle into the glass or bowl you’ve chosen. Carefully fill the vessel with water up to about a half inch to an inch below the tip of the candle. Make sure the wick is not submerged or wet, which will prevent you from lighting it. Sprinkle the salt into the water, around the taper, and say:“With salt, this water is made pure. I give it the power to heal and cure.”
If you practice magic, you can use your own words for the incantation.
If you are unfamiliar with how Wiccan rituals are done, you can read about the topic here.

, It might help to visualize sparks as the salt hits the water. Light the taper and say, “A spell was cast with baneful will. A wicked web was wrongly spun. I take away the harm and ill. I now undo what has been done.”Imagine that positive energy and light are emanating from the water and flowing around you.
As the candle burns, allow this positive energy to grow within the circle.
Picture this energy building to become powerful enough to reverse the curse.

, Remove the extinguished taper from the water. Hold it horizontally with both hands. Say these words, “This harmful spell I now negate. Return things to their rightful state.” As you say the final words, “rightful state,” break the candle in half.


Imagine the snapping sound being as loud and powerful as a sudden clap of thunder.
Picture the white light and energy suddenly bursting from inside your circle like lightning, energetic and powerful enough to destroy the curse’s effects.

, Bury the candle pieces in the earth, along with any candle wax that dripped into the water. Then pour the water around the buried candle, circling the spot with the water. Close the circle.There is no guarantee that this works. Try to think of the ritual as a symbolic gesture. Work on thinking positively about your situation.

"
"
Gather your tools.,
Light the stick of incense.,
Set up the two mirrors to face each other.,
Light the candle.,
Repeat the incantation.",How to Reverse a Curse3," For this reversal spell you will need two small mirrors (on stands if possible), one black candle and one stick of sandalwood incense. Try to perform this ritual exactly at midnight.You can cast the sacred circle if you like, but it’s not required.
You will need to choose a place where the tools can remain, undisturbed, for one month.

, Allow the incense smoke to drift and build around your chosen ritual area. Carefully carve an X into the wax of the candle. Be sure to carve it into the side of the candle. Don't simply scratch the X lightly into the wax – carve it deeply.

, If you don’t have stands for them, propping the mirrors up against something will work fine, as long as they are facing each other. Put the carved candle between the mirrors. This set up will result in the candle appearing to reflect infinitely back and forth between the two mirrors., Relax and allow your eyes to shift focus back and forth between the two mirrors. As you look back and forth, concentrate on the negative energy of the curse. Picture it as something visible, such as a black cloud of smoke or mist.


Say the words, “The magic upon me, be trapped this night, between these mirrors, never to see light.”
You can improvise your own words for the incantation, if you wish.

, Picture the curse getting trapped in the reflected surface of the mirrors. Continue to repeat the words over and over, allowing the energy and power to build. Imagine the darkness of the curse being sent back to the original sender.Allow the candle to burn all the way down on its own.Leave the two mirrors facing each other for one month.
There is no guarantee that this works. Think of the ritual as a symbolic gesture. Positive thinking will help you feel better about your situation.

Try to identify other modern traditions that can help you understand your tradition.,
Find a group.,
Take classes about your chosen tradition, but always be alert for cultural biases that might sneak into your textbook or lectures.

",How to Be a Reconstructionist Pagan," You may be drawn to a historical tradition based on your own ethnic background or you may feel drawn to a particular tradition for your own personal reasons. There are now many reconstructionist groups active around the world working in many different traditions. It is usually best to pick just one to study so you can focus yourself better, but it is not uncommon to explore several different traditions at different times.;
, Your library, bookstore and the internet are places to look for literature about your chosen tradition. Keep in mind that modern scholars, especially through the middle of the 20th century, may be expressing some of their own cultural biases in their writing. For this reason, it is a good idea to look for the most recent scholarship and try to find several different sources.

, Many traditional belief systems do not have a body of ""canonical"" literature (such as the Christian Bible). Still, there may be a body of literature that will help you understand the culture, practices and beliefs of the ancients. It would be a good idea to learn the original language of your tradition. For example, modern Hellenic Recons often learn ancient Greek so that they can read ancient Greek texts in the original language.

, You will be reconstructing a tradition that grew out of a culture that may be very different from your own. It is good to learn to understand your own cultural biases so that they do not become an obstacle for you.

, For example, some followers of Roman reconstructionism look to Japanese Shinto to help them understand Roman paganism because they feel there are some similarities between the two traditions.

, Either on line or better yet, a face to face group.

Plant seeds.,
Paint eggs.,
Go for a walk in the woods/forest.,
Start something new.,
Hide some eggs.",How to Celebrate Ostara," Ostara celebrates the beginning of a new life and planting seeds is a brilliant way to represent that. This is a time for birth and the end of the winter. Work in your garden or start a small vegetable garden, as well as celebrating Ostara with this, growing your own vegetables can also save you some money.;
, Eggs represent fertility, and painting eggs is a typical and enjoyable way to celebrate Ostara and Easter. This is a great, inexpensive activity to do with children. You can boil some eggs or blow eggs out, then decorate the eggs however you want. The eggs can be placed in a basket and used for decoration on your altar or table.

, Go out and enjoy Ostara by taking a walk in a wood or a forest and pick some wild flowers ( be careful and check first if this is allowed- as some flowers are protected, making it illegal to pick them). If you want you can leave an offering behind. Thank the flowers for their sacrifice and put them in vase on your altar or table.

, This is an excellent time to start something new. Some people choose to start a new diet or stop smoking, but the possibilities are endless.

, Hide some eggs in the garden or around in your house if the weather is bad, and let your children look for them. You may choose to hide chocolate eggs, or you might have a prize for the winner.


Have egg races. Egg races are games where the players each balance an egg on a spoon, and run around an outdoor course.
Have messy fun with an egg toss game. Egg toss is a game where people stand in pairs, and toss a raw egg back and forth between them. First the pairs are close together, with every successful toss and catch they take a step back, making the next toss more difficult. When the egg breaks, that couple is eliminated, continue until all eggs are broken.

Pick the base for your altar.,
Choose the placement in your home.,
Arrange symbols of your gods.,
Represent the four elements.",How to Do White Magic1," Your altar can be any raised flat surface wide enough to place your Book of Shadows and your chosen ritual items. This can be a coffee table, nightstand, a shelf, or a large storage chest. Some practitioners prefer to use a round altar, as it is easier to move around when inside a ritual circle. Others prefer square or rectangular altars for practical reasons, such as ease of storage.


For white magic especially, you may want to choose an altar made of wood to be more in tune with nature.You may even choose to use a particular type of wood associated with particular types of spells.;
, Make sure you pick a spot that is a generally quiet place where you can best concentrate. Some traditions hold that the altar must be placed either towards the North or East, depending on the school of thought.For white magic, you may choose to place your altar in a spot with a lot of natural light. You could also put it in a symbolically positive spot associated with creation, such as in your kitchen.

, These symbols should be placed side-by-side and central on your altar. Your symbolic items can represent either the Horned God and the Mother Goddess or a personal choice of deities pulled from a particular pantheon. Some choose different colored candles to represent their deities. Others purchase statues in their deities' likeness. Still, others pick certain items meaningful to their deities, usually derived from myths and traditions., Many traditions include symbols of the four elements arranged around the altar corresponding to the four cardinal directions. For performing white magic, use white or light-colored versions of these items (i.e.,. white wine instead of red) if you choose.


Earth to the North: Represented by a pentacle, stones, salt, food, and/or plants. A yellow or green candle is placed on the periphery.
Fire to the South: Represented by oil, ritual knives, and/or a candle snuffer. Place a red candle at the periphery.
Air to the East: Represented by incense, feathers, a bell, and/or your wand. Place a yellow or blue candle at the periphery.
Water to the West: Represented by a bowl of water, seashells, a chalice or glass of wine, and/or a cauldron. A blue or green candle is placed at the periphery."
"
Determine your intent.,
Select extra objects for your altar related to your spell.,
Start by casting a circle.,
Meditate on your altar.,
Perform any rituals or recite any incantations appropriate for your spell.",How to Do White Magic2," Always have a clear goal in mind when performing a spell. Remember that white magic is generally positive and for the good of others. White magic encourages healing, growth, happiness, peace, etc.


Many believe that a major aspect of white magic is that it cannot subvert the will of another person. When following this tenet, you should not, for example, cast a love spell on a particular person to force him or her to love you. Instead, a white magic love spell would involve attracting an unknown person, possibly with certain desired qualities, to either you or the person who asked you to perform the spell., The particulars of the items are generally considered secondary to their meaning to you, the caster. Draw from your culture or coven's traditions and symbols. Specific herbs and figurines are popular choices. You may add as many items as you want as long as they don't overcrowd your altar.Continuing with the example of a white magic love spell, place representations of the qualities you want in a lover. If you want someone passionate, add pepper or a dash of spice. Intelligence may be represented by a statue of an owl. A jar of saffron could be for a suitor who is happy or stable., Create a circle around your altar and stand inside it before beginning your spell. The circle can be made with chalk, string, stones, twigs, salt, or any other object you can fashion into one. Face towards your altar. If you are casting with other people, join hands and face into the center of the circle., Use the objects on the altar to clear your mind and focus on your goal. You can use either a wand or ceremonial knife to channel your focus by pointing at each symbolic object. Think about how each relates to the spell you are casting. Pray to your chosen deities for guidance and assistance.

, These are not always necessary for a spell, but many practitioners use them. You can either learn these by research or directly from another believer. You may even craft your own spell to write in your Book of Shadows. It's good to memorize everything necessary before starting, but you may also read directly from your book.For white magic, do not perform any actions that are either violent or symbolize violence. Similarly, do not speak negatively or use hateful words.

Condition your mind to enter a deep meditative state.,
Choose a place for meditation that resonates with you.,
Find a comfortable position.,
Decide on which type of mediation you will do.,
Close your eyes.,
Visualize positive energy filling your being.,
Allow thoughts to surface if you are practicing passive meditation.,
Keep a notebook and pen nearby.,
End your session by offering thanks.",How to Do a Wiccan Meditaton," Meditation devices such as candles, incense and chanting can help you enter into a relaxed meditative state. You can listen to a chanting CD or you can chant the name of your favorite Goddess or God. Keep the lights turned low or turn them off.;
, If you practice Celtic Wicca, you’ll probably want to practice your mediation outdoors. Your preference for the sights, smells and sounds of nature will enhance your meditation. Many Wiccans prefer to mediate at their altars, especially if the weather is inclement. The important thing is to choose a place to meditate that makes you feel naturally relaxed. If you mediate indoors, make sure the room is quiet and that you will not be interrupted.

, It doesn’t matter if you are seated or lying down or walking, as long as you are relaxed and comfortable. Your goal is to be receptive and alert, so don’t get so comfortable that you fall asleep.

, Passive meditation is the art of allowing images to arise in your mind and concentrating on those images or symbols. Active meditation involves you selecting the image or symbol you want to concentrate on; you can do this with your eyes open or closed. Whether you allow a symbol to come to you, or if you choose the symbol, give the image you have chosen your total concentration. Subjects to meditate upon include:


Pentagram
Magick
God/Goddess
Color(s)
Number(s)
Tree, flower or plant
Gem (crystal, amethyst, sapphire, etc. )

, Focus on your breath for a few minutes. Observe yourself breathing. When your breathing is calm and steady, take your awareness to your feet and move your focus all the way up your body. Release any tension you feel anywhere in your body. You can also stop and focus on tension and ask why the tension is there.

, Breathe in and picture white light entering your feet all the way to the top of your head. Exhale and release the white light, allowing it to enclose you in your magical space.

, If a thought or image intrigues you, begin concentrating on it, otherwise, let it go and allow the next thought to surface. (If your thoughts start to ramble, return to the focus on your breathing and start over.) If you have chosen to do active meditation, close your eyes and mentally focus on the symbol or image you have chosen. If you prefer, you can keep your eyes open and concentrate on your chosen symbol. Give it your total and examine every aspect of it.

, You may want to jot down ideas or sketch images that come to you during your meditation. Once you have done so, return to your meditative state.

, Try to think of at least 10 things you are thankful for; your list can range from minor pleasures (I’m thankful for my neighbor’s help yesterday) to major issues (I’m thankful I have enough food to eat.)

,
Go to everybody present and draw a pentagram on their heads with holy water saying ""Blessed be"" as you go, they should say ""Blessed Be"" in return.

,
Conclude the ceremony by thanking and farewelling each element in a backwards direction (you started with air and ended with spirit, so the order is Spirit, Earth, Water, Fire and Air) when you have farewelled each element blow out the candle.",How to Cast a Wiccan Circle,";
,, On the altar place a purple candle (for the element spirit), a statue of the Goddess, a burning stem of sage and lavender, and a bowl of holy water.

,,,,,

Talk in a strong, sure, and confident way. Be sure of what you are saying, and believe in your Goddess.
Light the candles; talk about each element and its uses as you go.
When you light the spirit candle, make sure you say how it is the master element, and that it represents the almighty Goddess.
if you can't find yellow, red, blue, green and purple candles; white will suffice. Just burn white sage Incense as well (if you burn it throughout the ceremony it represents the purity of the magic circle).

Grow your Wicca community.",How to Become a Wiccan," Wicca is based on a belief of the Goddess at the center of all life and creation. Some versions of Wicca weigh goddesses and gods equally, as there is a general sense in Wicca to believe in duality or balance in the universe.There are no holy books or prophets or intermediaries. All who practice Wicca have direct access to the Goddess or the Divine, and the Divine lives in each person.The Wiccan Rede, or creed, is the central tenet that Wiccans follow, which is: “If You Harm None, Do What You Will.” This creed values the harmony with which one should live their life, and as long as your actions do not hurt others or infringe upon their ability to live their lives, then proceed as you will. The threefold rule is also central to Wiccan beliefs, which is the idea that whatever you do will come back to you threefold. This can happen in a positive or negative way.
Wiccans take responsibility for their own actions. This is the belief that you have sole responsibility for your words and actions. You alone determine how you act and react to outside forces, and making amends to those who you have treated poorly is the best approach to taking responsibility.Harmony with nature is a key aspect, as is the sacredness of all life. Wiccans recognize that people live in partnership with the earth and rely on the earth’s bounty to survive. Nature and life occur in a cycle, and people are very much part of that. Related to this is the belief in reincarnation in some form. Things in nature keep returning, whether it is sea water that returns as clouds or clouds that return as rain, and so on. This also influences how Wiccans perceive death; death is also a part of the cycle of nature.There are many different forms of Wicca. According to Circle Sanctuary, “Hereditary, Shamanic, Gardnerian, Alexandrian, Celtic, Traditionalist, Dianic, Faerie, and Eclectic are just some of the variety of Wiccan traditions or paths.”These each have specific beliefs and rituals.;
, Wiccans prefer to perform rituals and celebrate outdoors where the connection to nature is closer.Many rituals and celebrations revolve around the cycles of the moon, such as the full moon and new moon, as well as the changing of the seasons. There can be, however, complications related to weather and safety, which means that Wiccans must often perform rituals inside. Some rituals are performed as a gathering of Wiccans in a circle surrounded by candles. There may be an altar at the candle placed at the north end of the circle. This circle creates a space for healing energy and Wiccans gather within the circle. During this circle gathering, there may be healing, divination, discussion or other nature-based activities. Many ceremonies and rituals also include eating food and drinking wine or juice before the circle is dissolved and the ritual ends., Wicca is not anti-Christian, nor is it against any other religion. It is sometimes known as pre-Christian since many of its beliefs are rooted in pagan practices of honoring the earth, honoring life and creation, and honoring the Goddess. You also don’t need to dress or look a certain way or act a certain way to be a Wiccan. People from all walks of life are Wiccans, and there is no official look or behavior that absolutely defines all Wiccans.

, This religion does not use magic to curse people or cast hurtful spells. As a Wiccan, you need to be responsible for your relationship to and use of magick. You live by a creed, or the Wiccan Rede, which is: “If You Harm None, Do What You Will.” If you live positively and in harmony with the earth, then you will be a successful Wiccan.

, The best introduction to self-studying Wicca is to read and research about the religion. Some of the most influential books about Wicca include: “The Heart of Wicca” by Ellen Cannon Reed, “Wicca for a Solitary Practitioner,” by Scott Cunningham, and other titles.There are introductory and advanced texts about Wicca that will give you a solid understanding of the religion.

, Wicca is polytheistic, meaning that its followers believe in multiple goddesses and gods. These goddesses and gods are not set apart from nature, nor do they possess superhuman powers. Rather, they are embodied in nature. These deities are derived from a variety of sources, including Roman, Norse, Hindu and Celtic roots.There are over 200 gods and goddesses that Wiccans might follow, but you won’t just randomly choose one to be your matron or patron deity. One of these deities will become your matron or patron deity. While you certainly have a say in which god or goddess you follow, it will also present itself to you, so be open to learning about a lot of deities. Be sure to research the deities thoroughly so you know which ones might have characteristics, not to your liking. , As you study and learn more about Wicca, you will begin to find associations and preferences within yourself. Writing down these observations will help you make connections and realizations about yourself. This journal will evolve into your Book of Shadows, a journal that you will keep when you become a Wiccan., Magick within the Wiccan religion is the practice of raising and channeling energy for a purpose.Magick for Wiccans is spelled with a “k” at the end of the word to distinguish it from stage tricks. Most Wiccans believe that magick is a personal manifestation of energy that comes from within.It is not sorcery; rather, it is spiritual and can turn your dreams into reality through spell-casting. You will need to learn how to make magick safe and protected by considering possible consequences of certain requests or spells and understanding the ramifications of using magick to obtain certain things.Practice meditation and visualization exercises to enhance concentration for using magick. Make a quiet space for yourself where you can meditate without interruption., In Wicca, the threefold law is the principle that whatever you do, it will be returned to you three times over. No matter if you do something good or bad, your actions will reverberate back to you. Following the threefold law and understanding that vengeful or vindictive actions will negatively affect you.Use the threefold principle to be aware and appreciative of your blessings., You can find them online in discussion groups and other forums, or you might find them in your local community. It’s likely that you will be able to find Wiccans more easily in a larger city, but that does not mean that smaller communities do not have their fair share of Wiccans. Depending on the perceived tolerance of your community, Wiccans might not be very publicly vocal about their beliefs. Talk with Wiccans about what they believe, how they practice, how they got started, and so on. These conversations will give you greater understanding of the entire faith, and they will help you develop a supportive community.

, This ceremony will formalize your personal relationship with Wicca and share your devotion to your deities. There are a number of simple and complex ceremonies that you can use; many suggestions can be found online.One such ceremony is as follows:


Collect symbols that signify a balance of nature. These objects will represent fire, water, air, and earth. It is fine to use objects that are readily available, such as a candle for fire, a glass of water for water, and so on. In a circle around you, place the water in the west, earth in the north, the air in the east and fire in the south.
Walk or swing your arm around in a clockwise manner three times. Close the circle by reciting, “Thrice I cast this circle ’round, sacred is this holy ground.” This creates a space between you and the physical world in which to make your dedication.
Make a statement about why you want to follow Wicca. Attest that you will follow the Rede (“If You Harm None, Do What You Will.”). Open the circle back up by walking or waving your arm three times counterclockwise., Most covens and other formal gatherings require that you have studied Wicca for a year and a day before you are considered knowledgeable or serious enough to join the group. Find a coven in your local community if one exists, and introduce yourself to the group. Some covens have closed membership and do not accept new members. Others are more open and welcome new members.It is not necessary to join a coven to practice Wicca. Like any religion, Wicca can be an individual activity or it can be practiced in a group setting. You may not have an adequate community in your local area, or perhaps you have tried to be in a group setting and it hasn’t worked out. Practicing as a solitary Wiccan can be lonely, but it can also be liberating. You can remain as true to yourself as you allow yourself to be. A circle is a loose gathering of people who might only meet periodically, but they gain support from each other. A coven is a more formal gathering of people, and they are often closed to outsiders. They demand trust and respect, but can often be subject to personality clashes or egos., One of the earliest actions that Wiccans should do is take an oath of secrecy. This covers three areas: protection of identity, protection of rituals, and protection of the mysteries of the craft. Wiccans should not assume that other Wiccans have announced publicly that they follow the religion; many remain secretive because of potential discrimination and harassment, or for other personal reasons. Wiccans should keep rituals secret and protected in order to maintain trust and ensure that people can be vulnerable within a trusted group and space. Protecting the mysteries of the craft respects the complexities and fragilities of Wicca as a religious practice. Respecting the mysteries and inexplicable occurrences will help sustain Wicca as a practice and reserve its magical qualities for those who actively practice it., The Rede, creed or approach, as you know it is: “If You Harm None, Do What You Will.”This idea emphasizes freedom to act as you see fit so long as your actions do not harm others. Tied to the Rede is the threefold law, or the idea that whatever you do will come back to you threefold. These principles emphasize positivity and harmony.

, Bring Wiccan beliefs into your daily life by reflecting on your religious path regularly. Wicca upholds strong beliefs in creative freedom, connection to the physical, spiritual self-empowerment, the divine feminine, family bonding, and a connection to nature.These ideals can be celebrated and integrated into everyday life through meditation, increased time with family, and engaging with the environment. Many everyday Wicca practices just take a few minutes, such as breathing and centering exercises, meditating for 10-15 minutes, or giving thanks for a meal. You might also perform a brief ritual of devotion to one of your deities, speaking to them about problems you’re having or giving thanks for blessings in your life. Other practices that can take more time might be: building an altar to one of your deities; creating art or writing that reflects your religious beliefs; or taking a long walk or hike in a natural setting., There are 8 holidays, or Sabbats, that are typically celebrated by Wiccans throughout the year, with the Wiccan new year being celebrated on October 31.These holidays can be celebrated in a number of ways, but they tend to include some acknowledgement and celebration of nature and family or community. Esbats are the celebrations based on a lunar cycle. Some Wiccans celebrate waning, waxing and full moon but there are some that celebrate only full moons. The Sabbats include:


Samhain (end of summer, around October 31)
Yule (winter solstice, around December 20-23)
Imbolc (February 1)
Ostara (spring equinox, around March 21)
Beltane (April 30-May 1)
Litha (summer solstice, around June 21)
Lughnasadh (July 31-August 1, first day of harvest season)
Mabon (autumn equinox, around September 21)

, A Book of Shadows is an integral part of being a Wiccan and is a record of your practice as a Wiccan. This book can follow a number of templates and no two books are the same. They are deeply personal and a person can tailor their book to their own experiences. Most books have certain elements, such as a page with the Wiccan Rede; a list or description of the deities you follow; spells and incantations; rituals; mythology; and other elements., As you practice more and grow more comfortable with how Wicca fits into your life, you can become part of a wider Wiccan community. This does not, however, mean that you should try to recruit other people to become Wiccans. This religion frowns upon proselytizing, or trying to convert people.But you can be a leader in your Wicca community, offering guidance and mentorship to new members.

Choose a container for your secret belongings.,
Purify the container, bless and consecrate.

,
On the bottom of your container, as well as on the inner side of the lid, draw / paint / carve in the pentagram with the symbols of the elements.,
Design the seal.,
Come up with a protective spell which will maintain and constantly empower the seal.,
If your spell includes asking certain spirits / deities for help, that means they'll most likely have to stick around our world in order to maintain the seal; so to prevent them from leaving and thus ruining all of this, make sure you seal the pact with them.,
Gather the items you wish to protect and cast a circle.,
Put the things you want protected in your container.,
Close the container so the drawn pentagrams on the bottom and lid match.,
If you wish, you may recite your spell again, channeling more energy to the seal.",How to Put a Protective Seal on a Container," It can be as fancy or as simple as you wish. Anything from a shoebox to a wooden chest will work fine. Clean it up, and, if you wish, decorate it.;
,, Draw them in such a way that their positions will match once the container is closed.

, This part is extremely personal. Make sure the seal is something meaningful to you and that you can easily remember and visualize it.

, This, again, is very personal. Write it out on a piece of paper or fabric using any medium you wish (ink, paint, etc). Next to the spell, draw another pentagram. (Note: the spell in the picture is blurred to prevent misuse and plagiarism. Remember, spells are always more powerful when you write them yourself!).

, Do this by signing in the bottom of the paper / fabric and then leaving an imprint of your fingerprints next to the spell, in the same medium in which the spell is written. Leave the fingerprints of the hand by which you wrote the spell. In the middle, draw a circle to represent Aether and bind the pact.

, Recite your spell and then put the paper / fabric on which it's written in your container.

, Organize them any way you want.

, Place your palms on the top of the lid and recite your spell again. Imagine your seal black and spinning deosil as you recite, and then descending on the container. The moment it settles on the lid, its color will change. Do not try to dictate this, let the change in color come by itself. It's alright if the color it changes to is unexpected, just go with it.

, This will add more power to it.

The final necessity for your shrine to the Wiccan God and Goddess is a small plate, bowl or other container to hold offerings.,
Once you have put your shrine together, you will want to bless it before using it for the first time.",How to Build a Wiccan Shrine," You can use anything as the base for your shrine. A small end table or TV stand will work wonderfully. Whatever you decide to use, make sure you consecrate it and use it only for this purpose. This will be a holy shrine dedicated to the Wiccan God and Goddess.;
, There are many beautiful altar cloths that you can purchase from Wiccan supply stores. Some have symbols of the God and Goddess, others portray Celtic symbols. You may just want to use a plain color cloth or you can choose not to cover the shrine at all. This is strictly a matter of personal taste.

, This symbol can be anything from a white candle to symbolize the Goddess or a yellow candle to symbolize the God to an ornate statue to portray the Wiccan deities. Use something that is meaningful to you. If you live in a home with other non-Wiccans, you might not want to be so bold as to use blatant pagan symbols. In this case, a corresponding candle may be the best choice to represent the Wiccan God and Goddess.

, When you are ready to pray or give an offering, the incense can be lit to help promote a more spiritual state of mind or to consecrate an item before offering. The censer can be anything from a seashell to a bowl of sand or even an elaborate pagan censer if you wish.

, You can use anything you wish for this from a small saucer to a seashell or piece of pottery. Whatever you choose for this purpose, use it only for offerings. It will become a holy thing and shouldn't be used for other reasons if you can help it.

, Light the incense and sprinkle it with water and salt, while asking the elements and the God and Goddess to bless and consecrate the space. You can write your own words for the blessing, incorporate someone else's or just speak from your heart as you do it.

Charm it physically.,
Give it your name.,
Cleanse the wand.,
Leave it in full moonlight.,
Remember that ""you"" are the power of the wand.",How to Charm a Wiccan Staff or Wand," Stones and charms are a personal touch to your wand that will strengthen its energy and add more meaning for you, strengthening its magic. You may want to hang stones from it. Choose stones which have energies you admire, and that feel right for you, rather than stones that look pretty. Charms such as moons or stars are also a nice touch, or perhaps beads in significant colors.;
, Carve your initials into your wand/staff. Carving is a better idea than simply painting them on. Your name on your wand symbolizes it as a tool of your own energies and inner magic and again adds more meaning to it. Remember that everything you do in this process must hold personal meaning for you; otherwise, it will not work.

, You put your own energies into this wand as you created it. Now it is time for cleansing through the elements. Pass your wand through smoke (air and fire) and salted water (water and earth).

, It is essential that you ensure nobody will disturb it during this process. You can leave it outside, or simply on your windowsill. Touch the wand often to charge it with your own energies. If you wish, you may want to apply holy water or essential oil to it; remember that this is a personal ceremony for you and therefore you can do what you want to ensure it holds meaning for you and make it more efficient.

, Your wand contains ""your"" energies, ""your"" own inner magic and while it is a powerful and useful tool, don't forget that ultimately, you hold your own power within yourself. A wand is not essential for magic; it is simply a useful tool.

Figure out why you want to use mantra meditation.,
Find an appropriate mantra or mantras for your intention.,
Set an intention.,
Find a comfortable place to practice.,
Sit in a comfortable cross legged-position with elevated hips and closed eyes.,
Focus on your breath, but don’t control it.,
Chant your chosen mantra.,
Decide if you want to continue chanting or silently meditate.,
Meditate for as long as you want.",How to Perform Mantra Meditation," Every person has a different reason for meditating from health benefits to attaining a spiritual connection. Figuring out why you want to use mantra meditating will help you identify the best mantras to chant and time to dedicate to your meditation practice.


There are many different health benefits to mantra meditation including lower blood pressure and heart rate, decreased anxiety and depression, less stress, and greater feelings of relaxation and general well-being.Mantra meditation can also have spiritual benefits such as liberating your mind and letting go of any attachment to things you can’t control.;
, One of the goals of chanting mantras is to feel their subtle vibrations. This sensation can help you effect positive changes and enter a deep state of meditation. Each mantra has different vibrations and you want to find one that corresponds to your intention.


Repetition of mantras can help you disconnect from any thoughts that arise during meditation and also help keep you focused on your intention.
There are many different mantras from which you can choose. The following are a few examples of powerful mantras that you can chant.
Om or aum is the most basic and powerful mantra you can chant. This universal mantra will create powerful, positive vibrations in your lower abdomen. It is often combined with the mantra “Shanti,” which means peace in Sanskrit.You can repeat aum as many times as you wish for your chanting.
Maha mantra, which is also called either the great mantra or Hare Krishna mantra, can help you achieve salvation and peace of mind. Repeat the entire mantra as many times as you like. It’s words are: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.
Lokah samastah sukhino bhavantu is a mantra of cooperation and compassion and means “May all beings everywhere be happy and free, and may the thoughts, words, and actions of my own life contribute in some way to that happiness and to that freedom for all.” Repeat this mantra three or more times.Om namah shivaya is a mantra that reminds every person of her own divinity and encourages self-confidence and compassion. It means “I bow to Shiva, the supreme deity of transformation who represents the truest, highest self.” Repeat the mantra three or more times., No mantra meditation practice is complete without first setting an intention. By taking a few seconds to dedicate your practice to something, you may be able to focus more intently and achieve a deeper state of meditation.


Lightly touch the bases of your palms, then the palms themselves, and finally your fingers to make prayer hands. You can leave a small space between your palms if you like to let energy flow. Lightly bow your chin towards your chest.
If you don’t know what your intention is, consider something as simple as “letting go.”

, You’ll want to practice mantra meditation in a comfortable and quiet space. This can be somewhere in your home, or even in places such as a yoga studio or church.Look for a somewhat darker place to practice meditating so that you don’t get overstimulated from the light.
Make sure the place you practice your mantra meditation is quiet so that no one can disturb you or break your concentration.

, Before you begin your mantra meditation, sit in a comfortable cross-legged position with your hips elevated above your knees with your eyes closed. This will help you sit with a straight spine, which is the best position for your body to absorb the mantra’s vibrations and focus on your intention.If you can’t get your hips above your knees, sit on as many blocks or folded blankets as necessary until you achieve this position.
Place your hands lightly on your thighs. If you like, you can place one hand in chin or gyan mudra, which represents universal consciousness. Chin mudra and prayer beads may help you enter a deeper meditation.Use prayer or mala beads to help focus yourself., Focus on your breath and the feeling of each inhalation and exhalation while avoiding the tendency to control your breath. This will help you focus on your meditation practice and achieve greater relaxation.It can be hard to not control your breath, but learning to let it go will help your overall meditation practice. The more you practice, the easier this will get.

, It’s time to chant your chosen mantra! There are no prescribed times or ways to chant your mantra, so do what feels best to you. Even a small amount of mantra chanting can have significant benefits.


Consider starting your chant with an aum, which is the most elemental sound.
As you chant, you should feel mantra’s vibrations in your lower belly. If you can’t feel this sensation, try sitting up straighter.
There are different perspectives on correct pronunciation, but simply do your best with the Sanskrit. You’re chanting and meditating for your well-being and not perfection, which may subvert the reason you’re practicing.

, Chanting itself can be a form of meditation, but you can also choose to transition from chanting meditation to a silent meditation. Either choice you make, you will reap the benefits of a mantra meditation practice.


Allow your body to flow with what it wants and whatever works for you in the moment. There are times when you may want to continue chanting or other times when you will want to meditate silently. The point is to not force your body or your mind.

, When you’ve finished chanting your mantra, transition to a silent meditation by staying in the same seated position and feeling any sensations that arise in your body. Sit in silent meditation for as long as you like. This will allow you focus on your intention and help you achieve greater relaxation.


Continue to focus on your inhalations and exhalations and any lingering vibrations from your mantra chanting.Let your thoughts come and whenever they arise. This will teach you to focus and let go of anything you can’t control.
Any time you need to refocus your mind, you can repeat “let” with every inhalation and “go” with every exhalation.
Meditation takes consistent practice. You will have good days and bad days and accepting this is part of the meditation journey.

Attain the end of suffering in your life.",How to Attain Nirvana," Meditation is the key to changing how your mind works and will allow you to travel the path to nirvana. It should be a part of your everyday life. While you can learn to meditate on your own, a teacher can help guide you and apply proper techniques.You can meditate alone, but it is helpful to meditate with other people and under the guidance of a teacher.You cannot travel the path without meditating. Meditation will help you better understand yourself and the world.;
, The Buddhist teachings (i.e. The Four Noble Truths) are the lens that you view the world through. If you are unable to accept the teachings, you will not be able to follow the other steps in the path. The right view and the right understanding is the foundation of the path. See the world as it really is and not as you would like for it to be.You seek to understand reality completely and through an objective lens. This requires you to examine, study, and learn.


The Four Noble Truths are the basis of the right understanding. You must believe that those truths describe things as they really are.Nothing is perfect or permanent. Think critically about situations instead of inserting your personal feelings, desires, and concerns.

, Commit yourself to developing an attitude that is line with your belief system. Act as if all life is equal and deserves to be treated with compassion and love. This applies to yourself and to others. Reject thoughts that are selfish, violent, and hateful. Love and non-violence should should be the rule.Show regard for all living things (e.g. plants, animals, and people) regardless of their status. For example, you would treat a wealthy person and poor person with the same respect. People from all backgrounds, age groups, races, ethnicity, economic groups should be treated equally.

, The third step is the right speech. When practicing the right speech, you do not lie, slander, gossip, or speak harshly. Instead you speak kind and truthful words.You words should affirm and uplift others. Knowing when to be silent and holding back your words is also important.


Having the right speech is something you practice every day.

, Your actions flow out of what is in your heart and in your mind. Treat yourself and other people well.Do not destroy life or steal. Live a peaceful life and help other people live peaceful lives as well. Be honest when you deal with other people. For example, you would not deceive or lie to get ahead or get something that you want.Your presence and actions should be positive and improve the lives of other people and society.

, Choose a profession that is in agreement with your beliefs. Do not have a job that harms other people, involves killing animals, or cheating. Selling weapons, drugs, or working at a slaughterhouse are not acceptable occupations.Whatever profession you choose, you must carry it out with integrity.


For example, if you work in sales, you would not use deception or lies to get people to purchase your product.

, Putting true effort into anything that you do will lead to success. Rid your mind of negative thoughts and focus on positive thinking. Have enthusiasm for whatever you do (e.g. school, career, friendships, hobbies etc.).You have to consistently practice having positive thoughts as this does not always come naturally. This will prepare your mind to practice mindfulness.The four tenets of right effort are:


Prevent evil and unwholesome states (sensual desire, ill will, worry, doubt, restlessness) of from arising
Get rid of evil and unwholesome states that have already arisen by countering them with good thoughts, redirecting your attention to something else, or confronting the thought and investigating the source of the thought.Produce good and wholesome states
Maintain and perfect the good and wholesome states

, Mindfulness allows you to see reality and see things as they really are. The four foundations of mindfulness are contemplation of body, feelings, states of mind, and phenomena. When you are mindful, you live in the moment and are open to the entire experience.You focus on your present situation not on the future or the past. Be attentive to your body, your feelings, your thoughts, your ideas, and everything around you.Living in the present frees you desires from your future and past.
Mindfulness also means being attentive to other people's feelings, emotions, and body.

, Right concentration is the ability to focus your mind on a single object and not be distracted by outside influences.Going through the other parts of the path will allow you concentrate. Your mind will be focused and not filled with stress and anxiety. You will have a good relationship with yourself and the world. Right concentration allows you to view something clearly and as it truly is.


Concentration is similar to mindfulness. However, when you concentrate you are not aware of all of the different sensations and feelings. For example, if you are concentrating on an exam, you are only focused on taking the exam. If you were practicing mindfulness during the exam, you would notice how you felt taking the exam, how the other people around you were acting, or how you were sitting during the exam.

, Metta means non-romantic love, kindness,and friendliness. It is a feeling that comes from your heart, and it has to be cultivated and practiced. It is usually practiced in five stages. If you are a beginner, try to stay in each stage for five minutes.Stage 1- Feel metta for yourself. Focus on feelings of peace, tranquility, strength, and confidence. You can repeat the phrase ""May I be well and happy."" to yourself.
Stage 2- Think of a friend and all of the things that you like about them. Repeat the phrase, ""May they be well; may they be happy.""
Stage 3- Think of someone that you are neutral about. You do not like them or dislike them. Consider the person's humanity and extend your feelings of metta to that person.
Stage 4- Think of someone that you do not like at all. Instead of thinking about why you do not like them and having hateful thoughts, send your feelings of metta to them.
Stage 5- In this last stage, think of every single person including yourself. Send metta to those people, your city, your neighborhood, your country, and the entire world.

, This type of mediation will teach you to concentrate and focus your thoughts. Through this mediation you can learn to practice mindfulness, relax, and rid yourself of anxiety.Find a sitting position that is comfortable for you. Your spine needs to be upright and relaxed. Your shoulders should be relaxed and slightly rolled back and down. Support your hands on a cushion or in your lap.Once you have your posture, begin going through the different stages. Each stage should last for at least 5 minutes.


Stage 1- Count internally (breathe in, breathe out, 1 breathe in, breathe out 2, etc.) after each breath until you reach 10. Start over once you have reached 10. Focus on the sensations of breathing in and out. Your mind will wander. Just bring your thoughts back to your breathing.
Stage 2- Continue to breathe in cycles of 10, but count before you inhale this time (e.g.,1, breathe in, breathe out, 2, breathe in, breathe out, 3, etc.). Focus on the sensations you have when you are inhaling.
Stage 3- Breathe in and out without counting. Try to see your breathing as a continuous process instead of just breathing in and breathing out.
Stage 4- Your focus should now be in the sensations of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. This may be your breath passing over your nostrils or your upper lip., The ultimate goal of Buddhism is to achieve inner peace and then share your experience with other people.Attaining nirvana is not only for your benefit, but for the world as well. It is important for you to be a source of encouragement and support for others. This is as simple as giving someone a hug if he or she is feeling down. If someone is important to you or does something nice for you, let the person know how you feel. Let people know that you are grateful for them and appreciate them. If someone is having a bad day, provide a listening ear.

, Your happiness is directly related to the happiness of other people.Showing compassion promotes happiness for all. You can practice compassion in many ways:Turn off your cell phone when you are spending time with friends and family.
Make eye contact when someone is talking to you and listen without interrupting.
Volunteer in your community.
Open doors for other people.
Be empathetic towards people. For example, if someone is upset, acknowledge and try to understand why they are upset. Ask them what you can do to help. Listen and show concern for their feelings.

, When you practice mindfulness, you pay attention to how you think and feel in the present moment. Mindfulness is not only for meditation but for your every day life as well. For example, you can be mindful as you eat, shower, or get dressed in the morning.Start by choosing one activity and then focus on the sensations in your body and your breathing as you do it.If you want to mindful while you are eating, concentrate on the taste, texture, and smell of the food as you eat it.
As you wash the dishes, pay attention to the temperature of the water, how your hands feel as you clean the dishes, and how the water feels as you rinse the dishes.
Instead of listening to the music or the television as you get dressed in the morning, get ready in silence. Notice how you feel. Were you tired or well rested when you woke up? How does your body feel as you put on clothes or shower?

, Buddha describes suffering differently than you may usually think of it. Suffering is inevitable and is a part of life. Dukkha is the truth that all is suffering. Suffering is typically used to describe things such as sickness, aging, accidents, and physical and emotional pain. Yet, Buddha considers desires(i.e. especially unfulfilled desires) and cravings as suffering as well.These two things are considered the roots of suffering because humans are rarely ever satisfied or content. Once one desire is met, another desire is created. This is a vicious cycle.


Dukkha means ""that which is difficult to bear.""Suffering is a large spectrum and includes things that are great and small.

, Desire and ignorance are the root of suffering.Your unfulfilled desires are the worst type of suffering. For example, if you are sick, you are suffering. While you are sick, you desire to be well. Your unmet desire to be well is a greater form of suffering than just being sick. Any time you desire a thing, opportunity, person, or achievement that you cannot have, you are suffering.The only guarantees in life aging, sickness, and death.Your desires will never be satisfied. Once you achieve or get something that you want, you will begin to desire something else. Your constant cravings keep you from achieving true happiness., Each of the four truths is a stepping stone. If all is suffering and suffering comes from your desires, then the only way to end suffering is by no longer having desires.You must believe that you do not have to suffer and that you have the ability to stop the suffering in your life. To end the suffering in your life, you must change your perception and learn to control your desires.


Controlling your desires and cravings will allow you to live with freedom and contentment.

, The end of suffering can be attained by traveling the Noble Eightfold Path.Your path to nirvana involves can be summed up by three ideas. First, you have to to have the right intentions and mindset. Secondly, you have to live out your right intentions in your everyday life. Lastly, you have to understand true reality and have the correct beliefs about all things.The eightfold path can be divided into three categories: wisdom (right view, right intention), ethical conduct (right speech, right action, right livelihood), and mental cultivation (right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration).This path offers guidelines for how to live your everyday life."
"
Recognize that nobody is perfect and everyone is affected by their current situation.,
Understand that intent often counts as much as your actual actions.

,
Learn which actions will almost certainly generate negative karma:


murder, even if you are not caught, unless it's in self defense
stealing, even if you are not caught and no matter how you justify it
telling a lie that hurts someone else in any way, even if you are not caught and even if you believe your own lie
intentionally hurting someone in any way
not doing the ""right thing,"" subsequently causing someone else to suffer in any way
resenting someone; your anger may cause you to be confronted with similar circumstances in the future until you learn to forgive and if applicable, take responsibility for your part of the conflict
incurring addiction, if it hurts you or anyone around you
disrespecting yourself to the point of personal harm (such as being a martyr); while you can gain good karma by helping others through martyrdom, but you still may have to balance a lack of self-respect

,
Recognize situations that are often believed to produce negative karma, but usually do not:


making, or otherwise acquiring a lot of money, as long as you do so honestly
having a lot of money and not giving a lot away to charities; the world is not your responsibility, even if contributing would create positive karma
lying to protect someone, as long as you're not hurting someone else in the process, or helping the person you're protecting to dodge taking responsibility for their actions
divorce or breaking up with a partner, as long as you are not intentionally doing anything to hurt them in the process
having sex without being married, as long as you do not intentionally hurt anyone (or yourself) in the process - sexual misconduct is one the worst possible sins and accrues bad karma that lasts lifetimes and is almost impossible to absolve
practicing non-monogamy, as long as you are honest with everyone involved, are acting responsibly, and do not intentionally hurt anyone in the process
accidentally hurting someone in any way, but any guilt could cause you to experience a reaction in the future if you don't let go of it
prostitution, as long as it's between two consenting adults and you are not intentionally hurting anyone in the process
exceeding the speed limit, although any associated guilt may create karmic ties
having a few drinks, although if done regularly enough in excess, you're disrespecting and hurting yourself, therefore incurring negative karma
being a single parent or having a child outside of marriage, as long as you provide for the child and be the best parent you can be
refusing to give in to others' ""shoulds"" (""you should do this or that""); it's your life and you know what's best for your highest good; as long as you're not hurting yourself or anyone else you're free to live your life as you desire

",How to Know What Creates Negative Karma," Admittedly, ""doing the right thing"" sometimes seems all but impossible for many due to the forces of personal fate. People will behave in accordance with their level of awareness, usually without thinking about karmic consequences.;
,,,"
"
Prepare for some negative reactions.Do not get angry at the negativity and realize that pagans who are not Otherkin themselves are accepting at best and indifferent at worst.,
Understand the difference between Otherkin and Therian.,
Know that Otherkin behave like rational human beings.,
Understand and Believe in Reincarnation.,
Understand the Energy Model.,
Join Otherkin Communities.",How to Be an Otherkin Wiccan," Also, it seems that most of the negativity comes from the Internet, not face-to-face meetings. People are a lot more aggressive to others online than in person.


Remember that it is your belief and you should stick to it. No amount of trash talking should make you question your belief;
, Otherkins feel that they are nonhuman. They believe that deep down their mind is similar to a species whose existence hasn't been proved yet. Therians believe they are connected to a species whose presence is already known of.


There are no secret rituals or magical spells. It is just a way of thinking and perception. Though many Otherkin do believe in magic and explain their current condition as a result of a spell cast on them a long time ago(when they were living their previous life).
You must deeply feel that you are not human but some other creature, this feeling should be strong enough to make you feel uncomfortable when someone calls you human.

, Even if you identify yourself as an animal or a mythological creature, it does not mean that you are entirely different from the rest of mankind. A wolf therian does not bite people on sight, he merely feels more conscious about damage to the jungle and feels more deeply hurt when a wolf is harmed.


Being Otherkin does not change anything. You keep living your normal life. Being Otherkin just colors your perception a little.
Avoid making claims that you can turn into your kin's form. This is called ""Physical shifts"" and it's frowned upon in the Kin community because it is impossible. Making such claims can get you noted as a troll.

, Most (but not all) Otherkin believe in the form of reincarnation. They believe that their previous life as an animal influences their current human form, which those animalistic tendencies are carried over to this life.


This can also be explained by Timothy Leary’s eight-circuit model of consciousness, in which the first two circuits are animalistic in nature, while the third is human(it tends to categorize and label things), in Otherkin the third circuit is labeled the first two circuit as an animal within them., Energy is a force which creates magic, which we can further shape and direct to do our bidding. We are made up of energy and that every person poses a unique “energy signature”. This signature can be changed to resonate with “elven” or “draconic” energies leading to some Otherkin identifying themselves as elves or dragons., Most Otherkin resources can be found online. Otherkins are fairly outgoing and participate in Wiccan gatherings. You should locate and participate in such communities,

Fear from misunderstanding is common, and the best thing you can do if those sort of people won't let themselves be taught about your faith is to stay away from them.

Whether you display it or not, be mindful of the consequences. Your need to be bold may need to be tempered by the climate of your school.

If you are being bullied or threatened, do not be afraid to go to counselors or teachers for help. It may end up with you being outed by parents or friends (which isn't the end of the world), but your personal safety should always be your biggest concern. Most counselors need your permission before parents are consulted anyway, and they can see to it that the problems end. Never let the problem continue to escalate until you are actually hurt.

Chanting can be done congregationally or individually. The idea is to chant as much, and as regularly, as possible.
Individual chanting on prayer beads is recommended; 108 sequences of the mantra compose a full cycle on the prayer beads. Each cycle represents one round. Gradually increasing chanting to 16 rounds daily is considered the necessary minimum standard to progress towards bhakti (spontaneous devotion). It takes about 2.5-3.0 hours to chant 16 rounds, at a pace demonstrated by Prabhupad, about 11:30 minutes per round. You can find a sample at prabhupada.
Any number of rounds is beneficial.

, Most temples, mandirs, have a variety of programs that are open to the public. Since many Vedic Hinduism rituals have modern day equivalents, simply attending services during rituals and holidays can help you understand how the history of Hinduism has formed the current traditions. If there’s a specific ritual, rite, or celebration you’ve found particularly interesting in your studies thus far, attending the modern celebration at a temple can be very enlightening.


Start with an online search for Hindu Temples or Mandirs.
Once you find a nearby Temple, explore their website looking for ways you can get involved.
Call the Temple or their education office, if they have one. Explain that you are a student of ancient Hinduism and would like to find out more about the philosophies. In most cases, they will be happy to offer assistance., Mentors or gurus have been an integral part of Hinduism since the very beginning. Gurus are considered to be incarnations of god in human form. They are teachers who live their lives as an example for their students. You may not be able to find a guru, but learning from someone who has knowledge and understanding of both the lower and higher knowledge of Hinduism can be extremely beneficial, especially if you’re interested in conversion to Hinduism.


This can be a professor, member of the Hindu temple, or anyone else who has more knowledge about ancient Hinduism than you do., Contact your local community colleges or universities to find out if they offer courses on Hindu studies or Hinduism.

, Three paired concepts make up the essence of ancient Hinduism: Atman and Brahman, reincarnation and karma, and moksha and samsara. Once you have an understanding of these underlying concepts, you can begin to dive deeper into ancient Hinduism.


Atman is the individual soul and Brahman is the universal soul that all souls seek to return to.
Reincarnation and karma are concepts that describe how an individual soul is able to reunite with Brahman. By doing good deeds, the soul builds good karma, and it is reincarnated into progressively higher beings until it achieves union with Brahman.
Moksha and samsara are the main goals of ancient Hinduism. Samsara is the best way to live and progress through the reincarnation cycle, and moksha is the ultimate freedom from this cycle.To find out more about these and other main premises of ancient Hinduism, read more online or visit your library.

, These are the oldest Hindu religious texts, and they include a variety of information about the ancient practice of Hinduism. The Vedas provide samples of hymns of devotion, rituals, and sacrificial practices, as well as essential information about daily life for the ancient Hindu people.There are four Vedas, and they are available in multiple translations on the internet. One good translation is available here https://www.scribd.com/doc/17001079/Four-Vedas-English-Translation.
You can also find commentaries on the Vedas online. A good place to start is with the Srimad-Bhagavatam. This is an analysis of the Vedas that is available free online at http://e-vedas.com/books/sb_set.htm.

, The ancient practice of Hinduism has been passed down through the generations, changed, and molded into new forms. Hinduism is one of the only religions with no known individual source, and its rich history has shaped its current forms. The best way to understand the faith lives of the ancient Hindus is to explore the history.


The earliest evidence of Hinduism dates back to 5500 BCE.
The Vedas were passed down orally and then in writing, and they offer the earliest insight into the faith. There is no known beginning date for Hinduism, as there were other versions of Hinduism practiced at this time that have been lost.
The basis for ancient Hinduism was the idea that gurus, people whose souls had achieved a higher level, were able to see the best way to live and show it to their students. Thus, many people followed these gurus in an attempt to remove themselves form the endless cycle of reincarnation., Hinduism is traditionally considered to be a pantheistic religion, with its main deity being the Brahman or global soul. However, the three main deities of the Brahman, which make up a Trimurti, are Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Their consorts are Sarasvati, Lakshmi, and Parvati., This is a document that all converts to Hinduism are required to complete as part of their conversion, but it’s also a helpful way to understand Hinduism as it compares to other religions or life philosophies you may be more familiar with. It is essentially a way to systematically compare the main points of Hinduism and teachings of the Vedas to a familiar philosophy.


One example would be thinking of how reincarnation and karma compares to the idea of Judeo-Christian heaven and hell.
This can and should take months or years. It’s one of the methods of internalizing the teachings of Hinduism., This has been part of studying and practicing Hinduism for thousands of years. Whether or not you find it personally helpful, this is a great way to better understand how its practitioners learned ancient Hinduism. There are a variety of ways to meditate, but the purpose is to better understand yourself. Because Hinduism teaches that all people are representations of the Brahman, the only way to fully know and understand Hinduism is to fully know yourself.


Start by finding a quiet place.
Sit comfortably. You don’t necessarily need to assume any specific pose.
Breathe deeply and slowly in and out.
Quiet your mind by repeating one of the mantras from the Vedas or any other repeated phrase you find meaningful. This can be done out loud or internally.
Continue this process for any length of time you feel comfortable. You may not achieve any great revelations, but you’ll at least understand how the ancient Hindu people understood their religion., Hinduism teaches that gaining control of your body is essential to harnessing the full potential of the mind, so you’re able to fully engage with complex ideas and elevate your soul in your next incarnation. The Vedas explained that, rather than external sacrifices, it was necessary to sacrifice the ego to achieve higher knowledge, and yoga was one way the Vedas named to accomplish this.


Today yoga is very popular, and you can easily find poses online or join a class at your gym.
Practicing yoga is another way to internalize how the ancient Hindus practiced their faith., Now that you’ve gotten the big concepts and started practicing meditation and yoga, it’s time to learn from others. While few people are still practicing ancient Hinduism, becoming part of a Hindu community exposes you to the knowledge and history of the faith and introduces you to numerous resources for further learning.


You can do this online. There are a number of online groups where you can talk about Hinduism with others who have more experience and better understanding.
Visit your local temple. Talk to the people there, and learn more about those in your area who are currently practicing Hinduism.
If you decide you’d like to continue studying and being involved with the Hindu community, talk to the leaders at the mandir about the conversion process. It includes reviewing your past religion to determine why you believe in Hinduism, and addressing your past faith leaders to sever ties with churches you’re a member of peacefully and respectfully."

Realize that Vedanta provides the key to understanding the inner significance of Indian culture and literature.,
Love your fellow beings as yourself - this is the essence of Vedanta.,
Practice yoga.",How to Get the Essence of Vedanta,"

The recognition of the divinity in man is the essence of Vedanta.
Vedanta teaches us there is one reality and each soul is identical with that reality. All the infinite powers of the world are with in the human soul. According to the Mundaka Upanishad:-- ""Brahman is supreme, He is self luminous, he is beyond all thought. Subtler than the subtlest is he, farther than the farthest, nearer than the nearest. He resides in the lotus of the heart of every being.;
, Often we do not know why it would be good to love other beings as ourselves. It is possible when we understand that the whole world is one–the oneness of the universe is the solidarity of life–that in hurting anyone you are hurting yourself, in loving anyone, you are loving yourself., Vedanta tells us to build in all people a faith in themselves. We have to struggle to manifest the perfection and divinity within through the practice of yoga. This is the key to inner transformation and to change the world around us.

Rediscover your own divine nature and help others to do the same. The Veda teaches us "" Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam "" which means the total world is a family. Here we strive to enclose little spaces and exclude outsiders. So our aim should be to wipe out these little enclosures, to widen the boundaries until they are lost sight of.

To understand what the principles are.,

Understand what is different of where and when Mahatma Gandhi lived and where and when you live

He lived in India during the '30s and '40s when he was following these principles.,
Manipulate the principles to not lose the meaning behind them but be able to apply them without feeling restricted.",How to Follow Gandhi's  Principles," There are 6 principles that Mahatma Gandhi followed:

Truth: learning from your own mistakes and conducting experiments on yourself.
Nonviolence: nonresistance connected in a way to religion..
Vegetarianism: carved in the Hindu and Jain traditions in India.
Brahmacharya: spiritual and practical purity.
Simplicity: giving up unnecessary spending.
Faith: belief in a Higher power and that all religions are real and are equal.;
,
We live in a society and amongst a generation that has a lot more technology, is more materialistic and we are not fighting for the same reasons (we have 'freedom'(opportunities to do what we want to do))

, Here is an example:







Truth: fight your own inner demons, fear and insecurities. Everyone is unique in this world and therefore, one should not compare with others. Be honest with yourself of who you are and what you want. If you think there is something to fix, then fix it.






Nonviolence: control your temper and also your thoughts. What we think, we become and therefore if you always are thinking of hurting someone or feeling extremely angry at someone, those are the vibes you'll be giving to others. Best way to be nonviolent is to think positive and believe that whatever happens, it is for a good reason.






Vegetarianism: not everyone can resist meat, but you can control your consumption. For health reasons, avoiding eating a lot of red meat is a good idea.






Brahmacharya: many of us want to get married and have children or be intimate with someone. Therefore, becoming a brahmacharya might not be possible. However, you could reduce thinking of the opposite sex as an object. You could also wait to be intimate with someone till after marriage.






Simplicity: life in the western countries tends to be quite fast. Do you need the latest fashion clothing or can you wear the clothes you already have? Do you need 50-100 pairs of shoes? Do you need the latest gadgets? Do you need a brand new BMW? Simplicity doesn't mean foregoing all your desires, but not buying something right away or something you don't really need. Simplicity also means being happy with what you are given and have.






Faith: believing that there is someone or something higher than you. You don't need to believe in God, but believing that everyone is equal and you are no less or more than someone else. It is knowing your values, ethics and morals. Faith is not following others blindly especially when someone else is doing something that your heart says is not right.

Understand that conversion to Hinduism is all about practice.,
Find a sect that will accept you.,
Involve yourself in ritual worship.,
Practice yoga and meditation.,
Commit to improving your karma.,
Become a member of a temple.,
Take part in ritual practices.,
Attend Hindu celebrations and festivals.,
Undertake a spiritual pilgrimage.,
Accept your differences.,
Recognize the dharma.,
Know the significance of karma.,
Strive for spiritual liberation.",How to Convert to Hinduism," There is no official conversion process or ceremony for converting to the Hindu faith. To become a follower, one needs only to have the will and the commitment to study the scriptures and abide the proper practices. While Hinduism is a highly traditional religion founded on ritual, it is not exclusive in the sense that one must be formally recognized in order to be a practitioner.Hinduism preaches the very principle that there is no need for conversion; the wisdom of the universe is available to all, if only they're willing to seek it.;
, Do some research to see if there are any Hindu temples or organizations in your area and find out what the requirements are to join. Many contemporary Hindu sects are happy to take on Western followers and anyone else who is interested in learning Hindu doctrine. Consider whether the beliefs and practices of the sect you’re thinking of joining are in alignment with what you wish to gain from becoming a follower.Most people who practice the Hindu religion are born into it, and consider it something of a birthright. There are those that claim that you cannot “convert” to Hinduism; if you were not born Hindu, you never will be. However, this is a somewhat dated position, as Hinduism has become a major world religion and many people flock to learn its ways.Two prominent examples of Western sects that have embraced the Hindu religion are the Hare Krishnas and the school of Transcendental Meditation., Once you become part of a Hindu temple or organization, you will be expected to participate in puja, or ritual worship. Puja ceremonies are most often composed of many different symbolic actions, such as cleansing idols representing Hindu deities, making offerings and recitation of spiritual scriptures. Taking part in puja will help you understand more about Hindu rituals and their religious significance.In addition to its role as a communal practice, puja is considered a highly individual devotion, and a good deal of prayer and offerings are performed from the privacy of one’s home.

, Learn the proper asanas, or meditative yoga motions, to supplement prayer and ritual offerings. In the Hindu religion, meditation can be performed either from a resting position, as it done conventionally, or through the practice of yoga, which is essentially a form of moving meditation. Traditionally, yoga involves transitioning through a series of strenuous postures that serve to purify the body and make the mind and spirit receptive to the blessings of enlightenment.Though it’s become a trendy form of exercise in the West, the practice of yoga is considered an integral part of of the spiritual duties of the Hindu follower.
Yoga requires you to be supple, which promotes proper breath control and circulation, strengthening your body and enhancing your ability to focus.

, Seek to live a good live, to be mindful of the suffering of the world, to show kindness to others and to implement the wisdom of the Vedas, or classical scriptures. Karma is a tenant central to Hindu philosophy and lies at the heart of all human interaction. It is effectively an inventory of one’s moral character, and through the cultivation of pure karma comes the possibility of freeing oneself from the cycle of reincarnation.Karma can be understood as a sort of meter—if your karma is bad, or low, you will be visited by hardship and injustice, even in your subsequent lives. But if your karma meter is full, if you’ve always acted with good intentions and devoted yourself to lessening the suffering in the world, you stand a chance of attaining liberation and thus being freed from Samsara.

, See if there are any Hindu temples or community centers where you live that would allow you to join their congregation. The widespread acceptance of the major world religions has made finding places of worship in unlikely locations more common. As a member of a temple, you will be guided through puja and be given advice on yoga meditation and understanding the Vedas (scriptures), which will help you on your spiritual journey.Unfortunately, it is still somewhat common for Westerners and those of other religious foundations to be rejected from practicing Hinduism in a formal capacity. If this happens to you, keep looking until you find a temple that will accept you, or continue your study and worship on your own.

, Learn about different ritual activities from the leaders of your temple or community and incorporate them into your practice. In addition to puja and yoga, there are many other rituals that encompass important aspects of Hinduism. While most of these are spiritual in nature and center around paying tribute to divinity, others are more personal and practical, and function almost as good-luck rituals or reminders of the need to excel in your station of life.Puja is the most commonplace form of ritual in Hinduism, and is usually performed every day. Other important rituals for the Hindu follower to observe include making offerings and sacrifices (symbolic in meaning) to the various deities of the pantheon, decorating the body with markings that represent spiritual aims and sitting in meditation of the truths of the Vedas.
Other more sophisticated rituals, collectively identified as a yajna, require the oversight of qualified holy men and typically entail systematic group offerings and blessings. These rituals are more akin to what you might expect to find in churches where Abrahamic religions are practiced. If you belong to a Hindu temple or spiritual community, a yajna is likely to be conducted by the group's most prominent leaders.

, Hindu festivals are based around the seasons and usually commemorate or symbolize important events in Hindu theology. Some of these celebrations, such as Makar Sankranti, require visiting cultural landmarks like the Ganges river, but many holy events can be honored anywhere with prayers and offerings particular to the day. In becoming immersed in the Hindu religion, make an effort to learn the significance marking these occasions and take part in observing them.Among the most venerated annual Hindu festivities are Holi, a celebration of springtime and rebirth occurring the day after the full moon in early March; Diwali, the ""row of lights"" ceremony that commemorates the end of the Vikram calendar; and Mahashivaratri, a birthday celebration for Shiva, one of the three highest deities in the Hindu religion.The majority of Hindu celebrations are scheduled by the Vikram calendar, which follows a lunar progression, and fall on notable days of the moon cycle., If you have fully committed yourself to following the Hindu religion, you might plan a pilgrimage to visit holy sites in India and its outlying regions and pay your respects. Embarking on a pilgrimage will offer you a rare opportunity to see the shrines of deities and saints, refocus your spiritual devotion and purify yourself of sins and impurities. Pilgrimages are time-consuming and expensive undertakings and may not be feasible for all practitioners, but they are venerated tradition in Hinduism nonetheless.Some of the most famous sites for pilgrimages include the “big four” Indian towns Puri, Rameshwaram, Dwarka and Badrinath, as well as Nepalese stops like the Pashupatinath Temple.
A small percentage of larger Hindu organizations that are funded by local communities may offer all-expense-paid group pilgrimage opportunities for those who could not otherwise afford them. Check and see if your temple or organization is one of these.

, If you come from a place with vastly different religious background, not all Hindu beliefs and precepts will make sense to you at first. You may also encounter some opposition to your becoming a follower of the religion if you were not born into it. Be patient with these differences and try to see beyond them. You have a right to pursue your own spiritual path, and nothing should hold you back once you have decided to devote yourself to the Hindu religion.


Much of the cultural exclusion of Hinduism stems from the Indian caste system, in which people are born into certain social classes from which they can neither raise or lower themselves. Because non-Indians are outside of the sacred caste, they are also thought to be necessarily outside of Hindu spirituality.
If you cannot find a temple or group to join and are forced to continue your practice from home, don’t despair. There are many modern gurus who are willing to share their teachings with followers through recorded content like books and audio recordings, and communal interaction can be found through chat rooms and international conventions., Dharma is a complex term with several different interpretations, referring to the natural order of the universe, the “right way of living” or the comprehensive teachings of the deities. These notions form the fundamental principles of Hinduism. Even though you may not understand their meaning or application right away, strive to extract as much practical wisdom as you can from the scriptures you study. As you progress in your practice, the connectivity of these concepts will open up to you.All Hindu beliefs have their place. Rather than getting caught up in the more fantastic elements of the scriptures, concentrate on understanding what they offer in terms of truth and knowledge.

, Be mindful of the notion of karma at all times and consider how your actions influence your own morality as well as the well-being of others. Your karma should be at the center of every decision you make. Auditing your actions brings you closer to realizing moksha, or spiritual liberation, but it also ensures that you’re making the right choices at any given time.Karma is more complex than simply penalty or reward for your actions. It is a common thread that runs through consecutive rebirths. Introspection of one’s karmic state creates a kind of feedback system for evaluating the goodness of one’s lives.
Bad karma is thought to follow an individual through their different lifetimes, accounting for the seemingly random nature of misfortune in the world., Meditate often on salvation and the means to attain it. The ultimate purpose of any religion is to transcend the struggle of human existence and come to actualize the divine aspects of the self. This can be achieved through a focused approach to spiritual learning. Try to apply the wisdom that you gain to your everyday life. You’ll find that through enlightened consciousness, the quality of your own life will improve, which will allow you to positively affect the lives of the people around you.Moksha can simultaneously be understood as a literal spiritual “breakthrough” after which the mysteries of existence seem to dissolve, or as a purposefully maintained state that recognizes the need for compassion, selflessness and acceptance.

Decide if you want a ready-made mandir (shrine) from a store, or whether you want to build a simple one with what you have.,
If you have decided that you will buy one, then purchase it from a store and place it in a corner, or a quiet place in the house.,
Find a small table, not too high.,
Put a murti (idol) or picture of Lord Ganesha in it.,
Put other images or idols of the deities you love in it as well.,
You may place a lamp-holder, a bowl and an incense stick-holder on the shrine, near the images.,
Worship at the shrine.",How to Create a Home Shrine (Hinduism),";
, However if you have decided to make a simple one, this is what you must do:

, This can be used as a shrine. You may build levels in it.

, This is essential, because He is considered the Lord of Good Beginnings and is worshiped before any other deity.

, If you have made levels, then at the topmost level, place a patron deity, or the deity you believe is supreme above all others. If you have not made levels, you may simply place this deity in the center.

, The bowl will help to store water as as an offering to the deities.

, This is important. You should perform a special worship in the beginning to make the shrine consecrated and holy.

Read up on reincarnation.,
Search for examples that some people believe show proof of incarnation.,
Sometimes reading something is proof enough but for true skeptics you must find more solid proof.,
Ask other people what they think about the idea of reincarnation?,
Think.,
Be persistent.",How to Have a Belief in Reincarnation," To believe in something, you must at least understand what it is. Go to the bookstore, library, or search topics on the internet. Look for Hindu, Buddhist, New Age and Wiccan approaches to reincarnation.;
, There are well-known cases where children have gone to strange towns and known residents there and even insisted that a certain home was theirs. Do these stories ring true for you or do you think adults prompted them?

, Look for reincarnation proof in everything and everyone around you. What mechanism creates a child prodigy like Mozart? Could child prodigies simply have learnt their skills in previous lives and now remember them? Do you have friends with incredible skills that came really easily to them?

, If they believe in it, do they have any examples they believe prove it?

, Think undisturbed thoughts about life, death, in-between, and reincarnation. Consider whether it makes more sense to you that your mind simply stops existing after death. And if it doesn't, what do you think could happen to it, besides reincarnation?

, Accepting new ideas takes time, as does finding proof that something is incorrect. Take time to ensure your research totally convinces you.

Begin with faith.,
Pray!,
Search!,
Make a choice!,
Repeat step two!,
Listen!,
If you have your answers, skip to step 9, if not, continue to step 8.

,
Re-evaluate, Re-consider, Re-choose.,
Live what you learn!",How to Find a New Church," OK, so you've heard this before. But you've already taken this step - you're here - you've asked the question.;
, This is much harder for some people - it shouldn't be, but it is! A church should be built up unto God. Take God out of the equation, and you might just as well join your local service organization. It will give you the social involvement you want, and you can still take the kids to the movies for your Sunday outings. What I'm getting at, is using the faith you have from step one, to get down upon your knees and begin your search by petitioning the Great Creator to direct your search. Don't expect a pillar of light just yet - especially if it's been awhile since you've ""called home"".

, For a blessed few, angels have come to the door bearing all things - for most of us, this step means study. Your search may include books, questions posed to close friends, the ""net"", or perhaps visits to prospective churches. If you have followed step two correctly, you may begin to feel little ""nudges"" from within, taking your search in a specific direction. The more times you repeat step two, the more likely these nudges will come during step three, and the more strongly you will feel them.

, Yes, that's right, life is all about choice. Review what you have learned, and choose what you are beginning to feel most comfortable with. Lay aside tradition, forget all prejudice and let your heart speak first. Then choose a direction.

, For the prophets, long heavenly dissertations usually come after much struggle, and often require the ultimate sacrifice to confirm. God does not need to repeat what has already been said. Yes or no answers come much more easily from above. Ask The One who already knows the answer if your choice, is the right choice.

, Prayer is communication. That means when you speak, God listens, and when God speaks - you listen! Since God speaks with the Spirit, you will get your answer by the Spirit. You may feel a fullness of light, a sense of the dark, or nothing at all. The ""light"" will seem familiar to you, and doubt will flee. Repeating the first six steps will keep you on the right course until you have every answer your heart desires.

,, You know what's right and wrong - it's called your conscience. If you know there is something in your life that makes you feel awful inside, get rid of it. The things that make us feel terrible about ourselves, get in the way of feeling the answers we might otherwise receive from above. Light and dark can never exist in the same place at the same time. Once you feel right about yourself, try your question again, if you still get nothing, change the question - that is, make another choice. Continue this process until you receive an answer confirmed by the Spirit as in step six.

, Time and trial will dim the light you have received unless you daily add to it. Do not be afraid to ask for more answers using the above steps, and do not fear to share what you have learned with others. More will come after you asking the same questions. How will they know where to look, unless someone is there to tell them?

Keep these aspects in mind while you fast. Don't confuse this with any other reasons for fasting such as weight loss, etc. Center it around Jesus.;
, Pray, confessing every one of your sins, and inviting the Holy Spirit to lead your life. Let Jesus know you wish to know Him personally. Acknowledge that He lived without sin, died in our place, on the cross for our sins and rose 3 days later, freeing us from condemnation, and giving us His free gift of eternal life. Humble yourself to ask forgiveness from everyone you have hurt; ask forgiveness from God. Forgive those who have hurt you. You do not want to enter into a fast holding grudges, carrying envy, pride, anger or hurt. The enemy will try to use those things to distract you from your fast.

, These may include the ability to forgive, His strength or wisdom, His peace, the capacity to love unconditionally, etc. Praise Him for these attributes! Surrender your life and thank Him for all He has done for you!

, You may wish to try a shorter fast, and start slowly at first, if you have not previously fasted. You can also pray and ask the Holy Spirit to reveal to you how long you should fast.

, You may feel that the Holy Spirit calls you to a specific type of fast. A partial fast may mean giving up only certain types of foods. Juice fasts remove the pleasure of chewing any type of solid food, yet fruit and vegetable juices are permitted.

,, Worship Him and praise Him for His attributes. Read God’s Word, and meditate that God will lend me His Wisdom, so that I can input His Word into my life, and I can gain a fuller understanding of it. Pray for God’s Will to be done, and for the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Ask God to lead you in spreading His Glory into the world we live in.

, Walk outside, hand in hand with nature, while noticing God’s wondrous creation. Thank Him for everything He has created as you walk. Ask Him to give you a spirit of thanksgiving and appreciation.

, Pray for church leaders to preach His Word as God intended, so that your friends and family members will grow closer to Him or accept Him into their lives; pray for government leaders to come to Him, and ask Him for His Will.

,,,, Afterwards, progressively initiate additional foods into your eating.

If you are unfamiliar with God and don't know Him very well (ie: vaguely by name) then perhaps you should start by just locking yourself in your room.,
Take a deep breath and try to clear your mind of all things that trouble you.,
Then, as you would speak to a friend or someone you really trust, unloosen your tongue and tell God all that bothers you.,
Another great way to feel closer to God is to get to know Him.,
We can feel closer to God if we try to do the things He likes.,
Don't make promises to God that you can't keep.,
Be aware that He can and will talk to you through your day to day life.,

",How to Feel Closer to God," This will help you to feel that you are now alone with the Sustainer.;
, Then, say aloud, ""Hi, God. I saved this time for You. Will You please come and talk to me?"" This may feel absurd at first but know that God truly listens and cares. Remember, ""Ask and you shall receive."" There is nothing wrong with asking for God to talk to you.

, Or, tell Him something great that's just recently happened to you (ie: your team just won a game, someone you like asked you out, or you made a new friend). God listens and understands--always--so you won't have to feel silly.

, What does He like? What does He dislike? What makes Him happy, sad or angry? What does He value? What does He think is foolishness? All these answers are in the book He gave to us through men He loved so we could know Him better. We call that book the Bible. He knows it very well. It has His promises in it that He makes for all of us. It has the story of Jesus (The Gospel of St John)and how He came to the earth and died on a cross, even though He didn't do anything wrong, so that we would be forgiven for our sins. It tells us what a ""sin"" is. As we learn about our Creator and our relationship with Him, we will get closer to Him.

, If you came home from work and ignored your wife and brought home a girlfriend or two, you wouldn't have a very good relationship with her. You wouldn't feel very close to her even when you were alone with her. Relationship takes time and effort, and maybe a few flowers! God likes flowers too. He created them and He likes to hear about your enjoyment of them. In fact, God loves a thankful heart. If you don't know what else to say to God, tell Him how much you appreciate all the things He's made, all He's done for you, all He's given to you.

, And if you fail on a promise, go back and make amends with Him. Maybe He will want you to make amends to others. Maybe not. Recognize, when you pray, what your feelings are so that you can understand Him better. Open your heart and be honest-He already knows what's in your heart. YOU need to see what's in there-and be honest about it. If you lie, you are only lying to yourself because He already knows the truth.

, He may talk into your heart during prayer (""Wow-I wouldn't have ever thought of that!"") or throughout the day through other people who never knew what you said in prayer, or circumstances that are so very unusual. Also, He is usually more interested in answering the ""Why?"" instead of the ""What?"" or the ""When?"" Sometimes He answers ""Yes"", sometimes ""No"", sometimes ""Not now"".

Do as Jesus Christ, the Messiah, said so you may be changed, Be Born Again, and so that an opportunity can be moved in the better way -- in the way that whatsoever you may ask may be done, as you handle the little faith part.,
Pray and Receive the Desires of Your Heart.,
Be Proud of Being a Christian, but not of your faith?,
Pray Effectively (Christianity).,
Love Others to strengthen your faith for the right thing in the right person (the Son of Man), the right place, and within God's will.

Act As a Christian Super Hero by asking in Jesus name as Jesus said -- asking in Jesus name -- in the name of your mediator makes sense.,
Go to a Higher Place Through Jesus by expecting obstacles to continue to move out of the way through applying your ""little"" faith in God through Jesus.

Ask rightly: this is not for getting your list of wishes or pleasures.,

Little faith is not as useless, or as common as one might think.

, Find faith through the Son of Man, Son of God, Jesus Christ.

, No! That is not it.


""God resists the proud."";
, Spend time in prayer. Try to do God's will in any ways that you can in your life -- and especially to desire God's will in all your being and doing by as much as possible.

,, If you do believe and have faith in something -- then, you will focus in those areas.

, Realize that merely acting up or acting out in the area of an obstacle would not be of itself (of that action) necessarily spiritual or anything Godly.


God clearly allows but does not do evil as ""God is Love""...

, Keep your faith in God. If you waiver in your belief in yourself that will be okay.


When you see someone who is sick pray for them and see God do the impossible by healing them.







, Wavering in your own little faith is not the problem. Because wavering ""about yourself"" is not doubting God.

, Do not doubt God. Do not waver in faith that God is good, but that is not about your little faith.

, Love God. If you waiver in respecting God, then that is not Godly faith, and you should not expect anything.

, Act rightly, but acting in the strength of the flesh (people) is not the key.

, Taste and see that the gift of God is good. Test your ideas to see if they are really good -- and that would be only in God's will. Your health, blessing, wealth and well being is in faith, but how do you manage it? ""The love of money is the root all evil.""

, ""Love your enemy."" Jesus said that. Your destroying your enemy is not necessarily in or of faith. That which is not of faith is harmful and hurtful to other people, for instance: Act Like a Christian in Any Circumstance.



Escape the Condemnation of Hell According to the Word of God in the Bible. Place the focus on believing in the one who can do it -- not on the problem.

, You individually do not need machines or dynamite for moving mountains of flesh (friend or foe).

,, He is at the right hand of the Father always. Jesus said: ""What you ask in my (Jesus Christ's) name and believe, nothing doubting, that it will happen, and you shall have it.""

,, ""Ye ask, and receive not, when ye ask wrongly, that ye may consume it for your lusts."","

There is no point to worrying, unless you are actually coming up with a game plan to tackle something.  If you are worrying for no reason, stop. 
Don't try to control things that you really aren't able to control anyway.;
,


People will always have their opinions.  Don't worry about it. 
What God knows about you is what matters. You can never please everyone, so try hard to please Jesus Christ, by helping God's children.

,


This includes things you did as an adult and way back to things you have done since you were a small child.  You can't change the past; so, let it go, and move on. 
You won't really have wholeness in general until you make wholeness within yourself through Christ. 
You need to generally like yourself and get along with yourself, because you will always be there.  You can't get away from yourself.  Wherever you go, there you are. So become your own friend, then you can love others as you love yourself and can be whole within yourself. 
God, the perfect and holy one, gives you grace; so give yourself grace. 
You never have been and never will be perfect.  So get over trying to be.

,


Hillsong is a great worship band, and they have a lot of healing worship songs.

, Acknowledge Him in all you do.


Confess what you need to and then forget about it. 
God says ""I will remove your sins as far as the east is from the west"" when you confess them and admit you were wrong.  He puts them out of his mind, and you should too. 
There is no sense beating yourself up over something that you can't change.  Like the famous prayer about acceptance says, ""God help me accept the things I cannot change.""

, 


The only thing you can change about the past is the damage you may have done to relationships.  You may need to make amends with some people, and say, ""I'm sorry!"" 
Sometimes it feels like unfinished business, if something is left in a state of tension.  Break the ice, admit you were wrong in a relationship, and then you and the other person can let go of any bitterness and move on. 
Sometimes God won't let us rest with ourselves and be whole or complete in Christ unless we take care of certain things. 
The Bible says reconcile with your fellow man: ""Therefore, if you are presenting your offering at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your offering there before the altar, and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your offering.""  (Matthew 5).
Another good related verse is: ""Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions. But, if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions."" (Mark 11).

, 


When Jesus was asked how many times we have to forgive others He said 70 times 7, as in, countless times.  Joyce Meyer, a renowned Christian teacher says, ""Do yourself a favor, and forgive,"" because you will never truly be spiritually whole until you forgive everyone and anyone who has done you wrong. 

, Strive to love everyone you meet. Although it may be hard to love people you disagree with, or dislike, do your best.

, There are all sorts of ways to make peace, and Reading the Bible can help you. Looking in the New Testament is a good place to start.

, Praying to God can help you find peace in your own mind, and he can speak to you and help you. Pray to God, ask him to help make you stronger, and to do peaceful things, and to help other people. God is love. Know who God is, look up to him, and He will help you find peace.


One thing you can do is try to replace any negative thoughts you have about a person with ""I hope they are happy"" or ""May they find peace.""
Remember that it is God's place to judge, not man's.

,, Doing charity work for others is a great way to find peace with yourself, and it doesn't have to be hard or take much of your time.

Tell people that Christianity is all about Love: Love for God, and love for neighbour.,
Tell people that the goal of Christianity is eternal fellowship and salvation.,
Tell people that Christianity emphasizes prayer.,
If someone tries to trap you saying they could prove Jesus was the biological son of St Joseph, explain to him the very First Verse of Matthew 1 in the Bible explains the descendant of Jesus Christ, and it says that ""Jesus is the Son of Mary, of the House of David, who was engaged to a carpenter called Joseph""... have you read that?,
Consider the more than 300 verses explaining that Jesus is from the Holy Spirit, like this one; search in the Bible and you shall find the Bible proofs: 30 But the angel said to her, ""Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God.,
Explain that Jesus indeed said He is the Son of God, ( the Savior is in the Old Testament, and the the Torah explains also about the Savior, also called Messiah.,
Remember that The Hebrew Bible  (or Old Testament)  says clearly ""God has a Son"":

""I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto Me, 'Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.',
Expect God's Son to be the King: ""And when thy days be fulfilled ...",How to Explain Christianity," Our love for God comes first, and we do always and everywhere try to serve Him. And, because He is the Heavenly Father of us all, we love all our neighbours and do our best to serve them in whichever way we can, because what we do for (or to) His children, we do for or to Him.


Christians believe the Lord Jesus Christ Is the Eternal Son Of God, and Son of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

, Because our first parents had sinned; so we too sin, and thus, our souls are in danger of going to Hell. Through the Passion, Death, and Resurrection Of Our Lord Jesus Christ -- it is possible for us to go to Heaven, and be with Our Heavenly family members and Father for all eternity.


Christians become born again in Christ, through the Sacrament of Baptism, and receiving the Gospel and keeping Christ's words. Follow Jesus Christ including baptism. Baptism is symbolic of Christians dying to sin; being in the Tomb with Christ; and rising again to new life. Christians are born again.

, Prayer is communing with the Lord and God. Christians may pray directly to God as the Father, to Jesus Christ our Mediator, and/or to the Holy Spirit.


Christians pray to the Holy Spirit, to help them to continue repenting of their sins and to become Holy.
Christians worship on the first day of the week (Sunday), because it is the day in which Christ rose from the dead.
Christians may also ask the Virgin Mary and the Saints to intercede with God for them, in prayer too.

, ""Jesus David"" in a sense. He could take the family name of His Mother who was impregnated by the Holy Spirit, called the Immaculate Conception, so that He is not the biological son of St. Joseph!...

, 31 You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, 33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end."" 34 ""How will this be,"" Mary asked the angel, ""since I am a virgin?"" 35 The angel answered, ""The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God. 36 Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month. 37 For nothing is impossible with God."" 38 ""I am the Lord's servant,"" Mary answered. ""May it be to me as you have said."" Then the angel left her. (Luke 1:30-38),

Pray for forgiveness.",How to Feel Better by Avoiding the 7 Deadly Sins," Reconsider the old saying, ""what goes up, must come down"": When we feel down, we may pull others down to try to feel ""right"" (above them). But if we recall that we are truly equal as humans, not demanding attention -- then there's no need to shame, or to puff up with air (vanity). We can deflate our hot-air balloon, realizing the uselessness of self-centered relationships, and begin living a fuller, more productive life, feeling much better toward other persons and ourselves.
INTERACT: We won't insist on holding the floor as if that's more important than hearing others (thoughtfully), instead of saying, ""Let me finish..."" or ""I wasn't through..."" Feel better: Flip that to ""Hey, I'm interested in your opinion"": Pausing... casually listening to once hated interruptions (called people), smiling -- then speaking again when it's your turn, without fuming. You will see the conversation will be productive and satisfying.
ENJOY what you have, not flaunting it, humbly. Realize that you are not superior because of ownership of finer things.
RECEIVE compliments, saying, ""Thank you"" as if you mean it, but not as if it's unnecessary; accept it gracefully.
GIVE a compliment on others achievements like their solid work on the job, success preparing a meal, or their good taste in art.
INCLUDE SINCERE reasons: Why you like their efforts and the results, as why you gave that compliment. That makes it sincere.
""GOOD PRIDE"" is clean, pure, seeking education and betterment for sharing it -- not neglectful, but providential (following Christ), not self-seeking, to shirk duty nor ""con"" people, not corrupt...
According to the Bible outward circumstances will not separate you from perfect love; so that while in the path of everyday life, family and other duty, be satisfied and happy in many kinds of situations, by the exercise of your faith, hope, effort to improve,
FOR GOOD with prayer and ESPECIALLY actually supplying needs of God's lesser/little ones.


""PURE CHRISTIANITY IS by your:~ a ~ ""Caring for orphans and widows in their times of trouble..."" and
~ b ~ ""Refusing to let the world corrupt you."" (James 1:27), in their need (to assist them as well as you might) and not taking their home, means or goods... but joyously enlarging their hopes and nurturing them!;
, Thrown at us everyday, by turning on the TV, lust and passions are a sure way of enticing oneself with the slick, sensual commercials, and seeing all those unnecessary sexual scenes in TV movies. When we focus on that one flashy aspect of a relationship, sex, we fail to see the other fine qualities of togetherness, and we may adopt a one-track-mind. Yet, little time is actually spent on sexual activity in any ongoing relationship; so, compared to all other quality time spent together it is so quick and little.


Try focusing your attention away -- when confronted with such temptations -- onto doing and enjoying, appreciating all aspects of a relationship, then your mind will become stronger, and you will begin to feel an inner peace. So how to feel better by not being lustful, one has to look at the bigger picture. So don't be the wham thank you mam or man kind of person. Go to the movies before or afterwards, and enjoy some relating time together, and some popcorn; that treat will last longer than the sex will anyway?
You have to look at all aspects of the relationship. No one wants to be used for just physical attributes alone, and those can't last forever, but the human spirit does! When you realize this beyond the physical, you will become more well-rounded, and that will make you feel better.

, Excess in the area of diet, including over-indulgence of desires and over-consumption of anything to the point of waste; you don't need it, so eating too much is acting like a ""disposal"" unit. This is sinful because of the lustful desire for excess, and withholding extra food from the needy (selfishness - placing one's own interests above the well-being or interests of others). So, then be thankful; share; help to feed the poor, needy widows, orphans... (Avoid huge problems: worries of overweight, general health, compulsions, excessive thinness or obesity, possible diabetes, high blood pressure, higher chance of cancer -- back, hip and knee troubles, shortness of breath, lower energy and performance,...). Ways to commit gluttony, include eating ""too"":


Obsessively, includes eating disorders.
Soon (often, selfishly).
Expensively (luxuriously, with exotic tastes).
Much
Over-eagerly
Daintily (elaborately prepared, highly critical.)
Wildly

, Beware of plain old laziness! If we just sit around home and not engage ourselves with others, we become deadened to the world and people; it sees less of us, and we see less of it. When we just sit around the house eating a bag of chips, watching too much television, we become lethargic and depressed and it's hard to get going. Go to the park and take a walk, consider an exercise club, start a new project or whatever you have to do to keep busy away from your TV, and you will begin to feel more vigorous. So get up off your lazy... and do something.

, We can appreciate another's possessions, without selling ourselves short for what we have. And, admire one for certain qualities and personality that we would like to embody is one thing -- but placing too much emphasis on what they have, but not reaching for improvement or learning talents makes us feel bad. Develop what you can do and be thankful for what you already have. LIST your abilities, realistic goals and possessions, and you will see that it's a lot longer than you may expect. Don't spend useless time over focusing on or overly possessed by what another has over you. Realize what someone has doesn't take away from what you have; so count your blessings and not theirs.

, Such destructive emotions hurt us in the sense that it uses up our vital energy. We become frustrated by not getting our way, and for some unknown reason, we just blow up. We don't want to let go of getting our choice; we keep confronting it. When we don't get what we want, we become frustrated, and let go, by speaking loudly, yelling or breaking something, or worst of all, hurting our credibility, shredding someone else's feelings by taking our aggression out on them.


Anger in itself is not such a bad sin in its nature, but the way we deal with it can be defeating our good purposes. We do not want it to hurt us or others. It was said by a doctor that we are always prone to anger, but we must find the best way possible to vent that explosive pressure.
One could get a punching bag and go to town on it, take a brisk walk, take a break from a frustrating matter and focus on something less stressful until we calm down.
In front of a group of people, when we become angered, in such a harsh way -- instead of sticking around and freaking, jumping up and down, ranting or raving, and blurting out obscenities -- just find an excuse to break away fast. Then come back in a few minutes to the scene with a more dignified response to the situation, and you can act and feel much better.

, Share time, work and activities -- give your best effort to assist others to do well, and it will make us feel better, avoiding greed. It's nice to have things in life, but placing too much emphasis on material things, or on making impressive friends, wanting too much of anything of value to us is greed. So sharing our live and energy, experiences and dignity with others and you will feel better inside.

, This is the most important thing to do. Don't just go off and make yourself happy.
Pray for forgiveness of your sins.

High-traffic areas good for evangelism might include downtown business districts, street fairs or farmers' markets, and college campuses.


Avoid evangelizing around churches of other faiths and other places that might be contentious or difficult. The subway platform at 8 am won't find most people in a chatting mood. Use your judgment. It might be a great idea to evangelize outside a punk rock club on a Friday night, if you can pull it off, or it might just lead to arguments.
Make sure to follow any solicitation laws in the area and abide instructions from business and property owners who might want you to move on. Be courteous and leave.;
, You might outline and mark particular verses or stories from the Bible you hope to highlight in your evangelism. Also, prepare anecdotes from your own life as a believer that might serve to interest someone in becoming a member of your church. Whatever you think will connect with people in a personal way is appropriate. You might share:


Favorite verses and stories.
Important verses.
The story of your faith.
Your history in the church.

, It's helpful to transition from simple conversation into a discussion of faith by leading with probing questions, and it helps to have a good list of them to draw from so you're not struggling to come up with them on the fly. Good questions might include:


Do you believe in an afterlife?
What do you think happens when you die?
If you died right now, do you think you'd go to heaven? Why?
Do you feel fulfilled in your life?
Do you ever feel like something is missing?
Do you ever pray?

, You might consider praying and preparing yourself for a day of talking about your faith. Some people find it very hard to share their faith and experiences in the Church, and it takes courage to talk about what you believe in to people who might not always be interested in listening.Get a group together to evangelize as a unit. Don't approach people in a gang, but take frequent breaks and talk about how it's going individually. Having a support group will make the job a lot easier, letting tips and advice flow freely through the group.

, Start with some small talk and ask about what has been going on in his or her life lately. Don't expect that anyone would immediately trust you. It will take a while before someone opens up to you.


Ask them if they have any pain or sickness and offer to pray for them ) A healing from God will help show them that God is real and cares for them.
The Billy Graham Association said that 90% of converts remain in a church when they find a friend there. So if you are in college or school, you can do this experiment: sit with someone in the cafeteria for 3 days and make a friend first, then talk faith on the third day. The results may be startling for you, the student may pour his/her heart out to you, even for hours, with questions.

, Ask a question that will lower the person's guard and get them thinking about larger existential issues, making them receptive to an exchange of ideas. A question like, ""What do you think happens when you die?"" or ""Do you believe in an afterlife?"" can be effective at transitioning the conversation into your territory.


A most effective evangelistic tool that you can use is a survey. You can ask four questions about an individual's life, and after you know the needs and beliefs, witness to each based on the point of view.

, Evangelism isn't just waiting for an opportunity to speak, it needs to be a real conversation and exchange of ideas. When you ask a question like, ""Are you happy in your life?"" or ""Do you ever feel as if you're missing out on something?"" really listen to the answer someone gives. Aside from giving them the feeling that they have a willing listener, you need to pay attention to what they're saying to learn to respond accurately and convincingly.


Avoid pressing the persons that are totally closed to you, but persist with the ones that are open. Listening closely will help you to gauge this interest and open them up even more.

, Tell them about your version of Christianity, what it means to you, and how your faith has changed your life for the better.


It's important to treat this conversation as a conversation between two people, putting a face on the Church. In general, you'll want to avoid getting into overly complicated discussions of dogma and theology, focusing instead on the importance of faith and salvation.

, The Commandments are typically somewhat familiar to the lay person, and a conversation about ""laws"" can be an effective transition into more theoretical concepts and ideas. Even non-believers can agree that lying, killing, and stealing are to be avoided, and hearing it laid out in those terms can make closed listeners more receptive.

, Some evangelists like to use a basic introduction method of becoming a Christian as a way of giving a possible convert a concrete list of steps to keep in mind when thinking about developing their faith. The ABC method breaks down like this:


A: Admit that you are a sinner
B: Believe that Jesus Christ is the son of the Lord and died for your sins
C: Confess your belief to Christ

, Have some Bibles on hand to gift to the most receptive of the people you communicate with.


If your church has provided you with tracts or specific documents they hope to disseminate, give them to as many people as possible, interested or not., A person isn't going to become spiritually mature and be ""Saved"" after talking to you for five minutes. What's the next step? What should this person do tomorrow and the next day to build and maintain their new interest in your faith? Where might you direct them?


Consider exchanging information, or giving them literature about your Church if you don't feel comfortable giving them your personal contact information.

, If the person has never prayed before, they might be curious and nervous about the process, which you can help facilitate by walking them through their first prayer session. Say a simple and brief prayer, introducing them to it as a practice. Tell them how to pray and when to pray.

, If you're in a town that's not your own, take some time becoming familiar with churches in the area that you can recommend. Knowing the time of the next service could be a nice way to give your possible converts a good next step.

, Make sure all of the items are presentable: clean, neat (ironed or pressed if appropriate), fit well, and in good condition. Wear these items with respect for their meaning in your religion or faith.

, Some places of worship require footwear to be removed, or men not to have headwear in place, so no socks with holes, dirty toes or bed heads (and even women should not wear baseball caps--as shown in image 2).

, A party dress or Hawaiian shirt is probably not appropriate, but the smart blouse or long sleeved shirt you last wore for a job interview could make an appearance at church.

, Church is a great place for women to wear dresses or skirts, but short skirts, low-cut tops, vest tops, etc., are some typically inappropriate garments. Also, be sparing with makeup and jewelry (natural and subdued, rather than gaudy and flashy).

, Churches and places of worship are not catwalks. The latest fashions are not required to praise your god.

, In summer, wear colours that make you think of summer flowers, do the same for the other seasons if you desire. This can be nice if your place of worship has floral arrangements as decorations. Your outfit will go with the flowers.

, Attending a worship service is about getting together with friends and family. Wear items of clothing that were gifts if they fit the occasion. Accessories are great for this. Your friend that bought you that smart tie or your aunt that gave you those smashing earrings will love to see you in them at church.

, You may all like to look good together when you worship or you may not care if you all clash color-wise and make an awesome orange, green and purple impact! The choice is yours. Beware though, a husband and wife attending church both dressed in white tops, beige pants and dark shoes may get one or two odd glances - only go ""Bobbsey Twins"" intentionally!

In Ephesians 6:12, the Apostle Paul explains, ""For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.""This verse defines spiritual warfare as warfare against powers that are not “of the flesh,” meaning powers that are not physical or tangible in nature.
Since the spiritual and physical realms are connected, things that happen in the physical realm can have spiritual consequences and vice versa. Obedience to God in your earthly life, for instance, strengthens your spirit. Violating God's law in your earthly life will also weaken your spirit. As James 4:7 says, ""Submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."" You have to first submit to God in order to resist the devil.;
, Only by God's power can you hope to win against the enemy. Relying on God's power requires you to accept the salvation offered to you by Christ. You must also understand that each victory belongs to God.


When you rebuke the devil, you must do so in Jesus' name while relying on God's authority over evil. Even the archangel Michael says ""The Lord rebuke you"" when fighting with the devil over the body of Moses (Jude 9). If even angels must rely on the name of God to rebuke evil, it is little wonder that the Christian must rely on the name and power of Christ to do so.It is also important to understand that the name of Christ alone does not do the work. It is your relationship with Christ as a Christian that you must lean on.
Acts 19:13-16 describes the story of the seven sons of Sceva, who used the name of Jesus to drive out evil spirits without having a solid relationship with Christ. One day, an evil spirit fought back and overpowered them because they placed their faith in the wrong aspect of the process. They simply used the name of Jesus, but they did not really know Jesus.

, You have the power to do battle within the greater spiritual war, but this power is granted to you through Christ. If you begin taking pride in that power as though it were your own, you need to cast that pride aside before continuing. Satan might be able to use the sin of pride against you in spiritual warfare. To truly submit to God, you need to be humble. It is impossible to truly submit yourself to the might and will of another if some part of you believes that your own power can possibly be equal. If two powers are comparable or similar, then you hold neither one as absolute over the other.
You must fully rely on the power of God to do spiritual warfare. Let go of any pride you have concerning your own power. As the Bible says, ""Lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.""

, Doing spiritual warfare requires you to remain obedient to God in all things. Oftentimes, you must exercise great self-control in order to achieve such a level of obedience.


The Apostle Paul instructs believers to ""be strong in the Lord"" (Ephesians 6:10). It is important to note that the term is ""in,"" not ""by."" It is not enough to rely on God's power to win your spiritual battles for you. Instead, you must be in fellowship with Christ, fighting alongside God in the battles you face.To do this, obedience and self-control are necessary.
You must be obedient to God by following God's commands and by resisting or ridding yourself of any force that would influence you to do otherwise.
Self-control requires you to rid yourself of any excess. You need to balance yourself spiritually by resisting the urge to indulge in things that are wicked or in excessive amounts that can cause spiritual decay.

, 1 Peter 5:8 says, ""Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour."" Know that an attack may come when you least expect it. You must remain aware of the spiritual battleground, and you must also continually guard yourself against potential attacks.Treat the battle seriously. The enemy is always ready to attack, so you must always be ready to defend yourself.
When you wake up each morning, take the time to prepare yourself spiritually through prayer and meditation. Ask God for His help each day. A good prayer to pray is ""God I can't do this, but you can.""

, The ""armor of God"" refers to a set of metaphorical spiritual armor that Christians should wear at all times to protect themselves against Satan.


The whole armor of God is described in Ephesians, 6:10-18.
The passage instructs you to ""Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil"" (Ephesians 6:11). In essence, arming yourself with the protection and weapons offered to you by your faith in Christ, will allow you to stand strong and hold out against evil attacks of a spiritual nature.

, Ephesians 6:14 states, ""Stand, therefore, having girded your waist with truth.""


The opposite of the truth is a lie, and Satan is often referred to as the ""father of lies."" Arming yourself with the ""belt of truth"" means protecting yourself from the evils of deception by clinging to the truth. In the Bible, Jesus refuted Satan's temptations in the wilderness with truths from Scripture. You can also do this; quote Scripture to refute the lies of Satan.To cling to the truth, you must seek the truth in all things and speak the truth to all people, including yourself. Don't let yourself be deceived about anything.

, The second part of Ephesians 6:14 refers to the ""breastplate of righteousness.""


""Righteousness"" refers to the absolute righteousness of Christ, not the halfhearted and fallible righteousness of mankind.
Through your faith, you must rely on the righteousness of Christ to protect your heart against spiritual attacks just as a physical breastplate would protect your heart in a physical battle. If Satan tries to tell you that you aren't righteous, quote Romans 3:22, ""This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.""

, Ephesians 6:15 instructs believers to ""shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.""


The ""gospel of peace"" refers to the gospel or good news of salvation.
Preparing your feet with the gospel of peace suggests that you will need to take this gospel as you travel into enemy territory. By stepping forward with this gospel, your soul is protected with each step. As Scripture says, ""Seek first the kingdom of God, and all these things will be added unto you."" This includes spiritual protection from Satan.

, You are also instructed in Ephesians 6:16 that, above all, you should take ""the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.""


Faith is an absolute essential to have when engaging in spiritual warfare. Like a shield, faith can protect you against otherwise piercing attacks launched by the enemy. When Satan tries to tell you lies about God, remember to keep your faith that God is good, and that He has good plans for you etc.

, As Ephesians 6:17 states, ""take the helmet of salvation.""


The salvation spoken of in this passage refers to the spiritual salvation Christ offers through His death and resurrection.
A helmet of salvation can be interpreted as the knowledge of spiritual salvation. Just as a physical helmet protects the brain, the helmet of salvation protects the mind from spiritual attacks and false claims that would turn your mind away from God.

, The second half of Ephesians 6:18 instructs you to take ""the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.""


The sword of the Spirit is directly described in the passage as the Word of God, or the Bible.
To yield the sword of the Spirit, you need to have an understanding of the Bible. Your knowledge of scriptures can then be used as a rebuttal to spiritual attacks. Hebrews 4:12 says, ""For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.""

, The verses regarding the whole armor of God finish with Ephesians 6:18, which states that you should be ""praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints.""


In choosing these words to wrap up the passage on the armor of God, the Apostle Paul highlights the importance of relying on God for spiritual strength through the practice of steady and ongoing prayer. The Bible tells us to ""pray without ceasing."" Continually pray over every situation in your life for God's protection and help.
The armor of God is a set of tools and protection that God grants believers, but it is the power of God that the believer must ultimately rely on.

, Offensive warfare requires you to actively tear down enemy strongholds previously built in your mind. Defensive warfare requires you to guard yourself against future attacks.An enemy stronghold is a lie that has already been built inside your mind. It gains strength by deception and accusation, and it may make it harder for you to resist the power of temptation or to see through Satan's lies.
These strongholds have a tendency to become stronger or louder when you are alone, so you need to actively work at tearing them down using the spiritual weapons God has granted you. As these strongholds lessen, it will also become easier to guard yourself against future attacks.

, The enemy uses deception to trick you into believing something untrue so that you will fall into error and sin.


A notable example of this would be when Satan deceived Eve into believing that no harm would come to her if she ate the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden.
In reference to the armor of God, you actively rely upon the belt of truth and the sword of the Spirit when you battle against deception. The belt of truth is your defense against deception, while the sword of the Spirit allows you to fight against deception.
In simpler terms, fighting against deception requires you to understand truth. To understand truth, you need a thorough understanding of Scripture.

, When the enemy uses temptation, he tries to make something wicked look good and appealing in an effort to entice you towards it.


Temptation usually follows deception. For instance, Eve was tempted to eat the forbidden fruit after being deceived into thinking that doing so would be acceptable. Something wicked can only look desirable to you once you have been tricked into thinking that it is in some way good.
Dealing with temptation requires you to resist the devil while drawing closer to God. Both elements are necessary, and both naturally go hand-in-hand as you put them into practice.
Draw near to God through prayer, Bible study, obedience, and worship. As you draw closer to God, you will turn away from evil and temptation will have less power over you.

, The enemy will accuse the believer using past faults and sins in an effort to weigh that individual down with shame and hopelessness. The Bible refers to Satan as ""the accuser of the brethren"" so he will even try accusing you to yourself. Remind yourself always of the verse, ""There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.""


With regards to the armor of God, one of your best defenses against accusation is the shield of faith. When the enemy fires an attack against you using your past failures as ammunition, you must guard your entire self against the attack by relying on your faith in Christ.
You can also use the breastplate of Christ's righteousness to guard your heart and the helmet of salvation to guard your mind against such attacks.

Live for God, when it's all done: remember, if you are a Christian, you are living in the world, but you are not ""of"" the world.",How to Develop Self Esteem Through God," Start with the New Testament, the book of John.

Also study the Old Testament. These are records of God's dealings with the men and women on earth and the prophecies he sent through prophets.



 

;
, Look also for evidence that God is; creator, righteous, holy, loving, good, and not capable of any evil.

Look for writings that show God's love for his children, a love that mirrors and transcends the love a parent has for a child. This will provide you with the theoretical knowledge to support your self-esteem. Knowing that your true self is connected to the fact that God created you and loves you even though you are a sinner, provides true confidence. You can know that you are truly loved unconditionally, which is a good way to gain esteem and confidence.







, These are the things that God has asked his children to do in order to serve him. God also knows that when one lives life the way He's prescribed for us, by obeying his commands, that person will be living life in the most abundant way possible. In his love, he has given you guidance to achieve this.

, You can even use those words: ""...in the name of Jesus Christ"". As you seek to follow Christ, he will change you. If you turn away from sin and accept that Christ died on the cross and rose again to save you from eternal separation from God, then the Holy Spirit will regenerate you and make you into a new person. Both prayer and the Holy Spirit encouraged life-changes will give you the knowledge to increase your self-esteem.

,, You will feel good about yourself because you will know how much Jesus Christ loves you. It is a feeling you won't get anywhere else.

,

The rules of world's peoples, their esteem, their clothing, everything of theirs is just that, theirs; not given over to God's will. You are God's loved child, and as his child, you must rely fully on him for everything, including self-esteem.






Worldly self-esteem is highly overrated. If you need more self-esteem, you need more of God. It is not our self-esteem that matters, but our GOD-esteem. Remember this throughout the day. In the end, it's not your social standing that matters, its your faith.

Present the new converts.",How to Do an Altar Call," Before you can call unbelievers to the altar, you need to make sure they understand what the call is actually about. This means that you'll need to deliver a powerful sermon that doesn't shy away from the truth about sin, repentance, and the urgency of accepting Christ as Savior.


Preach the gospel. Make sure that your message is derived from the Bible's teachings on repenting and believing.Don't shy away from the harsh reality of sin. You won't be able to stress the importance of salvation without explaining the consequence of living and dying without it.
Your message should clearly explain that accepting Jesus is equivalent to being rescued, not a trick you can use to make your life better.
Stress the importance of repentance alongside forgiveness.
Explain ""church lingo"" each time you use it. Terms that you might use regularly, like ""born again,"" ""saved,"" and ""repent,"" can be completely unfamiliar to nonbelievers.;
, Announce the altar call after you finish the sermon. As you make the announcement, explain how the process will work physically and how it should work spiritually.


Spelling out the steps can make potential converts feel more at ease. The fear of the unknown can cause plenty of people to hesitate, but describing each stage of the altar call in advance can remove some of that fear.

, Lead the congregation in prayer at the start of the altar call. Ask God to move the hearts of those who still need to accept Him and to continue working in the hearts and lives of those who already have.


Even though the focus is on those who need to repent and accept Christ, you need to address current believers in your prayer, too. Everyone should be able to benefit from this opportunity for spiritual renewal.

, Play soft music in the background. Dim the lights, but make sure that there is still enough light to maintain visibility.


The idea is to make the environment peaceful since peace encourages reflection.
During the actual invitation to the altar, instrumental music is usually preferred over music with lyrics. Vocal worship songs should usually be reserved until after the invitation portion of the altar call is complete.

, Instruct everyone to close their eyes and bow their heads. Repeat these instructions while looking around, and continue past this point only when the majority of people have done as you have asked.


Providing a certain degree of anonymity can relieve some of the pressure and make it easier for people to act—and to do so genuinely.
Admitting that you are a sinner in need of salvation can be a vulnerable experience, and making such an admission in front of a large crowd can be so intimidating that a person might opt to avoid the experience altogether. This is especially true when you are working with teenagers, but it can also apply to groups of adults.
On the other hand, if many people respond to the altar call, others may get swept up in the moment and respond without being truly ready for it at heart. Remember: the ultimate goal is to save souls, not to have an impressive-looking altar call. You want people to answer the call, but only if they are doing so for the right reason.

, State that anyone who is ready to give his or her life to Christ—or anyone who wants to learn more about doing so—should lift his or her head and make eye contact with you.


Another option would be to ask those who are ready to raise their hands instead of their heads. Both options are fairly common and typically yield similar results

, Look around the entire room. Repeat the call at regular intervals. Acknowledge each person with whom you make eye contact.


Most of the congregation will consist of people who have already accepted Christ and are not being spiritually prompted to respond to the current altar call. As you repeat the invitation to the altar, ask those who remain in their seats to take the time to reconnect with Christ and to pray for those who are accepting salvation for the first time.

, When you sense that everyone who is ready to answer the call has looked up, invite those individuals to the altar while instructing the rest of the congregation to continue in prayer with closed eyes and bowed heads.


Greet those at the altar with a friendly expression and kind words. Reassure them that the step they are taking here and now is a positive, life-saving one.

, Introduce each person standing before you at the altar to a counselor. Once everyone has been taken care of, send the counselors and potential converts to private rooms for further discussion.


While the counseling sessions commence, the rest of the congregation should be invited to join in song. Worship should typically continue until everyone has had a chance to complete the brief counseling session, but if someone needs an extensive amount of time, you may need to conclude the service before that individual finishes.

, Make the process as personal as possible by assigning only one person to each counselor during any given altar call. Provide your counselors with training so that they know how to handle the process appropriately, and make sure that they all take a Bible with them when they embark on a session.


It can be difficult enough to open your heart to one person, so being put into a position in which you need to open your heart in front of a group can be even more difficult, even if the group is relatively small. For that reason, one-on-one counseling can encourage greater sincerity.
Your counselors do not need extensive theological training, but they should be equipped with some basic review. Each counselor should know:

Where to go during the counseling session
What to say and what not to say
How to clearly explain God's plan of salvation
The importance of confidentiality



, It's important to connect to those who responded to the call on an individual level since doing so can encourage them to accept Christ as their personal Savior. To that end, you need to ask questions that allow the individual to open up.


The absolute first thing a counselor should do is ask for a name. After receiving a name, the counselor can also introduce himself or herself.
Beyond that, ask questions about what made the individual respond to the message and what that individual is currently struggling with. From there, lead into the Gospel.

, Once the individual counseling sessions start, the focus should be on Christ. Specific sins and concerns can be brought up, but they should not distract from the primary purpose of the call.


Ask about the individual's relationship with Jesus. Discuss whether he or she has such a relationship, what the quality of that relationship with, and how his or her current struggles with sin impact that relationship.
Even though it should have been mentioned in the sermon, each counselor should also discuss humanity's sinful nature and the need for a Savior.

, Instead of asking each person to repeat a generic “Sinner's Prayer,” encourage new converts to pray for repentance from the heart. Rely on a formulaic prayer only if the new believer doesn't know what to say.


The words may not be eloquent, but there's nothing wrong with that. Jesus is concerned with the heart, so an awkward yet sincere prayer means more than a graceful yet insincere one.
Counselors can (and should) guide the individual through the process of confessing his or her sins, asking for God's forgiveness, and committing his or her life to Christ.

, Consider presenting those who have just accepted Christ to the rest of the congregation at the end of the service.Standing before the congregation can make new believers feel reassured and welcomed into the Church.
Encourage this step without demanding it. Do not force anyone to stand before the congregation if they feel uncomfortable doing so.

Look for a reproductive living cell without a ""mother cell"" (preceding generation(s) of life) in seawater (or ""primordial soup"").,
Realize what creative ability that mathematical chance has.,
Bet your life on a very low percent -- just bet that lifeless matter created everything -- really?,
Examine the very idea of any theory; if there is a query/question for us -- say who/what created the capacity to theorize?,
Remember that life produces life: life comes from life.",How to Defend a Belief in the Existence of God1," Would it be found? There was an ancient expanse of rocks and dust very much like the moon but add air and water, the planet Earth, and so look for life where it has no known cause, no genetic design and no so no plan.

Life is active (such as forming organelles inside a semipermeable membrane in plant or animal life, absorbing food and excreting waste, and creatively using energy, such as for reproducing, etc.). And one would expect an action to have a cause in physics or biology, or life that had a cause. Would you expect to see life without a genetic cause or plan? Is that probability a high expectation?



 

;
, That is: ""no creative ability"", since it is a only some concepts of ratios; so probability has no power by adding more and more time. Probability is a number like: zero or infinitesimally small, versus a high probability, say 99.9% and everything between the extremes.


So, if there were no cells with cytoplasmic, reproductive life in previous billions (thousands of millions) of years, then what random chance is there of life to form by adding similarly thousands of millions of years -- without a cause, design or plan and so to form the reproductive living cell(s).
Even, recently dead cells that have every material thing, including genetics, needed for life except that once it is truly dead then the greatest of sciences can not bring it back to life; yet did ""nature"" take non-viable (non-living) materials and ""at some fortunate moment"" form life of, for and by nothing?
Thinking of creation by ""chance""... If the universe were created by chance (without an intelligent creator), then what power did billions of years and chance have? Is that any increasing powers of creativity by sterile/lifeless time passing?

, Do you feel that lucky? So did ""mother nature"" get so lucky that she created life without a plan, without sterile lab conditions and with no pre-existing organic, reproductive form of life (from any previously existing life)?

, Where is that coming from or going? Why is there a question in the first place: So, life causes the ability to have a potential for science... Just because intelligent life exists, then there could be a question/hypothesis about un-caused life appearing some day. But life causes theories... another billion years of non-living matter seems empty of life -- without a cause.

, That is all we know: scientifically it has not been proven beyond a doubt how cells began. No, DNA and RNA couldn't make it very far with no cell in which to operate, no organelles, no nucleus, no food, no biological energy, no organization? Having no place or way for life to begin is as good as saying it could not reasonably happen...

See the logic, ""If the universe created itself, how did something come from nothing?"",
Poof!,
Rub a glass rod with wool, or put a ""lightning rod"" in or near a puddle (tidal pool), let the ocean vents bask in sunlight: then could static electricity or an electrical flash of lightning like an explosion near a puddle such as a tidal pool, or sunshine piercing darkness cause the initializing of intracellular, mitochondrial energy creation, by ""purposeless"" living cells that would then begin regulated processes, respiring, digesting, and of course reproducing -- to somehow achieve ""genetic programming of uniqueness"" but still be the same in multitudes of meaningful ways -- programming of instincts and immune system, healing of injuries, nerves, nerves cooperating, nerves communicating, autonomic life processes (automated) like respiration, hundreds or millions of interrelated, interdependent reactions and systems,... Well, genes contain unique DNA, as coded plans.,
Explain the membrane of the single cell eukaryotes.",How to Defend a Belief in the Existence of God2," Even scientists say that the expanding universe is not eternal. It has not existed forever. There was a starting point and before that there was a chunk of matter? So if the universe wasn't there before, how did that chunk of matter come to be -- just ""POOF"" and it appeared by God's will?

, and ""Oh, it was just there."" makes no sense at all. While quantum fluctuations, or the creation of particles out of nowhere is a real thing, they are not likely to create whole universes out of chance. So what if DNA took millions of years to develop, then it still needed an enclosed environment (a cell) and organelles (cell parts)... But if there is a God - an all powerful God would have the power to create something out of nothing, not because of any preconceived or preeminent matter, but because the all powerful God can do that by definition!

, So each expression of a gene involves communicating their definitive coded information within the living cell. Those highly specific genetic ""blueprints"" tell the cells which proteins, mineral compounds and enzymes to make for each system. And even such essential nutritional things as vitamins can profoundly affect their interdependent processes. So how, from where, and why did even the simplest life with the many thousand of exquisite instructions, come to be -- to say nothing of expressing millions, billions or trillions of instructions defining individual, personal, and the recognizable racial, tribal and family traits -- from an all powerful God, outside of time, beyond universal limits by definition?

, Plant cell structure is not a simple matter!
1.) Eukaryotes are all cellular organisms including animal, plants, fungi -- and protists (slime molds and protozoans) -- whose cells are organized into interrelated, interdependent structures inside of selective semipermeable membranes.
2.) Where did the semipermeable, cytoplasmic membrane (the skin of a cell) and its fluid serum and its first foods come from? Cannibalism -- of... well so that's your answer? Where did that cannibal find enough life to cannibalize?


Veggies (plant-life) and proteins were the baby food of the first cell? Oh, so how and why were these plants and proteins available? So then the veggies have interrelated, interdependent cell structure and would need organic materials in plant energy production from the very first second.
Wasn't life much too interrelated, interdependent for mother nature to solve a million crucial balanced systems without knowing! So she did all of that without a brain or any observable form of intelligence?Plant Cell Structure Photo Image: If millions (or billions) of years of storms in junk yards could never create a modern computer or a beautiful machine of any kind, then what logic says that chaos can create amazing life like one typical cell of a plant and bring it to an excellent, interrelated, interdependent status -- well beyond a virus or simple ""germ of life."""

Look at how nature breaks down things and think about whether creation of life seems natural!,
Point out that the most basic ""natural"" scientific processes called entropy and chaos do not normally improve things: so how did Cell Molecular Organization of life just ""happen"" (Please see the image with a chart.,
Entropy is disorder or uncertainty in a system and much like inertia it is neutral and only exists because of outside forces.,
Equilibrium apparently has no creative energies or powers, and so entropy could do little or nothing but come to a balanced or settled condition (as, by definition, energy is not available to do work by entropy).

Examine the creativity of a great booming explosion, ""boom"" (a big boom).,
Visualize the big bang.,
Contemplate, how and if all life came into existence as the result of ""a"" big bang, where did that big bang come from?",How to Defend a Belief in the Existence of God3,", The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy always increases in closed systems unless external energy is used to ""clean it up"", similar to how cleaning up a room requires your energy. Entropy, for the most part, means disorder. An example is about breaking down rocks to pebbles and to sand, dissolving, oxidizing, mineral deposits, poison, corrosion, erosion, and rot. Evolution depends on disorder such as mutations but then devolves to order, which is in contrast of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. While some may use escape hatches, such as that the organisms themselves are not closed systems, or that the Earth is not a closed system because it gets energy from the sun, the Sun is not intelligently affecting the Earth in a meaningful way, unlike a person cleaning up a room. Evolution is not surely proven because nothing in science will ever be proven, as the scientific method means that a better alternative to evolution may be found. God can override laws as he wishes, after all, He made laws but is not bound or limited by them.

Learn of simple to interrelated, interdependent organization of knowledge in Genesis Chapter 1.,
See that Genesis 1 is not some great mishmash of strange creatures or weird information, though some of its data may seem as outliers (statically out of the norm) yet it is usual to have some such data that is out of your desired set as a value far from most others -- but outliers exist realistically, in most any kinds of sets of data: ""Outliers make statistical analyses difficult"" (Harvey Motulsky).God would not be surprised at some events or details that are not expected in anything.,

, ""He uses simple things to confound the wise.""

, That does not indicate inane randomness in mental processes that some schizoid accident of nature might infer.

, Express as best you can the amazing interrelated systems of even the simplest life up to the human ""multiple intelligences.""

,, Most are unicellular, but a few prokaryotes, such as myxo-bacteria, have multicellular stages in their life cycles.


The root word ""karyote"" comes from the Greek karyon ""nut or kernel"".

, Some believe say that since the archaea is simpler than the other forms of cellular life that they came as an earlier form of life, but simpler means God can do life all kinds of ways, ie: simple to complex is evidently present in all things of any kind anywhere, so what does that prove -- order, continuity, persistence, individual qualities, not copies, (identical twins have unique fingerprints),...

, The Bible had that concept first, by far...

Simple Love Spell.,
Lost Love Spell.,
Let the candles burn down.,
Soul Mate Love Spell.",How to Cast a Love Spell2," This is a basic spell that requires no exotic ingredients or astrological charts. This spell is meant to attract more friends and to enhance your sexual attraction if you're looking for more than friends. If you have a particular individual in mind, plan to focus on him or her during this ritual as a way to draw that person to you or to strengthen the bond that already exists between the two of you.


Thoroughly clean your bathroom. We're not talking about a psychic cleansing here; do a true cleaning with cleanser and anti-bacterial products. Cover your mirrors with white or pink towels or sheets.






Draw a bath and add a handful of sea salt or other salt to the water while saying: ""Negativity is washed away. I am renewed as of today! Many heads will turn my way, the ones I chose will wish to stay.""






If you don't have a bathtub, tie the salt up in a washcloth while saying the above words, and use it in the shower.


Light three white votive candles or place three floating candles in the bathtub. Relax and focus on your body as you anticipate entering the water--think and feel how sensual it is and how beautiful you are. Focus on what you like about yourself. If you're casting this spell for a certain person, begin focusing on him or her now.






Turn off the lights and turn on your favorite music if possible. Choose music that's in line with your desired end result.






If you're looking for wild romance and hot love, pick something that makes you feel reckless and sexy. If you desire a soulmate and someone who makes you feel safe, choose music that makes you feel calm and peaceful. For general attraction, you may want a happy, mellow song.


Enter the bath and relax. Make sure every part of your body is immersed in the water at least once. Shampoo and condition your hair; shave if appropriate. Cleansing is an important part of this ritual.






When you're finished, repeat the words of the incantation you spoke before you entered the bath. This time, add the following line to close the spell: ""I am blessed, I am loving, I am loved and love myself! I am love!""






Follow your intuition and add any other elements that feel right to you. These could include incense, bath oils made with herbal extracts or essential oils, your favorite perfume or cologne, a cup of herbal tea or a bath towel purchased specifically for this ritual.



, If you had love but lost it through circumstances, personal difficulties or outside interference, you can use this spell to try to reunite with your lost love.


Purchase six candles. You'll need one candle in each of the following colors: red, green, yellow and blue You'll also need two pink candles.






Place the candles at the appropriate compass points. Place the red candle in the southern corner of your space, green in the northern, yellow in the eastern and blue in the western.






Light all six candles. Hold the two pink candles in your hands and face the red candle. Chant the following until you feel satisfied: ""Beautiful Goddess, powerful God, hear my prayer! Lords of fire, burn my desire, times three. If it is meant to be, Bring (insert name) back to me.""







, It's best not to blow out candles used in a spell; allow them to burn down on their own.

, This spell is meant to draw to you a partner who's suited for you at this time in your life. Before you cast this spell, be sure you're ready for this level of commitment. You shouldn't undertake this if you're simply curious about the one who is ""meant"" for you. You must be prepared to take responsibility for any results and consequences.


You'll need to do a little preparation before beginning this spell. Get some special paper, whatever that means to you--real parchment paper, paper made of cotton or hemp or a sheet of decorative paper. You'll also need a ritual writing instrument. Again, you decide if that's a quill pen, fountain pen, favorite ballpoint or calligraphy marker. It shouldn't be something you use daily to jot down the grocery list. Finally, pick up moon incense and charcoal and a small heart-shaped box or box decorated with hearts.






Pick the perfect time. Ideally this spell should be cast after dark; if you can do it during the waxing moon, all the better. You will have the power of the moon incense working for you, so you can be a little flexible with your time without diminished results.






Reinforce your aura through meditation and/or cleansing. Using your ritual pen and paper, write words of power that will call the most perfect partner to you at this time. Do not include specific names and avoid thinking of a specific person. You may or may not have even met your soul mate yet, so leave everything open to possibilities.






If you can't quite come up with what feel like the right words, use the following: ""If there be a perfect match, this work tonight will surely catch. the perfect one who is meant to be, shall find His/Her way home to me. In perfect love and perfect trust, I send this out, but not from lust. This spell will guide us to unite, free will remains with us tonight.""


When you're are finished, read over what you wrote and make sure you've said everything you wanted to say, and nothing's been left out. Then spend some time meditating on your goal while you light your ritual fire or the charcoal.






Continue your meditation until you feel that everything is right, your will is focused and your sense of certainty is secure. When the fire has become coals or the charcoal is glowing, read what you've written aloud three times. As you read or when you come to the end of each repetition, sprinkle about a tablespoon of the moon incense on the fire.

If you have never used moon incense with a ritual fire, you should practice a few times. Flames will leap up along the dust trail of this incense powder, so you must be extremely careful. There will be sparks of incense outside of this trail of flames as well--also dangerous. Toss in the incense all at once; don't trail the dust or sprinkle it. Do not wear gauzy or loose clothing or sleeves that trail. Be very careful.


Fold the paper and place it in your heart box; this is your spell box. Put it in a safe place with positive energy. Now forget about it. Let nature, fate and the spirits do their work to bring your soulmate to you.

Set your intention.,
Gather symbolically appropriate materials.,
Cleanse your body.,
Choose your place.,
Cast a circle.,
Light candles and concentrate.,
Repeat for effect.,
Be open to possibility.",How to Cast a Love Spell3," Are you hoping to get someone special to notice you? Draw a mysterious stranger into your life? Dispel negativity from a wounded relationship? Spice up a lackluster love life? Make your interactions with the universe at large more loving? The most important part of manifestation, so get a very clear picture in your mind of what you’d like to accomplish.


Think very carefully about the potential drawbacks of your intention. If, for example, you intend to attract your ideal mate, think about whether or not you’re at a place in your life where you can enter into such a relationship. If you’d like to work your magic on someone you don’t know that well, brace yourself for the possibility that (s)he won’t be as interesting or attractive in real life as they seem from afar.
Remember the rule of three. According to the Wiccan Rede, “All good that a person does to another returns threefold in this life; harm is also returned threefold.” Encourage love by sending it out freely.

Stay away from intentions that involve dominating, manipulating or in some way controlling another person. Those kinds of intentions leave you open to receiving the same in turn. For example, instead of manifesting a nurturing, mutually supportive and satisfying relationship, you could draw to yourself someone who is wildly possessive and extremely jealous.



, Exactly what you choose and in what combination should be based on the kind of love you want to attract.


Start by emphasizing colors. Red, for example, is the color most closely associated with passion and lust. Pink is also a heart color but is considered to be more nurturing. White speaks of innocence and would be appropriate for a platonic relationship. Green's association is with nature and might be used to promote virility. Choose candles, cloths, papers, flowers, or other objects in a color(s) whose associations fit your needs.
Integrate herbs into the spell. According to herb lore, balm and catnip can be used to attract love, and marjoram can be used to dispel negativity and promote love and happiness. Lavender is perhaps the best herb for attracting men. If your intention is more sexual in nature, try using vervain, which was used by the Druids to promote love, lust, and sexual fulfillment, or caraway, which promotes lust and fidelity or cinnamon and fennel to promote vigor and libido.
Use symbolic items. Do a little reading about the symbolism attached to common items. You're likely to find multiple interpretations for the same object, so go with your gut and choose what's meaningful for you.

Use a mirror for healthy self-image, a piece of silk for sensuality, flowers for romance, lingerie for libido, or anything else that might have a special significance for you.
If you're directing your spell at a specific individual and you happen to have an item taken from that person (hair, a piece of clothing, a letter, something they've borrowed from you), be sure to include it.
Beware of adding items with negative associations such as needles, knives, ropes or other metaphorically aggressive objects; they might put an undesirable spin on your ritual.



, Take a ritual bath using herbs, flowers or essential oils. Infuse the water with rose, jasmine, or any of the herbs listed above. If possible, bathe by candlelight. When you’re done, dress in clean clothes. If you've chosen a new outfit for your ritual, put that on.

, Cast your spell somewhere you won’t be disturbed. It would be wonderful if you could choose a romantic location such as a forest or beach; however, your number one priority should be privacy and the ability to concentrate, so if that means staying indoors in a clean, cozy room, that's fine.

, Spread sea salt (with or without rosemary added) in a circle around the space where you want to work for protection. If necessary, smudge the area by burning sage to cleanse it of negativity.

, Focus on your intention. Visualize the scenario you'd like to experience in real life; make it as real as possible by imagining it with all your senses. If you feel comfortable doing so, chant your intention aloud; otherwise, repeat it in your head or write it on paper and burn it, allowing it to go out into the universe.


Make a rhyming spell if desired. This can make your ritual more potent. You may even want to include the name of a relevant god or goddess into the spell if that fits with your personal philosophy. Don't stress about being a poet. Rhyming is nice if you can pull it off, but what's most important is the sincerity and good intentions of your words.
Make a symbolic offering. Suitable offerings include flowers, an apple, wine or anything else that has personal significance.
Do not disturb your candles or blow them out prematurely. Allow them to burn down completely, then gather the wax and either place it in a sachet beneath your pillow or bury it in the garden to let it grow - preferably somewhere the dog won’t dig it up.

, The more you concentrate on your intention, the more powerful a signal you will send. Perform this ritual every day/week/full moon/whatever other length of time feels appropriate and be grateful in advance for your success.

, The results of your manifestation might be different – or even better – than what you imagined for yourself. Don’t become so focused on one narrow vision of love that you let a glorious opportunity pass you by.

Talk with a pastor.,
Talk with a Christian missionary.,
Get together with Christian friends.,
Familiarize yourself with the Bible.,
Choose a Christian denomination.,
Be patient.",How to Convert from Hinduism to Christianity1," Reach out to one or more Christian pastors or leaders in your community. You can find one by entering “Christian church” and your city into a search engine. Then, sit down individually with each of them and discuss your thoughts regarding conversion. Ask them for advice. See if you can sit in on a sermon or congregation meeting. Be prepared to meet with religious leaders multiple times before coming to a final decision.Don’t be shy about approaching these religious officials. Many of them will be more than happy to guide you through the conversion process. For example, Methodists consider meeting with a pastor to be a critical first step towards conversion.;
, If you live in an area with missionaries, you might attend one of their gatherings or ask a missionary to visit you at home. You can discuss their particular Christian beliefs, such as their understanding of salvation and sin. Or, you could ask about how their denomination treats new converts. Missionaries come from a variety of Christian denominations, so you may need to talk with multiple people before moving forward with a conversion.For example, you might ask, ""How did you become a Christian?"" Or, ""How did you know that this particular denomination of Christianity was the right one for you?""
You can expect a missionary to be excited about the opportunity to speak with you. They are usually individuals who sometimes have moved far away from their home and are trying to spread the word about their faith and potentially convert others.
Be aware that once you reach out to a missionary they may expect continued contact with you, even if you decide to convert to another Christian group.

, Ask them about their beliefs and what draws them to Christ. Discuss their memories of the conversion process, if they went through it. You can also go online and find communities of Christians who can discuss conversion with you. Find a group that piques your interest by entering “Christian conversion support” into a search engine.Online groups are also a great place to ask any questions that came up as you read through the Bible or other Christian texts. For example, you might be curious as to whether or not you will need to attend church every Sunday or not.

, Purchase a physical or digital edition of the Bible and begin to read through it. Highlight any passages that you are particularly interested in. Write down any questions that you have and make sure to bring these up with your Christian religious leader. You may also find it interesting to read through Christian hymns.Be aware that there are many different printed versions of the Bible. For example, you can buy a copy that has all of the passages directly pertaining to women highlighted in red. Talk with your Christian spiritual adviser to determine which text will work the best for you.
Sometimes it also helps to buy an annotated edition with explanations in the margins. A Bible editor might use these annotations as a way to provide historical context, for example. Annotated Bibles often come with additional space in the margins for your notes as well.

, After you’ve talked with a number of Christian ministers and friends, sit down at your computer to do some additional research. Visit a variety of websites affiliated with the denominations that catch your interest. For example, if you enter “Baptist” into a search engine, you will pull up a number of websites. Pay particular attention to any statements of faith that you see.


You can expect some variations between various congregations. Try to focus on the similarities that you see across each denomination.

, The conversion process can sometimes takes years to complete. It is very much based on the individual and how they choose to proceed. It will likely involve a great deal of thought and conversation with other people regarding your choices. Don’t rush the process and instead look at it as an opportunity to make sure that you are making the right choice for you.Some converts have said that reading about the religious struggles experienced by those people found in the Bible helped them to cope with their own conversion process.
Many Christians believe that the conversion process never truly ends. It is an effort that you must make day after day."

, Whether you're lying down gazing at the sky or sitting up meditating, just be sure that your posture allows for correct breathing.

, If a person or non-natural sound distracts you, be happy for the occasional reality awakening. Finding yourself and connecting with the universe is beautiful, but it might become too easy to slip away from what's real.

, They may be of an earthly substance, but if you're using nature to accompany you in the process, this is the best way. It is a very pleasant experience when you are aware of what really exists. You will begin to realize and be thankful for the true beauty that surrounds you.

, It's important to know who you are and to occasionally find time to walk inside the beautiful temple of love that was given to you by the eternal creator. This is not to be associated with religion. It is spirituality and it is all you need to survive, because it provides you with the essence of life.

, The plants love the voices all around them. Tell them you are thankful to have them. Even so sing to them. They are like us in so many ways. We just don't always notice right away.

Thus how can it be that there is all the variation on this planet, like wind lighting? We are all the same shape, even with the difficulties of understanding each other when we are together, we are still the same.

It alone is the final authority in determining all doctrinal truths (for example: not traditions or other writings). In its original writing, it is inspired, infallible and inerrant (See: II Timothy 3:16; II Peter 1:20-21; Proverbs 30:5; Romans 16:25-26).;
, Outline that God is eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son (Jesus) and Holy Spirit. These three are coequal and co-eternal (See: I John 5:7; Genesis 1:26; Matthew 3:16-17, 28:19; Luke 1:35; Isaiah 9:6; Hebrews 3:7-11).

, Believe and present Jesus Christ as God the Son (the second person of the Trinity). On earth, Jesus was both 100% God and 100% man. Filled with The Holy Spirit beyond limit, He is the only man ever to have lived a sinless life. He was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, performed miracles, died on the cross for mankind and thus, took the punishment for our sins through the shedding of His blood. He rose from the dead on the third day according to the Scriptures, ascended to the right hand of the Father, and will return again in power and glory. (See: John 1:1,14, 20:28; I Timothy 3:16; Isaiah 9:6; Philippians 2:5-6; I Timothy 2:5).

, Proclaim that Jesus Christ was conceived by God the Father, through the Holy Spirit (the third person of the Trinity) in the virgin Mary's womb; therefore, He is the Son of God (See: Matthew 1:18, 25; Luke 1:35; Isaiah 7:14; Luke 1:27-35).

, Realize that man was created good and upright, but by voluntary transgression he fell from grace (and each of us have sinned) so that: ones only hope of redemption is in Jesus Christ, the Son of God (See: Genesis 1:26-31, 3:1-7; Romans 5:12-21).

, Knowing God by being regenerated by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential (See: John 6:44, 65; Matthew 19:28; Titus 3:5).

, Be saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ by His death, burial, and resurrection, as salvation is a gift from God, not a result of any of your good works or of any other human efforts, but so that you then ""do work preordained that you should do"" (Ephesians 2:8-10; Galatians 2:16, 3:8; Titus 3:5; Romans 10:9-10; Acts 16:31; Hebrews 9:22).

, Make your own commitment to change your mind, being willing to turn around, in all areas of life, to follow Christ, which allows anyone, who will repent, to receive His redemption, and be regenerated by receiving His Holy Spirit. Thus, through true repentance we receive forgiveness of sin and appropriate salvation (See: Acts 2:21, 3:19; I John 1:9).

, Continue in the ongoing process of yielding to God’s Word and His Spirit in order to complete the development of Christ's character in you. It is through the present ministry of the Holy Spirit and the Word of God that the Christian is enabled to live a Godly life in Christ Jesus (See: I Thessalonians 4:3, 5:23; II Corinthians 3:18, 6:14-18, II Thessalonians 2:1-3, Romans 8:29, 12:1-2, Hebrews 2:11).

, Accept and know that the sinless blood that Jesus Christ shed on the Cross of Calvary was in payment, for redemption, for all time -- for all who receive Him -- able to end all use of blood sacrifice, as it is 100% sufficient to cleanse all mankind of all sin. Jesus allowed Himself to be punished for both your sinfulness and your sins, enabling all those who believe to be free from the penalty of unforgiven sin, which is death (See: I John 1:7; Revelation 1:5, 5:9; Colossians 1:20; Romans 3:10-12, 23, 5:9; John 1:29).

, Realize that Christians are people who have invited the Lord Jesus Christ to come and live inside them or 'dwell' within them by His Holy Spirit so that each believer will: relinquish the sovereign authority of ones life over to Him in truth thus making Jesus the Lord (King and Leader) of ones life as well as Savior. Each believer puts ones trust in what Jesus accomplished for each of them when He died, was buried, and rose again from the dead (See: John 1:12; John 14:17, 23; John 15:4; Romans 8:11; Revelation 3:20).

, Receive the promise of Pentecost; it is the promise of the Father, sent by Jesus after His Ascension, to abide with each and all believers, forever, to empower the Church to preach the Gospel throughout the whole earth (See: Joel 2:28-29; Matthew 3:11; Mark 16:17; Acts 1:5,2:1-4, 17, 38-39, 8:14-17, 10:38, 44-47, 11:15-17, 19:1-6).

, Desire The Holy Spirit being manifested in your daily life through a variety of spiritual gifts to build and to sanctify the church, to demonstrate the validity of the resurrection, to be able to conform to God's plan, and confirm the power of the Gospel of Christ Jesus. The Bible lists of these gifts are not necessarily exhaustive, and the gifts may occur in various combinations. All believers are commanded to earnestly desire the manifestation of the gifts in their lives. These gifts always operate in harmony with the Scriptures and should never be used in violation of Biblical parameters. (See: Hebrews 2:4; Romans 1:11, 12 :4-8; Ephesians 4:16; I Timothy 4:14; II Timothy 1:6-7; I Corinthians 12:1-31, 14:1-40; I Peter 4:10).

, Agree with believers that The Church is the Body of Christ, the habitation of God through His Spirit, with divine appointments for the fulfillment of Jesus' Great Commission. Every person who is born of the Spirit is an integral part of the church as a member of the body of believers. There is a spiritual unity of all believers in our Lord Jesus Christ. (See: Ephesians 1:22, 2:19-22; Hebrews 12:23; John 17:11, 20-23).

,


Follow Jesus in ""Water Baptism"": Profess faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, then the new convert is commanded by the Word of God to be baptized in water in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (See: Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:38; Mark 16:16; Acts 8:12, 36-38; 10:47-48).







Take ""The Lord's Supper"": Partake as a believer in a unique time of communion in the presence of God when the elements of bread and grape juice (the Body and Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ) are taken in remembrance of Jesus' sacrifice on the Cross (See: Matthew 26:26-29; I Corinthians 10:16, 11:23-25).





, Being always in prayer--in everything: give thanks for His favor and the unlimited power of agreeing together upon God's promises.There is much to be achieved through the power of agreement and shared burden in your field of endeavor, especially as Jesus said, ""If two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in Heaven."" (See: Matthew 18:19) Pray for one another:


General prayer requests
Salvation for yourself
Salvation for a loved one
Finances/Work/School
Family/Friends/Enemies
Emotions/Concerns/Sexual problems/Disorders
Drugs/Alcohol/Habits/Addictions
Healing:

Pray for healing of the sick, thanking God that He has already provided it, giving Him the praise: expect to see examples of His healing power, as were illustrated in the life and ministry of Jesus, and included in the commission of Jesus to all His disciples, to as many as He shall call. This blessing of divine healing is given as a sign, which is to ""follow believers"". It is also a part of Jesus' completed work on the Cross and is one of the gifts of the Spirit. (See: Psalm 103:2-3; Isaiah 53:5; Matthew 8:16-17; Mark 16:17-18; Acts 8:6-7; James 5:14-16; I Corinthians 12:9, 28; Romans 11:29).



, Study and pro-actively seek the Father's will for believers to become whole, healthy and successful in all areas of life realizing that God will deny you no good thing! Love one another as Christ has loved the church, preferring one another, seeking not only your own, but serving in all things, as possible. But because of the fall, many may not receive the full benefits of God’s will while on Earth, as men may, if they wish, deny God and hinder you in some instances from some good already provided for you, if they can. That fact, though, should never prevent all believers from seeking the full benefits of Christ’s provision in order to better serve others, in many areas included in:


Spiritual (John 3:3-11; II Corinthians 5:17-21; Romans 10:9-10).
Mental and Emotional (II Timothy 1:7, 2:11; Philippians 4:7-8; Romans 12:2; Isaiah 26:3).
Physical (Isaiah 53:4,5; Matthew 8:17; I Peter 2:24).
Financial (Joshua 1:8; Malachi 3:10-11; Luke 6:38; II Corinthians 9:6-10; Deuteronomy 28:1-14; Psalm 34:10, 84:11; Philippians 4:19).

, Realize and receive Jesus Christ as physically resurrected from the dead in a glorified body three days after His death on the cross. In addition, both the saved and the lost will be resurrected; they that are saved to the resurrection of life, and they that are lost to the resurrection of eternal damnation (See: Luke 24:16, 36, 39; John 2:19-21, 20:26-28, 21:4; Acts 24:15; I Corinthians 15:42, 44; Philippians 1:21-23, 3:21).

, The eternal dwelling place for all believers after passing from death in the Gospel of Jesus Christ is called Heaven.(See: Matthew 5:3, 12, 20, 6:20, 19:21, 25:34; John 17:24; II Corinthians 5:1; Hebrews 11:16; I Peter 1:4).

, Live your one life on earth for God in Christ, because the unbelievers will receive supreme justice, judged by the one merciful Judge, God, and sent to Hell, if they have not received and proclaimed His will on Earth, to then receive just punishment with the Devil and his Fallen Angels by eternal separation in darkness (See: Matthew 25:41; Mark 9:43-48; Hebrews 9:27; Revelation 14:9-11, 20:12-15, 21:8).

, Proclaim that Jesus Christ will physically and visibly return to earth for the second time to establish His Kingdom. This will occur at a date undisclosed by the Scriptures (See: Ephesians 2:10, Matthew 24:30, 26:63-64; Acts 1:9-11; I Thessalonians 4:15-17; II Thessalonians 1:7-8; Revelation 1:7).

Start off by casting a circle.,
Sit down in the middle of your circle, and take the object that resembles your element.,
Run your hands through/over the object that represents your element.,
Call the element forth.,
Once you have finished with your element, thank it and ask it to return to its normal position in the circle, then close it.

",How to Connect to Your Element," This will draw the positive energy around you, so that there is no chance that any unwanted spirits will interrupt you. Make sure that you have brought something resembling your element into the centre.;
, The objects to represent each one should be:

Water - A cup of water. Works best on full moon.

Fire - A lit candle.

Earth - A flowerpot of earth.

Air - A feather, some incense or a fan.


, Think of how it feels to be consumed by it (e.g. water, underwater, fire, on a hot summer's day, earth, buried underground, and air, in the centre of a hurricane). Imagine it taking care of you, making sure you can breathe underwater, that you don't get too hot, crushed by the earth, or that you don't get whipped away by the wind.

, You could ask it to play with you. Your vision of being consumed by that element may become more vivid. Talk to it, tell it about what makes you happy or sad. Connect with it as you would connect with other people.

It represents the first loaf of harvest and some use it in ritual whereas some have it as part of their meal.;
, Pumpkin soup, harvest broth and casserole made with seasonal vegetables such as spring onions and potatoes will be great. Blackberry pie and cream made with fat ripe brambles will be delicious for a dessert. There are plenty of harvest recipes on the net so explore them and discuss them and plan out your menu.

, Encourage your family members to prayer or meditate to give thanks for the abundance and generosity of nature. If you sit in a circle you can share your spiritual energies with one another.


Do this in the garden or somewhere natural and quiet and hope the weather stays fair and bright. Some will use the loaf they have baked to eat after their ritual. It's because of nature that they can enjoy this food. You could always have the meal on the late afternoon and go for a picnic for lunch in the warm countryside with all the family.

, Harvest is a popular time of year for anyone whatever their religion so it's no wonder why many villages and towns have their own celebrations. Try to attend one of these even if they're a bit out of your way. It will get the family into it more to see other people having fun in ways that can only be done in community games.


Perhaps you could even get work joining in the harvest and truly get into the spirit of it all.

, If you have young children think of a story and tell it to them either the night before or on the day itself. It will be easier for them to understand the festival like this. Try singing some songs as well to the wheels on the bus (e.g. The leaves on the tree come falling down, falling down, falling down) which was invented by Tracy Roe.

Understand the exact requirements.,
Continue to attend church sermons and functions.,
Take a new members class, if offered.,
Repent your sins.,
Develop and affirm your personal relationship with Jesus Christ.,
Get baptized.,
Participate in all conversion celebrations.,
Continue to follow all church membership rules.",How to Convert from Hinduism to Christianity2," Talk with the minister of your potential congregation about what you will need to do in both the long and short term. You can talk about whether or not a baptism is necessary. Or, if you will need other Christians as sponsors. You can also request that they lay out the timeline of necessary events.


For example, in the Catholic faith, you must express your desire to be baptized and take on the label of “Catechumen.” You will then begin the process of learning about Catholicism, a period which can last for months., As you are exploring conversion and after you’ve converted, make sure to stay involved in your local church. Attend sermons and activities. Talk with your minister or pastor on a regular basis. You can also keep track of national and international developments in Christianity via the internet., Almost all Christian denominations embrace the idea of a “learning period” for those persons pursuing conversion and many churches even offer classes aimed at new members. In a class of this type, you would continue to familiarize yourself with the Bible, while also learning more about your church’s membership requirements., Your Christian denomination may require that you write down your sins in a book, speak with a minister, or simply contemplate your sins on an everyday basis. This will help to pave your way to salvation through the process of repentance., Again, this will be something that you’ll need to do privately. However, you may also be asked to verbally affirm your beliefs and commitment, sometimes in front of the entire congregation. For example, the minister might ask you, “Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the savior?” You would then answer in the affirmative.You may also perform this affirmation as a group alongside other new members., You will need to be partially submerged or touched with holy water as part of a baptism. This reflects you being purified and you will usually become a full-fledged Christian and church member at this point. In the case of Catholicism, you may also be asked to receive the Eucharist. You may receive a Christian name as well.A baptism can be a private event between you and your priest or may take place in front of an audience, such as the entire congregation., After your baptism and statement of faith is complete, your congregation may throw a celebration. Depending on their traditions, this event may involve singing, dancing, or just talking. Make sure to fully participate in these events to continue to demonstrate your commitment to the community., As a new member, make sure to attend as many church-sponsored events as possible. Be aware of the sermon schedule and organize your plans around it, too. Some churches will have moral guidelines as well, such as prohibitions against drinking alcohol. If you have any questions about what constitutes a violation of church rules, ask your minister.

Recognize any Hindu-Christian similarities.,
Decide whether or not to stay vegetarian.,
Choose which, if any, religious symbols to wear.,
Try to stay in touch with your Hindu friends and family.,
Notify any local officials, as necessary.,
Be aware of the possibility for backlash.",How to Convert from Hinduism to Christianity3," As you read through Christian texts, you might notice a number of commonalities to Hindu readings. You might see that both religions emphasize love and surrender, for example. The idea that God is ever-present is another similarity. As you come upon these similarities, make note of them because they can help you weather the transition process.For example, Hindus often emphasize the idea of long-standing devotion to God, including the surrender of one’s body and mind. Christians often teach the same beliefs., Many Hindus choose not to consume meat and, if that was your choice, you can continue to do so as a Christian. There are many Christians who choose to lead a vegetarian lifestyle for personal, health, or religious reasons., You can decide to wear a cross around your neck. Or, you can continue to don the bindi, if you are a woman. If you are a man, you may want to untie the Hindu white thread around your torso, or leave it intact. These are also changes that you can make over time., As you go through the conversion process, you may want to ‘feel out’ your Hindu friends to see how they feel about your choices. If they are supportive, you may be able to open up to them about your struggles. If they are resistant, then you may need to get some distance from them and try to rebuild your relationships later., Depending on the religious restrictions where you live, you may need to contact a local government official to let them know about your conversion. If this is the case, you will generally have to attest that you made this decision out of free will and without being pressured.For example, in India many personal religious changes must be logged by a local oath commissioner.

, Understand any perils to your personal safety as a result of your decision to convert and take the proper safeguards. In some areas, Christian converts are targeted for violence. Try to determine if your conversion may have a larger impact on your ability to live safely in your current home.Depending on your local situation, if you are persecuted because of your faith, you may want to reach out to law enforcement authorities. You can also talk to church authorities about other options for personal protection.

Keep a journal.",How to Ground and Center," Meditation is most effective when you can find a quiet space with limited distractions. The space should also be physically comfortable, with no extreme temperatures, so you can focus on connecting your body to thoughts of peace and calm.If you are using a meditation space in your own home, you can prepare this in multiple ways to be your ideal space. Consider incorporating elements of nature in your space, such as hanging planters, artworks featuring flowers or a beautiful landscape scene, or a natural souvenir from a recent trip, such as a seashell or jar of sand from your favorite beach.If you are using your meditation space in a shared room (like a living room of home gym), consider putting up a screen to divide the space specifically for meditation.
Many colleges also offer meditation centers in their student life centers or in their university gyms. If you are a student facing the stress of mid-terms or finals, consider looking into whether your university offers a space like this.You can also use many beautiful spaces such as public gardens, parks or mountain trails if you are comfortable meditating in public. Many vacation destinations also offer meditation retreats, so you can even plan your next trip to help you ground and center.;
, The process of grounding and centering requires that you become physically connected to the Earth. The most effective way to position yourself is with your feet directly touching the ground. Try sitting in a chair with your feet on the ground, about hip width apart from each other.You can also ground and center when you stand. Place with your feet hip width apart and keep your arms hanging loose and comfortable at your sides. While you should stand tall, don't keep your knees too rigid as this could make you dizzy.You might be tempted to lie down. If that is the position you are most comfortable in, then you should do this. But most practitioners suggest that grounding and centering works best when your feet are in direct contact with the ground., Deep breathing is a key component of meditation. When you are meditating, do not breathe through your mouth or from your throat. Instead, breathe from your diaphragm.Your diaphragm is located in your lower abdominal muscles (or your lower belly). As you inhale, push out these muscles and feel your rib cage expand outward.
Hold your breath for two seconds.
Exhale by bring your diaphragm muscles back inward to your belly.In this method, you are breathing in and out through your nose, not your mouth.
Breathing deeply from your diaphragm can effectively reduce stress and help you optimize the amount of the oxygen your lungs take in., As you practice inhaling outward and exhaling inward. imagine that your body is going through a transformational process. As you inhale outward, imagine your body filling up with positive power. As you exhale and your push your abdominal muscles inward, imagine that you are releasing all of the negative forces in your life.Practicing this basic technique of accepting (inhaling) positive things and exhaling (repelling) negative feelings will help clear your mind for other calming thoughts., As you are breathing, close your eyes. Imagine your feet are rooted to the core of the earth beneath you.


Pretend that your feet are sprouting roots, as if they were at the base of tree trunk. These roots connect you to all other beings in the Earth -- the soil, the air, the ocean, animals, and the sun.You can also envision yourself as a vine growing up from the earth or a boulder on the side of the mountain. But it should be an image that anchors you to the world around you., As you breathe out and in, and imagine your feet sprouting roots, follow where the roots take you. They should go down and down, further and further into the soil until you find yourself in the center of the Earth.What does the center of the Earth look like? Is it hot, with flowing lava? You can throw any feelings of pain, frustration, anger or bitterness into the fire at the center of the Earth., After you have grounded yourself, you can then push your energy upward and outward. Imagine your torso as the trunk of a tree that grows and then forms into branches. The branches then burst into leaves in the warmth of the sun.You can stand up for this part of the meditation if you wish. Raise your arms up above your head as if they are the main branches of the tree splitting off at the trunk.As you raise your arms, alternate keeping your hands curled up in a ball and then stretching your fingers outward. This will help you feel more connected to the warmth and energy of the sun., In this final phase of the meditation, you should feel a sense of connectedness between the roots of the ground and the branches of the sky. This will center you perfectly between the opposing elemental forces of the world: the earth and the sky.Try to practice the above process for at least three minutes, 3-4 times a week. With frequent practice, this method will feel more natural and you will be able to practice if for longer (ideally 15-20 minutes, or even longer if you wish).

, As you finish the exercise, imagine all the connected energy contained in your toes, fingers, arms, and legs begin to contract in the center of your body in your upper abdominal muscles. Imagine that this is where you can contain your grounded, centered energy in your body.Ask yourself if there is a word or phrase that represents this grounded state for you? Having a word or phrase that brings you to this state of peace and interconnectedness can help you ground yourself quickly in stressful situations, like in the middle of a busy commute or when you have had a frustrating conversation with a coworker.[

, The key idea behind grounding and centering is becoming connected with the world around you. You can practice this form of meditation in many different contexts.Enjoy the fresh air. Taking a walk -- even if it only for a few minutes -- can help you feel more connected to the world around you. As you walk around your neighborhood or favorite park, take notice of all the trees, plants, and any wildlife you encounter. Breathe in deeply and slowly.
Try not to wear headphones or listen to music while you are doing this as this can distract you from removing negative energy from your body and replenishing it with positive thoughts.
If you have a garden, spend time tending to your plants and foliage as a way of grounding yourself., You might find that you can center and ground yourself while you are in the process of creating something. Perhaps you love to paint in a sunlit room, write poetry with your morning cup of coffee, or spend your weekend afternoons baking a favorite dessert.Practice your breathing while you perform these activities. As you practice them, consider how they calm you and connect you to nature and the rest of mankind. If you find yourself becoming frustrated and stressed, then stop and focus purely on breathing and centering yourself., Tai chi is a series of graceful, self-paced movements that are meant to be physical accompaniment to your mental meditation.Tai chi is an ideal physical exercise for meditation because your muscles remain relaxed and loose as opposed to tense and stressed. Wear comfortable clothing when you practice this and it will help you reach a state relaxation and connectedness with both yourself and the world around you.Tai chi has also been shown to have benefits for a broad range of medical conditions, from breast cancer and heart disease to arthritis and hypertension., Meditation is largely an act of reflection and a journal is a perfect place to calm and inspire yourself. There are many different things you can include in your journal, such as:Listing the things you are grateful for. When you are stressed, angry, or feel isolated, take the time to list the things you are grateful for in your journal. This will help foreground all of the positive elements in your life and help you release negative energy from your body.
Analyzing inspirational sayings. If you enjoy reading poetry, small quotes or even longer pieces of literature, you can use your journal to reflect on things that you have read. Write down the quote that struck you as important and then write 3-4 sentences on why you think this quote is important. How does it relate to you?
Setting goals and tracking your progress. If you have a particular goal you want to achieve -- for example, to become less anxious in work meetings -- then tracking your progress in your journal can help you take steps to accomplish your goal. Note the date on which you feel anxious (like during an important meeting on the rebranding strategy for a client), and then note how you handled that stress. Did you take a series of deep breaths? Did you repeat an affirmative mantra to yourself? How long did it take you to calm down?A journal can provide you a real sense of accomplishment while also helping you to remain grounded and centered in your present state."

Practice the Middle Way.This is an important part of Buddhism which requires Buddhists to lead a balanced life that is not too lavish or too stringent.",How to Become a Buddhist," This will make it much easier to understand everything you will read, since many Buddhist terms can be very unfamiliar, especially to Westerners. The basic terms of Buddhism include but are not limited to:


Arhat: a being who has attained nirvana.
Bodhisattva: a being who is on the way to enlightenment.
Buddha: an awakened being who has achieved perfect enlightenment.Dharma: a complicated term that usually refers to the teachings of the Buddha.
Nirvana: spiritual bliss. Nirvana is the ultimate goal of Buddhism.
Sangha: the Buddhist community.
Sutra: a sacred Buddhist text.
Venerable: The title of an ordained monk or nun, seen wearing the specific colored robes of their tradition and sect.;
, The two most popular Buddhist schools today are Theravada and Mahayana.Though these two schools have the same basic beliefs, there are differences in the teachings they focus on: Mahayana focuses heavily on becoming a bodhisattva, Theravada focuses on practicing the dharma, and so on.There are many other schools of Buddhism, such as Zen Buddhism, Pure Land Buddhism, and Esoteric Buddhism.
No matter which school interests you, the basic teachings of Buddhism are the same.
Because Buddhism is such an ancient religion, there are many intricate differences between all the schools that cannot be covered in detail here; spend time researching Buddhism to find out more.

, There are many books talking about the founder of Buddhism, and a simple online search will reveal many articles about his life as well. Siddhartha Gautama was a prince who left his palace and lavish lifestyle to seek enlightenment. Though he is not the only Buddha in existence, he is the historical founder of Buddhism.

, One of the most foundational concepts of Buddhism is summarized a teaching called the Four Noble Truths: the truth of suffering, the truth of the cause of suffering, the truth of the end of suffering, and the truth of the path that leads to the end of suffering.In other words, suffering exists, it has a cause and an end, and there is a way to bring about the end of suffering.


The Four Noble Truths are not negative; they are actually meant to reduce suffering through contemplating them.
The Four Noble Truths emphasize that pursuing pleasure is not important.
If you find yourself confused by the Four Noble Truths, don’t feel alone; it takes many people years to fully grasp this teaching.

, Buddhists believe beings live multiple lives. Once a being dies, they are born into a new life, and this cycle of living and dying will only cease once nirvana is attained.A being can be reborn into the human, heavenly, animal, hell, asura, or hungry ghost realms., Karma is closely intertwined with reincarnation and nirvana because karma determines where and when a being will be reborn. Karma consists of the good or bad actions of previous lifetimes and this lifetime. Bad or good karma may affect a being right away, thousands of years from now, or in five lifetimes, depending on when the effects are meant to occur.


Negative karma results from bad actions or thoughts, like killing, stealing, or lying.
Positive karma results from good actions or thoughts, such as generosity, kindness, and spreading Buddhist teachings.
Neutral karma results from actions that have no real effect, such as breathing or sleeping.

, Many major cities have a Buddhist temple, but each temple will stem from a different school (such as Theravada or Zen), and each will certainly offer different services, classes, and activities. The best way to learn about temples near you is to visit them and talk to a Venerable or lay devotee.


Ask about what services and activities the temple offers.
Explore the different shrines.
Attend a few services and see if you like the atmosphere.

, Like most religions, Buddhism has a strong sense of community, and the devotees and monks are welcoming and informative. Begin attending classes and making friends at your temple.


Many Buddhist communities will travel together to different Buddhist temples across the world. This is a fun way to get involved.
If at first you feel shy or nervous, this is perfectly normal.
Buddhism is the most popular religion in many countries like Japan, Thailand, Myanmar, Nepal, Korea, Sri Lanka, China etc.

, The Triple Gem consists of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha.When you take refuge in the Triple Gem, you will likely undergo a ceremony in which you vow to uphold the Five Precepts, which are to not kill, not steal, not commit sexual misconduct, refrain from false speech, and not consume intoxicants.


The specific aspects of the ceremony will vary from temple to temple.
Do not feel obligated to take the Three Refuges, since upholding Buddhist morality is the most important part of this religion.
If you cannot take the Three Refuges because of cultural reasons, or if you cannot find a temple near you, you can still uphold the Five Precepts.
Once you take refuge in Buddhism, you are officially a Buddhist.

, Attending classes at the temple where you took refuge is a great way to stay connected to the Buddhist community. A quick note upon visiting temples, don't sit with the bottoms of your feet towards altars, Buddha statues, or monks. Women may not touch monks in any way, even to shake hands, and men cannot do the same with nuns. A simple bow will do. Most temples offer lessons in yoga, meditation, or various sutra lessons. Spend time with friends and family members who are Buddhist, too.

, Many translated sutras are available online, your temple might have a library, or you can buy sutras. There are also many different Venerable monks and lay Buddhists who have written explanations of Buddhist sutras. Some of the most popular Buddhist sutras are: The Diamond Sutra, The Heart Sutra, and The Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.


Teach others what you have learned about Buddhism once you think you’ve mastered a concept.
There are hundreds of Buddhist concepts and teachings to study, but try not to feel overwhelmed or pressured to “get it” right away.
Attend classes taught by a Venerable or lay devotee at your temple.

, When you took refuge in the Triple Gem, you vowed to uphold the Five Precepts, but this can be difficult at times. Do your best to not kill any living creature, be honest, not consume intoxicants, do not steal, and do not commit sexual misconduct. If you break the precepts, simply repent, and do your best to keep upholding them.

, The Middle Way is also known as the “Noble Eightfold Path,” which teaches Buddhists to abide by eight elements. Spend time studying all eight:


Right view
Right intention
Right speech
Right action
Right livelihood
Right effort
Right mindfulness
Right concentration

Find a safe place to cast your circle.,
Purify the place where you will cast your circle.,
Physically determine the bounds of your circle, if you want.,
Place all the objects you will be using in your ritual inside the circle.,
Complete the circle.,
Bless the circle.,
State the purpose of the circle.,
Invoke the elements and spirits and deities you wish to work with.,
Complete your ritual.,
Close the circle when you're done: pay respect to whatever deities you invited, thank the elements before you remove their representative objects, and finally undo the casting by casting in reverse.

",How to Cast a Circle," It can be indoors or outdoors, at midnight or early in the morning. There's no perfect place to cast, so don't feel any pressure to hike out to the middle of nowhere if that will make you psychologically uncomfortable. The best place is somewhere you'll feel comforted and at ease, able to commune in the way you wish, and in the appropriate way for whatever ritual or ceremony you hope to perform. If that's your bedroom, basement, or garage, so be it.


Make sure that the place is private and free for as long as you'll need the ceremony. Being interrupted in the middle of a ritual is a frustrating and even dangerous experience.;
, First, purify your location physically by tidying up the spot and making things orderly. If you're outdoors, clear the area of branches, leaves and rocks. Next, cleanse the area spiritually. Meditating, use your hands (or a wand or broom if your practice involves these items) and push negative energy from the spot.


You could also try using a cleansing agent like witch hazel to cleanse the area - a couple of drops in each corner of the room and round the perimeter of the circle should be sufficient.

, Do this by drawing a circle on the floor, sprinkling salt water in a circle, or by laying a cord in a circle (make sure you tie it). Anyhow, the circle is usually as wide as you are tall.


Alternatively, if you're in the outdoors, consider using the elements of nature to create your circle. Create a circle of rocks or other natural elements if it seems appropriate to your ritual or practice.

, Once you start practicing, you're going to want to stay in the circle and not break the connection until your ritual is completed. If you start and you've forgotten a particular candle or totem that's important to you, getting up and hitting ""pause"" isn't an option. Gather everything you'll need to begin your ritual and start preparing for your ritual.


If you're going to offer something to a spirit, remember to include that and everything you'll need to prepare it.
Other popular items to include in rituals include totems, black candles, crystals, knives, bells, bowls of salt and bowls of water. Organize them, whatever they are, to form an altar. Bring a surface to set them on, like a box or crate with a small black tablecloth. The altar should face north, as should you when you're in the circle completing your ritual.

, Place candles or other items at each cardinal direction. Do not light them yet. Some wiccans will choose something that represents Earth in the north, Air in the east, Fire in the south, and Water in the west. Follow whatever procedures are appropriate for the rituals you desire.


Salt, a stone, or a green candle could represent Earth. Incense, broken glass, or a yellow candle could stand in for Air. Water in any receptacle is a fine representation of water, or a blue candle for Water. A red candle or cigarette does nicely for Fire. If you have one, you could also use the Aces in your Tarot deck.

, How you choose to use your circle once its cast is largely up to you, your practice, and your goals. In general, though, you'll want to start by blessing the space and clearing it of negative energy, beginning the invocation of spirits. Some covens are very formal and ritualized in their practice, while some less so. Do what feels natural.


Walk around the circle, lighting the candles, leaving a trail of salt around the boundary. In each cardinal direction, recite an invocation like: ""Blessing upon the creatures and spirits of the North."", Walk around the circle three times, saying: ""Cast the circle thrice about, to keep the evil spirits out.""


""I conjure thee, O Circle of Power, that thou best a meeting place of love and joy and truth; a shield against all wickedness and evil; a boundary between men and the realms of the Mighty Ones; a rampart and protection that shall preserve and contain the power that we shall raise within thee."", Call them to the objects that represent them. Take each of the objects that represent the elements around your circle, filling it with the power of each of them.


Meditate for a while now. Meditation or astral projection might be the main act, or it serves just to shift your consciousness.

, Remember: ""And it harm none, do what ye will."" If you must leave the circle before you are done, cut a doorway. Envision a doorway being cut from the edge of the circle, up, to the side, then down again. Reclose the circle once you're back in.

Develop a morning ritual.,
Practice empathy.,
Practice commonalities.,
Practice relief of suffering.,
Practice the act of kindness.,
Move beyond to practice compassion for those who mistreat us.,
Develop an evening routine.",How to Cultivate Compassion in Your Life," Greet each morning with a ritual. Try this one, suggested by the Dalai Lama: “Today I am fortunate to have woken up, I am alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others, to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings, I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others, I am going to benefit others as much as I can.” Then, when you’ve done this, try one of the practices below.;
, The first step in cultivating compassion, is to develop empathy for your fellow human beings and yourself. Many of us believe that we have empathy, and on some level nearly all of us do. But many times we are centered on ourselves and we let our sense of empathy get rusty. Try this practice: Imagine that a loved one is suffering. Something terrible has happened to him or her. Now try to imagine the pain they are going through. Imagine the suffering in as much detail as possible. After doing this practice for a couple of weeks, you should try moving on to imagining the suffering of others you know, not just those who are close to you.
This means that you should experience the other persons suffering or emotions from that persons frame of reference, meaning as if you are in that persons shoes.


To keep empathy from turning into sympathy, keep your focus on the other person, rather than allowing your empathy to shift your focus to your own experience and memory of suffering., Instead of recognizing the differences between yourself and others, try to recognize what you have in common. At the root of it all, we are all human beings. We need food, and shelter, and love. We crave attention, and recognition, and affection, and above all, happiness. Reflect on these commonalities you have with every other human being, and ignore the differences. One favorite exercise comes from a great article from Ode Magazine — it’s a five-step exercise to try when you meet friends and strangers. Do it discreetly and try to do all the steps with the same person. With your attention geared to the other person, tell yourself:Step 1: “Just like me, this person is seeking happiness in his/her life.”
Step 2: “Just like me, this person is trying to avoid suffering in his/her life.”
Step 3: “Just like me, this person has known sadness, loneliness and despair.”
Step 4: “Just like me, this person is seeking to fulfill his/her needs.”
Step 5: “Just like me, this person is learning about life.”

, Once you can empathize with another person, and understand his humanity and suffering, the next step is to want that person to be free from suffering. This is the heart of compassion — actually the definition of it. Try this exercise: Imagine the suffering of a human being you’ve met recently. Now imagine that you are the one going through that suffering. Reflect on how much you would like that suffering to end. Reflect on how happy you would be if another human being desired your suffering to end, and acted upon it. Open your heart to that human being and if you feel even a little that you’d want their suffering to end, reflect on that feeling. That’s the feeling that you want to develop. With constant practice, that feeling can be grown and nurtured.


A study suggests that the more you meditate on compassion, the more your brain reorganizes itself to feel empathy towards others.

, Now that you’ve gotten good at the fourth practice, take the exercise a step further. Imagine again the suffering of someone you know or met recently. Imagine again that you are that person, and are going through that suffering. Now imagine that another human being would like your suffering to end — perhaps your mother or another loved one. What would you like for that person to do to end your suffering? Now reverse roles: you are the person who desires for the other person’s suffering to end. Imagine that you do something to help ease the suffering, or end it completely. Once you get good at this stage, practice doing something small each day to help end the suffering of others, even in a tiny way. Even a smile, or a kind word, or doing an errand or chore, or just talking about a problem with another person. Practice doing something kind to help ease the suffering of others. When you are good at this, find a way to make it a daily practice, and eventually a throughout-the-day practice.

, The final stage in these compassion practices is to not only want to ease the suffering of those we love and meet, but even those who mistreat us. When we encounter someone who mistreats us, instead of acting in anger, withdraw. Later, when you are calm and more detached, reflect on that person who mistreated you. Try to imagine the background of that person. Try to imagine what that person was taught as a child. Try to imagine the day or week that person was going through, and what kind of bad things had happened to that person. Try to imagine the mood and state of mind that person was in — the suffering that person must have been going through to mistreat you that way. And understand that their action was not about you, but about what they were going through. Now think some more about the suffering of that poor person, and see if you can imagine trying to stop the suffering of that person. And then reflect that if you mistreated someone, and they acted with kindness and compassion toward you, whether that would make you less likely to mistreat that person the next time, and more likely to be kind to that person. Once you have mastered this practice of reflection, try acting with compassion and understanding the next time a person mistreats you. Do it in little doses, until you are good at it. Practice makes perfect.


It will take time to manage your emotions to the extent that you can practice full compassion, but the following techniques will help; in addition, people who practiced them in a study produced 100 percent more DHEA, which is a hormone that counteracts the aging process, and 23 percent less cortisol — the “stress hormone.”Cut-through: Observe your feelings, focusing on your heart. Pretend you're someone outside of the situation, giving yourself advice like ""Relax, it's no big deal."" Imagine your negative feelings getting absorbed and diffused by your heart. This will help you transform rather than repress your negative feelings.Heart lock-in: Quiet your mind and focus your attention on your heart. Tap into feelings that you have towards someone or something you love easily, and try to stay with that feeling for ten or fifteen minutes. Then imagine sending those feelings to yourself and others.You may also want to read How to Forgive.

, It is highly recommended that you take a few minutes before you go to bed to reflect upon your day. Think about the people you met and talked to, and how you treated each other. Think about your goal that you stated this morning, to act with compassion towards others. How well did you do? What could you do better? What did you learn from your experiences today? And if you have time, try one of the above practices and exercises.

Rely on the power of replacing negative thoughts with positive ones.,
Accept and embrace the cliché that failure is a stepping stone to success.,
Practice patience.,
Treat the messed up, overturned karmic experience as a lesson that goes beyond the moment and reveals our character.,
Take strength from bad karma happenings.,
Stay unruffled and turn away from thoughts of revenge.,
Love your enemy.,
Meditate.",How to Flip Your Karma," When you fail to see the point of something any longer or you're fed up with suffering through trying to quit a bad habit, it can be easy to just want to sink into deep negativity. It can be a comfortable, albeit unhelpful, habit to think the worst. Nobody is suggesting you sugarcoat reality but you can definitely recognize negativity for what it is:


Acknowledge that it is just negative thinking; it is not who you are or what is destined for you. It is simply a set of bad thoughts.
Acknowledge the bad thoughts directly. Say hello to them almost, as in ""Hi fear of not doing this well enough; I see you've decided to drop by again"". This isn't trivializing; it's recognizing and naming what your emotions and feelings are creating in your mind.
Replace those negative thoughts with the opposite, positive thought. For example, when you're busy telling yourself that you can't do something, say ""STOP!"", then say ""I can do this!"".
Stopping the flow of negativity thinking and replacing it with more upbeat thoughts is a habit too. Learning it takes a little time but is worth the trouble.;
, It's a cliché because it's true in the majority of instances. You would be hard pressed to find a person who hasn't failed at one time or another, although it's fairly easy to find many a person who covers up the fact! Everyone experiences a fall, slip up or a miss of the mark now and then, no matter how expert, experienced or clever they may be. The secret is to stop treating failure as a reason for giving up or for telling yourself that you'll never make it. The secret is to get up, dust yourself off, perhaps insert a little humor into what has happened and to start all over again (with tweaks refined by what your failure has taught you shouldn't be repeated).


Failure highlights obstacles, errors in thinking and what doesn't work. Bravo for failure showing us the way!
Failure is a teacher without remorse. You will learn how to shift those obstacles, improve your thinking and cease to bang your head against the proverbial brick wall.
Failure teaches you what winning means to you personally. Winning in life is never as ""cut-and-dried"" as winning a sports race. Winning in life is about feeling satisfied, fulfilled and contented. Only you can be the judge of being in these states. Failure helps you to tell the difference.

, When you get frustrated, when someone is difficult, when you begin to lose your patience, practice patience right when it feels the hardest thing to do. Let off some healthy steam about whatever you're going through by talking to a friend, a spouse or a counselor. Avoid letting out anger; anger is a side effect of frustration but it's not something to be indulged because it simply makes things worse. Patience is the art of waiting, waiting for bad and difficult moments in your life to resolve both with and without your input. Recognizing that sometimes the best thing you can do is to stand back and let the way of the world work out things is just as beneficial as knowing when to actively apply yourself to a solution. Patience gives you the space to recognize the best approach forward.


Write poems to yourself, about your life.
Keep a journal and explore your feelings in it. Take out any negative emotions on paper, not on other people.

, Remember that it is well known that how we react under pressure reveals our true self; this is quite contrary to people who say ""I wasn't myself because of the stress"". You are your ultimate self under pressure, so learn the lessons that the pressured you reveals and deal with aspects of your coping that seem to be letting you down.


Apply what you're experiencing and how you're coping to your life's events in general. Figure out what went wrong and why. How did you contribute to it?
How might you change what you did so that when a similar thing happens, you will react differently? Character tests are good and healthy for you. They motivate you to step up to another level, to see if you can meet the challenge. Any time you go through a trying time — see it as a challenge, and try to meet that challenge. And when you do, you’ll feel great about yourself.
Do you need help with any specific issues such as anger, inability to hold back frustration or a tendency to act impetuously? Getting help is a sign of strength and getting such monkeys off your back will improve your karma dramatically.
If you see learning as a wonderful thing, then you can see every mistake as a blessing.

, Bad experiences strengthen you. They strengthen your resolve to improve your approach to an issue or person, they strengthen your ability to bounce back and they strengthen your knowledge––but only if you let them. You could choose to see bad karma moments as being a case of the world out to get you or thinking that other people are always crossing you badly but in doing so, you shift responsibility for caring for yourself onto others and stop taking responsibility for courageous, healthy responsiveness to people and your community.


Difficult moments change us for the better when we tackle them with courage and forbearance. We feel less out of control, less at the mercy of life's events when we do something positive to help ourselves bounce back.

, If someone said to you that they punched a stapler because it stapled them, you'd wonder where their head was at. However, the pettiness and stupidity of such an act is no different when hurting another in our anger, whether it be verbally, emotionally or even physically. We have no right to lose our temper and take it out on other beings; in doing so, we lose all self respect and continue a cycle of harm. If someone else has hurt you, do not return the hurt. Instead:


Be more cautious about their motivations and attitude toward you but do not seek to harm them. They will meet their own karma through their continued negative actions but even that is not for you to decide or worry about.
Make an effort to quash desires for revenge. As with other negative thoughts, acknowledge them as they appear in your mind but release them as soon as acknowledged.
Seek the intervention of an appropriate authority if what someone else has done to you is illegal or immoral. There are always safe and prudent ways to deal with someone who is harming others to this extent and you must not play victim or enable them.
Some people will simply try to wear you down through criticism, name-calling and suggestions that whatever you try, it'll fail. Listen to the message underneath what they're saying––it's usually ""I wanted to be just like you/doing what you're doing but I'm too afraid. So I'd like to stop you from achieving it too and so I think it's okay to scare you away."" In other words, learn to hear the real message and feel compassion for their loss rather than frustration at their attempt to place obstacles before you. Try thanking them for their concern, letting them know you'll take on board whatever they've said and leave it at that. As for name-calling, you can find humorous ways to turn even that around, by acknowledging that perhaps you are a little ""pig-headed"" or ""lazy"" but that you have your own clever workarounds to fix this!
Avoid using force against another. To this say, “Where does it end?” And also remember that you are merely stooping to their level. Rise above the pettiness of others, and become a better human being.

, This is one of life’s greatest challenges. When you harbor anger, hatred or condescension toward another human being, try to swap out the negative projections for love instead. If you succeed, to any degree whatsoever, you will rejoice in this success. Love is a miraculous thing; the one thing that will restore your karma endlessly.

, Meditation clears out the negativity around you, which will in turn help clear bad karma. In addition meditating will help you stay calm and peaceful as you get spiritually connected with the vibrations of the Universe.

Read the Analects or the Meng-Tze.,
Firstly embrace the five bonds of filial piety.,
All bonds are two way, therefore there are actually ten types of love.,
The first bond is parent to child.,
The second bond is Husband to wife.,
The third bond is elder sibling to younger sibling.,
The fourth bond is friend to friend.,
The fifth bond which crosses over to Chung is ruler to ruled.,
For Ruler and ruled you must embrace the mandate of heaven.",How to Practice Confucian Filial Piety," When reading one must remember context, Confucius wrote in the 6th century BC, when China faced major internal strife from various warring factions, this time is known as the six warring kingdoms period. Confucius wished to return to the golden age under the Chou dynasty, when China was moral and united, tranquil and peaceful.;
, The five bonds are the five types of love/respect in Confucianism, similar to the four types of love in Judeo-Christian religions. Consistency and uprightness are extremely important in Confucianism, if you can't follow all of them, find another ideology.

, Confucius says that as a gentlemen or Lady one must show respect/love even if this is not reciprocated though he does state that you should not go near these people once you have discovered their true nature. Note: You do not treat these people any differently, rather you do not associate with them, though there are some exceptions.

, The child must show respect and obedience to their parents, especially the father who is head. In return the parent must show undying love, must protect the child, encourage the child and help development. The child however should only love and respect a parent that fulfills these duties and a father should only care for a child that is obedient.

, Like the parent to child, a husband must be love/respect his wife, trust her, allowing her dominance in areas of the kitchen,cleaning and other household tasks. The husband must also protect the wife and ensure she receives an acceptable standard of living. The wife must be obedient, allowing the husband to be the bread winner, not to enter into politics or monetary affairs. She must also keep the house tidy and the children fed.

, A love stronger than friendship should be between siblings, the elder brother should teach the younger, acting as a tutor who has already been there. The elder brother acts like a nanny in some ways insuring the naive younger brother is not lead astray or makes harmful mistakes. In return the younger brother loves/respects the elder and listens to his wise words. The younger should also be there to help the elder if ever he is in times of need, remember a mouse can help a lion-Aesop.

, Unlike all the other relationship this one is on equal terms and it is necessary to follow Confucius' golden rule, do for others as you would like to be done for you. Confucius means if your friend asks for help you help him, if you ask a friend to do something for you, but you wouldn't do it for him then you're a user. If you'll do something for him, but he won't for you then he is using you, this is a way in which Confucians determine the difference between friends and enemies.

, The ruler like a father with his children, must be benevolent,caring and concerned for the people's welfare. As a ruler he must guard against invaders, ensure people are fed, educated, are healthy, are free and most importantly virtuous/Happy. The ruled must therefore be law abiding, loyal, fight in his armies, work his farms, build his roads and schools and pay taxes. The Hsiao bit is that ruler should be benevolent to the ruled and the ruled should respect their master. However when it comes to Chung, the ruled have a right to overthrow leaders who are bad, incompetent and have lost the mandate of heaven.

, Accept that so long as a ruler is competent and virtuous he has a mandate from heaven to rule and therefore it goes against the highest order to overthrow a virtuous ruler. If he is bad though, he has lost the mandate and can be overthrown.

"
"
Accept that all people, no matter what, are capable of perfection and are teachable as well as improvable.,
Do not chastise people for their mistakes.,
Dedicate yourself to attaining perfection and freedom from ignorance.,
Be polite.,
Love your family (Hsiao).,
Practice righteousness (Yi).,
Be honest (Xin).,
Be benevolent and humane towards others (Jen, pronounced Ren).,
Be loyal to the state (Chung).,
Embrace meritocracy.,
Embrace learning.,
(Optional) Follow ancestral worship, by writing names upon a wall or something of the sort at which you pray and offer homage and respect to.,
(Optional) Worship Tien (also known as Heaven).,
Embrace other religions.",How to Be a Confucian," Confucianism is similar to western Humanism. You should therefore not have a pessimistic view of people, but should always be optimistic. It also means you must never chastise people for their mistakes or their ignorance, but rather show them the way and guide, not force.;
, You should not worry about making mistakes, for mistakes help us by showing us what not to do. Confucius said, ""Be not ashamed of mistakes and thus make them crimes.""

, Like enlightenment in Buddhism, Confucius teaches how man can become a Chun-Tzu or the perfect gentlemen. That man will follow and cultivate virtue and moral perfection, they are best described as six commandments or rules of life, similar to the eightfold path or the ten commandments. However, different sects have varying numbers of commandments, usually 5,6,7,8. Most Confucian teachings have these basic precepts or tenets (all Confucians must follow these precepts):



Li - Ritual propriety and etiquette

Hsiao - Love within the family, love of parents and love of children

Yi - Righteousness

Xin - Honesty and trustworthiness

Jen or Ren - Benevolence, humaneness towards others (this is the highest Confucian virtue)

Chung - Loyalty to the state.

, Li is better referred to as politeness and social etiquette rather than religious ritual. Confucius tried to revive past etiquette. People must therefore act consistent, being polite at all times with no deviation or lowering of standards for the sake of fitting in or out of laxity. Confucianism does have some rituals, though people can be both Confucian and of another religion like Buddhism or Taoism, they usually follow the other religion's rituals.

, Every Confucian should love their parents and their parents should love them, unconditionally, no matter what happens. There are five bonds of Hsiao which every Confucian must follow:


Ruler to Ruled
Father to Son
Husband to Wife
Elder Brother to Younger Brother
Friend to Friend.

, Righteousness should be practiced by every Confucian, it is the moral disposition to do good, people should always do what is right, which is why bravery and wisdom are often associated with Yi as it takes a wise man to know good from evil and a brave man to carry it out despite fear of death, imprisonment or humiliation.

, All people should be honest and trustworthy, however Confucian Xin goes further, primarily it is integrity, one should be someone who is respectable. Xin is a major feature of the Chun-Tzu and the ruler should also have Xin, if he has Xin you must be loyal to him as part of Chung and Hsiao, though Confucius allows Citizens to overthrow rulers without Xin. Confucians are never allowed to lie, though there is a grey area when it come to white lies, so Xin and Jen to conflict in some respects.

, This is the highest Confucian virtue and forms the golden rule of Confucius, 'do for others what you would like to be done to you'. This is not the same as treat others as you would wish to be treated, though similar. If you want your neighbour to cut your grass are you willing to cut his grass for him? Jen is closely associated with the precepts of Li and Yi.

, The citizen should be humble, productive and obedient, the ruler should therefore be humane, just and kind to his people, though still maintaining order (similar to Plato's Philosopher kings in The Republic). Confucius allowed Citizens to overthrow rulers who were incompetent or evil, this could be considered the first avocation of a form of democracy. Therefore you have a duty to be loyal and the ruler a duty to be just.

, Meritocracy is the principle that the best, most hardworking and able people should be rewarded and the worst, laziest and least able should be overlooked.

, Confucius once said, ""Ignorance is the night of the mind, but a night without moon or stars."" Ignorance is the greatest evil there is, so knowledge and wisdom are often placed among the six virtues above. Confucius also said, ""Ignorance is the night of the mind, but a night without moon and star."" Broker no superstition and search for truth, there are parallels with Socrates here.

, Paper money and incense are burnt on special holidays.

, Tien is roughly the equivalent to Western notion of Providence.

, Do not be afraid to be both Buddhist, Taoist or Christian and a Confucian at the same time. Confucianism is a way of life and can easily accompany other religious beliefs. Confucianism goes well with Buddhism and sometimes Taoism. In fact, it is quite difficult for Buddhist and Confucian numbers to be calculated due to the large amount of overlap between the two.

Gather your coins.,
Write down your question.,
Toss the coins.,
Assign a number.,
Learn the meaning of the numbers in the I Ching.,
Repeat the process six times total.,
Consult a guidebook.,
Find an online list of hexagram interpretations.,
Enter your results into a hexagram calculator.",How to Consult the I Ching Using 3 Coins," You can consult the I Ching with whatever coins you have handy. Pennies are a good option. If you want to add significance to the process, you can use coins minted in years that mean something, such as your birth year. You can also purchase old Chinese coins if you want to add authenticity to the process.If you consult the I Ching on a regular basis, it is good to keep these three coins especially for this purpose. You can store them in a small pouch so they won’t get mixed up with your everyday change.;
, The I Ching is intended for gaining some clarity about a specific dilemma that you are facing, so it is important to have a clear and simple question. Write down your question and continue to look at it and think about it as you perform the consultation.It is better to use an open-ended question versus a yes/no question. For example, “Will I become rich?” might not yield as clear results as “What will my finances look like this year?”
You also don’t want to think and write a complex question with too many parts. Rather than writing, “Would it be better to travel to Bermuda for my honeymoon or should I save the money to put a down payment on a house?” you could try “What will happen if I travel to Bermuda for my honeymoon?”

, You can shake the coins in your hand briefly and then gently toss them onto a smooth surface. It might work well to throw the coins into the lid of a box so that the coins do not roll all over the place.The exact method you use for this step is up to you. As long as you don’t look at the coins to try to get them to fall in a certain way. You could even shake them in your hand and simply lay your hand flat on the table letting them fall.

, Each toss of the coins will add up to a certain amount. Assign a value of three to any coins that are heads and two to any coins that are tails. Your roll will add up to 6, 7, 8, or 9. Three heads add up to 9. Two heads and 1 tail add up to 8. One head and two tails add up to 7. Three tails add up to 6., Each number corresponds to a few things in the I Ching system. The sum of the numbers designated to each side of the coin determines the yin or yang of the line, whether it is changing or unchanging, and whether it is a broken or unbroken line.


6 (3 tails) is considered a changing yin and is drawn as a broken line with an X in the middle. 9 (3 heads) is considered a changing yang and is drawn as a solid line with a circle in the middle.
7 (2 tails, 1 head) is considered an unchanging yang, and is drawn as a solid line. 8 (2 heads, 1 tail) is considered an unchanging yin and is drawn as a broken line.

, Use the coins to come up with six lines, which are called your hexagram. Each time, throw the coins, record the number and the line type. Put the first line as the bottom and draw each successive line above the previous one.For some I Ching guides, you can use the total “score” that your numbers added up to to find the hexagram value, rather than the line pattern. If you get six 6s, this would add up to 36. Six 9s would add up to 63.

, There are 63, or in some systems 64, variations of the hexagram pattern. If you have an I Ching book, you can read the meaning of your specific hexagram. There have been dozens of translations of the ancient text. The Wilhelm-Baynes translation is one of the most influential.


If you don’t already have a copy, and you don’t want to buy one, visit your local library and check the book out or consult while you are at the library.
The basic way of interpreting your hexagram is matching up the pattern with the list of possible patterns and reading the description of what that pattern represents.

, Since the I Ching is an ancient text, you can find many websites with comprehensive lists of possible hexagram variations. These will offer interpretations of what the meaning of your hexagram could be.The I Ching is not meant to give exact answers to your questions, so it is okay to trust an online I Ching guide.

, Some websites allow you to input the results of each of your coin tosses by selecting the line that showed up. Once you enter all six lines, it will locate the proper hexagram for you and give you the meaning.For example, if your hexagram numbers added up to 45, you would enter that and receive the interpretation of “Meeting” from the I Ching.

Remember that Hinduism is a very open-minded religion.,
Choose the form of God you wish to worship.,
Pray and sincerely believe in the form of Parambrahman (God) you have chosen.,
Read some of the holy scriptures of Hinduism.,
Try to understand some of the tenets of Hinduism.,
Karma is another tenet of Hinduism which means that you are responsible for whatever wrong you do, and you will be punished unless you repent sincerely.,
Respect other religions and do not convert to any religion or convert anyone to your religion.,
Be peaceful and loving to all people, and try to consume less meat.",How to Be a Better Hindu," You can practice this faith anyway you want. There is no prescribed ritual in Hinduism or any particular way to worship God. Our scriptures clearly state that while God is one, he has many forms and one can worship him in any way and in any religion.;
, It depends on which God gives you peace. If Krishna gives you peace, then worship Krishna, if Shiva gives you peace, then worship Shiva! It is your decision. You may even worship God in Himself like the Brahmo Samajis or Arya Samajis, if you wish. It is all up to you.

, You may perform puja for Him, or you may worship Him in your way. Call upon him even when you are not in distress.

, The Bhagvad Gita and the Upanishads are good examples. But remember though, that while some scriptures show God commanding people to kill, this is not a justification of murder. Hinduism is a religion of peace. What God is trying to say is that you should kill the Devil inside you and become righteous.

, Reincarnation is one, and it has also been proven scientifically. Hindus believe that a person is born again and again after death, and to escape this cycle one must attain moksha (salvation). Some people say that to attain moksha you must leave your family. This is not true. You can attain salvation, even if you are a family man, but you must overcome the sins - Kaam (lust), krodh (anger), lobh (greed), maya (illusion or attachment to worldly things and relations) and abhimaan (ego). If you do not overcome these you cannot attain salvation.

, God is All-Forgiving and All-Merciful.

, Hinduism is not a special-class religion. It is equal to all other religions be it Islam, Baha'i Faith, Christianity, Buddhism or any other faith. Respect others and their point of view.

, Remember, animal sacrifice is a heretic's act and has no place in Hinduism, though some Hindus still practice it. Do not consume beef, for cow is considered sacred. In fact, it is better to avoid meat of the larger animals, or even better, eat no meat at all.

It’s vital to begin your entry into this religion through an appreciation of its foundation elements. The Trimūrti is a concept in Hinduism ""in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver and Shiva the destroyer or transformer."" However in most Puranic texts, Brahma's creative activity depends on the presence and power of a higher god.Traditionally, Hinduism prescribed a strictly ordered social varna system with 4 main groups: Brahmin (priests), Kshatriyas (nobles and warriors or leaders), Vaishyas (craftsmen and farmers or profit-minded), and Shudras (skilled/unskilled laborers). With possible myth, a fifth “untouchable” class which is said to be outside of the Varna system, doesn't exist. Hindu religion doesn't divide people into categories and classes. The Varna system defines one's varna quotient and one can possess all varna quotient with one or more prominent.Karma refers to a cause-and-effect system where one’s deeds and acts influence what happens in life. Each person creates their own destiny through their actions in life: if one conducts good deeds, they will reap good consequences later on in life.Dharma refers to God’s divine law which orders the cosmos. When we follow dharma, our souls are brought into harmony and advanced towards God, truth, and righteousness.Reincarnation, also known as punarjanma, is a cyclic process of birth, life, death, and rebirth. Instead of an afterlife, as is found in Judeo-Christian religions, Hindus believe that the immortal soul continues to exist after the death of the body, and is reborn into subsequent new bodies. The actions that one completes in life (their karma) influence how the souls is reborn (for example, as a lower order life-form). Once one resolves or “perfects” their karma, the soul breaks free from the reincarnation cycle.Hindus also traditionally believe in Chakras. There are 7 Chakras, or energy centers, located throughout the body and connected to one’s spirit. Believers can purify or open up their Chakras through yoga mediation.
While there is a wide array of perspectives on the “Divine” as well as a host of deity figures, all Hindus worship a Supreme Being who is unchanging, all-present, timeless, formless, and pure love. ;
, More than most major religions, Hinduism accepts and even celebrates pluralism. It is open to multiple types of practices and traditions.


The Hindu phrase, “May good thoughts come to us from all sides,” reflects this open and accepting nature. It indicates that all can (and should) seek out enlightenment from multiple sources and perspectives rather than from one dogma.
Hindus do not ascribe to any one creed, and do not believe that there is any one singular view, reality, or way to reach God.
Contemporary Hindus tend to practice tolerance and acceptance as an important religious virtue, rather than being exclusionary or narrow-minded.

, There are 4 main denominations within Hinduism. Though each have their differences, they also share a common purpose: to further the soul's journey towards its divine destiny.Under Shaivism, Hindus worship the Supreme God as Shiva, (“the Compassionate One”). Shaivite Hindus value self discipline, follow a guru, worship in a temple, and practice yoga in order become one with Shiva.
Followers of Shaktism, worship the Supreme as the Divine Mother, Shakti or Devi, and use chants, magic, yoga, and other rituals to channel cosmic forces and awaken one’s spine Chakra.
In Vaishnavism, worshipers seek the Supreme as Lord Vishnu and His incarnations, Krishna and Rama. Vaishnavites are deeply devotional and invested in saints, temples, and scriptures.
Followers of Smartism, worship the Supreme in one of six forms: Ganesha, Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu, Surya and Skanda. They accept all the major Hindu Gods and are thus known as the most liberal or nonsectarian Hindus. They follow a philosophical, meditative path and strive after oneness with God through understanding.

, These texts were written at different times in Hindu history and offer different perspectives on Hindu tenets.The Bhagavad Gita (usually considered part of larger book, Mahabharata), is a central text of Hinduism. It is structured as a philosophical dialog between the deity Krishna and the warrior Arjuna. The Bhagavad Gita is consider to be the most popular and accessible of the sacred texts and is the ideal book to start with as a beginner interested in Hinduism.The Vedas are another primary Hindu text. There are 4 books in the ‘’‘Vedas’’’(the Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda and Atharva Veda) which contain hymns, incantations, rituals, a unique view of everyday life in ancient India.The Upanishads detail how the soul (Atman) can be united with the ultimate truth (Brahman). This is accomplished through contemplation and mediation, as well as establishing good karma.The Puranas offer a narrative history of the Universe from creation to destruction, as well as tales of kings, heroes, and demigods., In the Hindu pantheon, God takes on many forms and appears as several deities. While it is commonly stated that there are 330 million Hinduism deities, there are some main or more recognizable ones that you should try to learn. Ganesha (elephant god) is the son of Shiva and considered to be the god of success.

Brahma is the creator of all reality.

Vishnu is the preserver of order.

Shiva is the God of Gods
Saraswati""' is the Goddess of knowledge, music, arts and wisdom and consort of Brahma.

Lakshmi is the Goddess of all wealth and consort of Vishnu.

Parvati/Durga is the Goddess of Power, strength and valour and consort of Shiva

, The first step in completing an “ethical conversion” to Hinduism is to join a Hindu community. Search the internet for Hindu temples in your area and stop by to learn more about them and their services.
The goal of joining a Hindu community is to become accepted by your local practicing members, as well as gain their help in completing the daily and constant rituals (see section on Practicing Hinduism).
If there are no Hindu temples in your area, you can always join an online community, so that you can at least connect with fellow followers virtually .You can also call a priest over and make a praying area for pujas in a small part of the house.

, The next step towards conversion is to create a point-counterpoint list of the beliefs help by your previous religion (if you had one) and the belief of Hindu. This exercise will help you take stock of what you will be leaving behind and embracing through your conversion.

, An important element of Hindu philosophy is detachment, and you can start to practice this by leaving behind mentors and sources of influence from your former life, especially if they are not supportive of your conversion decision.Converts from former religions are encouraged to share their desires to join Hinduism with their past religious mentors, and allow their mentors to try to change their mind.
Converts are to request a letter of severance from their past religious mentors, indicating that they have terminated their involvement with that religion in order to become a Hindu.

, Coverts are asked to perform a legal name change and take on a Hindu name as part of their conversion process.


Hindu names are usually based on Sanskrit or Indian name, and are especially drawn from Hindu deities and mythologies.
Technically, one is asked to change both their first and last name, and to make these legal changes on all their documents (driver’s license, passport, work documents, etc.)
Popular Hindu first names for boys include Aarav (Peaceful, wisdom, musical note), Vivaan (First rays of the sun, full of life), and Aditya (the sun). For girls, popular first names include Saanvi (Goddess Lakshmi), Aanya (grace), and Aadhya (Goddess Durga)., This ceremony, also called a nama karan sanskara, is performed at the temple and is where the new Hindu name is conferred, vows are taken, and the certificate of conversion is signed.

, After all the previous steps are completed, the new convert is asked to publish a 3-day announcement in their local newspaper proclaiming their name change and conversion. This announcement should be copied and saved for proof of conversion. , To celebrate your home coming into the Hinduism, a traditional vratyastoma ceremony is thrown in your honor., Hindus believe that all life is sacred and therefore should be loved and revered. As a practicing Hindu, try to be sensitive to all life forms, big and small.Practice nonviolence (ahimsa) in thought, word and deed. In other words, try not to be hurtful or harmful to other living things in the things you do, say, or think.
Consider becoming vegetarian. Many Hindus, though not all, practice vegetarianism as a way to show care and respect for animal life.Though all animals are considered sacred in Hindu culture, cows are especially revered as holy. According to an ancient Hindu story, the original cow, Mother Surabhi, was a treasure churned from the cosmic ocean.Beef is never eaten in Hindu cuisine, though the 5 byproducts of cows -- milk, curd, butter (ghee), urine, and dung -- are revered as sacramental objects.
It is considered an important and holy duty (a dharma) to feed animals. Many Hindu households will ritualistically offer food to ants, for example, or offer sweet delicacies to elephants on special holidays., These daily duties, or homages, are performed by every Hindu householder.Brahma Yajna involves paying homage to Brahman by teaching and studying scriptures.

Deva Yajna involves paying homage to Gods and universe elementals by building fire.

Pitri Yajna involves paying homage to the ancestors through the offering of water.

Nara Yajna involves paying respects to human guests, helping the poor and downtrodden

Bhuta Yajna involves paying homage to beings by offering food to all creatures.

, In addition to the 5 daily homages listed above, Hindus practice 5 karmas, or pious acts, as listed below.


One should pursue righteousness (dharma) and live a virtuous life of purity, respect, self-control, detachment, selflessness, and striving towards truth.
One should partake in pilgrimages (tirthayatra) where you regularly visit holy persons, temples, and sacred pilgrimage sites. Such journeys provide freedom from routine life and thereby freshen the mind. Pilgrimages also help to create a sense of togetherness in the family, since all members undertake the pilgrimages together.
One should keep the Holy Days (Uthsava) by participating in festivals, celebrating holy days in the home or temple, and observe fasts. Hindu sages tell us that occasional fasting prevents bodily diseases, restores the body's healing power, and heals the mind by removing lust, anger, hatred, pride, and jealousy.
One should perform the sacraments (samskaras) as outlined in the scriptures and that mark an individual's passage through life.
One should proclaim that “God is in all” (Sarva Brahma) and look for God in all beings., Puja is the central act of Hindu worship.


Puja can take place be in a temple setting or at home.
In puja, one worships a Hindu god by bathing a statue/reliquary of it in milk, curds, honey, butter, and water before dressing it in rich fabrics and anointing it with jewelry, flowers, sandalwood, and incense., In addition to these traditional practices, consider following other Hindu acts which are becoming increasingly popular in mainstream culture. Ayurveda is an ancient Hindu system of holistic healing and wellness that is finding new popularity in the west today.Hatha Yoga has been adapted from Hindu practice as a way to bring meditative movement to the masses.Saying the “Namaste” greeting while bringing together both palms of the hands before the heart has become popularized as a humble way of greeting people."

To access the Akashic Records, you need to release resistance.,
Meditation


For most people meditation allows them to focus and raise their vibration, while dismissing their surroundings for a more intimate experience.,
Tell the universe what you would like to channel or know, and then you simply allow it to flow through you.,
After accessing the Akashic Records, trust yourself.",How to Access Akashic Records,"


In a dimension that follows the law of attraction, you cannot manifest that which you want if you have a resistance towards it.
Think of the Akashic Records as a giant library, and each floor is another dimension, and The Akashic Records corresponds to each dimension individually, hence the different floors.
You must also remember that every being has access to the Akashic Records, and in fact most access it every day;
,
This step can be optional if you so choose.

, This is the Akashic Records being accessed.


What I mean by allowing is alignment. Alignment is working yourself into the very frequency of the thing you are searching for.

,


Doubt is a form of resistance. And just like muscles, training takes practice.
You may also want to write down what you have just accessed, if at all possible. Even if you're doubting it.

, Like, for example, holding the door open for someone behind you or picking up a dropped pencil.

, They may not know, but karma always knows.

, You know, those tins at the cashier that donate to the children's hospital and such? Think of all the good that money does. If everyone donated their spare change to charity tins, the world would be a better place.

, Older and younger people know lots of cool stuff you probably don't, and you'll make them feel good too.

, You've seen that commercial. You can take them into most stores and they'll give you 5 cents a pop can. You can even give that money to a charity tin! Two good deeds in one day. Doesn't that make you feel better?

, When people talk about their problems, it makes them feel better. Don't offer advice. Don't give opinions. Just listen.

, If you simply say hello to that shy girl at the back of the class, if you are kind to those you aren't a huge fan of, if you let someone use some of your lunch money and not ask the next day for the money you lent, if you're at the store and see a $0.50 pin your friend would like and buy it: These are the things that help make you a good person. Not only will you get karma points, but you will have a better reputation.

, It's like smiling with your voice. It makes people feel better and more confident. But don't just compliment - be thoughtful in finding something you truly appreciate or adore, and mean what you say.

Sit on the floor or in a chair.,
Put your hands on your lap.,
Focus all your attention on breathing.,
Notice – and release – other sensations and thoughts.,
Start slowly and increase your meditation.",How to Do Indian Meditation1," Find a place where you can sit comfortably for at least ten minutes. It could be indoors or outside. What matters most, however, is that it is quiet and free from distracting noise like music, television, or people talking.Not all noise is bad in the Vipassana tradition. Ambient sound like cars or the ticking of a clock can actually be points for you to focus your mindfulness.
Ideally, wear loose clothing and remove your shoes.
Sit on the floor or on a pillow. You can take a number of postures like the half-lotus, full lotus, or cross-legged. Make sure that you are upright, with an unsupported and straight spine.
If you have back pain, it is also OK to sit erect in a chair.Your posture should be upright, but not too tense. You will want your mind and body to be relaxed, while the effort to remain upright should energize your meditation.;
, Now, place your hands one on top of the other on your lap, palms facing up. Traditionally, your right hand should rest on top of the left. It may also be helpful for beginners to close their eyes.Try not to clench your hands or make fists.
Closed eyes will help you concentrate. But concentration is not key to Vipassana meditation and you may find it best to open them if, as sometimes happens, you see disturbing images.

, Turn your attention to the rhythm of your inhalation and exhalation. Some people find it helpful to focus on the rise and fall of their abdomens, for example, an inch or two above the navel. Follow this motion with your mind, from beginning to end.If you’re having trouble following the rise and fall of your abdomen, place your hand atop it.
You might also try focusing on the feeling of air as it passes through your nostrils and touches the skin on your upper lip. This practice is a bit more advanced.“Sharpen your attention” to these movements. Be aware of the sensations involved from start to finish. Don’t try to split the act into parts but experience it as one continuous motion., While you are meditating, focus on the “primary object” of your attention, i.e. your breathing. If your mind wanders to a “secondary object,” though, like a thought, a sound, or a feeling, focus on that object for a moment.Don’t resist secondary objects. The idea instead is to let them move past you. Pause for a second or two and give them abstract mental notes. If you hear a barking dog, label it “hearing.” If you feel an insect bite, label it “feeling.”Once you have noted an object, let it go and return to the primary object of your breathing. Noting thus allows you be aware of the surrounding world without being attached. The sensations should rise and pass over you.
This detachment is supposed to help you appreciate the impermanence of the world, and the emptiness of self.

, How long should you try to meditate? There’s no right answer, except that some is better than none at all. However, aiming for 15 minutes a day at first is a doable goal. Work up from there.Slowly lengthen the time you meditate by about 5 minutes per day each week, until you reach 45 minutes.
There will be days when you’re too busy to put in 45 minutes of meditation. That’s OK. But try to set aside some time, however short.

Accept the consequences of your actions.",How to Confess," A confession should ideally be a private, intimate conversation between you and whoever you've affected with your actions. Don't invite more people than you need to - a confession should be a humbling affair, not a chance for you to perform for an audience. Organize a small, in-person get-together with the person(s) you've done wrong to. You can be as direct as you like in your invitation. There's nothing wrong with simply saying, ""I have a confession to make. When can we meet?"" Try not to make a joke about this, laughing maybe taken as an offense and will ruin the confession


Give yourself some privacy. Confessions can, unfortunately, cause emotions to flare. Don't open yourself or your confessor up to embarrassment by, for example, confessing in a crowded restaurant.;
, For much of our lives, we project certain facades and cultivate certain self-images that reflect how we want to be seen by other people. A confession is no time to worry about these things. Realize that a sincere confession reveals the inner ""you."" You can't make a good confession from a false position of superiority. You're acknowledging your own imperfection, which, for many people, is an especially difficult, intimate task. Any attempts to remain ""cool"" or aloof will make you seem insincere. Be ready to shed any pretenses that you normally maintain.


Here's an example of a confession that sounds disingenuous: ""Hey, Frank, I broke your trumpet. Sorry! Guess I don't know my own strength!"" This confession doesn't seem to come from a place of sincere regret - by trying to keep the mood light, the speaker sacrifices the integrity of his confession. A better approach would be something like: ""Hey, Frank. Listen, I have some bad news. I accidentally broke your trumpet. I'm so sorry. I know how important it was to you. ""
We don't only maintain facades when we deal with other people. We also routinely lie to ourselves about our true motivations. Be completely open and honest with your internal thoughts - why did you do the bad things you did? Don't make any excuses for yourself if you don't have any.

, This is the central purpose of your confession - to reveal that you've done wrong. Be direct and to the point. Tell the people you have gathered with that you've made a mistake that's hurt them. Tell them that you feel bad about what you've done and that you want forgiveness. Calmly and clearly explain what you did, how you've hurt them, and why you're sorry.


Don't beat around the bush. If you're confessing for saying nasty about a friend behind his or her back, don't try to ease into the subject by, for instance, talking about how catty the characters in the movie Mean Girls are. It's much better to just say, ""I was mad that you didn't invite me to go camping, so I told Jen that you hate her. I'm really, really sorry. It was seriously petty of me to ruin your friendship.""
Be prepared to weather the anger or grief of the people you've wronged. If you've seriously hurt someone, don't be surprised if they react to your confession by getting angry, crying, or shouting. The emotions surrounding a confession can be very painful. Know that, no matter how bad things get during a confession, by coming clean you're making things better in the long run than if you had allowed this person to continue without knowing the truth about things.

, ""Confession"" implies that the knowledge of your wrongdoing is a secret. So, when you make a confession, you may also need to explain the true course of events surrounding your wrongdoing, especially if you've previously lied about what's happened. This is extremely important if someone else has taken the blame for your mistake or misdeed. You owe it to everyone involved to make sure they know the truth, even if the truth is painful.


For instance, if you sat in silence as a classmate took the blame for the senior prank that you planned, when you confess to the principal, to exonerate the innocent party (your classmate) and to ensure that the guilty party (you) receive justice, you'll need to correct the ""official"" version of events.

, By confessing to someone, we lower ourselves before them. A confession is no time to be stubborn or prideful. Don't try to paint your actions as somehow noble or well-intended if they weren't. Don't excuse yourself if you don't deserve it. Don't use a confession as an opportunity to subtly build yourself up or put the person you've wronged down. Acknowledge your wrongdoing with humble dignity.


Never blame your victim while you're confessing. If you've ""borrowed"" a little money out of someone's purse, don't say something like ""I'm sorry I took your money, but I only did it because you wouldn't buy me those shoes I liked.""

, Be humble and direct. A line like ""I'm really, really sorry. I hope you can forgive me"" works fine. This should be what you want out of a confession - to get the assurance that you're forgiven in the heart of the person(s) you've hurt. This gives you a sense of closure and internal peace. It also allows you to begin to move on because when you're forgiven you know that you're ""done"" with the confession process. After you're forgiven, any additional guilt will have no purpose, so try to move on.


Unfortunately, in some cases, the people you've wronged might not forgive you. If you've hurt someone multiple times or you've done something especially egregious, they're justified in withholding their forgiveness. In this case, it's not enough to say you're sorry - show them that you're truly repentant by changing your behavior.

, You've confessed and (hopefully) been forgiven. How do you move forward? A good first step is to ask for advice on to what to do next. For instance, the person you hurt might give you instructions on how to make things up to them. They might also tell you who else you need to confess to. They might even tell you how your personal relationship has changed. If you've done something serious, your relationship with the people you've hurt may be subject to new rules or boundaries. For instance, if you've used your access to someone's sensitive information to spread gossip, you may no longer be trusted with secrets. Honor these new boundaries to show you're truly sorry and to speed your journey back to normal levels of trust.


Remember that confession doesn't ""wipe the slate clean."" Don't return to your old bad behavior. A confession should be used not just for forgiveness, but also for growth, so be sure to move forward, away from your bad deeds, not backward.

, If you've done something wrong with serious consequences, like if you've committed a crime, you should make your initial confession to a law enforcement representative or another appropriate authority. Cooperating fully with the authorities also serves a practical purpose - it can be used to reduce the length or severity of your punishment.


Never try to lie to a judge or police officer to avoid a confession. This is a crime. By making these lies, you make your eventual punishment even worse.

, It can be very, very hard to confess to someone you're romantically involved with. No one wants to hurt or disappoint the people they love. Unfortunately, by not confessing, you are hurting your S.O. They just don't know they're being hurt. Confessions within the context of a romantic relationship can be very difficult and painful, so, if you're hesitating, motivate yourself to start the confession process by thinking of your confession as an act of love. You're showing that you love your partner by telling them the truth, even if the truth damages their opinion of you.


This being said, don't twist your love for your partner into an excuse for your actions. ""I kept this information from you because I love you"" isn't a justification for your behavior. If you haven't been honest to your partner, you've hurt them. Period.

, In a relationship, it's even more important than normal that your partner knows exactly how you've hurt them. Because you (presumably) still care about your partner, it can be tempting to avoid hurting his or her feelings by lying about what you've done to make your wrongdoing seem less serious than it is or somehow well-intentioned. Don't do this. Your partner deserves to know the truth, even if it's a painful truth. This will also open your relationship up to future heartbreak, should your lie be discovered. Be honest and tell the whole story of your wrongdoing.


While it's very important to be forthcoming about what you've done, it's possible to cause unnecessary pain by giving too much detail in your confession. If, for instance, you've committed an act of infidelity, you should be honest about who was involved and when the event occurred, but you shouldn't go into a detailed play-by-play of the day's events unless you're asked to - this information can be very painful for your partner to hear.
Think of a romantic confession as a particularly difficult way of updating your partner on the state of your relationship. You can't have a healthy relationship that's open to growth if both partners have different ideas about what's happening in the relationship.

, There's a reason that we say that ""trust is the foundation of a relationship."" A relationship without some degree of trust isn't possible. We can't spy on our partners 24/7, so we trust them to be honest about what they've done and what they've said. We also trust our partners to be open about the way that they feel. If you've been concealing your actions or feelings from your partner, you've damaged their ability to trust you. A sincere apology may, in time, help you regain that trust.

, In addition to apologizing for violating your partner's trust, you should also devote a little time to apologizing for the fact that you've reduced the happiness, openness, and overall health of the relationship you share. You have, in a sense, damaged something that you both own. Making a confession to your partner is like coming clean about ruining a project you both worked on together, but with very high emotional stakes.


The time after a confession can be tense and awkward for both partners. It can even, depending on the severity of your wrongdoing, be marked by real sadness. When you apologize for damaging your relationship, it can be wise to apologize for the hard times your confession will cause in the near future.

, Confessing to wrongdoing is always a healthier, more honest thing to do that keeping your actions a secret. However, a confession can change a relationship. It may change the way your partner and you think about each other. It may change the the amount that you trust each other. In serious cases, your relationship may even be damaged beyond repair. Accept these changes to your relationship. Confessions open up the path of healing and allow you to start working past your mistakes, but they don't absolve you of the consequences of your actions.


Let's hypothetically say that you make a sincere confession to your partner about an act of infidelity you've committed. Suppose your partner says that s/he would like to ""take a break"" from your relationship. Even if this is very difficult for you, you need to humbly honor your partner's wish. After all, the relationship is as much your partner's as it is yours. If one partner wants to end a relationship or make a serious change to it, the other partner has no right to force him or her not to.

Everyone placed any wood or flammable scrap materials they had on top of the log, and they’d end up with a large pile of wood ready to burn. Gather enough wood and combustible material to create a medium to large sized pile for your Holika bonfire., On the eve of Holi, place a combustible statue of Holika, the sister of the demon king Hiranyakashipu, in the pile of firewood. Burning Holika in the bonfire symbolizes the triumph of good over evil because she is said to have tried to kill Prahlad, the son of Hiranyakashipu and a devoted follower of Lord Narayana., Use a fire starter like kerosene to pour a little on the wood to help get the fire going. Light a match and throw it into the pile of wood to start the fire.Make sure to stand far from the wood when trying to start the fire so you don’t get hurt.
Gather friends, family, or the community together to watch the Holika bonfire light.

, While you watch the bonfire, chant the Rakshoghna Mantras. These mantras are found in the Rig Veda, an ancient Indian collection of the Vedic Sanskrit hymns. Enjoy the fire by dancing around it and chanting the mantras to ward off evil spirits.You can find the text for these mantras online or by purchasing a book of the Rig Veda.

, The day of the Holi celebration, people celebrate the end of winter and the coming of spring by showering each other with bright colored powder and water. You can buy gulal, which is a natural red-orange color made from the flowers of palash. The flowers are dried and ground to create a powdered color. You can also buy abeer, which is small crystal chips of mica that create a sparkly silver color. People frequently combine the two to create a fun red-orange sparkly colored powder.You can also find colors of yellow and green to buy in markets or online.
There are many more colors available that are made from rice flour and natural colorings. Look online to buy Holi colors for the next festival.
Red, yellow, green and violet are some most used colors.

, Smear the colored powder onto your friends and family to make them colorful and commence the festival of colors. The colors are non toxic and won’t stain so have fun smearing them on your family members' arms, legs, back, and hair., A pichkari is a water gun to squirt colored water from as a fun way to celebrate Holi. Mix some of the colored powder with water and then add it to the pichkari. Use the pichkari to cover people with colored water and enjoy playing in the bright colors.Pichkaris are especially fun for kids to celebrate Holi with.
They make great gifts for kids in preparation for the Holi celebration.

, A dholak is a hand drum that is played at celebrations such as Holi. Enjoy the celebration by dancing in the colors to the beat of the dholak. Sing Holi songs and let your body move to the beat while you celebrate the coming of spring., A great way to celebrate Holi is with delicious traditional Indian meals. There are many different traditional meals for Holi depending on what region you are in, but here are some popular foods and drinks you can try.One Holi staple is Thandai, a traditional creamy milk drink flavored with nuts and spices, it often has some herbs that might make you feel dizzy. You may drink it after you've enjoyed together.
Gujia or Ghughra is a sweet dish which you will enjoy.
Puran Poli is a popular sweet dish typically eaten in Maharashtra. It is a sweet flatbread with a buttery taste and a stuffing of lentils and spices.
Dahi Wada is a tasty snack food made from lentil fritters soaked in Indian yogurt.

, One older tradition of Holi is the breaking of the pot. First you string up a ceramic pot of buttermilk in a street. It is said that Lord Krishna was very fond of buttermilk and would steal it from the houses in the village. To hide it from young Lord Krishna, the women would hang the buttermilk high up in the streets., The men in the town form a human pyramid by balancing on each others backs or shoulders. The pyramid should be tall enough for the person on top to reach the pot of buttermilk.Be careful balancing on another person’s back or shoulders. This can be extremely tricky and requires a lot of balance.

, When the pyramid becomes tall enough for the top man to reach the pot, he should break the pot of buttermilk with his head. This is what is traditionally done to celebrate the breaking of the pot, but you could also break it with your hands if you can’t use your head.

, The women of the town surround the men in the pyramid. They have fun singing traditional Holi songs and throwing buckets of water. The women should enjoy singing and dancing around the men in celebration of Holi., At the end of the evening when the celebration of the colors has subdued, many people like to visit friends or family to enjoy the evening. Holi is a celebration meant to bring together the community so it culminates with coming together and relishing in the day’s festivities., It’s customary to bring sweets to exchange with your friends and family when you visit them. People bring traditional Indian delicacies to enjoy together creating a great end to the celebration.Gujia, Coconut Burfi, Rava Ladoo, or Carrot Halwa would be great sweets to bring.

, Some towns organize large Holi get togethers in the evening, but you can also just enjoy visiting at a person’s home. Exchange hugs and well wishes with friends and family to celebrate Holi and the spirit of brotherhood. Continue singing songs and enjoying dances as the evening winds down. Holi truly is an all day celebration."

Understand God's role in consecration.,
Dedicate your heart to God.,
Reflect on your motives.,
Repent.,
Be baptized.,
Separate yourself from the evils of the world.,
Draw closer to God.,
Stay committed.",How to Consecrate Yourself," In a general sense, the term “consecration” refers to the act of dedicating oneself to a specific purpose or intention. To “consecrate” yourself essentially means to wholly dedicate yourself to something of greatest important.When spoken plainly, however, ""consecration"" refers to the act of setting yourself aside and dedicating yourself to a deity, and that deity almost always refers to the God of Christianity.
The term can also be used to refer to ordination into a sacred office. For most believers, however, it only refers to a basic, personal act of dedication.
To “consecrate” something, one makes that thing holy or sacred. In that sense, the act of consecration can also be defined as the act of being made sacred.;
, As a religious practice, consecration dates as far back as the Old Testament. There are discussions about consecration in both halves of the Bible, in fact, and the practice is also frequently referred to by the Christian community of today.


One of the earliest biblical references to the act of consecration can be found in Joshua 3:5. After wandering through the wilderness for 40 years, the people of Israel were commanded to consecrate themselves before entering the Promised Land. As this command was issued and followed, they were also assured that God would do great things and fulfill the promises He made to them.The act of consecration is also referred to in the New Testament. In 2 Corinthians 6:17, God instructs his followers to ""touch no unclean thing"" and promises to receive them in response. Similarly, in Romans 12:1-2, Paul describes the necessity of viewing the body as a living sacrifice to God, set aside wholly for the worship of God and no longer for the ways of the world.

, God calls humanity to be consecrated to Him. The ability to consecrate yourself is only made possible by God, and the calling to do so comes directly from God.


All holiness comes from God, and any holiness demonstrated by a human being is transferred to that person from God. Only God has the power to transform a human into something sacred, so in a sense, God is consecrating you—making you holy—once you decide to consecrate yourself.
As the Creator, God wants each person to live in God's image and likeness. As such, God wants to dedicate each person to a sacred or consecrated life.

, To consecrate yourself is to answer God's call to spiritual consecration. This means making a conscious, willing decision to dedicate your soul, mind, heart, and body to God.


This decision must be one of will, intelligence, and affection. Only you can make the decision to consecrate yourself to God. No one else can push you into it.

, Since consecration is something that must be done voluntarily, you need to ask yourself if you are truly dedicated or if you are caving into outward pressures.


Only you and God know your heart, so don't worry about whether you appear to have the right motives.
You should view your commitment to Christ as a priority, not a secondary option or passive experience.You should also be able to feel gratitude and love in your heart for God. If your heart is ready to be consecrated to God, it will love God in response to the love God has for you.

, Repentance is one of the first acts you should undertake when you make the decision to consecrate yourself to God. The act of repenting involves the acknowledgment of your sins and the need for the salvation offered to you by Christ.


Repentance is a personal experience, and it's also a fairly straightforward one. Upon gaining the desire to repent, all you need to do is pray for forgiveness and ask God to help you fight against temptation in the future.

, Water baptism is an outward sign of inner consecration. In being baptized, you are given a new spiritual life and dedicated to a life lived for the service of Christ.You should also take time to regularly renew your baptismal promises, especially if you were baptized as an infant before the decision was completely yours to make.
Renewal of your baptismal promises can happen in several ways. Some denominations, like Roman Catholicism, have the Sacrament of Confirmation, in which you confirm your own intention to remain consecrated to God.
Without a separate sacrament, you can still renew your baptismal promises by reciting a creed of faith or by regularly praying a personal vow to God about your desire and intention to remain consecrated.

, The physical body will always be drawn to the ways of the world, but consecrating yourself means prioritizing the spiritual life over the physical one.

There are plenty of things in the physical world that are good. For instance, on a basic level, food is good because it provides the human body with the nourishment it needs to survive. There is nothing wrong with enjoying the food you eat, either.
As a fallen world, though, even good things can be hijacked and used for ill purposes. Using food as an example, you can ruin your body by eating too much food, especially if you eat the wrong foods.
Rejecting the evils of the world does not mean that you have to reject the good things of the world. It only means that you have to reject the bad side of worldly things. It also means that you have to accept that worldly things are significantly less important than spiritual things.
On a practical level, this means rejecting things the world promotes when your faith tells you that those things are wicked. It also means following God's will for your life even when it seems to conflict with something neutral the world holds as a major priority—financial security, romantic love, etc. These “neutral” things can be good when used to serve God, but they are not to be prioritized over service to God.

, Rejecting the wicked ways of the world will not be enough to truly transform you. The human spirit always needs to ""drink"" from some source. If you do not drink from a worldly source, you must drink from a divine source.Just as the body hungers for the ways of the world, the spirit thirsts of the ways of God. The more you train yourself to cave into the desire of your spirit, the easier it will become to continually turn to God.
There are practical things you can do to draw closer to God. Regular prayer is one of the most important. Weekly worship at a church and study of the Scriptures are two other common and highly effective practices. Any activity that allows you to keep God as the focus of your life and encourages you to approach God can be used as a tool for that purpose.

, Consecration is not a single, one-time-only decision. It is a way of living. When you make the decision to consecrate yourself, you must be prepared to continue pursuing God for the rest of your life.


Even though you can only draw near to God after consecrating yourself, your consecration will never be ""complete."" You will never achieve perfect righteousness.
God does not demand complete perfection, though. You are only asked to make the commitment and to actively pursue it. You can stumble as you walk the path, but you must choose to keep walking even when you do.

Start with exploration: You might go to a large evangelical meeting in a stadium or a small group Bible study.,
Do not depend or rely on what others decide, say or do, if you would receive Jesus Christ.,
Get a Bible and begin to read it.,
Watch TV broadcasts of large or small Christian worship services and hear TV sermons or listen on the radio.",How to Convert to Christianity1," The size does not matter for where the Spirit of God is presented/manifested: there you'll find the love, joy and peace of God that can satisfy the seeker's soul. Seek first the will of God and all His provisions can freely be yours on your life's path and at The Judgment. If one place does not have really receptive and welcoming followers of Jesus, you need to find a happier group of believers at another meeting place. Try different Christian meetings, churches in your area, and see how you feel.

, Conversion is a venture in which you may start out with one congregation or a home Bible study group, and then decide to go to another., A Bible is a universal book you can find in many places. A Bible contains both the ""Old Testament,"" Jewish/Hebrew books or law, foretelling of Jesus, and of prophetic scriptures -- and the ""New Testament,"" Christian scriptures together.

""The New Testament"" is what you'll want to read to understand Jesus Christ and Christianity. Its first four books are a day-by-day report in the actual words and teachings of Jesus (the books of ""Matthew"", ""Mark"", ""Luke"" and ""John"", written by those four of his disciples) depicting the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ and presenting great teachings by Him and several other of his disciples, especially of St. Paul, who explained the essentials of Christianity in great detail.
You will learn about love, hope, salvation by grace through faith, and doing good works appointed to you, but realizing that works do not buy grace which is free (a gift of God), and forgiving the wrongs of others, helping the needy/least of God's children, and much more.
As you read, there may be times when you become unsure or confused. If so, you can ask believers about scriptures, including teachers, priests, pastors, and search the Bible online or in Christian books. Just keep in mind that some teachings differ among different denominations, so at times, you may receive differing ""answers"" to your questions. Keep in mind that Satan is the author of confusion, but God is the author of mercy, grace and peace (choose God's way of grace). God's grace is beyond understanding, but it is all sufficient.
The most popular English Bible for Protestants for over 400 years has been the King James Bible. Does that translation sound like Elizabethan/Shakespearean English, well that's simply that the early, modern English ""thee, thou, thy, thine, hence, thence, whence, comets, ghost, etc."" are from that time period. It is important to consider that English speaking Roman Catholics use the Douay-Rheims Bible (with Apocrypha), also from about 1600. Whereas, Protestants use Bibles with only 66 books (omitting the Apocrypha by excluding several Jewish writings, of chapters and books of obscure origins such as Esdras and Maccabees, etc.)







, Find sermons online on the Internet that are inspiring and lead to a deeper, daily walk with Jesus Christ. Scholarly preaching is not what the new believer can get much from. You need the simple, milk of the word of God, before you will need the meat of doctrine or religious opinion..."

Have a clear reason as to why you want to convert this person.,
Have a clear understanding of Islam.,
Pray.,
Understand their religion as well.,
Invite him/her to attend a mosque!,
Be kind to others.,
Be a best friend.,
Don't get discouraged.,
Make contacts with other Christian converts to Islam and have them join you in persuading an individual into accepting Islam.,
Don't force it.,
Explain ""Peace be unto you"" and ""Be a peacemaker"".",How to Convert a Christian to Islam," Why do you want to convert this person to Islam? Do you want to prove to others something? Are you feeling obligated to do it? Has Allah put this desire in your heart? Or do you just really love this person and care for this person and you want him/her to go with you to heaven?;
, Are you a devoted Muslim? Do you put Allah first in your life? Are you a good example of how a Muslim should be? Make sure to have a close relationship with Allah. Attend a mosque every Friday, read your Koran, have quiet times...

, Prayer is the number one factor here. If you want to convert your Christian friend to Islam, you have to tell Allah first! Tell him how you feel, really open your heart to him so that he can see how devoted you are and so that he can help you overcome this victory. Remember to pray daily.

, This knowledge may come in handy especially when it comes to discussions.

, If your friend won't then introduce that person to some of your Muslim friends so that he/she can feel the warmth and love that we share towards each other.

, Showing a good example is also a big key. Be kind, not only to him/her, but to everyone! Always have a smile on your face and always be happy, for Allah always wants our light to shine. Our actions can create a GREAT impact to others, remember talk is cheap, actions are worth so much more.

, Be there whenever you can. If your friend is in a bad situation, don't just sit there and say your sorry, do something for them! That way they can see how extraordinary you are.

, Your friend may not ever want to become a Muslim, but if you just always remember that Allah is on your side, and that anything is worth possible, don't ever give up on your dream...keep pressing forward.

, Having them see and discuss with people who were once Christian will help get your point across.

, You have to be really smart and delicate with how you present the topic. If you're throwing information in their face and drowning them it'll only discourage them.

, Jesus said, ""Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God"" (Matthew 5:9). Point out that Jesus/Isa is the Prince of Peace in the Bible. He calls his followers to bring peace to conflict, perhaps after a war, or peace might have little meaning if it is not applied. We may intervene or interfere in warlike situations. Jesus indicated that we are to bring goodness, peace, joy, love,... with us.

""Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you."" (2 Corinthians 13:11)

Find a good, quiet place.,
Sit upright.,
Focus on your breath.,
Begin with “counting.” There are eight graduated steps in Anapanasati meditation, each one working up to nirvana.,
Pursue further “steps” to develop your practice.",How to Do Indian Meditation2," Like Vipassana meditation, Anapanasati is about quiet mindfulness. The first step, then, is to find a suitable location. The Buddha recommended three: the forest, the foot of a tree, or an isolated or empty spot.Silence is essential to Anapanasati, especially for beginners. For you, a quiet room might be best. A secluded woods or beach might also work well.
Silence will help you to develop concentration. If you cannot find complete silence, aim for somewhere that is quiet and private.

, People can meditate in several different postures, like standing, reclining, sitting, and walking. Sitting is the best for Anapanasati. Ideally, you should take a cross-legged position with both feet turned up and resting on your thighs, i.e. the lotus position.Don’t worry if you can’t take the lotus position. It is also acceptable to sit half cross-legged, with one leg slightly bent.
You should also sit erect. Your torso should be upright but not tense or rigid. Imagine that all the bones in your spine are linked together.
As for your hands, they should lay gently on your lap. Like in Vipassana, the right hand is traditionally atop the left with the palms up.
Your eyes can be closed, half-closed, or open – whichever is most comfortable – and your head should be tilted downward, your nose perpendicular to the navel.

, The focus of your mindfulness in Anapanasati will again be breathing. Turn your mind toward the rising and falling, the inhalation and exhalation of your breath. Follow the sensations involved and be aware of them.


Be especially mindful of the place when the breath enters and leaves your nostrils. This will be a spot just under your nose or above your upper lip. Center on the spot where the breath touches the skin.
Be aware: when you breathe in, recognize that you’re breathing in. Likewise when you are breathing out. However, don’t try to control or hold back your breathing. As your awareness of breathing increases, it will become less willful., The basic and most rudimentary level is “counting.” Counting is intended for those with no background in the technique. People with experience in meditation may not need it and can begin with the second level.Fix your attention on the tip of your nose, as said. Now, count the movements of your breath. For example, you might count the first inhalation as “one, one” and the first exhalation as “two, two.” Continue to the tenth breath (“ten, ten”) before returning to “one, one.”
If you lose track, start again at “one, one.”
The counting itself is not meditation. It instead helps to calm the wandering mind, by making you aware when you become distracted and lose the count.

, In Anapanasati there are eight total steps. To get further in the technique, you will slowly be able to move into higher levels. “Following” comes next. Once you have calmed your mind with counting, you should be able to mentally track or “follow” the course of your breath without keeping track.


Following just means to follow the breath with the mind. You do not deliberately breathe in or out, but only remain aware that it takes place. Try to see the beginning, the middle, and the end of each cycle of breaths. This practice is called ""experiencing the whole body.""
“Contact” and “Fixing” come next. These both require stronger concentration and are harder to attain. People who reach this level may feel they have stopped breathing altogether, because they are so calm that it’s hard to feel the action of the breath. They must keep focused on the spot under the nostrils. Many report calm, joy, or even powerful visions.
Very few people make it to the upper steps of the technique. “Observing,” “turning away,” “purification,” and “retrospection” will take you to higher paths of self-awareness.
If you want to achieve these higher grades, you will most likely need to find a spiritual master to guide you. Consider attending a meditation retreat – monasteries and other centers around the world host such retreats, in many cases as a free service to the community."

Choose a mantra.,
Pick a good time and location.,
Sit down and close your eyes.,
Chant your mantra.,
Start slowly and work your way to longer sessions.",How to Do Indian Meditation3," Mantra meditation comes from the Hindu tradition and involves the meditative repetition of a single word or phrase. This is the “mantra.” The purpose of the mantra is to give you a focus of attention, like breathing in the Vipassana and Anapanasati techniques. First thing, choose your mantra.You might pick any word or one that inspires you. Simple is better!
Some ancient mantras are “Om,” “Om Mani Padne Hum,” “Ham-sah,” or “Namo Amitabah.” Modern mantras might be “peace,” “love,” or “one.”Picking a non-English mantra might actually help, because you will have fewer connections to it. It will not distract you from your meditation.

, Obviously, there is no right time or place to do your mediation. The choice is a personal one. However, some people find that mantra mediation has its best results if done first thing in the morning, after working, or during your low point in the afternoon at around 4 o’clock.As for places, make sure to have a quiet spot where you won’t be disturbed. For instance, try your bedroom, your backyard, or a quiet park, woodlot, or beach.
The key is to minimize distractions. The quieter and fewer people, the better.

, You don’t have to sit cross-legged or in the lotus position for mantra meditation. Find someplace comfy to sit upright. If you’d like, support your back with a cushion or the wall or even sit in a chair.Lying down is not recommended for this type of meditation – you can easily fall asleep.
Close your eyes and sit still for a half a minute or so. Get accustomed to your environment and draw in several deep breaths., After a few deep breaths, resume your normal breathing and start to chant your mantra. Some people are comfortable doing this aloud. Otherwise, repeat the word silently in your head without moving your tongue or lips.Don’t force things. The repetition of the mantra should be relaxed and gentle.
You also don’t need to worry about coordinating the mantra with your breath. Let both come as naturally as you can.
Some people find it helps to imagine that the mantra is being whispered in their ear, rather than coming from their own mind.
Stay fixed on the mantra and don’t try to empty your mind. When your attention wanders, just bring it back to the mantra and your breathing. Don’t worry if this happens – it’s normal. What’s more important is that you realize when you start to wander and refocus., Try to repeat your mantra for 5 minutes at a time to start. Gradually, you should be able to go for up to 20 to 30 minutes, several times per week. Other people alternatively aim for a certain number of repetitions, traditionally 108 or 1008.Some people use cellphone alarms as timers, while others sit with a clock in view. It really doesn’t matter. Do whatever works best for you.
When you wind down, stop saying the mantra and sit silently for a few more minutes to relax. Let yourself slowly re-enter your normal activities. Otherwise, you may feel groggy like you’ve gotten up from a nap."

Be willing to accept the Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart.,
""Be saved by believing the Christian gospel (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).,
Become Baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

,
Receive Baptism and Holy Communion, rites that some churches call Ordinances, and which other churches call part of the Sacraments.

,
Follow Jesus Christ and be sure you are a Christian by God's grace through faith, believing: you might not have a local church, pastor or be able to get baptized, because maybe you are in a country that does not contain any churches or not many priests, pastors, (e.g.,
When you receive the Holy Spirit (officially become a Christian), do anything you can to strengthen your faith and belief in Jesus.,
Become committed to praising God, giving thanks for all things, acknowledging Him in all areas of life.",How to Convert to Christianity2," Converting to Christianity is based on your belief that Jesus is God's only begotten Son, and that He does all manner of miracles including Salvation. Christianity starts with being saved, trusting Christ to save you, and then entails living a good and godly life that is pleasing to God. Both are important.;
, This means that you believe that Jesus died for your sins and rose again. Since he paid for your sins you can be forgiven, and because he rose again He has power to give you eternal life. Believing this message you respond, ""Lord Jesus, I believe you died for my sins and rose again, so now please save me, a sinner."" That saves you and begins your Christian life. Continue to believe.

A key passage describing salvation is Romans 10:9-10, ""That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved. For with the heart (core being) man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."" Such belief is called faith and leads to God freely giving you the gift of salvation by grace through faith not by work or great deeds.Romans 10:9-10""







,,, Saudi Arabia, Libya,...). Be sure that your relationship with Jesus is not based on formalities, such as baptizing but is based on your personal belief in Him, following Him (and His teachings). Yes, be baptized by another believer, if you can, but the most important baptism for a Christian is his spiritual baptism into Christ Jesus (Galatians 3:27).

,


Christianity is about God's love, so start showing His love that you received freely, to others such as being willing to forgive everyone and anyone who has wronged you. Jesus said, ""You have heard, 'Love your neighbor', but I say to you,
'Love your enemy, and do good to those who hate you and spitefully use you.' "". We may try to fail miserably -- but God's supply of grace is sufficient, in His boundless mercy, as the grace of God is the power of God unto salvation, not by work, lest any boast. How can anyone afford to reject such great salvation, so rich, and yet so free.
Do good deeds because you believe in God and are a Christian. ""This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that you affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. "" Titus 3:8; ""That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works."" 2 Timothy 3:17. Jesus Christ has said, ""And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."" Revelation 22:12.
Fulfill Jesus' commission (Matthew 10:7-8) by going out and preaching the Gospel and healing the sick.

, Always pray, remaining in a spirit of prayer in every circumstance, even if to say only, ""Thank you Lord."" Also, in all things, glorify God by how you live your life."
"
Take the time to learn the teachings and practices of the churches you choose to visit and feel free to ask questions.,
Find a pastor or priest, to help you.,
Choose a Church to fellowship and to follow Christ.",How to Convert to Christianity3," A good way to examine beliefs of a church is to read the particular church's Statement of Faith, a list of basic beliefs and compare it to others.


There are many Christian denominations, including Anglican, Assembly of God (and other Pentecostal denominations), Baptist, Christian (denomination), Churches of Christ, Episcopal, Lutheran, Methodist, Orthodox (Eastern, Greek, Russian), Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, and United Church of Christ. There are other Protestant groups, with some called ""nondenominational"", ""not affiliated with (____)"" or ""independent (____)"" churches of one kind or another.
Although all Christians share belief in Jesus Christ, each denomination has its own unique emphases on certain teachings, traditions, customs, and beliefs. Different groups form consensus on understandings of different doctrines about The Sacraments, The Triune God (versus Arian Belief concerning God), pastor, order of services, offices of bishop, presbyter, deacon, and such, marriage, healing, prophesies, praying to saints, speaking unknown tongues, formalities, rituals, written prayers, or informality, pray as the Spirit of God gives utterance, etc.
It is wise to research organizations very carefully and thoroughly before you get involved with them too deeply. Some people have had negative experiences because they rushed into a group too quickly before finding out all about it. Don't let yourself be rushed into a commitment to a group until you feel comfortable. Beware falling under the sway of religious cult leaders who won't respect your right to make your own decisions or who try to control your life in a manipulative manner.

, He or she may help you find all the answers to the questions you need to know.

, Find a church near you, or one that you like. Go to that church and talk to the pastor or priest, attend church services or mass whenever you can, and visit this Church any day of the week that your soul calls you to.

"
Learn about and believe that Jesus died for your sins, rose bodily from the dead as your Savior and then pray to God in Jesus name and turn from your own path to repent to the one, true God saying: ""I am sorry for my sin, all my wrong doing; I want to be new, and I truly thank you for everything and that I am now forgiven and saved from the penalty for my sins as a free gift of Your Holy Spirit, in Jesus' name."",
Tell others that ""There is one Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who is Lord and Savior for everyone who believes, repents (""turns 180 degrees"" for example) and follows Him"" which would include: going to Christian meetings, being baptised as a sign of repentance, praying to God, reading the Bible, taking communion (""The Lord's Supper""), and showing God's love by kindness, forgiving others, making peace, to fellowship with believers -- and when thinking that you have un-confessed sin, confess and repent asking for, and accepting, forgiveness, expecting consequences for some wrongs and going on, all in Christ Jesus' name -- with God as the one, true Judge of all things good or bad.

Learn the Christian creeds: The Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed.",How to Convert to Christianity5,"

Many churches have somewhat different confessions of faith and/or catechisms that are based upon their own interpretation of the Christian creeds, Holy Ordinances, system of church organization, and other matters. See, for example, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the Lutheran Formula of Concord, the Westminster Confession, the Anglican 39 Articles, the 1689 Baptist Confession, the 1919 Doctrinal Statement of the World Conference on Christian Fundamentals, and others. The Lutheran Service Book has the following text:







"
"
Take an honest, open appraisal of your sins before confessing.,
Think back on the sins you've committed since your last confession.,
Reflect back on the good deeds you ignored, and the subtle sins you may have committed.,
Think about the sins you've committed against yourself.,
Ensure that you feel actual remorse for you sins.,
Refer to the Catholic Church's guides for personal examination to help reflect.",How to Confess Sins1," Known in the church as an ""examination of conscience,"" reflecting on your spiritual and moral life is imperative before you end up in the confessional. Make a note, either mentally or on a piece of paper, about the sins you've committed since your last confession. Pay particular attention to the ones that still feel fresh, or that you really want to confess for. To start this examination, ask two questions:


""In what ways did I sin?""
""When did I fail to do the good or right thing when I should have?"";
, You should focus on the sins most pressing on your mind. That said, nothing is too small for confessional. If it weighs on your soul, now is the time to let it out in a safe environment. Think about:


Insults, fights, or rudeness to loved ones.
Cheating, even small amounts.
Lying, stealing, or hurting someone for personal gain.

, Even if you didn't do something obviously wrong, we can all improve on the times we forgot to do something right. Think about ways you've cut corners or ignored the plights of others. Remember, while confession is about releasing your sins, it is also about becoming a better person who sins less in the future. Think about times you didn't do anything negative or positive and find ways to make those moments positive in the future.


Have you prayed every day? Do you feel connected to God?
Do you do the bare minimum for you loved ones, or do you go above and beyond?
Do you take the easy way out, or push yourself to be a better person and servant of God?

, This is probably the least remembered type of sin, though everyone goes through periods of it in their life. Think about the times you were filled with self-pity, they days you cheated yourself out of a life goal or happiness, and the times you abused or neglected your own well-being. You need to treat all people with love and respect -- but that has to start with yourself.

, Know this: confession is not some mechanical exchange where just entering the booth immediately washes away your wrong-doing. If you don't actually feel bad about what you've done then confession means absolutely nothing. Remember, this is between you and your God -- not just you and the priest., Sometimes the best way to see your flaws is to turn to an outside source. The Catholic Diocese published ""sample examinations"" for various groups of people. They contain useful questions, information on certain sins and current issues, and perspective on the problems you're currently facing. To start, check out their guides for:Married Couples
Single People
Young Adults

Find a quiet spot where you won't be disturbed.,
Bring a Bible and a notebook with you as well!,
Sit still and listen.,
Read your Bible.,
Talk to Him!,
Avoid distractions.,
Listen to traditional, spiritual, Gospel or contemporary Christian music, such as hymns, or even Gregorian chants, Byzantium chants, etc.,
Let God speak to you through the Christian songs and music.,
It can be hard to get into a habit of listening to God and reading your Bible.,
Go to a good, Bible-based church.,
If you are a kid or a teen, you may consider going to Sunday school (children), or the church youth group (teens).",How to Commune with God (Christianity)," This may be your living area, bedroom, or out in the middle of the desert or the woods with God's creation.;
, You may bring a hard copy of the Bible, or a digital copy on your notebook, smartphone, or tablet. You can get a free copy of an older version from a number of Internet sites.

, Try to see whether God is talking to you (perhaps, it may be through a still small voice in your conscience). Anything you are impressed that God is saying must agree with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Bible. The Universe and the sounds of nature are ""part"" of Him. God made the good and the not so good, to build character as we learn to cope with it. The Bible states that ""it is better to listen than to talk."" This means that it is better to be quiet, listen and agree with what God's Word - the Bible and Spirit has to say -- rather than talking to Him without listening or meditating on the Words of God.


If you don't hear God's voice, realize that ""the word is near you, even in your mouth and in your heart (innermost being): that is, the word of faith (The Gospel), which we preach;"" (Romans 10:8). So, quote a favorite promise of God's Word: ""The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want..."" (Psalm 23:1), ""The Lord sets a table before me, in the presence of my enemies..."" (Psalm 23:5), etc. You can read Psalm 23 here, for more remarkable verses.

, See whether God responds to your questions. God talks to His creation through His word and signs, as ""the one who can do infinitely more than all we can ask or imagine according to the power that is working among us."" (Ephesians 3:20). Write down your prayers, if that helps you to concentrate. Write down what God is telling you as well.

, It doesn't matter whether it is in your head or out loud. The more you talk to him the better you will feel in your heart. Jesus calls us His friends! Remember ""God's love is perfect, and perfect love casts out all fear!""


Jesus said, ""You are My friends, if you do what I command you. I no longer call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you."" (John 15:14 and 15).

, If you can't get away from your work place, business or school, that's okay. You can still try to avoid being distracted from communing -- even if for only a few moments/minutes at a time, on a break for instance.


Don't worry about anything: instead, pray about everything, always. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done, is doing and will do, for His continued blessings on you. (Philippians 4:6 NLT)

We need to understand that our decision making is a very complex process, encompassing not only our knowledge and desire, but also much input from other sources.,
We need to learn to sort through and decide what input we will allow to influence our decisions and reject or disallow those sources that cause us to choose to do wrong.,
We need to equip ourselves with the Enforcer to back us up as we eject evil voices that speak into our lives; freeing us to choose to do the right thing.,
We need to surround ourselves with reinforcements to make this admittedly difficult task easier.,
Practice, practice, practice.",How to Choose to Do the Right Thing (for Christians)," Start with your knowledge of what is right in the situation. Add your desire to do the right thing. Now notice the first input; probably yourself. You are just to tired or lazy, or it will cost you something; perhaps your money or comfort or time. Next, the input of former training or prejudices; you may subliminally hear your parent's voice of disapproval. Now, a dark input comes from the spirit world; the same voice Eve heard long ago. (He has a vested interest in your choosing not to do the right thing as he is the champion of evil.) He sends whatever thought or fear it will take to dissuade you right into your mind, and you may never discover it is not your own.;
, Think and reflect upon your tendency to make bad choices over and over again. When we have jumped the wrong way there is usually a pinpoint moment we made that decision that we can remember. Find that reason, source, or input and use that as a lesson for the future. Begin to review your decisions before you make them. Am I afraid? Selfish? Choose to override yourself even if you must!

, That would be the Holy Spirit that comes from God, the source of all that is good and right. You may obtain Him from God, simply by asking for Him, as it is written in the Scripture; Luke 11:13 ""If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?"" Jesus said, ""And you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you..."" This actually gives us the strength and ability to say no to evil and yes to good.

, That could be other people who are choosing to do the right thing; It is much easier to do right at a little league game than in a nightclub! Fill your mind with good thoughts by reading good things, watching clean uplifting movies, opening your eyes to the blessings you are already enjoying... your health, family, etc. Most importantly, read the Word of God that He has left you to be your encouragement and guide. Pray often for help and you will receive it.

, We get very good at what we do often. And it gets easier too!

Confide you sins in a priest, or a trusted friend, relative, or authority figure, whenever possible.,
Go to your local church and look up confession hours.,
Begin with a sign of the cross and a brief prayer from the priest.,
Start your confession by asking forgiveness.,
Slowly, without fear or shame, recount your sins to the priest.,
Make a determined inner effort to move past your sins and avoid them later in life.,
Listen to the priest's response and discuss how to move forward.,
Carry out your penance as soon as you can.",How to Confess Sins2," Whenever you can, go to a priest for confession -- they have the knowledge and skills to help you the most. While everyone has their own special connection with God, but most Christian leaders suggest confessing sins to another. This gets the weight off your chest, provides someone to offer guidance and advice, and allows you to make things better with the help of a friend. If there is no priest around, a trusted confident will do.


If you've sinned against someone, you should first go and confess to them. Make things right with them and the rest will follow.
Confessing to another person is not a necessity -- it is only recommended. You can confess your sins alone to god as well.
The reasoning for confession can be found in John 5:16: ""Confess your sins to one another ... that you may be healed.""

, You can usually find them in the church bulletin, on the door of the confessional, or by asking a priest or church staff member.

, Both of you begin with ""In the name of the Father, the Son, etc..."" before the priest says a few brief words. He may read a short passage, or he may say something along the lines of, ""May the Lord be in your heart and help you to confess your sins with true sorrow."" Once he has stopped speaking you may begin your confession., Begin by saying, ""Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been _________ day/months since my last confession."" This is considered the beginning of your actual confession.Don't worry if the words aren't exactly right -- asking for forgiveness and stating your last confession are the crucial parts.
Some people prefer the less judgmental-sounding, ""Bless me Father, for I have sinned.""

, Do not feel like you must hold back, feel embarrassed, or lie. Nothing you say in a confession can be repeated outside of the confessional -- even if you were to threaten to murder someone (including the priest himself). The point of a confession is to unburden your soul with the help of another. This sacred bond of trust, known as the Seal of the Confessional, is there to protect you and help you freely open up., Determine that those sins should not be what you are or what you do, and repudiate them.Resolve in your heart or inner being that you have repented and will not return to them. This is a deeply personal moment, and one that requires strength and courage to follow through with. This, however, is why you come to confession after examining your conscience.

, He will absolve you of all your sins, and tell you how much the Lord loves you. If you need, ask questions, add small details when needed, and engage with the priest. This is a conversation, not some a car wash, and you should feel free to engage in the process and work through issues with your priest.


At the end of the confession, the priest gives you a ""penance."" This is a task or tasks that you must complete for forgiveness.

, Do not put this off. Whatever the priest has assigned for you to do, get right to it while the memory and feelings of spirituality are still hot. Penance is a way to bring you closer to your sins, helping you learn from them. It is not punishment. When you start looking at it as a chance for self-improvement, the ability to complete your penance is much easier.

,How to Confess Sins3,
"
Consider whether you will place your confidence in the Rock of Ages.,
Do not act religious -- meaning this: avoid pride in name-brand or branch of Christianity that has developed in about 2000 years, as being better for as long as salvation is by grace through faith not of yourself it is the gift of God, then it matters little:


""Are you a Christian?"",
Accept The Good News, and give it to others; pass it on, so for as He is so are we (we must rely on Truth) when we are founded upon the rock:


Ask for and thank God for His kind of change and love: a new life in Christ.,
Accept God's discipline and correction to go higher on the Rock:


Accept help for change desiring a fresh start, repenting and receiving it.

,
Consider your base being Jesus Christ in the hurricanes of life.,
Receive the desires of your heart by aligning your desires in Christ with God's will: what is right, just, honest and is not self-righteous (Luke 6:37):


""Judge not, and ye shall not be judged:

condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned:

forgive, and ye shall be forgiven...""

,
Be generous and you will receive and so give expecting no return at all... ""Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you.,
Plan for now (short term goals), and later (long term goals) for your individual way to act upon your faith, your own hopes, dreams and visions for your individual life.

,
Consider life on the rock is: about relationships.,
Boast in the unmerited grace and in the love of God.,
Get onto the foundation so your life in Christ is started and is inspected by the ""Master Builder"" -- Jesus Christ, ie: listen to the Holy Spirit and to your conscience, but that must agree with the ""Bible"": ""For no one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ."",
Change.,
Repent.,
Study the plans to accept grace and for options that describe building regulations in your life according to the Bible.,
Discuss the Bible in Adult Classes, Youth Sunday School and in fellowship with more experienced Christians like your youth leader, your pastor, parents, deacons, or others...

,
Consider finding a mentor (someone to learn from) -- someone to help you study the Bible and live for the good of others doing good to others for God.,
Follow Jesus daily without letting things stop you: ""Jesus looked at him and loved him.,
Take your opportunity to invite someone to church and mentor them in Christ (be a good friend, as a Christian)... if you know what you believe, and so you are serving Jesus, God and the Spirit.

,
See the plat of the development and use it, ie: the map is Jesus and the ""Bible.,
Show an increase (profit) in building after you receive your appointment (salvation) and are building your life (on The Rock) -- then add buildings (win souls) to ""grow"" in God's way (vine/tree), in God's will: ""The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he who wins souls is wise."",
Continue in building the vine -- add branches...,
Avoid building on a weak foundation:


flaky, crackling layers of confused purposes,
rubble of ruins in failures and poor efforts,
loose gravel of defeat from fussing or even hating,
slippery style of fear of agreeing with others who are serving God...

,
Be in prayer, for planning your life on your and God's purposes: ""And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the congregation and on the street corners to be seen by men.,
Get the engineering, ie: receive the Holy Spirit given guidance, comfort, joy while learning, relearning, if that is needed for your goals to be met. "",
Smile and finish your work with help from many resources: Pursue training and an education, which will be useful and helpful, which makes it possible to get your foot inside the door in various places and stations in life.,
Give God the credit for peace when you trim, do finishing, redo, and remodel your life when needed.,
Find strength in weakness, ie: choose your close friends well, think of dating as possibly leading to marriage so don't choose really silly, wild and crazy people.,
Stay invested and keep your eye on the goal during life's experiences, making investments and accounting for the costs, in the good or hard times.,
Lean and press forward toward the future: ""Strain toward what is ahead... press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called you heavenward in Christ Jesus..."" (Philippians 3:14),
Dig deep to find the solid rock, in God's Truth, Life and the Way:...He is like a man building a house, who 'dug down deep and laid the foundation upon solid rock'.",How to Build on the Rock (Jesus)," ""Confide in Jehovah for ever; for in Jah, Jehovah, is the Rock of Ages."" (Isaiah 26:4)The name of Jesus means ""Yahweh-saves"" which is the same as ""Yehoshua,"" ""Jehovah-saves."" wikipedia:Jehoshua Name Jesus is the Lord, the Savior and the ""Word made Flesh"", ie: Jehovah lives...:


""The Lord lives; and blessed be my Rock; and exalted be God -- the rock of my salvation!"" (2 Samuel 22:47)Jesus Christ is ""...the spiritual rock that rock was Christ."" (1 Corinthians 10:4) ;
, Some answer: ""I'm a ____________..."" (name a denomination or church). That is not the question.

Going to the garage or barn doesn't make you a car or a horse. Just going to church can not make you Christian... Symbols and gestures cannot make you a Christian.

Self-righteousness is about judging, doing, acting and going to their kind of Christian church and doing their traditions, but not crediting it all to God, and His grace and forgiveness which is available to all who are penitent/repentant.



,

Anger turning to hate against wrong doers may be understandable, but God's grace can save the worst. Pray for help and confess hate and anger that lingers for days... ""Don't let the sun go down on your anger."" -- try to make it right (be penitent yourself), and forgive the repentant.



,, Jesus said: ""The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock."" (Matthew 7:25) ,, For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you."" (Luke 6:38),, ""By this you all know that you are my disciples: if you love one another."" (John 13:35) ,


If the grace and the love of God is your boast then you will not be judging or boasting about your goodness...
""But I will never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. By his cross my relationship to the world and its relationship to me have been crucified ."" (Galatians 6:14) , (1 Corinthians 3:11) , You can improve your plans and your building as needed after inspections, according to your faith: Jesus said, ""For John came to you to call you to righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax-collectors and the harlots had faith in him: and you, when you saw it, neither regretted your sins, nor believed him."" (Matthew 21:32)

, Be penitent. Repent - means be willing to change, and try if you need to change your ways (and perhaps pay back people you had wronged then do so as you can...) -- then God's Spirit will help you by the Word and will direct your pathway by the ""Bible"" with guidance of God's Holy Spirit and by His people (church). ""I say to you, 'Except you repent (change), you shall all likewise perish'."" (Luke 13:5)Be penitent as that is needed, but know that you can not barter for or pay for your soul's salvation or for His grace. Both are free, but then you do the work for others but not to impress anyone including yourself. Be contrite.

, ""Study to show yourself to God as an approved workman that need not be ashamed, and who rightly handles the word of Truth."" (2 Timothy 2:15),, Be humble in dealing with others.

, 'One thing you lack: go your way, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me (the Rock)'"" (Mark 10:21),, """"Jesus (the rock) said to him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me'..."""" (John 14:6), (Proverbs 11:30), Here is a metaphor or a simile: ""I (The Rock) am the vine and you are the branches. Remain in me (The Rock), and I will remain in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself -- that is, if it does not continue in the vine -- so neither can you if you do not continue in me (The Rock)..."" (John 15:4)I chose you to bear fruit (in the cleft of the Rock; I am in you and you're in the Rock of Ages.):
""You did not choose me, but I chose you and you to go and bear fruit--fruit that will last... "" (John 5:16),, I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full."" (Matthew 6:5), I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but wait in the city of Jerusalem, until you are endued with power from on high."" (Luke 24:49), ""Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means..."" (2 Corinthians 8:11 ), ""LORD, you establish peace for us; all that we have accomplished you have done for us."" (Isaiah 26:12), Hang around with people who are into following God's will, but not being controlling; not judging everyone harshly. ""Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange doctrines, but gaining inner strength from God's kindness is good for us..."" (Hebrews 13:9), Invest in your friends, your spouse, in children and in your charity in the community to help the less fortunate to find their way --

,, (Luke 6:48)"
"
Pick a church leader that has a spotless reputation.,
Find a leader who has a good family life.,
Discern by evidence whether a potential leader has good character.,
Seek out a leader that is not a new Christian.,
See that the prospect has earned the right to become a leader, and part of earning that right is walking faithfully with God over a long period of time.,
See whether someone who wants to be a leader is thought to have good character by the standards of the outside world.",How to Choose Church Leadership (by Paul's Gospel)," As Paul says: ""Now the overseer is to be above reproach."" (1 Timothy 3:1). One question this might raise is whether the person has done immoral things in the past or has committed sins that show the potential for weakness as a leader. For example, could someone who used to be an alcoholic or a drug addict become a pastor or a deacon, etc.? In deciding whether the person has learned sufficiently from the experience and overcome it, look at the person's recent conduct, work habits and family life:


Has that life been clean, sober and consistent for the last five or 10 years? A modern day interpretation of what it means to be above reproach would be, have they not had any illegal substances in the last five years, or gambled, or gone to a strip club, or drank alcohol in excess? And so forth. Is their language clean? Do others respect and speak of this person as an upright, law-abiding citizen, chivalrous, kind but determined, etc?
Remember to keep a place for forgiveness and given someone a second chance. Where it is clear that the person has overcome the problems, learned and reformed, such a leader can be a beacon for those who wish to change their lives around for the better. Such a person will have incredible compassion, something much needed in a good leader.;
, ""He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect. If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?"" (1 Timothy 3:4--5). Paul says that a person worthy of leadership must have their house and family in order. While there is occasionally a joke told about the pastor's kids being some of the worst kids, this should not be the case.


The potential leader's children and spouse must respect them, because if their family doesn't respect them, why would a church body respect them? Paul says that a church leader must be ""faithful to his wife."" (1 Timothy 3:2) This would include any current pastor or church leader who is found with a stash of pornography or looking at it. Such one should step down when approached by a reputable group of church members.

, Paul says that a leader must be ""temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money."" (1 Timothy 3:2--3). This is a long list for sure:


To be temperate means that the leader must have very good self-restraint and self-discipline.
The person must be respected for their character. They must be hospitable, not rude to outsiders.
The person must be able to teach, so they must be educated.
They should not have a habit of getting drunk.
They should not be violent, and not prone to angry outbursts or yelling. They must not be quarrelsome, meaning they do not pick arguments everywhere they go. This person must be a peacemaker.
Lastly, and this is very important since churches take tithes and offerings, this person must not love money. The Bible says ""the love of money is the root of all evil,"" and Jesus said it would be impossible to love both God and money. So this person must be overall, a more noble person than one might expect.

, Paul says, ""He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil."" Satan was once a head angel in Heaven, but he became overly prideful, which resulted in God casting him out of Heaven down to earth. Satan thought that he could become the God himself. He wanted to rule in God's place. He literally tried to overthrow God, of all beings, and God expelled him and one third of the angels. So, Paul is saying that if someone has converted only a few months or years before seeking leadership, allowing this person to become a leader or an elder, risks making them overly prideful, much like Satan was.

, They have to prove themselves by having a long standing devotion to living the life that God intends for us to live. Also, how can they teach anyone the Bible until they have been taught the truths of the Bible themselves first?

, Paul says, ""He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap."" If several people who are not saved know some dirt on the prospective leader, their reputation could be quickly ruined, and the leader, and the church, would be disgraced.
Also, Paul mentions that the leader of bad character might ""fall into the devil's trap."" This means that if the person does have a bad reputation with outsiders, due to having a past of drugs or drinking, etc., it might be easy for them to fall back into the same behavior. This somewhat answers the question posed earlier of whether an ex-drug addict can become a pastor, however the context matters and care should be taken to assume that every person will fail in such a way. Paul would say that this generally would not be a good idea, but there are cases where it happens and works out okay. It depends on how strong the person's resolve is to stay clean. Also, if they are in a new city where no one knows them, there will be less temptation for them to fall back into their habits.
So it's hard to say for sure, but generally church leaders, in any position of leadership, should have a clean past as well as a clean present.

Let no one seek his own good, but that of the other (1 Corinthians 10:24).,
Show grace to others, according to the matchless grace that has been given to you by God.,
Let God's pathway guide/control your own life; don't let other people set your path for you.,
Stay calm; don't let people make you mad.,
Speak victory -- not defeat.,
Earn respect from others.,
Listen and learn to see the contributions of others and so sow love and respect for them and yourself, and take care of yourself.,
Set up boundaries with others.",How to Care About Yourself As a Christian," Speak the truth in love as the Bible says, and then you do not let people walk all over you (seeking their own good). If you allow it, they will think that is perfectly acceptable, and will continue to do so. You need to stand up for God's way. Agree together, and then God's will can be done in your life for you. If you stop listening/accepting, you cause others to not accept or listen to you/your points. Don't ignore the truth, but rather speak the truth about what you are feeling, and saying in love. Say what you need, to others. But try to always say it in an non-accusing, and calm way.


Peter said, ""Be sober and self-controlled, and be on the alert. The great accuser, the Devil, is going about like a roaring lion to see whom he may devour."" (1 Peter 5:8);
, Care about yourself. The amount that you care about and respect others is the amount that others will care about and respect you too. If you don’t respect yourself, others probably won’t respect you either. See yourself as what you are, a creation of God that is fearfully and wonderfully made.

, The only being alive that should have power over you is God, not people.


There is a famous quote: ""No one can have power over you without your consent."" You can give power to others over you by how you act and by what you say. People do not have that much power unless you give it to them.
You allow certain people to be in your life, and you allow certain behaviors to happen simply by being around certain people. If you do not like certain things, you have the power to walk away and end the relationship/friendship, etc. You are not a victim to things that happen to you. You choose them.

, The Bible says, ""In your anger do not sin."" And, the Bible tells us there we are to have self-control. Some like to say that someone ""made"" them mad. But another person cannot ""make"" you mad. You make yourself mad by how you choose to think and to react.


You may have certain expectations that make you mad, or you may care too much what another person says, or does. Granted sometimes people might push your buttons on purpose, in which case you need to separate yourself from that person in order to calm down. But generally, you can choose to get mad or choose to not get mad.
Proverbs 19:11 says, ""Good sense makes one slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense."" You can choose to take offense of you can choose to overlook an offense (or decide: ""That does not offend me."").

, If you never stand up for yourself, abuse may continue. And, if you would do well, you must serve others. If you never speak the mind of Christ, others will think they can control you or dominate you. When it's your call, deal fairly: so let the other go first and then say ""My turn!"" ""Life and death are in the power of the tongue."" Truth that you say will determine what you and others expect and will work for, call and urge into your future. Your words have power, to guide and protect you, and so protect others. You can speak life over your future and your situations. If you speak defeat/curses for yourself, or curses on others -- you cut your feet out from under you. Speak life, truth -- and speak victory when you ""Bless, and curse not.""

, Others will not just automatically respect you, you have to earn that respect. This is sometimes why arguments in relationships are necessary. People argue to regain respect that may have been lost. Anger is an attempt to regain respect, and it often works. Of course, it is better to earn respect by showing respect to others. The Bible says, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" Because generally, the kindness/fairness with which you treat others is how kindly and fairly people will treat you, if they are interested in agreeing with you.



""...I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you."" (Romans 12:3).

, You are not only called to love others as a Christian, but you also need to love yourself, but only as much as you love them. For Jesus said, ""What amount you measure out to others, the same measure will be measured back to you."", and He also said, ""Love your neighbor as you love yourself."" This means respect yourself, exactly as much as you respect others. Christians often think they need to be self-sacrificing to the point of forgetting their own needs almost completely. But think about it; Jesus ate when he was hungry. He slept when he was tired. He went away to be by himself when he needed some alone time. He had friends to teach -- or to talk to when he needed them.


Jesus took care of himself. It is okay to take care of yourself. It is not a sin to take care of yourself first. For some reason many Christians think that it is a sin, even if they don’t realize that they do. Also remember that you cannot really be strong for others, at least not well, until you strengthen yourself first.
Ask God what you should do: ""You don't even know what tomorrow will bring--what your life will be! For you are like fog that appears for a little while, then vanishes. Instead, you ought to say, 'If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that.'


, The reason people get mistreated sometimes is because they don’t set up boundaries of what is okay, and don't ask or seek agreement with others. ""Where two are three agree together, on anything, there I am in their midst!"" So, such agreement is required to get God's blessing (for he will be with whoever is doing His will). Not agreeing together may come from having too much fear of man or avoiding choosing words of agreement in submission to the Truth, the Life and the Way. This comes from worrying that people will disagree or get mad at you, and cut you out of the loop. Those fears can keep people enslaved and easily dominated or controlled by others. But Jesus calls Christians to freedom. ""He who the son sets free is free indeed."" Amen? This includes being free from controlling one another as well.


On goals, Paul said, ""I pursue as my goal the prize promised by God's high calling in Christ Jesus.

All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of such things. And if on some point you think differently (from others), that too God will make clear to you.

Only let us live up to what we have already attained."" (Philippians 3:14-16)

Go to a Lutheran church and ask the pastor about membership.
,The pastor will usually offer to take you through a Bible Instruction Class or meet with you to discuss the differences between Lutherans and other Christians.,After the class you are welcome to be a Lutheran member!,
Keep reading the Bible to grow your faith.",How to Become Lutheran,",,, Honestly believing the Bible isn't something that magically happens when you join a Lutheran church. It might take a while, but through reading the Bible and prayer, God can create real faith in your heart."
"
If you are unfamiliar with God, and don't know Him very well (i.e.,
Take a deep breath and try to clear your mind of all things that trouble you.,
Then, as you would speak to a friend or someone you really trust, unloosen your tongue and tell God all that bothers you.,
Don't try to be proud/boastful, or pray anything fancy: Try to address everything big in your life -- but nothing is too little to ask about or for help and wisdom.,
Remember that God has his own reasons, for His timeline, and so trust Him in that.,
Confess your sins to Him.,
Pray often.,
Ask your Christian friends about prayer, if you aren't the best at prayer, or look around and read articles online about how to pray effectively.

",How to Become Closer to God as a Christian1,": vaguely by name) then perhaps you should start by just locking yourself in your room. This will help you to feel that you are now alone with the Sustainer.;
, Then, say aloud, ""Hi, God. I saved this time for You. Will You please come and be close to me?"" This may feel absurd at first but know that God truly listens and cares. Remember, ""Ask and you shall receive."" There is also nothing wrong with asking for God to talk to you.

, Or, tell Him something you thank Him for that has recently happened to you (i.e.: thank Him if your team won a big game, someone you like asked you out, or you made a new friend). God listens and understands--always--so you won't have to feel silly.

, Prayer should not be only self-centered.

, You may not get exactly what you want when you want it, but He does everything for a reason.


Also realize that whatever happens may be a result of a ""third person(s)"" involved in personal actions/inaction, opposite of some of your prayers, and God does not contravene disagreeable parties. They, having free will, might not follow Christ or God, nor stop their misconduct that can involve you. It could, thus, depend (regrettably) on them.

, Pray for all your problems in your life right now, and other stuff that is really important to you. You can try making a prayer journal, if you aren't comfortable with praying, or you would like to record your petitions and their results.

, Though this may seem obvious, pray twice or more a day to God. Make sure the words come from your heart Imagine yourself coming before him and seeing his majesty as you pray. Worship his majesty! Yet, He wants to be your best friend forever , who is more than just and right, Holy God, The Judge, for ""He is Love"". He wants you to pray in the Spirit as well as in understanding. He wants you to pray for other people so that they will repent and so that they will be healed.

Know who Jesus is and what he did.,
Love him.,
Care for other people.,
Be learned and wise.,

Be considerate of others in all that you do.,
Watch your tone of voice, your style of language (don't curse, blaspheme, etc.).",How to Be More Like Jesus," Read the Bible to learn more about him. Acts 20:32 says that the Word of God is able to build you up.;
, Radiate that love with others. Jesus said in John 13:34-35 that people would know us if we had the agape love of God and demonstrate it to the world.


Have the right heart. Proverbs 4:23, ""Above all things keep your heart for out of it are the issues of life."" Proverbs 3:5, ""Trust in the Lord with all your Heart and rely not on your own understanding.""

, Treat others as you would like to be treated (Golden rule of Jesus in Matthew 7:12); think beyond yourself. Jesus forgave Peter even though Peter betrayed Jesus. Peter betrayed Jesus but Jesus would never betray Peter.

, Jesus grew in wisdom and stature and favor with both God and Man (Luke 2:52).

, After Jesus washed His disciples feet, He said, ""An example I have given you, that you should do likewise (John 13:15).


Deal with your pride and any boastfulness. Phil 2:5 says, ""Let this humble mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus"".
Be prepared to say sorry when you get something wrong.

, I Corinthians 13:4 says that love is always patient and kind. It was also through love that Jesus healed the sick and His desire was that His followers would do the same thing (Matthew 14:14, Matthew 10:7-8)

Think about God is always right next to you: He is always with you like a really close friend.,
Talk to your church's youth minister, priest, pastor or children's teacher about questions you have.,
Read the Bible.,
Don't make promises to God that you can't keep.,
Pay attention in church.,

The best way is to be honest in your thought, feeling, action.,
Resist violence and fights.,
If you are Catholic, go to Confession at least once every 2-3 months.,
Whether you're a child, a teenager, or adult -- try to ""hang around"" people of the same faith; so your own faith will grow stronger, including when 2, 3 or more persons agree for God to answer.",How to Become Closer to God as a Christian2," If you do this, you'll probably find yourself talking to God more and more. This automatically brings you closer to him. You will really benefit by worshiping God and seeking to be filled with the Holy Spirit.


Be aware that He can and will talk to you through your day to day life. He may talk into your heart during prayer (""Wow-I wouldn't have ever thought of that!"") or throughout the day through other people who never knew what you said in prayer, or circumstances that are so very unusual. Also, He is usually more interested in answering the ""Why?"" instead of the ""What?"" or the ""When?"" Sometimes He answers ""Yes"", sometimes ""No"", sometimes ""Not now""

, In general, they have studied the Bible and likely have asked many of your questions themselves. Ask that person things you want to know about God: why does He allow the free choice for us to sin; why does He allow/or (possibly) make His people suffer; how are there troubles when doing ""good""; why did He let His Son suffer, bleed and die on the cross for all people (even killers); why did Christ need to return to the Father in Heaven; why did He send the Holy Spirit, etc. You will learn many things about God that you didn't know. This information, also, will help you to explain God, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit to your non-Christian friends.

, Getting to know God will help you grow closer, and the Bible is the written word of God. What does He like? What does He dislike? What makes Him happy, sad or angry? What does He value? What does He think is foolishness? All these answers are in the book. Try to read your Bible daily through a reading plan. You can find tons of reading plans online, try to find one that you find works for you. Devotionals help because they explain passages in ways that relate to our lives, and explains a lot! You can buy your own, our find some online. A great book that spells out the promises of God, which are true even in the difficult times of life, is ""Always True"" by James MacDonald. He directs you to Scriptures that will encourage you and give you hope in tough times.

, And if you fail on a promise, go back and make amends with Him. Maybe He will want you to make amends to others. Maybe not. Recognize, when you pray, what your feelings are so that you can understand Him better. Open your heart and be honest-He already knows what's in your heart. YOU need to see what's in there-and be honest about it. If you lie, you are only lying to yourself because He already knows the truth.

, You'll learn a lot more and feel more in tune with God. Take notes in church!!! This helps tremendously and later on, you can review them and figure out how to apply principles to your own life.

, Singing in church, and doing the actions you're supposed to do (bow your head, stand up, sit down, etc.) is not enough. Volunteer as much as you can, help others, etc., and be blessed.

, God is purer than any person, so the more you are pure, the more, not only you, but God will touch your heart and fulfill your deepest desires.

, Stay balanced and ethically serene. Read the Bible for help on keeping an eternal cool.

, It will help you to live a more Christian life, and become closer to God.

, This doesn't mean you can't also be around people that don't believe, but whenever you pray, have faith for what you ask -- because -- if you don't believe, you won't become closer to God enough for a full, daily walk in Christ.

Choose a cross or crucifix.,
Consider having a priest or other religious leader bless the cross.,
Bless the cross yourself.,
For a publicly displayed Catholic cross or crucifix, have a priest recite the official blessing.",How to Bless a Cross1," A plain cross consists of only the shape of the cross, while a crucifix also has an image of Christ on the cross. Either can be blessed, but only the crucifix is used in most official Catholic and Orthodox ceremonies. Protestants typically prefer the bare cross, not the crucifix.


Many variations on the cross and crucifix exist, with different numbers and types of crossbars, and the appearance or lack of various letters. If you belong to a church, you may wish to ask your priest or minister what type of cross your denomination uses.
Some crucifixes include a skull beneath Christ's feet, representing the bones of Adam. This is more common in Catholic tradition, but is not required or banned by most denominations.;
, In many churches, including the Catholic church, a blessing from a priest, deacon, or other church leader is considered to be more effective than a layman's blessing. For a small cross, such as one you would wear around your neck, the blessing used is up to the priest.


One possible Catholic blessing: ""May this cross and the one who uses it be blessed, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.""One possible Orthodox blessing: ""O Creator and Author of mankind, Giver of spiritual graces and Bestower of eternal salvation: Do Thou, the same Lord, send down Thy Holy Spirit, with a blessing from on high, upon this cross, that, fortified by the might of heavenly protection, it may be potent unto bodily salvation and succor aid aid, unto all who shall desire to make use of it, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.""For more information on the difference between a priest's blessing and another person's, see the section on using the blessed cross.

, Blessing the cross yourself may not carry the same effect as a priest's blessing, but anyone may plea to God to bless their cross or other object. You may recite any prayer while doing so, for instance one of the following:


Lord, bless this Cross that it may be an instrument of Your Divine Mercy in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
Bless this Cross in the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

, While the Bible does not include any rituals for blessing the cross, the Catholic church has created a collection of official rituals called the Rituale Romanum. Here is a solemn blessing intended for crosses for display, such as on the wall of a church:"
"
Understand sacramentals.,
Understand the nature of a blessing without a priest.,
Wear small crosses or crucifixes with respect.,
Learn how to dispose of an old cross.",How to Bless a Cross2," In official Catholic practice, and in most other denominations, sacramental objects are most commonly created by God through the church, not through laymen. Sacramental objects, also called minor sacraments in the Orthodox tradition, potentially have similar, but not identical, effects, as the sacraments, which are rites of extreme importance to the church. Even within the same denomination, experts disagree on how effective sacramentals are, but according to some theologians, a cross blessed by a priest may be able to ward off evil or forgive venial (slight) sins.Protestant denominations have fewer official sacraments, and often avoid using the term.

, An unordained person is welcome to conduct blessings, but these are pleas to God, not the ordained creation of a sacramental object. There are no guarantees that the cross will become holy, or consecrated. It may not be suitable for use in church ceremonies until it has received an official blessing by a church leader.

, The Catholic church doesn't give mandatory instructions for how to wear a small cross. Wear it as you like, but treat it with reverence. Do not wear it as a fashion statement or jewelry. Catholics are discouraged from wearing the cross in a manner that causes scandal or offense, even if you do not consider it disrespectful., A cross loses its blessing if it is sold for a profit, or if it is substantially broken. If it hasn't been broken, you may have the cross blessed a second time. If you are disposing of it instead, melt or break it into pieces to remove the appearance of a cross. You may use the melted metal for another purpose, or bury the pieces to return it to the earth.

Read the Bible and pray asking God to guide you in by the Bible.,
Learn about Christianity, particularly the beliefs of the Pentecostal church, which actually has countless different groups worldwide.

,
Compare the doctrinal beliefs with the Bible, or be prepared to find out more and consider it with an open mind.,
Find your local Pentecostal church (Assembly of God, Pentecostal Church of God, Pentecostal, Revival Centers Intl.),
Meet the Pastor.

,
Attend a service and participate in the service.,
Live a life guided by the Bible.

,
Follow the teachings of Jesus.,
Notice that it's quite fundamental Christian doctrine of the apostle Paul!.,See what Jesus taught, ""You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth""(Acts 1:8)

",How to Become a Pentecostal Christian," Although it's not compulsory it might be a good idea to pray with a Pentecostal as they would hopefully be able to help. Ask God for forgiveness for all of your sins, and study His word (possibly, keep a journal/notebook of your studies). Pentecostals believe that prayer is a person's way to talk to God, and that ""rightly dividing"" the Word of Truth (The Bible) -- and so, measuring out its meanings correctly, is your final authority for answering all doctrinal questions. Intuition, leadings, callings must align with the scriptures of the Bible.


Say the prayer in Ephesians 1:16-23 for wisdom and revelation for yourself.







,, Pentecostals take a great deal of their core beliefs from the book of Acts which depicts the early church as it began from scratch a Jerusalem. The first two chapters of Acts are especially pertinent as that tells of the establishment of the Church upon the day of Pentecost.

, by looking in your phone book. Call the church for service times.

,, Pentecostal services are participatory occasions.

,, The Holy Spirit was promised by Jesus: He said, ""I must go away. If I do not go away the Holy Spirit will not come."" He said, ""I will send the Holy Spirit that He may comfort and guide you, and He shall be with you forever.""

, ""Be filled with the Spirit""(Ephesians 5:18)


And the early Church prayed for others to receive the Holy Spirit in Acts 8:15.;

Keep it simple.,
Remember that you're not alone.,
Get involved with your church.,
Learn about your faith.,
Read the Bible.,
Pray for strength.",How to Be Proud of Being a Christian," Everybody has their opinion and interpretation of how to be proud of being a Christian. Before you get into details, remember these key points:


Pray to have the strength and guidance.
Study the scriptures regularly and thoroughly.
Keep in mind that you are blessed for acting like you should.
Keep The Spirit(Holy Ghost) with you.;
, The last thing you want to do is fall into the misconception that you are the only Christian on Earth. In fact, 83 percent of Americans claim to be Christians (43 percent claimed in 2007, and only 32% actually attended church). Don't feel like a persecuted minority, because you certainly aren't.

, Go to services often. Get involved with the youth group if you're a teenager. Organize or attend a Bible study. Start a Christian book club. The idea behind all these things is to put you together with other like-minded individuals. Building your friendships from your church will remove any doubt from your mind that you are on your Christian journey alone.

, Understand the sacrifices which have been made to keep Christianity alive. Be proud to be part of the institution which Christ himself founded, and which men and women over the years have shed their blood to protect.

, Why? It will build your faith! Jesus knows that your walk as Christian will not be easy, but He has let us know that He is with us. Matthew 5:11-12 says: ""'Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.'""

, Prayer, your hot line to God, is the best way to stay intimate with your Creator. The better you know God, the more proud you will be that you are among His follower. Group prayer is helpful as well. Once again, building a community of faith is invaluable in building your confidence in your religion.

"
Look into other denominations, not just Baptist.,
Ask for their sheet of beliefs called fundamental beliefs, basic tenets, ""Statement of Fundamental Truths"", ""What we believe"" or such.

,
If you have decided that you are picking Baptist, make sure you do one last check.,
Decide which Baptist denomination you want to pick.,
Look online for a Baptist Church near you, and decide when to attend it.

,
Attend that particular church and decide whether you want to stay.,
Talk to the Pastor about becoming Baptist, and he will give you instructions.

,
He'll ask you if you have accepted Jesus into your heart.,
Next you want to get baptized, you may have already become Christian according to Baptists, but you have not become ""baptist"" yet.",How to Become Baptist," There are many other beautiful denominations out there. These include, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican (similarly Episcopal), Methodist, Presbyterian, United Christian, Churches of Christ; Church of God and Assembly of God called ""full gospel"" (and other Pentecostal groups), ""nondenominational"" and many others.;
,, Compare Baptist theology to the Bible and to the early church to make sure you feel 100% on becoming a Baptist.

, There are many of them so it may take a while to decide. The biggest denomination of Baptist is the Southern Baptist Convention, so you may want to join them.

,, If you decide you don't like it, look for other churches.

,, If you have, you're all set with that part. If you have not, he may ask you to say a simple prayer accepting Jesus. After that you're done.

, You will become a ""baptist"" when you're baptized. So make a date with the Pastor on when your baptism will be and then get baptized.

Recognize that the primary way that God will lead you is through your conscience and the Bible (Romans 8:14-16, John 17:17).,
For your conscience to be a good guide, you must avoid associating with sinners or it will contaminate your spirit (2 Corinthians 7:1).

,
Ask God for Guidance (Jeremiah 33:3, James 1:5, John 16:13).

,
Be still (Psalms 46:10).

,
You must be able to perceive the No's before you actually get guidance (I Corinthians 14:10, Acts 16:6-7, Acts 27:10).,
The next type of leading is when God is silent.,
The next type of leading is the green light where I feel joy or peace or God's presence.",How to Be Led by the Holy Spirit," Even Jesus followed His conscience (Mark 2:8).;
,,,, Paul says that there are many voices in the world and they all have their significance. There is the voice of diet, exercise, education, mastering a trade, but what is God telling you to do? When I perceive a ""No"", I usually do not feel good inside and God is trying to warn me that If I proceed, there will be danger or failure.

, This is where I do not have any leading in my conscience. God is saying, ""Wait it is not His timing or it is not His will."" In I Kings 13, the younger prophet lost his life when he proceeded without a leading from God.

, This is God saying, ""Yes"" and sometimes it comes with a revelation as to what to do (like Acts 16 and Acts 27), you just know supernaturally what to do inside your conscience.

"
"
Can you avoid saying ""I don't know.,
Consider building your faith by saying: ""I will strengthen my faith.,
Expect ministering spirits (angels) to help: they are ready to protect you and your children if possible -- if they are believing and living for God...~ ""Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?..."",
Pray that you, like the original Christians, would not recant: so, some were even thrown to the Roman lions in the Roman arenas as entertainment/punishment.,
Consider the possibility of dying for your beliefs: such as, would the early Christians have died as martyrs, if beliefs were not tested to their individual satisfactions.,
Check the biblical evidence.,
Glorify God by living out the words of Jesus -- if you believe the writings that indicate this would be a better world if everyone did what Jesus said according to the Bible.

,
Seek the Spirit of Christ, be saved, as you decide that the Word of God is reliable and trustworthy, and true in precepts (commands) and concepts.,
Be Blessed by living the Biblical attitudes that would make you more like Jesus, which are called the ""beatitudes"" -- and receive many blessings promised by Jesus for those who have the right attitudes that ""hunger and thirst after righteousness,"" and that are: ""poor in spirit (humble),"" meek (disciplined), merciful, ""pure in heart,"" peacemakers, and may be ""persecuted for the name of Christ."",
Decide whether the Bible is prophetically precise about Jesus as the Messiah.

,
Check that Bible manuscripts, and translations to other languages and copies are pure so that they are very highly dependable in detail.

,
Verify that the Bible is archaeologically accurate too: as to the sites of the end of times and other sites of Israel including The Plain of Megiddo, for Armageddon.

,
Check the Dead Sea Scrolls as a possible verification of the age and accuracy of ""The Old Testament"" (Tanakh).,
Look into questions and access the veracity of Jesus' resurrection.,
Read about a dead man living again as predicted:~ ""For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.,
Check on this: if science can clone a life -- God can do much more than clone a life.,
Decide whether the resurrection happened as reported in the Bible.,
Examine the evidence.,
Read the witness of all the people who saw Jesus alive after His Crucifixion.,
Consider the biblical evidence: the tomb was empty though it was guarded by troops of the Roman army, and realize that Jesus appeared in a number of places after His resurrection, and showed people his wounds and ate with them.

,
Study Biblically that there were over 500 who saw him.,
Read how there is much more to it than just His making a claim.,
Read how He was speaking of the temple of his body for which He foretells his resurrection as the Son of God, by His own power; Jesus said:~ ""Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days..."" He indicated he would permit them to destroy it:~ ""No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord.,
Check the point that Jesus walked on water.,
Read that He fed 5000 in a crowd by multiplying a few fish.,
Determine how much you trust the Bible and Jesus; trust in his resurrection, His truth, etc.,
Investigate the Bereans' eagerness to study the Scriptures every day to find out if what they have been taught about Christ is Truth according to the scriptures... ,
Consider what the Bible says about upholding a standard and will you raise up a standard of belief.",How to Believe Scriptures Biblically (Christianity),""": and, instead say ""I have faith."" -- or -- ""I believe.""~ ""If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say..."", Jesus asked. ~ ""And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him..."" ,""~ ""But, how shall they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a teacher? ..."" ~ ""But the Scriptures ... offer the promise by faith in Jesus Christ that might be given to those who believe."" ~ ""... but is now revealed and made known to all Gentiles everywhere, so that they, too, might believe and obey... the Scriptures of the prophets..."" , ,, Christianity was evidently believed by them as verified well enough to die for., That information leads to the doctrine of eternal life through Jesus who is called: the ""Truth"", the ""Life"" and the ""Way"". The person Jesus Christ, the ""Messiah"", the anointed ""Son of Man,"" and the only begotten ""Son of God"" are all used to depict Jesus. Consider basing your decision on the fact that Jesus is not just a good man or a great prophet according to the ""New Testament."" When you have done all then stand:~ ""Because of the proof given by this ministry, they will glorify God for your obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all,"" ,, That includes deciding that the Bible is accurate.

,

,,,, Tanakh - the English acronym of the initial letters TNK of the Hebrew names for the ""Torah,"" t(tôrâ); the Prophets, n(nədî'îm), and ""Writings"", k(kətûbôt).

, It is supported by evidence.

, Thou wilt show me the path of life: in thy presence is fullness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore."" , God can cause Jesus to live his life in the same body based on God as all powerful -- so that is no problem for Him!

, Many scientists believe it could indeed happen if they believe in God's existence and as an all powerful being.

, The evidence is there -- that Jesus rose from the dead. If he did, that is absolutely significant. No one else has done that. Therefore, what Jesus said would be on a higher order: Truth.

, That they were honest and were willing to give their lives for that truth that they held dearly...

,, You have the facts of what they attested to. See whether you believe that the Bible is not just symbolic. See the symbolic use of it also: but the Bible is not just good -- but reliable, like infallible. Verify to your own satisfaction that the Bible is textually reliable and that the Bible was written by eye witnesses. But looking inside yourself to find the best in yourself is not good enough.

, Jesus is shown to have backed up His words with what He did. Jesus foretold his death saying:~ ""When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what I have heard from my Father..."";
, I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again..."" .

, He read the hearts (purposes) of people. Jesus calmed a storm with a spoken command.

, Raised several people from the dead. He healed many people.


What did He say when he was talking about good and bad.
And what about when he said he would rise from the dead.

,


Be patient; ""for the Lord's Coming"" is near ... It is ""the last hour; the end of all things"" is near ... Many ""Anti-Christs have already appeared"" ... Yes, ""I am coming soon"" Jesus... ,, Refuse to accept doubt. Begin to praise God when negative thoughts may come to mind then replace them with praising God... He lives in and through His people who believe Him:~ ""God inhabits the praises of his people (ie: Israel) the believers."" If you really believe Him, then you will have plenty of praise for Him...

Attend Church regularly.,
If you are not already, become Baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.,
Attend either Bible study or catechism classes.,
When studying the Old Testament, read up on all the Prophecies which had been fulfilled by Christ.,
Read other ancient Christian writings too, such as the writings of the Church Fathers.,
Learn both the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed.,
Pray daily to our Lord Jesus.,
Visit Churches that believe in the Literal Presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament, so that you may bathe in His Presence, and adore Him in person.",How to Believe in Jesus," It may help you to come to faith. He lives in our hearts by faith. When you come to the point of trusting Him enough to ask Him for your salvation, He will live in your heart, also.;
, That is how one becomes Born Again in Christ the Lord.

, You also have the option to read the Bible at home yourself, however, it is far better to be taught by someone who is knowledgeable in Sacred scripture. Jesus said, ""And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you."" John 14:16-17) And,""However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come.John 16:13

, In most Bibles in their 'help' section you will find a list of fulfilled prophesies.

, Type into your search program names such as Fenelon, Molinos, and Guyon to name a few.

, This will help you articulate your own faith in God and begin to form your own statement of faith as you form your beliefs.

, You will find it becomes a two way conversation as you also wait upon Him to speak back to you... with a thought or perhaps a verse that comes to your mind. He wants to commune with you just as much as you want to know Him. He also wants you to call upon Him when you have need! Psalm 50:15 ""And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me."" And you have the promise that He will answer you! Psalm 91:15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

, But know also that,in sincerity, you may at anytime and anywhere, enter His Presence and worship Him.

Learn about Jesus, and believe that He died, rose from the dead as your Savior, and then talk to the one, true God.,
Tell others that ""There is one Christ Jesus, the Son of God, who is Lord and Savior for everyone who believes, repents and follows him:"" which should include going to Christian meetings, being baptized as a sign of accepting your new life, seeking to be filled and led by the Holy Spirit, praying to God, showing God's love by kindness, forgiving others, making peace, agreeing in prayer with other believers, and when you sin asking for (and accepting) forgiveness, expecting consequences for some wrongs and going on, all in Christ Jesus' holy name -- with God the Father as the one, true Judge of all things good or bad.

",How to Be Born Again,"



Respect God: ""The fear (respect) of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge..."" (Proverbs 1:7), ""He that believes and is baptized shall be saved, and he that disbelieves shall be condemned."" (Mark 16:16) You must believe in Jesus Christ. You can be baptized either way. But, you are not saved, if you don't have faith in Jesus Christ. In John 14:6 Jesus said to him, ""I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me...""

, (John 3:7)Jesus said, ""I tell you... unless you repent: you shall all likewise perish."" (Luke 13:5),, So, if you are saved, converted from your old life, ""reborn spiritually"", then you have received the Holy Spirit as Jesus said:


""But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you."" (John 16:7)The Holy Spirit is as Jesus promised -- ""... a comforter to abide with you forever..."" who shall help understanding and remembering the things of God -- and

""You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses to Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria and to the remotest part of the earth"" (Acts 1:8)

"
Look to God's absolute perfection.,
Think of holiness as the character of God.,
Reflect on God's command to holiness.,
Belong to God and thirst for holiness.,
Prepare your mind and heart.,
Avoid moralism.Many people often get the wrong idea about holiness and think that it can be achieved simply by following a strict set of rules.,
Set yourself apart.,
Practice self-control.,
Do not tolerate sin.For the most part, this means being intolerant of sin in your own life.,
Die to self but love who you are.,
Consider working catalysts into your daily routine.,
Pray for holiness.",How to Be Holy," God is perfect in every way possible: perfect in love, perfect in mercy, perfect in anger, perfect in justice, and so on. This perfection is directly connected to the holiness of God.God is without temptation and without sin. As indicated by James 1:13, ""God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one.""
The things that God does and desires may not always make sense from a human perspective, but being a believer means trusting that God's actions, commands, and desires are all perfect, even when you cannot comprehend them.;
, God is holy, but in another sense, God is holiness itself defined. There is nothing or no one more holy than God, and holiness itself is only fully embodied in God.


God is unlike any other, and God's holiness is the root of that ""otherness.""
Mankind can never be perfectly holy as God is, but humans should seek to emulate God's holiness since humans were created in the likeness of God.

, Striving for holiness in your own life is something that God has commanded you to do as a believer. The task at hand might seem overwhelming, but you should take comfort in the knowledge that God will never ask or demand you to do something you cannot do. As such, holiness is within your reach.


In Leviticus 11:44, God states, ""For I am the Lord your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy.""
Later, in 1 Peter 1:16, God reiterates, ""Be Holy, for I am Holy.""
By understanding how God moves in your life, you can train yourself to trust in God and never give up the hope of heaven. This sort of hope provides you with an anchor, and this anchor can keep you grounded in God's truth in your pursuit of holiness.

, True holiness will only come once you give your fully life to God. In doing so, you will recognize how you have starved for holiness in the past and how you hunger and thirst for it in the present.


To belong to God, you must be “born again.” In other words, you need to accept Christ and let the Holy Spirit work in your life.
Before you can truly ""thirst"" for holiness, you need to reach an understanding about why it is important for you to do as God wants. God does not demand things from you simply to test you. Instead, God wants what is best for your eternal well-being and issues commands to you based on that.
Even though humanity naturally thirsts for holiness, the world offers so many distractions that the appetite for holiness is often spoiled. The distractions of the world will never offer the spiritual nourishment the soul needs, however.

, Even though it is possible to achieve holiness, doing so is not often easy. You need to dedicate your mind and your heart to the practice if you have any hope of accomplishing the task.


In 1 Peter 1:13-14, the believer is instructed to ""gird up the loins of your mind."" If transcribed more literally, it would mean, ""prepare your mind for action.""
Setting your mind to action means making a clear, determined effort to abandon sinfulness and follow God in holiness.
There will be plenty of outside influences that try to lead you astray. If you do not fix your mind on a clear, definite goal, you are more likely to slip off the path you need to walk down in order to reach it.

, Rules and rituals have their place, but when you start to care more about looking holy than being holy, you tread into the realm of moralism.


For example, if you pray in public for the sake of being seen by other people, your attitude toward prayer is not as healthy as it could be. You can pray in public if the situation warrants it, but when you do so, your prayers must be for the sake of communicating with God.
There is nothing inherently wrong with being viewed as a spiritual or religious person, but that view must come about naturally. You must abandon the desire to appear holy to other people. If people still develop that view of you after the fact, then there is nothing wrong with it, but there is no guarantee that those around you will perceive your desire for holiness.

, As noted, God's law does have a part to play regarding holiness. God commands his believers to set themselves apart from the sinfulness of the world. This does not mean shutting yourself off from the secular world, but it does mean following God's law even with secularism criticizes you for doing so.In Leviticus 20:26, God explains, ""And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you from the other people, that ye should be mine.""
In essence, being ""severed"" from other people means severing yourself from the worldliness of other people. You need to sever yourself from influences that are not of God.
Understand that you do not need to shut yourself away in a monastery or convent to severe yourself from worldliness. You do exist in the world, and if God did not want you here, God would not have placed you here.

, You will never escape temptation, even if you do start exercising holiness in your life. When you face temptation, though, you will need to control the harmful desire to give into it to maintain any degree of holiness.


Temptation does not always come in a tangible form. It is relatively easy for many people to resist the temptation of stealing something from the store or physically hurting someone who angers you. It is much more difficult to resist the root temptations of greed and hate, though.
To really practice self-control, you need to do more than simply stopping the obvious sins. You need to guard yourself against the weaknesses of character that can distract you from God. These weaknesses include things like pride, envy, greed, hate, slothfulness, gluttony, and lust., Being intolerant of sin also means rejecting it in the world around you, though. No matter how much you may love someone, when that person sins, you must not make excuses for the sin or accept the sin itself.


Words like ""intolerance"" and ""judgment"" are often thrown around carelessly and used as criticisms, but the concepts themselves are not wicked. After all, few would claim that it is a bad thing to be intolerant of hate or to judge something as safe or dangerous. The error lies not with intolerance itself, but how it is practiced.
Be intolerant of sin, but do not use that intolerance as a justification for hating others. God is all that is good, and love is good above all else.
At the same time, you should not allow the love and sympathy you have for others to blind you to sinfulness. You cannot judge or control the hearts of others, but you should not accept someone else's sin as ""right"" since doing so damages the purity of your own heart.

, Dying to self means surrendering any desire that is not of God. That being said, God created you to be who you are, so you need not despise your existence.If anything, you need to love yourself in the same way that God loves you before you can approach God's level of holiness.


God created you just as you are, which means that you are beautiful just as you are. Your beauty includes all of your struggles, weaknesses, and past mistakes.
Even though you are beautiful just as you are, you also need to recognize your struggles and weaknesses for what they are. Seeking holiness means committing to the practice of leaving these vices behind for the sake of God.

, Some spiritual practices can serve as catalysts that help propel you toward a holier, more enriched existence. You do not always need to practice these catalysts to be holy, but they may guide you toward holiness when used.


For instance, in order to strive for holiness over the way you view food and eating, you could try fasting for one day, or even for half a day.
In some cases, holiness in a certain area of your life cannot be achieved without practicing the catalyst, even though the catalyst itself is not holiness. For instance, you must love and submit yourself to your spouse in order to have a holy marriage, and you must love your enemies in order to have holy relationships overall., Being holy is a difficult task and cannot be done in the absence of God. Prayer is a powerful resource—one of the most powerful tools available to the believer, in fact—so praying for holiness on a regular basis can help you become and remain holier.


Your prayers for holiness do not need to be long, extravagant, or eloquent. Something simple is perfectly fine as long as you pray it from your heart.
For example, your prayer could be as simple as, ""God, let me thirst for holiness more than I thirst for worldliness, and make me holy in every aspect of my character and actions.""

"
Humble yourself as Jesus said: ""Blessed are the 'poor in spirit': for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.,
Repent, be sorry for your bad deeds, accept responsibility, and be willing to change for the better.,
Be unassuming, non-egotistical.,
Seek right ways with an appetite for good.,
Show mercy.,
Be pure through faith.,
Be a peacemaker and be especially blessed!.,
Accept persecution.,
Accept persecution (meant for Him).,
""Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad: for great is your reward in Heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.",How to Be Blessed (Christianity),"""(Matthew 5:3) Read this and the other eight blessings for you as they were explained by Jesus, in Matthew 5, which are keys to unlocking such personal blessings.


Jesus promises that the poor in spirit can enter His Kingdom in this life! The Kingdom of God, Jesus said, ""is within you"" as Christ ""lives there"" -- as his presence, his Spirit, can be vital to you. Jesus said that ""I must go to my Father""... ""send you another comforter to abide with you forever.""
The words ""poor in spirit"" mean not finding special pleasure in yourself/your-life, and though you have been taught to be self-sufficient and proud of your reasoning and independence: still you may become smaller in your own eyes. If you are ready to depend on God's will for your blessings -- not ignoring God and not managing your own life and not making your choices all alone, not to be merely limited by ""self"", then you are ready to be blessed.
When you admit your limitations to Him--then you are humble, and God can then move in you and move you into his presence -- in the Kingdom of Heaven -- and begin blessing your life.;
, ""Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.""(Matthew 5:4)


In this beatitude Jesus puts value on grief and repentance evidently that would be helping the suffering of others and grief for your own flaws. So mourn and--in the first beatitude--you were told to become humble, ""smaller"" in your own eyes, and rely on God.
Ordinary activities of life do not bring real joy, not like faith, hope and God's Love do. Daily life may leave you thinking: ""If only I had ____"" (fill in the blank); it leaves you feeling your regrets, for what has been lost: lost peace, joy, hope -- and you may find yourself with ""a broken spirit"" -- a hurting attitude about life.

Regret your past sins, such as your damages to others -- and the time that you may have been against or ignoring and lacking God's blessing. Forgiving others removes selfishness and the guilt of ""self-centered"" life.
So He lets you accept forgiveness. Your guilt is removed through God's grace. You are blessed, and you know God is real.

, ""Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.""(Matthew 5:5)


Here in the third beatitude (again) there is a word that gives some negative feelings: Meek may imply weak--as in lacking spirit or courage. No! Be strong but not violent, and be able to endure problems with patience--not resenting other people or God, made possible by receiving Christ's Spirit in you.
Jesus described himself as: ""I am meek and gentle."" He was able to handle conflicts, insults, crisis without egotism as in: ""He's got it all together"".
So He said that the non-aggressors would ""inherit the earth""; eventually you receive the unearned gift of being a sister or brother of The King in The Kingdom of Jesus. The recipient of the gift is an heir who, without personal effort, takes control and ownership of property -- your environment -- as you yield control of your existence in Christ to God's ways. Man was to have dominion over the Earth.
God will dwell with you, in harmony and will control the path set in front of you to make it acceptable to God, productive and satisfying in Christ as you follow the path set by The Lord. Remember God will not deny any good thing, but not everything is expedient (some personal ventures might not follow the Lord's path).

, ""Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.""(Matthew 5:6)


Most people imagine themselves pure. You have never heard, ""I did that to be mean and foolish."" Doing any angry or revengeful act is embarrassing when your mistakes become public.
You need to make righteous choices for your own sake. It makes life easier. The apostle Paul spoke of a dilemma, ""I do not fully control my actions. I do not do what I want, but do what I would not do.""

Guilt and human nature makes your soul ""hunger and thirst"" for right choices and habitual righteousness; just like when you say, ""I need something to eat and drink, now!"" Also, built into you is a hunger to be right. You want to be seen as right.

Righteousness is the food and drink of your spiritual health: free from guilt, shame and sin: depend on God's promise to grow his righteousness in you.

, ""Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.""(Matthew 5:7)


You do not need to use complete sentences in your prayers -- just say ""Thank You Lord!""; ""Mercy..."", or simply talk to Him, ""God..."" or something like, ""Oh, God..."". Just be merciful so that He will hear you when you ask for mercy. God is merciful and ""will have mercy on whom he will have mercy"" (compassion).

Inhumanity of man against others has always been a force in history. So that the past history reveals selfish, inconsiderate, and cruel -- oppressing habits that cause poverty, slavery, being disinterested in social unrest, not working these things out with generous mercy, but with great indifference instead, not seeing the needs of the hurting.
Jesus tied your receiving God's mercy with your giving mercy to others. The more mercy you give out, the more you will receive -- ""as you sow, so shall you reap."" You see that your mercy brings reward.

, ""Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.""(Matthew 5:8)


Are there any popular radio, TV, talk shows, movies that consider purity and chastity as entertainment? Purity is found by concentrating on and dedicating to and seeking to right what is wrong, first in your own life, by God's will and purpose. But realize that Jesus said, ""You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."" (Matthew 7:5) -- which points out that one has to not judge others' behaviors, or be a hypocrite.
Your loving God will reward you in his presence by spiritual means. So it lets you ""see"" God, free from the pollution of mixed up desires in thoughts, words and deeds.
""Cleanse your mind; clean up your act"" and in the fullest sense as God himself removes your desire for impure thinking and impure ways of acting. God purifies your being from the inside.
""Seeing"" God: knowing him as your Father (by being in His presence) is the blessing promised in this beatitude.

, ""Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called 'the children' of God.""(Matthew 5:9)



Peace is a nice idea, as long as you get your way, but it's more than that. It starts at home: Love your wife... -- and have personal peace and love in Jesus. That starts by not returning evil for evil. He said, Turn the other cheek. Do what is asked of you and forgive each other.

Love unconditionally--treating the other as one would like to be treated, if the two roles were suddenly reversed: So, be kind to your enemy. Never overreact--just let revenge stop now! Hostility stops with you -- impossible? No! He empowers you. Peace may be found by doing something as simple as giving a difficult person a nice new pencil, a package of chips or a coupon for a free sandwich, if that makes sense.
His grace is sufficient; pass it on. God ""walks"" with you, overseeing your life as you walk in his path, handling difficulties for you (""Bless and curse not!"") in His own way, and protecting your person, even through the valley of the shadow of death. He continuously sends blessing, both spiritually and materially.
Your Father in Heaven can give you what your heart/core desires (deep, right feeling), fulfilling real needsby his grace and through your faith. Peacemaking brings God with His peace and harmony into your life.

, ""Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.""(Matthew 5:10)


Some bad news--""persecutions,"" if you are righteous -- but don't worry! You will be blessed with the benefits of the Kingdom of Heaven, if you are harassed because your life is in Christ and his newness of life is in you.
Well, you are different -- if you are in Christ. This threatens those who don't understand life's basis: spiritual life. You have put God first, and so your outlook seems to be crazy to others, who do not agree. You are just ""crazy enough"" to have the best in this life and in the life to come.

, ""Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you 'falsely,' for my sake.""(Matthew 5: 11) This is like people harshly criticizing (reviling) you because of your calling Jesus Christ the Lord.


No persecution is not the end of this thought; there is still the blessing. There is so much more blessing than the negative part... there is the rejoicing and being very glad.

,""(Matthew 5: 12)


Yes, He says you should rejoice because of the fact that you endure problems and troubles with people because you believe and live in His life.
So, rejoice through your troubles and through your weakness--for in Him you are made strong (that's another blessing), and you have a great reward in Heaven.

Bring others to Christ.",How to Be Filled with the Holy Spirit," Most people are guilty of being a little stubborn. Maybe you think you've got everything worked out and you know all the right answers, but if you really want to be filled with the Holy Spirit, you need to accept that you maybe still have a few things to learn. Open your mind to all possibilities, so that God can lead the way.;
, You probably also think you know God, and you may, but it can only help you if you open yourself up to new spiritual experiences. You can't tell God who to be, only He can show you. Find new ways of worship or see how other churches work, in order to open your spirit. God will show you the right way when you do.

, You can even stop reading this advice if you want to but the most important thing is to start using your own judgement. God gave you Reason for a reason. You don't need someone to interpret the word of God for you, you can read a Bible. You can research and learn until you can read the Bible better than anyone else. Then, use your own judgement to tell you what God wants. He won't let you be led astray...but as a wise man once said, ""Fear a man who pulls from one book.""


Be especially wary of those that try to tell you that you have to speak in tongues in order to know that you are filled with the Holy Spirit. Speaking in tongues is a spiritual gifts, but it is one of 15 spiritual gifts that the Holy Spirit might give you when he fills you. When the Holy Spirit enters the people in Acts 2, they speak in tongues, yes. But these aren't gibberish made up languages. God gives people from different countries the ability to talk to each other across language barriers. What this means is that being filled with the Holy Spirit is more about overcoming differences and getting together in a love of God.

, Once you've opened yourself to God and stopped listening to every word out of the mouth of mortals as if they were the next gospel, look in your heart and you will find what you need. This will grow your faith and open your heart for the Holy Spirit to fill you, in an extra way. Every Christian receives the Holy Spirit when they are saved, but you can ask God for an extra filling of the Holy Spirit whenever you want. God has filled your heart with his knowledge, and when you look there and think about what feels right to you, you will find what you are looking for. God will not lead you astray. The devil may have his tricks but when we see them, we know them for what they are in our hearts.

, You're probably having a hard time in life right now. That's why you're seeking a better relationship with God, right? Seek this relationship with God but remember that you must begin by respecting yourself. Stop doing the things that are making your life harder and begin to respect yourself and work for a better life. For the Bible tells us, ""So, brothers and sisters, because of God’s mercies, I encourage you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice that is holy and pleasing to God. This is your appropriate priestly service. Don’t be conformed to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds so that you can figure out what God’s will is—what is good and pleasing and mature."" (Romans 12:1-2). This means that you are the most important thing to God and that living your life well is the best way to give him thanks. Do this first, and you will be ready for the Holy Spirit.

, The next part in the process is all about giving the Holy Spirit a place in your life. You can start by finding where that place has been in the past. Think of times in your life that were really difficult or that really challenged your faith. Not little things like having an argument with a friend but big things like losing a loved one or getting fired from a job you really needed.

, Look at these tests and think about why you were being tested in those instances. Look at the good things that came out of those situations or the lessons that you learned. Find why God was testing you at those times and what He wanted you to gain from your experiences.

, Look at the trials in your life right now. Everyone has them. These can be big or small. Now, why are you being tested? Think about what God is trying to tell you now. Maybe you didn’t learn your lesson before, about procrastination or coveting or jealousy, and now God’s trying again. Maybe it’s a whole new lesson. Look for your failings and you will find God’s reasons.

, Once you find God’s reasons for testing you, take a lesson from the experiences you’re having. See where the Holy Spirit can help you improve your life and the lives of those around you.

, Thank God and your Lord Jesus Christ for the lessons they have brought you and appreciate the role they are playing in your life now. Once you recognize this place that the Holy Spirit has in your life, you will be much better able to be filled with the Holy Spirit.

, Begin letting God and the Holy Spirit into your life by praying. Pray every day if you can, in private or in church. Just have conversations with God and get used to having this spiritual time. With time, you will feel filled with the Holy Spirit whenever you pray, as well as when you go about your day normally.

, If you’re having trouble connecting with the Holy Spirit, one common way to feel more connected to God is to sing. Sings songs of praise to the Lord and let that spiritual feeling fill your body and soul. There are lots of great songs of praise, from hard rock to gospel choirs. You can find a song for almost any mood you’re in or any trial you’re suffering.


Try listening to Damion Suomi’s ""The Lion, The Ram and The Fish"" when you’re feeling like you’re having trouble being a good Christian.
Sing ""His Eye is on the Sparrow"" if you’re feeling like you just can’ win in life.
Try ""In Christ Alone"" if you’re feeling happy and fulfilled in Christ.

, You can read the Bible to feel even closer to God and the Holy Spirit. Turn randomly to let the Holy Spirit guide you to the right passage for you, if you don’t feel like reading all the way through.

, Schedule a nice long talk with your priest, pastor, or other preferred spiritual leader. They can help you go through some specially chosen passages, lead you in a prayer, or help you find God’s hand in the trials of your life. Remember, while you don’t need to follow their every word, spiritual leaders are there to help you and can be very useful when you’re feeling alone and confused.

, You can meet in groups at school, go to a full church, or just hang out with other Christians you know. Getting together to pray and talk about your trials will really help bring the Holy Spirit into your life and theirs!

, Just assuming that you know everything and that you know how things really are can close you off to the signs that God is trying to send to you. Maybe you’ve been praying for a good man to marry, but totally ignored that new guy at the office because he isn’t what you pictured. Whatever the case, stop trying to control everything and just stand back and look at your life. Accept the road of life as it comes and appreciate it for what it is.

, God will send you signs, when he wants you to take a certain path. The more you communicate with the Holy Spirit and let it fill you, the easier it will be to remove yourself from your current situation long enough to see what God is trying to tell you.

, There will always be people trying to tell you what’s right and wrong, whether you’re at home, in school, in church, or even just watching TV. When you are getting a lot of mixed messages, remember to look to your own moral compass. Not just the fed back information that other people have given you but that piece of your soul where God tells you what’s really right and wrong.


If you feel uncomfortable with something a spiritual leader or other trusted individual tells you (gays are evil, animals evolved without help, whatever), look inside yourself to decide for yourself what the truth is.
This may be hard to do and you may need to spend a lot of time researching and praying on an issue before you come to a conclusion, but that’s okay. Truth is usually hard won, but the sweetest reward, and you will be more comfortable in your relationship with the Holy Spirit.

, You will feel filled with the Holy Spirit most of all when you get out and do good works. God and Jesus are both pleased when you are making the world a better place and bringing hope and salvation to all. You can volunteer in big ways or just help out in small ways, do everything from going on a mission or building houses with Habitat for Humanity or just donate food to your local soup kitchen. Do whatever feels right to you.


Remember that sometimes it’s easier to bring people to Christ by showing them God’s love, rather than telling them about it. Evangelizing isn’t always the best road!
God’s favored causes are healing the sick, helping the poor, and delivering the oppressed. Find the people who are truly those things and help them, to bring yourself closer to Christ.

, Jesus taught us that it is most important to love your fellow man, second only (pretty much) to loving God. If you want to really feel filled by the Holy Spirit when you worship and go about your daily life, make sure you are living a Christian life by loving your fellow man. Judge him not, for he shall be judged by God and by no other. Help him and comfort him.

, If you can, bring others to the love of Christ. Don’t do this because you want to earn brownie points with God. That’s not how this works. Help bring others to God because in coming to Him, their lives will be better. They will be happier and healthier and make better decisions than they did before.


You can tell them about the beliefs of Christianity and the wisdom of Christ, or even just bring them to worship with you, so they can see what it’s all about.
Never push anyone to Christ or make them feel like less because they don’t believe. This only drives people away.

decline of Jehovah. Note how superstition about pronouncing the name Jehovah would eventually lead to the removal of the name in copies of scripture. See how this impacted Christian writers who wrote in Koine Greek and never used the name Jehovah.

power of saying things in the name of God. Bible writers often spoke in the name of God. Likewise modern religious leaders often claim to speak in the name of God. Note how such adds power and authority to their spoken and written words.

Bible writer's love of Jehovah. For example the author of Deuteronomy wrote ""For I shall declare the name of Jehovah. Do YOU attribute greatness to our God! The Rock, perfect is his activity. For all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice; Righteous and upright is he."" (Deuteronomy 32:3, 4; NWT)

Bible writer's love for Jehovah compared to some of the shocking acts of Jehovah. The recorded acts of Jehovah moved Richard Dawkins, author of the God Delusion, to write: ""The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.""

why Psalms 14:1 says what it says. Many quote Psalms 14:1 to suggest atheism is senseless. The full verse says, ""The senseless one has said in his heart: 'There is no Jehovah.' They have acted ruinously, they have acted detestably in dealing. There is no one doing good."" Clearly the focus is not on mere belief, but on acting badly and not doing good.

Realize that any gift or ability you may have came from God.,
Always see that God is God, and you are not.,
Do something that keeps you humble, such as house cleaning.,
Realize that you might be wrong on some things.,
See and treat others as better than yourself.,
Continuously be willing to see your sin.,
Don't boast about what you do for God's kingdom.,
Never, therefore, seek to please man, certainly not the powerful or rich self-serving people.",How to Be a Humble Christian," The Bible says ""Every good and perfect gift is from above."" God gave you breath. God gave you your personality and talents, etc. God wants you to use your talents, such as can be seen in the parable of the talents, which I think does literally refer to gifts or talents, but God doesn't want us to get prideful about our abilities. ""For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."" (Ephesians 2:8). Salvation is by grace, and sanctification is also by grace. Any progress that we make in our walks with God, any spiritual gift we might receive, is thanks to God's Holy Spirit in us alone. We have nothing to get puffed up or prideful about. It's always all about God and not about us.;
, Sometimes Christians can get on a power trip regarding prayer. We start to think that we can change the universe or something through prayer. But ultimately God is in charge. He can grant our requests in prayer, or He can choose to not grant them.

, Cleaning, or any kind of work, has a way of humbling us. Working out is a good way to discipline our bodies, and so, then discipline our minds. Try fasting and denying yourself food for a day or so, if you need to work on humility, etc.

, For some reason, since Christians have spiritual eyes through the Holy Spirit, we can start to think that we are always right and never wrong. But, it's good to admit that you could possibly be wrong on something.

, If you find that it's hard to serve others, ask God for help. Realize that every human being alive is created in God's image, so all people have innate value.

, Every person, Christian or not, sins every day. The Bible says ""If anyone says he is without sin, he is a liar.""

, What are something that Christians might boast about? One is having the gift of tongues, if a person has it. Or any other spiritual gift. But, the fact that we all need to realize is that any spiritual gift is from God; it is not of our own doing, so there is no room for boasting. Amen.


There are many other things Christians might boast about; going on a missions trip, serving in the church, teaching Sunday school, feeding the homeless, etc. It's hard to tell if we are doing things for the wrong motives sometimes. Do we serve God to be noticed by others, or do we serve God just to serve God?
Ongoing self-examination is good for anyone to do. It is always good to consider why we do what we do. Do we do good things for a boost to our own ego; to feel better about ourselves? Are we like the Pharisees and want other people to notice all the good that we do? What would Jesus say then, we have already received our reward. Jesus said when you give to anyone in any way, ""don't let your right hand know what your left hand is doing.""
Do we pray to be seen and heard by men, like the Pharisees did? Or, do we pray because we want to draw closer to God and build our relationship with Him alone? Do we give, and then tell everyone how much we gave and who we gave to, or do we do it without drawing any attention to ourselves? It's hard to give or to pray or to fast, etc. in secret without telling anyone, because our flesh wants others to know all that we are accomplishing for God. Our flesh wants to brag and boast. Our flesh wants to say, ""Look at me! Look at how holy I am!"" But, is that really being holy?
Paul said, ""Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or, am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ."" (Galatians 1:10). That is a good verse to always keep in mind in your Christian walk.

, But, love is the key. Have mercy on the hungry, cold, hurting and needy children and other people as to or for God. Don't expect any repayment. Only and always seek to please God and God alone. Jesus said:


""If you hate, then you are a murderer..."" and also ""Whatever you do (or do not do) for/to the least of these, you do for/to me."" -- and He even said: ""Love (be kind to) those who hate you."" That is hard to do, especially if they are merciless people who think they are serving God by being harsh and unloving, or such.

Find an area that has little ambient noise, is a comfortable temperature, and where you are able to focus on your practice.You could go to a quiet park on a day with nice weather, or stay inside in a tranquil room.

, You will be moving through different postures while you are practicing, so you will need to be in a space that is relatively large. You should be able to stretch your arms and not touch any objects. You want to be able to move around freely in the space without bumping into anything or tripping over something.If you are outdoors, make sure there are no rocks, roots, or raised areas that you may trip over.

, Meditation has a lot of great benefits, but it can actually raise your anxiety or stress if you aren’t in the right state of mind.Before you begin meditating and practicing Qigong, take a few minutes to think about how you are feeling. Is there anything that is weighing heavily on your mind? Do you have a pressing task that you need to accomplish before you begin?


You should be in a neutral state of mind before you begin meditating. If there is something that you need to take care of before you begin practicing, take some time to do that before you begin., There are two primary types of Qigong practice. The first is Wai Dan (Eternal Elixir) and involves physical movement and concentration. The second is Nei Dan (Internal Elixir) which involves sitting meditation and guided imagery and visualization.Begin your practice by sitting, either on the ground or in a chair with your legs underneath you. This should be a comfortable sitting position, so make adjustments if needed. Your back should be straight, and your hands can rest comfortably at your sides.


You can sit on a padded cushion or mat if sitting directly on the floor is uncomfortable. If you have joint pain in your hips and knees, make sure you are in a comfortable position that doesn’t put pressure on these areas.

, Spend one to two minutes breathing normally. Close your eyes and think about your breaths and the energy that you are drawing into your body. Your eyes can be closed if you’d like, or they can be fixed on a focal point. Try to clear your mind of any thoughts that aren’t related to the breaths coming in and out of your body.


In Qigong, the Chinese concept of “qi” talks about the power of breath as a life force. Your breath connects your mind and body, and can both energize and relax you., As you move into the meditative part of your practice, your breaths will move from your natural breathing pattern into a deeper and more expansive breath pattern.Your breaths should be calm and measured; take your time breathing in deeply and breathing out through your nostrils. Each breath should feel energizing as you breathe in more “qi.”


If you have problems with breathing, either as a result of a medical condition like emphysema or a short term illness, be very careful during deep breathing exercises. Start with one or two exercises at the time and stop doing them if you feel any shortness of breath or tightness in your chest.

, Effective meditation involves both your mind and your body.Your focus should be on your practice, the breaths you take, and the way your body feels. Distracted thoughts will pull you away from your practice and you’ll lose focus. When you are not focused on the movements and postures in Qigong, you risk becoming hurt. Focus on eliminating any distractions around you so you can focus on your practice.


For example, you may close the door and let others know you are not to be disturbed. Or you may go into another area that is quiet and secluded so you are not distracted by noise or talking from others.
To help you block out distractions, you can also try playing music in the background that is soothing and calming.

, Qigong uses your entire body, and stretching will warm up your muscles. While Qigong is a very gentle practice, stretching before and after you practice can help to prevent soreness or tenderness. Even five minutes of stretching can loosen your muscles and get you ready to practice. You should stretch your arms, legs, and core muscles. You can find examples of stretching techniques here.


Stretching can also become part of your Qigong routine and can help you settle your mind and body before you begin.
Before start stretching, warm up your muscles by jogging in place for five minutes or by going for a quick run around the block. You can also do exercises like jumping jacks or push ups to warm up your muscles.

, Posture is a very important part of Qigong. Your spine should be straight, like there is a string pulling the top of your head down to the bottom of your feet. Throughout the moves, you should focus on maintaining good posture so you lower the risk of injuring yourself or overextending a muscle.Your back should be straight and your shoulders should be in line with your hips.

, There are two primary stances that beginners will use during Qigong. The first is the MaBu, or Horse Stance.In this stance, your feet should be shoulder-length apart. Your toes should be parallel and your knees should be slightly bent. Your spine should be straight, with your tailbone tucked in.In this position, you look like you’re just about to sit down on an imaginary chair, or that you’re riding a horse.


This stance uses your back and leg muscles. When you are just starting out with Qigong, your muscles may not be strong enough to hold this stance for very long. Do not overexert yourself; you can start by holding this pose for 10 seconds and increasing the length you hold it over time.
If you are struggling with this stance, you can start by practicing it while sitting on the edge of a chair. Only your buttocks should be on the seat, not your thighs, while you are holding the posture.

, This is the second stance that you will use in your Qigong practice. In the GongBu, or Bow Stance, you’ll hold a posture like an archer just before they draw their bows. Stand with your feet together with your right foot pointing forward and your left foot pointing out forty-five degrees away from the right. Slide your right foot forward so your heels are now shoulder-width apart. You’ll slide your right foot several inches to the right so you can maintain stability. Your shoulder should be squared forward in the direction that you are facing.If you are familiar with yoga poses, this looks like the Warrior pose.
Your spine will be straight with your tailbone tucked in. You can hold this stance for 10 seconds if do not feel strong or stable enough to hold it for longer.

Prepare for your life in your ""apprenticeship"" as you accept the Master Potter's plan and learn the Potter's Life, Truth and the Way: ""Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also; and greater works than these he will do; because I go to the Father.,
Undergo the process of tempering by the Potter to reach your place in making the plans and ideals come to view in yourself and others in the great Potter's way.,
Receive molding of your clay: ""A person who doesn't love me doesn't do what I say.,
Model clay yourself: He can turn a heart of stone to a heart of clay and life of pain to life of gain -- in which He helps others through you.,
Accept the firing of the clay to fulfill the great Way in life.,
Receive the ""fire"" through receiving the Holy Spirit and continue studying, learning, and forming in the plan and purpose that prepares you for the pressures of life on your effectiveness as tempered clay.

,
Think of the F.I.R.E.,
Remember the scripture that says that we have the Gospel as a great ""...treasure in earthen vessels...""


2 Corinthians 4:7: ""We have this treasure in earthen vessels."",
Learn and continue in growing in the plan and promises of God: Go ye into all the world and re/present the Gospel.

,
Form clay to make it into ""vessels of mercy"" -- being an able ""potter"" yourself under His training and by His hand, but none come to the Truth unless the Spirit ""draw"" him/her.",How to Be Like the Great Potter (Christianity)," ..."";
, But:


""You turn things upside down, as if the potter were thought to be like the clay! -- Can the pot say of the potter, 'He knows nothing'?""-- as if the servant or apprentice might say that. Are you already firmed or have you been ""fired"" under the plan of His Book to make you a good apprentice potter to receive and apply the fire of His Spirit yourself?

, I don't make up what you hear me say. What I say comes from the Father who sent me."", He is busy shaping, sculpting and filling new vessels with new wine that He can use in your shaping future as an apprentice potter.

, Your vessel of clay must be exposed to the high temperatures of a kiln of the fire of the infilling of the Holy Spirit hopefully without cracking and so to be completed so that one can be truly useful in the Way of the Potter (the Spirit of God or Spirit of Jesus Christ).

,, in terms of how it contributes to a strong, vibrant, life-changing experience of preparation for everything that a real purpose has ahead for you.


F-Focus on the Master Potter's map: His Word and the Big Book. Let Him shape your short term goals like your youth activities and education as well as your long term goals like finding and moving into your career and family life and following a focus on topics such as:


Pray effectively,
Find God's plan for you and
Receive the Father’s love, God’s peace and love God,
Have ""the mind of Christ.""I-Identify yourself on His role of believers and followers:

Who are you in the scheme of things?
Be a person of the Book.


R-Reasons are important for your life:

Not just a plan, but why is it important?
Receiving and walking in your destiny.


E-Encounter with others so that even it only two or three may:

Play, pray, work and agree together in prayer when the Way is in it and then ""there I am in your midst.""
Agree also in the Truth at the middle of it all when you agree in His Way, if the Truth is in your midst.



,

Commentary: ""The treasure of the knowledge of Christ and of the ministry of the gospel of life. Perhaps his enemies pointed to his sorrows as a proof that he was not so favored as a minister of Christ. A splendid treasure was placed in a fragile, cheap earthen vessel. Then it was manifest that the great work wrought was the power of God, and not from us, the apostles and evangelists.""


So be tempered to the task of being a weak vessel of clay but blessing others -- to be for one and all and living in the plan ""one for all in Christ.""

,, (John 6:44)


""But I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself."""
"
Be chosen by God.,
Put your faith in Jesus, if you have not already.,
Share the gospel.,
Be prayed for, and anointed.,
Ask God to fill you with the Holy Spirit more.",How to Be Anointed (Christianity)," In the Old Testament, the kings of Israel and the priests were anointed. It was a ceremonial way to show that they were special and set apart. Anyone who is a believer in Christ is chosen by God and set apart.


2 Corinthians 1:21 says, ""Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us is God, who also has sealed us and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.""
Also every Christian now is a priest. 1 Peter 2:9 says about all Christians, ""You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light."" Amen.;
, Simply becoming a Christian makes you anointed. 1 John 2:27 says, ""The anointing that you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But, as His anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie—just as it has taught you, abide in Him.""


This anointing that John is referring to is the Holy Spirit. He says that as a Christian ""you have no need"" to be taught because the Holy Spirit leads you into all truth, as the Bible says. This does not mean ""don't"" listen to sermons, but it means that you ""can"" know and agree upon everything that any other Christian knows about the word, etc. because we all have the same Holy Spirit in us.
Also, we keep the anointing of salvation simply by abiding in Jesus. As He said, ""Remain in me, and I will remain in you."" The best way to abide in Jesus is to continue in an attitude of rejoicing and remain in His presence:


""rejoice always, pray without ceasing and give thanks in everything: for this is God's will..."" (1 Thessalonians 5:16--18) as the Bible, also, says,

""Let us come into His presence with thanksgiving and make a joyful noise to Him, singing songs of praise!"" (Psalm 95:2).



, Christians can get an extra anointing, or an extra filling of the Holy Spirit, in order that they may share the gospel better. This can be seen at Pentecost. A side note on this, the Bible does not say that the disciples were ""baptized"" with the Holy Spirit, it says that they were filled with the Holy Spirit.


There are many times throughout Acts where they and other Christians got re-filled, or filled in an extra way, by the Holy Spirit so that they could heal others or share the gospel.
Acts 4:31 says, ""When they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness."" These same men had already been filled with the Holy Spirit in Acts 1 at Pentecost, but they were filled again. Why? So that they could ""speak the word of God with boldness."" The primary purpose of an anointing, or an extra filling of the Holy Spirit, after Jesus came is to enable us to share the gospel.
Jesus read the following passage while at a temple one day, ""The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed."" God will empower us, anoint us, fill us with His Spirit more, in order to save and minister to the lost. Jesus said that He was anointed in order to ""proclaim the good news.""

, James 5:14 says, ""Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord."" It seems that sometimes the act of anointing with oil might draw the Holy Spirit in a greater way. In this case, the elders would want to draw the Holy Spirit to heal the person being anointed.


In the Old Testament David was anointed with oil. 1 Samuel 16 says, ""Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and, the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward."" David was being anointed to be a future king of Israel, but this act seemed to drawn the Holy Spirit to him more.

, You already have the Holy Spirit, if you are saved, but you can pray for more of the Holy Spirit. Jesus said in Luke 11:13, ""If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!"" Jesus also said, ""You have not because you ask not.""


You can always pray to be filled more with the Holy Spirit. You won't necessarily pray in tongues when you become more filled with the Holy Spirit. You may exhibit any one of the 15 spiritual gifts. 1 Corinthians 12:11 says about the spiritual gifts, ""All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and He distributes them to each one, just as He determines."" So whichever gift the Holy Spirit wants to give you is the one that He will.

Read deeply about tai chi.",How to Do Tai Chi," As with any martial art, it's not just how quickly and forcefully you can strike a board or knock a guy out. A huge part of it is having a firm grip on your mind. To clear yours, focus your chi, and tap into your potential, you'll need to start with proper breathing (which will, in turn, centre you).









Put your feet up to shoulder width apart, no further.
Place your hand on your lower abdomen, about 2 inches (5 cm) below your navel. Push in lightly.
Breathe in and out through your nose slowly (lips loosely together) from this area of your abdomen. If you can't feel this area moving, push in with your hand a bit more.;
, Once breathing like this feels normal, start relaxing every part of your body one at a time. Start with your feet and work your way up to your scalp. Get as tiny as you'd like -- down to your fingernails even. You'll find you were holding tension without even realizing it.









If you start to sway, that's actually a good thing! It means you're relaxing and your body isn't tensed to balance. If that does happen, consider slightly readjusting your feet or moving your concentration back to your balance until you're steady again.

, One of the concepts of tai chi is ""rooting."" It's fairly self-explanatory: imagine roots growing out from underneath your feet. You are a part of the ground, never losing balance, focus, or your centering. Your limbs sway like branches in the wind, never hesitating for fear or apprehension. You are rooted.









This does not mean you or your legs are stiff. Quite the opposite. Just imagine roots under you, a part of you, allowing you for freedom of movement because you cannot fall, you cannot fail, and you will always be a part of the natural world.

, In Tai Chi, there are a few forms your positions can take. Generally, each style favors a specific form. Here's a rundown of the basics:










Small frame style. In this style (usually Wu or Hao versions) aren't very expansive. The movements are smaller (big surprise, huh?) and there's less extension in general. The focus is on correct internal energy to form correct movements and transitions.

Large frame style. The large frame style (Chen and Yang) involves low and high stances, more dramatic postures, and swinging arms. It emphasizes correct positioning of the body and alignment to channel energy.

There is a medium frame style, but it's really just in between the two.If you have questions, ask your teacher!



, Because all Tai Chi is good, it's more important that you do any rather than worry about which style is right for you. But once you get immersed in the world, you may want to experiment. Here's a brief rundown:








The Chen style mixes up the tempo, going very slow and then being explosive. It can be difficult for beginners.
The Yang style is the most popular. It has a steady tempo and, as discussed above, uses large frame movements. It's probably what you think of when you think of tai chi.
In Wu, the movements are almost microscopic. This makes it easy to do, but difficult to master -- there's a lot of focus on powerful flows of energy and inner, pressured movements. The movements are very slow and deliberate.
The Hao style isn't very widely spread. You probably won't find a teacher that practices it.

, To understand the nature of Tai Chi Chuan (meaning ""Supreme Ultimate Fist"") we have to put it into context with the culture from where it has come. This means we have to look closer at the Chinese culture and, in particular, the spiritual tradition of Taoism which is where Tai Chi Chuan finds its roots and sustenance.


The art of tai chi is said to improve the flow of Chi (Qi), the traditional Chinese concept of a physically intangible energy or life force. In scientific studies, tai chi has been proven to improve a host of medical conditions including, but not limited to: muscular pain, headaches, fibromyalgia, cardiovascular problems, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Diabetes and ADHD. Though its low-impact workout is especially helpful to seniors, tai chi is for everyone and is deceptively simple in appearance.
The thing to keep in mind about Taoism is that it is about an attunement with nature. Not just nature outside of us, but also the nature within us. This principle is called Tzu Jan, or Ziran in pinyin, and it is the principle of being ""self-so"" or embodying one's ""self-nature"". So beyond the health benefits and stress relief, Tai Chi Chuan is also a means to tap into one's inner self.

, Tai Chi isn't about putting your arms out in front of you. No. Just no. For every moment, there's purpose, flow and, for some, a fighting application. While you're practising, think about these things. What does this move symbolize? How does such a simple move evoke such energy?








, We're just going to outline a few here (there are tons), but a pretty standard one that is seen in every variety is the single whip. It's where every point along your arms and upper torso is part of a whip -- they could explode with a force of energy at any moment, becoming the end of the whip. Doesn't seem so effortless now!









For this move, generally one hand stays in the ""beak hand"" position. You can probably guess why -- it sort of looks like a bird's beak. Your four fingers should be lightly touching your thumb and your palm should be facing downward. As for your arms, each style of Tai Chi is slightly different, but generally, they're at shoulder height and spread like loose wings.

, For this one, your weight should always be on one leg -- but both feet should always be on the ground. You'll be shifting back and forth as you test your balance. So to your arms should be opposite -- one should be moving fast and on different planes and the other should be slow and deliberate (but never flaccid and weak).


The name of this moves sounds docile, but it does have a fighting application. Think about it: your weight and arm position is always changing. And when you have 100% of your weight on one leg, it frees the other up to kick. There's your purpose!

, This can even be something you do waiting in line at the self-check out. You simply stand with your feet on the floor, parallel, shoulder-width apart. Then you pour your weight onto one leg and hold; after a few breaths in and out, you begin slowly pouring your weight onto the other leg and holding. Do this for a few minutes, clearing your mind and becoming aware of your balance., With your elbows out in front of you and your wrists relaxed, begin your arm circles. Start on the first level making slow circles with your fingers, then your wrists, then your forearms, and then through your shoulder. Try to keep perfect, unmoving balance in your core at all times.


Do leg cycling, too! Sit down and work from your toes to your thighs, bending your knees when you need to. Be sure to go both clockwise and counterclockwise., Again, this move is slightly different in each style of Tai Chi, but the general gist is the same: move from a standing position into a deep (hamstring) lunge as gracefully as possible!Once you're there, test your balance with your arms. Move them around on different planes and at different speeds. Can you hold it?

, For most beginners, you'll probably want to stick to the short form. That's 13-40 moves long and generally lasts about 5-20 minutes. But once you get that down, you may be craving more. That's where the long form comes in! It's 80 or more moves and can take over an hour.Talk about stress relief!

, There are hundreds of tai chi styles but each of them has a specific focus of its own such as health or martial arts,meaning that you need to make a decision about what you want to get from the tai chi experience. The six most popular styles, which originate from family lineages, are the Chen, Yang, Wu, Sun and Wu-Hao and Fa styles. Yang style is the most popular when focusing on health issues, however, Chen style, with its lower stances and focus on martial development, is most popular as a self-defense art. No matter the style, stick with it, and remember that despite visual differences all tai chi styles share the same basic underlying philosophy.


The many types of tai chi styles mean that there are over 100 movements and positions in tai chi that you can learn.Many of these carry the names of nature or animals.
The continuity between all forms of tai chi is a concentration on breathing coordinated with rhythmic movement, and an end goal of achieving inner calm by focusing on the present., Anyone can do tai chi, provided you choose a gentler form of it, if you need to. The reason for this is that tai chi emphasizes technique over strength, giving every person a chance to master the art regardless of strength or age. The workout is low-impact and is, therefore, suitable for most people. If you have any doubts, talk to your medical practitioner.


Those who have joint, spine, fractures, or heart problems, or who are pregnant, should discuss taking up tai chi with their medical practitioner first., There are no degrees or credentials for teaching tai chi,and the key factor is the compatibility of your learning style with their teaching style. While there may be helpful study guides, it is simply impossible to learn from a book or video. A DVD cannot correct your form, and everyone needs correction as a beginner. Moreover, the social support gained by attending a class is invaluable. Places to look for a tai chi teacher include your local health club, community center, wellness facility, martial arts studio, YMCA, or YWCA. There are many ""tai chi class finders"" online. Factors in choosing a teacher include:


There is no universal (or even widely-used) accreditation system for tai chi teachers. This often makes it difficult for a beginner to judge the veracity or suitability of a particular teacher's tai chi. A teacher without the ability to answer prolific questions and make individualized adjustments to your form is not acceptable, therefore it is best to trust your gut and keep looking until you click with the instructor.
If you're a newcomer to tai chi, it is completely acceptable to learn from another advanced student.
One important factor to consider is if you have any medical conditions which require special attention, such as arthritis or multiple sclerosis. If so, it is essential you choose a teacher who has experience making accommodations for your condition.
Picking a teacher who is an hour drive away is the fastest way to getting tai chi relegated to your New Year's resolution list year after year. Ensure that you find classes that are close and handy to you.
Pay only what you can afford. A fancy studio and a free uniform doesn't mean much if you aren't learning anything. Most traditional classes are held outdoors and are informal when compared to say, your local taekwondo school.

, No matter if your teacher of tai chi is a soccer mom from the burbs' or an old Chinese man with a white beard, pick a style of instruction that works for you. It doesn't matter how knowledgeable they are, if you can't understand them, you won't get any of their experience to show in your practice. Be sure to pick a teacher who has the same goals you do (in terms of health, self-defense etc.). To understand what you're in for, visit the class yourself before signing up. Teachers who refuse to allow a trial class are hiding something. Anyone who calls themselves, or insists you call them grandmaster or any other equally overblown term, is not worth pursuing. A true tai chi teacher will tell you that they are still learning to master tai chi, even after many years.Bear in mind that tai chi is not about competition. You are not entering the class to compete with the teacher or the others in the class. You are joining the class to honor and augment the teacher's work, and to learn.

, Reading the cool tai chi magazines is fun, but the primary way to improve your tai chi is to practice. Anecdotes about one tai chi master, the famous Chen Fake, say he practiced his styles form 30 plus times a day.While you certainly don't need to go to this extreme, practicing once a day is preferable. Twice a week is about the minimum amount of practice in order to learn most effectively, and feel a tangible benefit. When practicing, focus on what you remember. Don't beat yourself up about not remembering, but rather improve what you can work on. Even if you only remember one posture, standing and holding that posture is good for you.


Develop a routine so that it is both easy to remember and you find it a pleasant association between practicing tai chi and how you feel about your day in general.
What you get from your Tai Chi practice is largely determined by how, and how much your are practicing. To get the most from your training consistency is needed. Set aside some time for yourself every day, fifteen minutes will do. Then, every day, take that time to care for your body and clear your mind with your practice. The reward will be well worth it.
You can practice indoors or outdoors, with friends, or solo. Whatever fits in best for you, tai chi will work with you.

, At this point, they should be very evident and ongoing but don't give up – give yourself at least this minimum period to see the benefits. And once you reach this mark, continue for longer and bigger benefits, and for greatly increased skill., During the tai session, you are expected to put aside distractions and focus. The deep breathing aspect will help, as will relaxing:



Relax. Tensing your body is the best way to prevent getting any benefit from tai chi. However, relax does not mean turn into a wet noodle. Retain proper posture without excess tension. Classic tai chi literature often describes this as standing ""as if one were suspended on a string on the top of the head"".

Breathe. Part of the secret of tai chi's health benefits comes from deep, abdominal breathing. The majority of styles teach ""abdominal breathing"", in which one breathes in, expanding the abdominal area (not the chest) and exhales by contracting the abs. All inhalation is done through the nose; exhalation through the mouth and the tongue should touch the roof of the mouth, stimulating salivary function.
Live in the moment. Develop the tai chi mental discipline to live in the moment rather than focusing on anxieties.

, Once you are more proficient at tai chi, move it into your daily life to reduce stress. Practice the concepts of tai chi in highly stressful situations, such as traffic jams, or a high-intensity work meeting, to lessen the tension and restore inner calm and balance.


As a form of meditation, tai chi is able to help you learn to understand yourself better and thereby deal with others more effectively. Thus, when stressful situations arise, tai chi learning will help you to be assertive and respectful of others, as well as staying in the present and dealing with the situation before you with calmness. Tai chi helps you learn to merge the opposing forces of yin and yang, self and the world to achieve a natural balance for physical and spiritual well-being. This balance is represented by the tai chi symbol.

, Cross-training in other forms and styles, after you've achieved a basic level of mastery in your first form, is often very helpful at improving your general tai chi knowledge. The iconic practice of tai chi are the ""hand"" forms; the slow movements performed in a group or solo. But tai chi includes a vast array of forms which can improve your health and self-defense abilities. Most teachers only go on to such forms after a demonstrable proficiency in the basic hand form of the style.


Learn about weapons forms. Almost all styles, including those which disregard all martial intent, have tai chi forms practiced with weapons. These can range from simple staves or swords to esoteric Chinese weapons.
Try a faster form. Ironically, and in opposition to the public's general idea of tai chi, most traditional family styles (including Yang, Chen,Fa and Wu) have a ""fast form."" This form is often used as a way of expressing the martial power honed and stored in slow form practice. It is sometimes called ""Cannon Fist"" (pao chui) in Chen style.
Learn about partner work. If forms practice is tai chi's solo workout, ""pushing hands"" (tui shou) is its partner exercise. Though eventually it can lead into free sparring, push hands is essentially an exercise meant to develop the sensitivity and skill of tai chi in a cooperative way. Generally, the learning of push hands builds steadily; moving from fixed-stance patterns with a single hand, and ending in a moving step pattern with both hands sometimes varying in height and speed.

, Classwork is one thing but learning the meaning, philosophical underpinning, and history of tai chi takes time and much of it is best done through reading and learning in your own time. This is an important part of learning tai chi because it provides you with the opportunity to get a deeper understanding of how tai chi benefits you mentally and physically, and enables you to find new ideas about enriching your tai chi experience. Other people's learning about tai chi can inform your own and you may want to put some of their ideas into practice to see what works best for you.


Feel free to ask your teacher questions about your self-directed learning, such as what to read and questions about what you have read. That way you will expand your understanding a great deal.
Read the Tao Te Ching and the I Ching. These books discuss the concept of ""chi"" and how it can become blocked and when this happens, so does illness.

Do a spiritual inventory.,
Choose an alternative path.,
Be thoughtful.,
If after consultation you decide that you still want to withdraw, inform the Local Spiritual Assembly (LSA), who will inform the National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) of your decision.",How to Resign from the Baha'i Faith," Decide what it is about the religion, which has made you decide to leave.;
, If you do still believe in God, then learn about as many religions as possible, and decide which one fits your spiritual needs and views.

, When you announce your decision to withdraw from the religion, the Local Spiritual Assembly will probably want to talk with you about your decision. This is a community which no doubt cares about you, so meaningful communications regarding your decision would be important to both parties. Be frank and honest in consulting with them so that together, both you and the Assembly may understand each others' thoughts, feelings, and actions, and so that any options which you may have overlooked, or misunderstandings that may have existed on either side may be effectively reviewed.

,


The NSA will take you off the rolls and mailing list. You can be off the mailing list without withdrawing from the Faith, if you like. NSA may list you as ""address unknown"", which means you are not part of a local community and no one contacts you.

Clear your mind of all thoughts while reading Tao te ching.,
Be completely present with your whole being.",How to Understand the Tao Te Ching1," Tao te ching is a timeless masterpiece which was written with a lucid state of consciousness. Its teachings are older than the world, how can you grasp them with your mind?;
, Be aware of the stillness of your inner body and breathing; then read it with your whole being. The more you research, the less you will understand.

Take some quiet time for yourself and read the Tao Te Ching, an ancient book of Chinese folk wisdom attributed to the sixth-century BC sage Lao-Tzu.,
Research Taoism further.,
Call yourself a Taoist if you find Taoist ideas appealing.,
It would be wise to join a Taoist group if one is available where you live.,
Use the ideas of the Tao to restructure your thinking and lifestyle.,
Learn an internal cultivation art form such as Qi Gong, Tai Chi, or Taoist Yoga.",How to Become a Taoist," It's not to be read in one sitting, but rather to be contemplated over time. But if you're looking for a gentler introduction — especially if you're not yet committed, but simply deciding whether Taoism is right for you — may we humbly suggest the following?


The writings of Chuang-Tzu (Zhuangzi). His writings offer a more down-to-earth and humorous perspective on the principles of Taoism. Together, Lao-Tzu and Chuang-Tzu make up the yin and yang of primary Taoist texts, and we recommend both.

Zhuangzi Speaks and The Tao Speaks by Ts'ai Chih Chung.

The Tao of Pooh and The Te of Piglet by Benjamin Hoff — these companion books are intended for those who do not fully understand Taoism, and though they're based on Winnie the Pooh, they're easily accessible to readers of all ages.;
, Many translations of Taoist texts (see below) can be found in bookstores, libraries, and the Internet.


Be sure to find a quality translation of the Tao Te Ching and other Chinese texts. Since the English and Chinese languages are so different, a good translation can make all the difference.

, To be consistent, begin applying the philosophical principles to your actions.

, Joining a Guan can benefit you greatly and improve the pace in which you achieve peace of mind and body. Alternatively the Reform Taoist Congregation offers an online community of philosophical Taoists.

, This may lead to spiritual and philosophical communion, also known as ""peace"". Even before peace is achieved, it will begin to spread outward into other people and the world around you.

Neijia (Chinese 內家 nèijiā), usually translated as ""internal martial arts"", follow many Taoist principles, and are sometimes called ""physical Taoism"".

Read some of the verses from time to time.",How to Understand the Tao Te Ching2," ""If you want to become whole, let yourself be partial."" Tao te ching. Read some of the verses, especially when you are feeling anxious, fear, impatient, restless or any other negative emotions. Its because when you are in that state of consciousness, you are 'partial' and reading related verses, at that moment will help you understand them better. So allow yourself to be partial and then read. Makes sense?

Start by researching China during the time of Lao-Tzu.,
Research Confucianism.,
Research Legalism and Mohism.,
Research ancestral worship and local religions, particularly those in the region where Lao-Tzu lived in or traveled through.,
Research Chinese culture.,
Build up a library's worth of books on: Taoism, Confucianism, Legalism, Mohism, Absolutism, Chinese civilization, Chinese culture, Ancestral worship and local gods, the six warring kingdoms and finally on Lao-Tzu himself.,
Learn from others who have been inspired by the Tao Te Ching.,
Spend time reading the Tao Te Ching.",How to Understand the Tao Te Ching3," Unfortunately, little is known about Lao-Tzu – even the years in which he lived are debated – but we do know he lived around the 6th to 4th centuries BCE.At this time, China was torn apart by the six warring states. In your quest for understanding Lao-Tzu's times, research the six warring states and the effects this constant warring had on Chinese society. Many Chinese elders believed morals had fallen at this time, which may be a reason why the warring arose.

, Confucianism is a moral philosophy and religion that focuses on society as a whole, hierarchy, and obedience to superiors. Some people believe Taoism arose as a reaction to Confucianism. By understanding the reasons behind the ascent of Confucianism and the beliefs of Confucianism, you’ll be in a good position to compare and contrast the elements of each.

, Both these Chinese philosophies arose at the time of Taoism. Each advocated philosophies opposed to Taoism. Research both of these philosophies in order to understand some of the hidden meanings in Taoism, which are often attacks on certain tenets of these philosophies, in similar vein to making a joke about Qin Shi Huang Di and not knowing who he is. (Qin Shi Huang Di was the first emperor who gave China its name and beat the other five family clans.)

, Ancestral worship was very important in China in this time and was seen as something forgotten by the people of the day. Lao-Tzu and the Tao Te Ching might have been influenced by ancestral worship and local gods and goddesses.

, Taoism is completely against culture and civilization, instead believing people should cultivate a simple, ascetic lifestyle in tune with nature and the universe, which is naturally harmonious, perhaps working to a goal. To understand why the Tao Te Ching is anti-civilization, one must know what Chinese civilization was like at the time, particularly the immorality of certain sections like the elite, and worst of all, tax-collectors, who are definite signs of civilization.

, Make sure you have a variety of books on each topic, ensuring that you have access to well-rounded opinions and many different angles.


It is best if the books are written by reputable people, such as professors of Chinese religions or renowned historians. However, make sure you buy books from both Chinese and foreign professors of these subjects, (for example, British or German professors), as doing so will give you both an insider's opinion and an outsider's.
It is preferable that most of your books are not written by Chinese professors, only some, as the Chinese government have tried to suppress Taoism. Professors from China may be under pressure to write defamatory things on Taoism, which is often seen as too sexually liberal, even by Western standards.

, Many artists, poets, authors, calligraphers, and gardeners have been inspired by it.Their interpretations might inform your own understanding.

, As you read it, make notes in a journal about your questions, thoughts, and impressions. Come back to your notes regularly to keep trying to work through your own ideas of the meanings in the text.


Be aware that the style of the Tao Te Ching is poetic and the ideas are singular; the Tao Te Ching purposefully encourages contradictory interpretations through use of vague and ambiguous words.Your interpretations and understandings of the Tao Te Ching may change over time. There is no one right way of interpreting it and no single reader can claim to have the upper hand in understanding its ""real essence"". Perhaps its ambiguity is its real beauty, allowing you to reassess yourself, through varying stages of life.

Visit shrines when in good physical condition and pure spirits.,
Bow at the main gate and pass through to the side.,
Preserve the peacefulness and condition of the shrine.,
Follow shrine photography rules.,
Remove your shoes when necessary.",How to Worship at a Shinto Shrine1," The idea of purity is very important in the Shinto religion. Sickness, open wounds, and periods of mourning are believed to cause or spread impurity, so you should avoid going to shrines if you are suffering from one of these conditions.Shrines are especially popular during certain times of year, like Setsubun (lunar new year), Shogatsu (New Year’s Day), and Seigin-no-hi (Coming of Age Celebration).Shinto followers believe that certain right actions purify a person, improving luck and peace of mind, while wrong actions (like visiting a shrine when sick) create impurity.;
, You may notice many shrine visitors skip this first bow, but bowing signifies respect for this holy ground. The center line (Sei-chu) passing under and through gates is reserved for the gods, so you should walk along the sides instead.


Avoid taking pictures from the center line running under shrine gates. When you want a picture, step off to the side first.Most, though not all, shrine gates are painted with iconic orange and black paint. In Japanese, these gates are called “torii.”, When you arrive at a shrine on non-festival days, you should notice a solemn, serene mood. Avoid speaking loudly or making a spectacle of yourself to show proper respect for the gods and other shrine visitors as well.


Festivals can bring loud, joyful celebrations through towns right onto shrine grounds. On these days, you should still follow shrine rules, but feel free to participate in the celebratory atmosphere.All garbage should be thrown away in a proper receptacle or taken home for disposal later. Never leave behind garbage at a shrine.
The shrines and items contained inside are very old. Refrain from touching anything unless it is clearly indicated that touching is allowed.

, At most shrines, it’s usually alright to take pictures outside on the grounds, but many restrict photography inside the shrine itself. “No photography” areas are generally marked with signs.If you’re lucky enough to visit a shrine while a Shinto priest is performing a ceremony, refrain from taking any pictures, as this is considered very disrespectful., Keep your eyes peeled for cubby-like shoe lockers or for other shrine visitors taking off their shoes in a designated area. Some shrines require you to take your shoes off before entering the main building.Although in your home culture you might worry about your shoes being stolen, this is incredibly rare in Japan. Stealing would be considered a violation of the sacred atmosphere.
In addition to the cubbies, which are usually highly visible, in most cases there will be signs posted indicating where shoes are not allowed.

"
"
Approach the purification fountain (temizuya).,
Purify your hands with water from the temizuya.,
Cleanse your mouth.,
Waft incense around your body to prevent sickness.",How to Worship at a Shinto Shrine2," Water is a purifying force in Shinto, and washing your hands and mouth at the temizuya is an important part of preparing for worship. These structures are usually located after the main gate, at the entrance to the shrine grounds.Most temizuya are made of stone and have a simple roof. You should also notice small scoops, like long ladles, arranged on it.

, Take the scoop in your right hand and dip it into the water. Pour the water onto your left hand, then switch hands and do the same for your right. This should be done over the ground, so dirty water doesn’t mix in with the clean water in the temizuya.Only use a little bit of water to wash each hand. You should have some left over after washing your hands to cleanse your mouth. You should only dip your scoop in the water one time, total., Avoid touching your mouth directly to the scoop, as this is considered to be unclean and bad manners. Hold the scoop in your right hand and pour water into your cupped left hand. Draw the water into your mouth, swish, and spit off to the side., At many shrines you’ll see a large metal pot (like an old fashioned cauldron) giving off smoke. This holy incense is called “the breath of the gods.” Supposedly, it has healing powers.You may be able to purchase your own incense from the shrine to use at a shrine incense burner or when praying in your own home."
"
Head to the offering hall.,
Make your offering.,
Greet shrine deities with a bell ring and two bows.,
Pray quietly to the gods then clap twice.,
Conclude with a final bow and depart from the haiden.",How to Worship at a Shinto Shrine3," Now that you’ve been purified, you’re ready to commune with the gods of the shrine. This is done at the offering hall (haiden), which is located just before the main shrine building. The haiden usually has a simple roof with a large wooden offering box (saisenbako) underneath.You’ll be able to easily identify the offering box by the wooden slats in its top. These allow money offered to the gods to fall down into the box.

, Walk up to the offering box and quietly toss in a coin as an offering. A 100-yen coin is a typical offering, but you may offer more or less if you wish.Consider using a 5- or 50-yen coin as an offering. These coins are associated with good luck, especially in relationships.The amount of money you offer at a shrine is less important than your intention. If you meet the gods with a pure heart, your offering will be appreciated.

, If there is a bell at the haiden, give its rope a single, firm shake to call the gods to hear your prayer. After this is done, show your reverence to the gods with two deep bows. At some shrines, there may be a gong in place of a bell. In these situations, the gong is usually used in the same fashion as the bell – to call the gods to the shrine.Each bow should be at a 90° angle, so you’re bending in half at the waist. Take your time when bowing; rushing can be a sign of disrespect.

, Pray whatever is on your heart freely, but do so without speaking out loud. Express your gratitude wordlessly to the gods for listening to your prayer. When your prayer is finished, clap twice.Your claps should be unhurried and of moderate volume. This shows the gods your respect and also your happiness at meeting them., After expressing your respect and happiness with claps, you’ll need to bow once more to respectfully excuse yourself from the presence of the gods. Bow in the same fashion you did earlier and leave the haiden."
"
Identify the different kinds of fortunes, charms, and talismans.,
Purchase a suitable fortune, charm, or talisman.,
Attach your charm to something with significance.,
Replace your charm after a year.",How to Worship at a Shinto Shrine4," These are taken very seriously as religious items and should not be modified, tampered with, or used as toys. There are many different kinds, but the two most common include:Omamori, which are protective charms/talismans. These are used to help specific areas, like traffic safety, business success, educational success, safe pregnancy, health, and more.
Omikuji, which are paper fortunes. These random predictions might foresee “great good luck,” “great bad luck,” or anything in between. Omikuji are tied tree branches to improve their outcome., Many shrines have English translations or handouts that have simple explanations for charms and fortunes. Select the one that is relevant to your current life situation from a shrine fortune or charm seller.Charms and fortunes are intended to be purchased for a specific purpose, like passing an important exam or safe travel to and from school.
Traditionally, paper fortunes should be left at the shrine. However, charms and talismans can be taken with you.Official shrine charms and fortunes are sold at the shrine’s administrative office (shamusho) or at the exits to particularly important holy areas., If your charm is for educational success, you might attach it to your backpack or pencil case. A charm for traffic safety would be perfect hanging from your rearview mirror or on your car keys. This will amplify its spiritual power., Most charms only last for a single year. After a year has passed, you’ll need to go back to the shrine where you bought the charm and return it. Then you can buy a charm to keep you safe for the new year.


After an old charm is returned to a shrine, priests ritually purify and then ceremonially burn it. If you cannot return your charm, many shrines allow you to mail charms in for disposal."

Place on the altar a statue or an image of the deity being honoured.,
Have a sacred lamp.,
Light candles.,
Place three cups.,
Place the plates of fruit and bowls of food.,
Have an incense burner.",How to Make a Taoist Altar,";
, A Sacred Lamp should be placed in front of the statue/image. This represents the light of the Tao.

, Placed to the left and right of the sacred lamp should be two candles. These represent the Sun and the Moon.

, In front of the sacred lamp there should be three cups. The cup on the left should contain water, which represents Yang. The cup on the right should contain tea, which represents Yin. The center cup should contain grains of uncooked rice, which represents the union of Yin and Yang.

, In front of the three cups there should be five plates of fruit and five bowls of food. The plates of fruit represent the five elements (wood, fire, earth, metal & water) in their pre-natal form. The bowls of food represent them in their post-natal.

, In front of the five plates and five bowls should be an incense burner, which represents the lower abdominal area of the human body, called the lower Dantian."

",How to Set up a Kamidana," He can bless your house and advise you on obtaining and setting up a kamidana. However, since you are reading this article, it will be assume consulting a priest is not a viable option.;
, In most Japanese homes, it is placed on a shelf high on the wall. If this is impossible, consider placing it upon a lower shelf or table reserved especially for it. If you do not have a butsudana, consider placing the kamidana in the parlor. If you do, then another room might be more appropriate.

, If you are in Japan, this can be as simple as buying one at the local Homeac. If you are not in Japan, this can be done through Amazon.com or other websites. They cost anywhere from 5000 to 40000 yen.

, Accessories usually include two small saucers, a lidded bowl, two mizuire (vase-like lidded sake jars), two vases, and two candle holders. Excepting the candle holders, these are usually of white ceramic. The candle holders are usually of black metal. There is also often two Chinese style ceramic vases and/or a kagami (a disk of polished metal, held in a wooden stand).

, This usually includes two sprigs of sakaki, salt, rice, water, and sake. You will also want white candles for the shrine.

, An ofuda is a talisman inscribed with the essence of a kami.

,, In front of the stairs, place one of the saucers. Fill it with salt. To the left place the other saucer. Fill it with rice that has been washed, but not soaked. To the right, place the lidded bowl. Fill it with water. These are the three essentials of life which you are offering to the kami.

, To either side of center stairs, first place the mizuire, then the Chinese vases, and finally the vases. Sake is poured into the mizuire, and sakaki sprigs are placed in the tall white vases.

, Candles can be set in them. Your kamidana is now set up.

, Many kamidana are placed within a wooden box, often with glass doors to protect it. A curtain, often of bamboo or purple fabric emblazoned with a white mitsudomoe, can be placed in front of the kamidana. A shimenawa (rice straw rope) can be hung in the very front. Shide (folded strips of white paper), often wrapped within the shimenawa, mark the area of the kamidana as pure.

, Offerings or other talismans can be placed in front of the kamidana. For instance, a hamaya (demon breaking arrow) or kagami mochi might be placed so.

Call the police if the situation becomes violent.",How to Wear a Turban for Religious Reasons," But sometimes people are just scared and lashing out is the only way they can express this. Not responding to their taunts will sometimes silence them.;
, Explain in detail that the turban's importance can be found in just about every culture and religion, beginning with the ancient Babylonians and running up to western religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, as well as eastern traditions such as Hinduism and Sikhism. Show people a copy of the Old Testament and read from it, where it proclaims, “Once they enter the gates of the court”—implying God's court—“they are to wear linen vestments. They shall wear linen turbans.” Then explain your own personal reasons for wearing a turban as well as the personal religious beliefs that cause you to wear it, Invite speakers such as lawyers or judges to explain to the assembly the importance of religious freedom and its protection by both the US Constitution and state law. It might even be a good idea to feature people from your own religion who wear different types of turbans, and have them explain the differences and when and why they wear each.

, If possible, have this person visit the home of the person who is bothering you about your turban to speak to his/her parents and to discuss your religion's reasons that require you to wear a turban; this just might help stop any taunting.

, In North America, one religious group that wears a turban is the Sikhs. Since September 11, 2001, the Sikhs often have been mistakenly profiled by the public as representing the fanatical Taliban group of Afghanistan. This resulted in President George Bush signing a federal law which, among other things, prohibits persecution of American Sikhs and all Americans who wear turbans."

, This is not vital, but it would be immensely helpful in learning about shinto as many texts are only available  in japanese or have the more accurate versions in japanese

,, If you are not in Hawaii or Japan, you might have some difficulty doing this. There are temples in America and one foundation in the Netherlands as well

, Often Japanese people go back to their hometown for New Year's, so a Shrine with some connection to your birth or family would be good.

, Your local shrine will have festivals specifically sacred to their kami, so find out what they are. Common Shinto holy days are Hinamatsuri (Girl's Day), Hanami (Cherry Blossom Viewing), and of course Shogatsu (New Year's). If you have no Shinto shrine, consider organizing a celebration to celebrate these days. On New Year's, make kagami mochi, play karuta, and hang a New Year's wreath.

, A kamidana is a small home shrine. If you cannot find one, consider setting up a simple sacred place in your home. Remember to worship in front of the kamidana everyday.

, You might also want amulets or other charms to protect you from demons and bring you luck through the year. Omuji are fortunes which include a small charm to keep in your wallet. A hamaya (demonbreaking arrow) will keep bad fortune at bay. You might get a Maneki Neko (Lucky Cat) to encourage wealth and other good fortune to come your way. Or you might want one or more omamori (small brocade amulet) for Kōtsū Anzen (car safety) or Gakugyō Jōju (School Success).

, Consider trying to help with yard work or cleaning. Becoming involved in the going ons at the shrine will help you deepen your understanding of Shinto. Make friends with the miko (priestess) and kannushi (priests).

, Gagaku is traditional Japanese court music. Consider playing the ryūteki (flute), shō (oboe), or hichiriki (mouth organ). See if your school offers any classes in it.

, Shinto dancers often dress in a white kimono, red hakama, with a sheer white coat. Often, a sakaki branch adorned with shide (strips of folded white paper) is used in dances.

, Shinto is inseparable from Japanese culture. Learning about one will enhance the other.

Finally there is the possibility of setting up your own Shinto shrine, by yourself or backed by a parent shrine, like the one you studied at.

",How to Become a Shinto Priest," Shinto priests sit in a position known as seiza (sitting position with your legs folded beneath you). You will have to be able to move into and out of this position with ease and more importantly dignity.;
, You will need to be able to sit in this position for extended periods of time. You must be able to learn and do very complicated, demanding physical movements and you must do them in a very dignified manner for extended periods of time.

, Some study in Odori or Budo might be helpful. Other forms of martial arts will all help as well.

, If in Japan it is a must, fluently too. Knowledge of Japanese and Shinto history is a plus, though not necessary. Reading some of these texts is advisable.

Full-time University Level Program in Japan. If you made this choice you have likely quit your regular job, got your visa and moved to Japan. Forget about having a job outside of school. This program choice likely means that you will be in class most of the day 6 days a week. You will need to have enough money saved up head of time to cover tuition, books, materials, lodging and for a year or two (depending on the program).
Long Term Program in Japan Estimated Cost Breakdown (very speculative):

Airfare to Japan and back $1,000

Total $33,000

, As mentioned before, you would already need to have a long established relationship with the Jinja in question before being allowed to take their training program. So while the program itself may be short, it may take a few years of being associated with the Jinja to be allowed into the training program. The program through the Konpira Jinja in Shikoku is what will be discussed as an example here. The program is comprised of a minimum of two five-day long sessions held a year apart. The interim year is intended to by used by the student to go back to their home jinja and practice what was taught during the first five-day session. The program is held annually (generally May 13th through the 17th). The course curriculum varies from year to year and may include instruction on different ceremonies, cultural lectures, and courses on Norito composition, dressing in ceremonial wear, reciting prayers and lectures on ancient text. Be prepared to sit for long periods in seiza and get much practice kneeling. You receive points for attendance and performance in ceremonies and on tests, and these points are used as the basis for awarding licenses. Preparation and a patient attitude are the key. According to Rev. Caitlin Stronell of the Asakawa Konpira Jinja, in most cases, one attends the program, goes back to their home shrine to practice what they have learned and then attends the program again the following year before receiving a priest's license. However, she says, there is no guarantee that you will receive a license as it is a bit subjective.


Jinja Based Training (very speculative):
Airfare to Japan and back based on two trips $2,000
Lodging for one week based on two trips $1,400
Food for one week based on two trips $800
Tuition based on two trips $2,000
Books and materials $1,000
Train/transportation for one week based on two trips $400
Miscellaneous $1,400
Total $9,000

Rev. Patricia Ormsby of the Konpira Jinja had this to add relating to the financial considerations. ""In the case of Kompira, lodging is on shrine grounds and is economical. For me, the package, including room, board, tuition, shinkansen/express trains, and minor materials (not including purchasing hakama, kimonos, ceremonial vestments, etc., which are on sale there) and other costs, ran about $600 for each of the first two years. If you come into Kansai Airport, the trains will be less, so that would be about $500. But you may need to add a couple of days at hotels plus food on those days. In addition, you will want to bring a donation from your shrine--however much they feel they can spare, but typically $100 or so, and many make gifts to the shrine of sake, rice, etc., especially if it is their town's specialty. Such gifts appear to be discretionary. The total will probably be closer to $5000.""
Please note that the donation that Rev. Ormsby mentions will vary from program to program and may be substantially more.



, The information here is based on the correspondence course information provided by Irene Takizawa on the ShintoML Yahoo Group. This would entail no less than 6 trips to Japan over the course of two years. However, depending on your employer's time away from work policies, you would not need to quit your job. To be safe, we'll say that seven trips to Japan will be needed.


Correspondence Course Estimated Cost Breakdown (very speculative):
Airfare to Japan and back based on seven trips $7,000
Lodging for one week based on seven trips $4,900
Food for one week based on seven trips $2,100

Train/transportation based on seven trips $1,400
Miscellaneous based on seven trips $1,600

, It should also be easy in the west if you took a shrine based educational program as you will already be in the Shinto priesthood circles and a position in the priesthood at the shrine you trained at will probably be available.

Saints are also very compelling to listen to such as Sant Baba Mann Singh Ji Pehowa Wale- if you are born to an indian family and understand punjabi, Pehwa Wale Sant are very good to listen to as they really empower the true message of God.

, Read/listen to the panj baniya.

, By giving your head to Guru Ji, Guru Ji Maharaj automatically protects you. This is also Quoted in Guru Granth Sahib Ji.

, This is truly blessing and powerful.

, You can ask God for anything but its how much you want/try to get it that matters. Basically, if you want something from God, read sukhmani sahib or any other baniya and then do ardass.

, No one else can really truly help you except from Guru Ji Maharaj. The only one who is true is God. Satnaam- True is his name. Repeat the mool mantar every spare minute you have.

Feeling the subtle vibrations of your chosen Taoist mantras can help you more effectively embody your intention, effect positive changes, meet any goals you have, as well as get to a deeper state of consciousness. , Although it’s generally associated with Buddhism, some Taoists will also use “om” as a part of chanting.Be aware of the many benefits of chanting “om” including: creating positive vibrations, purifying the environment around you, allowing you to get into a deeper meditative state, improving concentration, removing toxins from your body, relaxing your body and mind, decreasing your heart rate, increasing happiness.
Lengthen it to chant “om mani padme hum.” Either of these universal invocations can create powerful and positive vibrations in your lower belly.

, These sounds, which are sometimes called the Six Basic Sounds for Health, are the best known Taoist uses of sound for chanting. Although all six sounds can cure illness, they will also cure individual ailments when used as a part of a exhalation. Chant all or a selection of the following sounds tailored to your individual needs:


Chway to expel heat
Hoo to expel cold
Shee to relieve tension
Her to release tension
Hsü to eliminate general illness
Sss to regain equilibrium., Many Taoist chants come from Tao Te Ching, or Lao-Tzu, which is the key book of Taoism. In the Tao Te Ching, the Three Purities are heaven, humanity, and earth. Praising the Three Purities can invoke not only a protective golden light around you, but also promote healing.Say San Ching Jiao Tzu Wu Liang Tien Tzun once you’ve settled into a comfortable seat and begun your chant.

, Consider chanting the words Wah Sheen, Jing Ru, Bye Lien if you are seeking health and longevity. The chant means, “My heart is as pure as the white lotus blossom” and is often chanted as an evening invocation.


Consider chanting Huh Yu Woh Tong Cheung for health and longevity as well. This simple invocation means “may the life of the universe live forever with me.”, The Taoist deity who governs the universe is the Jade Emperor.You can chant to the Jade Emperor if you are seeking longevity or blessings, to confess wrong doings, or if you want to be a better person.Say Yu Huang She Zui Tian Zun to offer your praise to the Jade Emperor.

, The chant Shing chu yuan ming wu nie means “The mind is like a bright pearl that rolls smoothly with no obstruction."" Use this chant if you want to calm negative thoughts and emotions.It can help


Try chanting Chiu Tien, Yen Yuan, Rei Sheng, Pu Hua, Tien Tsun to calm yourself, too. You can also use this chant to put a troubled spirit back in order., The three main ideas of meditations in Taoism are calm, cool, and clear. Part of achieving these in chanting is being able to focus without outside distractions such as sound or discomfort. Find a comfortable and quiet space to do your chanting. You can find a space at home, your office, or even in places like a yoga studio or spiritual center.Find a space without a lot of light so that you don’t get overstimulated or overheated. Make sure the space is exposed to a lot of outside noises quiet so that you can focus.

, Altars are very personal spaces that contain symbols of deities or concepts that are important to a person. Chanting in front of an altar that you’ve created and consecrated may help you more deeply enter your chanting practice and meditative space. The altar itself can be a small wood table. Some elements you may want to include on your altar are:Image or statue of the Deity you hold sacred
Representations of the Three Purities
Statue of guardian for deities
Incense burner placed centrally in front of the images
Offering cups of water, rice, and tea
Candles in colors such as red, orange, or white that symbolize the sun and moon
Brass bell to ring 9 times before chanting

, Before you begin your chant, it’s important to follow certain rules around the altar. While this may not seem necessary, it can keep the space calm and help you more effectively and deeper enter your chant. Some things to remember to do are:Remove your shoes
Avoid reclining with your feet pointed towards the altar
Speak in soft and calm tones
Avoid allowing animals or anyone who wouldn’t respect the altar around it

, Taoist priests wear sumptuous robes, which are decorated with many of the religion’s symbols. This is meant to transform your chanting area from an ordinary space into a celestial court. You can choose to purchase and wear Taoist robes to enhance your chanting experience or simply wear loose, comfortable clothing that can also make your chanting calm, cool, and clear.Look for robes that have the Three Purities, Lao-Tzu, and Jade Emperor on them. These symbols may also be a part of your chosen chant, and having them together on your body and in your heart may magnify the benefits of your chanting.
Put on comfortable and loose clothing in natural fabrics if you don’t have a robe. Wearing this type of clothing can help you stay focused on your chants.

, Most people are used to crossed legged chanting, but Taoism actually offer two types of sitting Before you begin your mantra meditation, sit yourself in a comfortable cross-legged position with your hips elevated above your knees with your eyes closed. This will help you sit with a straight spine, helping your body to best absorb the mantra’s vibrations and focus on your intention.Sit crossed-legged on the floor in a half-lotus position. Your butt should be elevated with a blanket or a pad. If you aren’t able to sit cross-legged, you can sit upright on a low stool or chair with your feet parallel and shoulder width apart.
Place your hands lightly on each of your thighs for balancing your chi. You can also lightly stretch out your palms and then place one on top of the other, interlacing your thumbs.

, Inhalation and exhalation are important parts of chanting in Taoism. Your inhalations bring life force, or chi, into your body and your exhalations will allow you to chant your given mantra. Focusing on what each inhalation and exhalation feels like can help you more effectively chant. However, you should remember to allow your breath to flow naturally.Recognize that it may take some practice to not control your breath, but learning to let it go, calling stopping and observing, is a key part of Taoist chanting. The more you chant, the easier this will get.

, It’s time to chant the mantra you’ve chosen! Many Taoists have morning and evening chants, but you can practice whenever you like. It simply requires repeating your chosen chant over and over for an allotted time. Remember that even five minutes of chanting can have benefits for you.Light some incense before you start if you like.
Inhale and then say your chosen chant as you exhale. Feel how the words vibrate in your lower belly. Try sitting up straighter if you can’t feel this.Allow your thoughts to arise and then leave in the same way. Holding on to any thoughts can keep you from having an effective chanting practice.
Remember that you’re likely chanting in another language and that perfect pronunciation isn’t important. You’re doing this for your overall well-being and worrying about pronunciation while you chant may keep you from meeting your intention.
Recognize that you can chant out loud or silently to yourself. It may sound strange at first to hear yourself chant, but you can get used to it as time passes. Allow your body and mind to flow with what they want. You may want to chant out loud sometimes while other times you may want to silently recite the invocations to yourself.

, If you’re just beginning to chant, you may find that you can only do it for a couple of minutes at a time. Remember to not force yourself. Instead, build up your chanting time gradually. When you’ve finished chanting, you can sit in silent meditation for a few minutes to see if you are done or want to try a new chant. This lets you focus on your intention and can help you be more relaxed.


Consider chanting in the mornings and evenings to help build your stamina.
Allow yourself to concentrate on lingering vibrations from your chanting.Remember that meditative chanting takes consistent practice. You may have great days with long chanting sessions and bad days on which you can’t focus at all. Accepting this is part of the journey.

, You may want to use meditative Taoist chanting for many reasons, from its health benefits to finding a spiritual connection. Identifying your intention can help you figure out the best mantras to chant.


Realize that chanting and meditation have many health benefits such as lowering your blood pressure and heart rate, decreasing depression and anxiety, reducing stress, and promoting relaxation and feelings of overall well-being. Taoist meditation and chanting can also bring spiritual benefits such as teaching you to let go of things you can’t control., Most chanting is done in conjunction with meditation. If you’re chanting a specific mantra to achieve a certain goal, take a few seconds to dedicate your practice to this intention. This can help you focus your chanting and get into a deeper meditative state.Place your palms lightly together, gently resting your fingertips on the opposite hand. Leave a small space between your palms to allow energy, or chi, to flow. Then bow your chin towards your chest.
Remember that your mantra can be as simple as “letting go of what I can’t control.”

, Your chanting and meditation is often meant to achieve a higher purpose for yourself. However, you can also dedicate it to another person or being for whom you hope the same thing. Simply think of this being as you chant and send them the same benefits you are feeling from your practice. You can also dedicate your practice to the Great Spirit of the Tao and Mother Earth, which help you open the gates to your bliss."
"
Know what it means to be a Sikh.,
The word Sikh means disciple or student.,
Six Gurus wrote the Guru Granth Sahib, but contains the writings of the Guru's and other religious teachers.,
There are however writings by followers of Sikhism from past and present that are worth while reading.

,
If you live in India it will be easy for you to attend a Gurdwara or Sikh temple.,
Do Not Eat Ritually Killed Meat.,
Observe that there is only one all pervading spirit (known as Akal or Ek Onkaar) that is formless and timeless, it is also almost difficult to know but not impossible.,
Meditate.,
Understand the Five distractions which are ego, anger, greed, lust and attachment.,
Guru Nanak taught that one can only achieve union through devotion to Akal.,
Embrace charity.,
Sikhs often recite parts of the Guru Granth Sahib daily and for before/after certain activities.,
Sikhs have a number of festivals, as a Sikh you attend these festivals as a sign of faith and to strengthen faith.,
Sikhs pray once in the morning and twice in the evening consecutively, sometimes done in the Gurudwara and sometimes done at home.,
Take Sikh baptism.",How to Be a Sikh," Sikhs have an obligation to pray daily, work hard, and share with those in need.;
, Sikhs are the students of their ten teachers (or Guru's) who compiled their teachings into a unique collection of divine scriptures, called the Guru Granth Sahib.

, The Guru Granth Sahib is considered a Living Guru

,, However outside India attending a Gurdwara might be more difficult, if you live in a large city. If you live near a Gurdwara visit the local Granthi/Sikh custodian who can provide more information on the Sikh path.

, Some Sikhs are vegetarian because they have a great respect for animals, however Sikhs are not bound to be vegetarianism according to the Sikh Code of Conduct. The Sikh Code of Conduct states that ritually slaughtered meat or Kosher/Halal is forbidden. When Sikhs attend a Gurdwara only vegetarian food is served. Whether a Sikh is vegetarian can also depend upon what traditions or region he or she are from.

, Akal is only realised through self knowledge, Sikhs therefore place emphasis on meditation to understand Akal. Sikhs aim to become one with Akal in order to end the cycle of birth and death, while not withdrawing from society.

, Sikhs also meditate for the purpose of realizing truth, as Akal (timeless spirit) is truth and truth is Akal and as Sikhs know Akal through meditation so they know truth through meditation, Guru Nanak said truth is only attainable through self realisation. Self realisation thus leads to enlightenment and ends the cycle of birth, death and rebirth.

, Sikhs believe these five distractions prevent one from achieving union with God which is the ultimate goal. If you are to lead a good life free from suffering you must avoid the five distractions.

, He stated that rite, pilgrimages and asceticism and fasting are meaningless, devotion should come inwardly. Sikhs therefore should try to balance work,charity and worship.Sikhs have an optimistic view of life, a spirit of chardi kala. They also believe that they should defend and protect the rights of others. They should never endorse a class system, sexism, racism, or other stereotypes that support inequality

, Charity is very important to Sikhs who balance charity along with work and worship. Charity is part of the Sikh belief in defending others and that can also mean defending others from poverty.

, The part of the Guru Granth Sahib depends on the activity and is supposed to strengthen faith.

, Here are some Sikh festivals taken from Wikipedia, though there are more.


Gurpurab are celebrations or commemorations based on the lives of the Sikh Gurus. They tend to be either birthdays or celebrations of Sikh martyrdom. All ten Gurus have Gurpurabs on the Nanakshahi calendar, but it is Guru Nanak Dev and Guru Gobind Singh who have a gurpurab that is widely celebrated in Gurdwaras and Sikh homes. The martyrdoms are also known as a shaheedi Gurpurab, which mark the martyrdom anniversary of Guru Arjan Dev and Guru Tegh Bahadur.
Vaisakhi or Baisakhi normally occurs on 13 April and marks rebirth, the beginning of the new spring year and the end of the harvest. Sikhs celebrate it because on Vaisakhi in 1699, the tenth guru, Gobind Singh, laid down the Foundation of the Khalsa an Independent Sikh Identity.
Bandi Chhor Divas or Diwali celebrates Guru Hargobind's release from the Gwalior Fort, with 52 innocent Hindu kings who were also imprisoned by Jahangir, on 26 October 1619.
Hola Mohalla occurs the day after Holi and is when the Khalsa Panth gather at Anandpur Sahib and display their warrior skills, including fighting and riding.

, Names of the morning and evening prayers are below.


Morning prayers include: Japji Sahib, Jaap Sahib, Tav Prasaad Svaiye, Chaupai Sahib, Anand Sahib
Evening prayer:Rehras Sahib
Bedtime prayer:Kirtan Sohila
Here is a link to recordings of prayers: http://sgpc.net/live-kirtan-sri-harmandir-sahib-96-kbps/


, When a Sikh takes Amrit he/she becomes pure or Khalsa. Khalsa members adhere to the five K's.

Read Your Bible.,
Pray to God.,
What Would Jesus Do?,
Avoid temptation.,
Go to church.",How to Be a Faithful Christian," You should read your Bible twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. If you focus just on God for 5-10 minutes, it really helps. Try to find time to read a verse or two from the Bible, and concentrate on what God is saying in the those verses.;
, Pray to him when you feel happy, sad, angry, scared, or just bored. Tell him your feelings and don't hold back on it. Not only are you strengthening your relationship with God, but it also really makes you feel better when you have someone to talk to.

, If you have a conflict, even if it is something as simple as, ""I wonder if I should eat this last slice of cake?"" You should ask yourself if what Jesus would do in this conflict. So, Jesus would probably not take that last slice of cake, but let someone else have it.

, A lot of times in our lives, we are tempted to do things we know we shouldn't do. Even though it's hard, the best thing to do is avoid it. Just walk away if the temptation is hard, and if it just keeps coming, pray to God to help lift your temptation, and find something to distract yourself. If someone is peer pressuring you to do something that isn't right, you should just tell them to stop, and walk away from it.

, It doesn't matter what type of Christian you are. There is a church out there for you. Attend any services you can, and make sure you take notes on the sermon. Also, attending a Sunday School helps, too. Most churches have Sunday Schools for adults and kids.

Experience!,
Fellowship!,

Live!!",How to Be a Devoted Christian Teenager," Let's say you get an e-mail from one of your close friends you haven't heard from in a while. What do you do? You read it, of course!


God wrote several letters to you, have you read them? Don't take out your dusty Bible and read it from cover-to-cover tonight - you'll never be able to grasp the right concept.
Read other books, like devotionals, that repeatedly talk about and quote the Bible; then you should read chapters of the Bible dealing with the issue in your devotional.
For an amazing reading plan and daily devotionals, try going to 1way2god.net

Girls: check out Point of Grace's book ""Girls of Grace"", which talks about God in every aspect of life, from family and friends, to boys. You can also try the ""Faithgirlz!"" series, which tells you how to stay close to God as you're growing up. For older teens, there is also the True Colors series by Melody Carlson. They're books that deal with common scenarios in today's society with a great Christian message. Look into them!

Guys: check out ""Revolution Devotional"".
A good standard of Bible reading time is ten to twenty minutes a day. No less. You can do more if you want, obviously.;
, You can experience the power of God in your life and know the real happiness which is more than just a religious concept, but comes from having the Holy Spirit in your life. Then you can build up your faith by praying in the Holy Spirit.

, That word means a lot more than casseroles and fried chicken at church get-togethers.


It means conversation. It means praying together. It means talking about what God is doing in your life. It means building up others who feel down.
It means no gossiping! If you're a Christian (especially if you go to a public school), you need other Christians to help you out. You need other Christians to give you encouragement and to listen to you. You need advice, too. And you need to give it when you can.
A lot of public schools have very few devoted Christians, so the best place to start looking for some Christian friends, is, of course, church. Choose them wisely though, only the ones that look and act like they really are dedicated, not the ones that look like they only come because the youth group goes to Dairy Queen once a month.

, Once you become more devoted to Christ, things should become different. Like Steven Curtis Chapman says, ""What about the difference? What about the change? What about forgiveness? What about a life that's showing I'm undergoing a change?""


It's time to show a change in your life relating to the opposite gender and keeping your integrity.

Guys, read Every Young Man's Battle: Strategies for Victory in the Real World of Sexual Temptation.
Girls, read Every Young Woman's Battle: Guarding Your Mind, Heart, and Body in a Sex-Saturated World.



, Be different in the way that you live life. Be mature and conduct yourself maturely.


This doesn't mean that you have to look totally different but it does mean that you shouldn't wear provocative clothing or shirts with pictures or messages that are contrary to a positive message. Listen to good music, and avoid any inappropriate videos. Use your best judgment.
The only way to truly live in a Christ-honoring fashion is to know Christ. You will never know him completely, on earth, but throughout life, by praying and reading your Bible, you can know him more.
Act the way Jesus did, and that's a life worth living, once you know Christ more than you did at first then you can understand how to live. Think WWJD (what would Jesus do)?

"
"
Get in touch with God.,
Stay close with your family.,
Build a close circle of friends.,
Take care of your body.,
Be confident.,
Express yourself.",How to Be a Happy Christian Teen," Read your Bible, pray, and worship. Reading your Bible doesn't mean you have to read it all the way through; skip around. One thing the Bible should not be is boring. Take time to meditate on the Word, look for understanding and try to apply it to your life.


Praying does not mean you have to spend 30 minutes talking to God. You don't have to be wordy. You don't have to kneel, fold your hands, or even close your eyes. You can pray standing up or on your knees with your eyes and hands lifted to heaven. That prayer might be only a few words repeated several times, ""Fill me"". ""Fill me, Lord."" It's simple, but God understands that it means, ""Fill me with your spirit, your strength, your joy. Help me show your love for others.""
Worship doesn't have to be only at church. You can sing and worship anywhere, even in the car on the way to school. Get a group of good Christian friends together, if you can, and take the time to sing worship songs. Remember, worship should occasionally be only between you and God, with no one else around.;
, Get along with your parents; take time with each of them to have fun. Working on a project together can be fun. Having a healthy relationship with your parents is always a good thing. Also talk to your parents about God; they can help your faith, if they are Christian too. If they're not, it's as important as ever to have a good relationship with them.


Don't forget being close with your siblings and grand parents (if you are lucky enough to have them).

, Choose anywhere between 1 and 15 good friends. They don't have to be the same age or gender, but in your closest group, try to stick with Christians who are a good influence. Have some Christian friends who are older than you, if possible, so you can look up to them, and they might help your faith grow by discussing the word of God.


With older friends you look up to, make sure they are good influences.
Feel free to have other friends besides the close group; include others, and maybe you will get a chance to be the good influence.
Make sure the friends you choose are true friends. They should build you up, not bring you down.

, This can mean a lot of things, but treat you body like a temple. Here are a few things you can do:


Eat healthy food. This doesn't mean no junk food; just all things in moderation. Gluttony is a sin, but don't starve yourself for any reason.
Keep away from drugs and cigarettes, and wait till you're 21 for the alcohol, if then. Be moderate in everything, especially things that may possibly have negative sides to them. Enough said?
Be happy with your body; it's beautiful. After all, God made you. Keep in good shape even if you have to walk, jog, swim and hike.
Be modest. Cover your body. Dress appropriately and attractively. Even if you are trying to get a date, immodesty is not the way to go about things. You will get attention, but it most likely won't be the right kind, or attract the right people.

, Build yourself up, and take care of your mind, and grades if you're in school. Don't criticize or cut yourself or others down., That hot shirt you love that's in the back of your closet because it's not ""cool""—wear it! No one will stop you, and you may have a good laugh in it.


One of the best ways to feel happy is to make someone else happy. You get to share in their happiness. You might be surprised how uplifting even a simple pat on the back can be to both giver and receiver.

Bring your dejection, your mourning, the ashes of your life and put it upon the table.,
Get to work on this trade by taking charge of your thoughts.,
Acknowledge God's existence, His authority, His ownership of all things -- including yourself, His involvement in your life, and His ability to affect the outcome of your life and circumstances.,
Come with thanksgiving.",How to Be a Happier Christian," You must be truly prepared to relinquish it entirely, thus disqualifying yourself from the comforts that accompany darkness of mind and spirit. You didn’t realize the perks? Well, they are there and very real. The comfort of your own self pity and perhaps that of Mom or other family members. The solace of knowing everything would have been so different in your life if they hadn’t done something to hurt you or if something hadn’t happened to you; better known as the victim mentality, thus relieving you of responsibility for your lack of motivation or joy. In fact, you and everyone else has ‘lowered the bar’ for you and not a lot is expected of you because of your ‘extenuating circumstances’. So, be ready to lose this rather bleak pay off along with your dejection!;
, When you are feeling low, you have more than a little trouble accessing good and happy positives available to you, for your thoughts stubbornly keep returning to the things that are wrong in your life then insist on predicting bad things to come! You need a concrete tool to help you direct your mind toward new horizons. Let’s use Psalm 100:4 -- “Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.” Using this verse, begin the process.

, (Your load is already lightened when you realize it is not all upon your shoulders -- that truly, God is in control.)

, Your depression has stolen from you the realization of all that is good in your life. You must deliberately force your mind to go and retrieve these things. Get a pen and notebook and begin a list of good things in and about your life that you can be thankful for. You will be amazed at what you find! It might be as simple as how good the cold milk is when you drink it with cobbler, or a very sweet memory of your mother playing with you when you were little. It might be that you get a check every month to meet your needs. You are manually retraining your mind, taking it from the well worn grooves it continually runs along to access worry, regret, fears. You are reprogramming it to search for good things; positive things that will make life worth living! Be strong and forcefully keep populating your list. You are alive and actually there are many things to be thankful for! As you reflect upon the things on your list it opens your eyes to the good things in your life and you can see them again!


You will feel the flutter of real, unforced gratitude, realizing as you do that God is the giver of every good thing -- your life, your very breath, for He is good and with Him all things are possible! As you see indisputable proof of His goodness and blessing upon your life, you will begin to be truly thankful -- for the air conditioning, for the neighbor who smiles at you, that your shoulder doesn’t hurt like it used to! Suddenly, your gratitude turns to praise to God for He is good! He didn’t have to be so good to you and everyone. He did it because He is good and worthy of praise.

Confronting/arguing with friends and family about sensitive subjects like this is a surefire way to make them feel irritated or uncomfortable. So, be patient and mindful of their feelings, avoid topics that are particularly touchy; pray for them and do not criticize them directly. Practicing an idea of what to say in advance is also a good idea to ensure you're conveying what you're trying to in a way that seems non-judgmental and easier for them to listen to. It's up to them to receive Christ as their Lord and Savior, but you can be supportive.

, Occasionally, volunteer and do daily, personal charity of your own. In the Gospels, Jesus commands: ""Love one another."" -- saying ""if you have no love, then you are none of mine.""

God does not want us to try to change ourselves superficially -- with things like strange hair dye, body piercings, and tattoos.But, if you have done all that and then come to Christ, use it all to advantage to reach the people similar to yourself, who may feel out of place with the most genteel and proper of great Christians, who don't get it...
Be well groomed, take care of your body and carry yourself well in both posture and confidence. Cleanliness and neatness also apply to your clothing, all of this will help you make a good impression, regardless of your taste in clothes. Invest a little time in good skin and hair care daily -- to enhance your appearance, naturally.
Girls, dress for success, modestly: that means please try to avoid mini skirts, short dresses, low cut tops, sleeveless tops, and/or short shorts. Wearing such clothing is not particularly wrong for your comfort, but it is certainly wrong to cause some other Christian brother to stumble by lusting over your body just because you want to feel more ""comfortable"". Wearing modest clothing isn't as limiting as you may think, modest clothes can still match your personal style quite nicely. Consider visiting a department store -- with someone whose tastes in clothing you respect -- to try new things on and see what styles and colors look better on you.
Girls, a little makeup can enhance natural beauty. All you need for daily wear is a bit of brown or blackish brown mascara, sheer lip gloss and blush in a flattering shade. Try concealer, if you have acne -- or use powder, if you have oily skin; just be careful to not overdo it. A little eyeshadow, eyeliner and natural lipliner/lipstick are for special occasions. The key is to enhance, not overpower, what God has given you.

,



Not by work but by receiving the free gift, ""by faith through God's grace""; so that, after you accept God's plan, then you will actively work and extend grace, because we ""love others as he first loved us"", and also ""do good-works appointed"" for each of us, as you accept and pass that grace (unmerited favor) on to others, and because you are justified, and pardoned freely by God -- for all you have ever done or do. Realize that you will get what you plant into your own life and into the lives of others -- ""you'll reap what you sow"", in another way of expressing that.

,


Encourage others to be saved and baptised.
Follow Jesus and The Ten Commandments all of the time.
Love God! Show it by loving others -- helping those in need. Anybody can say that they love God, but also show that you do through actions and words.
Honor you father and you mother at all times no matter how hard it may be. Arguing nicely with them may not be pleasant, but it comes with being a teenager and a human. Just make sure you resolve any conflicts that arise, take the initiative to do this, if necessary and try your best to stay on good terms with them
Do not steal or cheat. Be honest, not wasting breath or killing time.
Create a Christian website and/or articles with your notes and other info like inspiring testimonies and Bible verses. If you have a Facebook, you may also consider putting verses there for your friends to see and talk about how much God has done for you.

,


Be friendly with everyone. However, avoid falling under the bad influences of troublemakers, backstabbers, liars or bullies.
Don't fight with others. Always turn the other cheek. Don't growl.
Try to maintain your composure when stressed. Get energized, enthusiastic and inspired, but not frenzied; have an edge by living by faith (not by sight), not allowing moods or feelings to change your outlook! However, also know anxiety is a human emotion and there's no way to dodge it entirely.
Find quiet ways to curb anxiety, sadness, anger, etc. Activities such as sports, writing and drawing can do a great at helping you relieve yourself as they become a distraction. If you need help and know things are out of control, never be afraid to ask. Also remember that crying is a natural and healthy way of relieving stress, just try to do it either alone or with people you know.
Be a peacemaker. Don't get in harsh disagreements with people, whether it is physical or not. If there are direct insults, discrimination, aggression or anything intended to hurt, it's gone too far.
Don't gossip about other people. It can really hurt somebody and yourself, when you cut-down others without good reason.
Don't EVER be a bully -- cyber, verbal, or physical.
If you see another person being bullied for whatever reason, never be afraid to stand up for them. Odds are, they'll be very grateful for your help and admire your courage.
Don't stay in abusive or toxic situations. The only thing you owe anybody who is going out of their way to hurt you is a kick out of your life.
Don't avoid people because they have a different religion or ideology. Many of these people won't pressure you to change who you are and you can learn a lot from such friendships.
Demonstrate respect, fairness and kindness to others at all times.
Be respectful to your elders at all times.
Be set free of fear, hate and shame by living in Christ.

,
Volunteer, such as: in the nursery or toddler room during Sunday service.
Volunteer to help the teachers during VBS (vacation Bible school).

, Have fun learning, working and doing chores at home and helping your family and friends.


Set a good example for children and younger teenagers. If you're not comfortable with your brother or sister doing something, don't do it yourself.
Do your best in school. Make a good effort to study hard and love your schoolwork, it will reward you well after you graduate.
If you have a job, be a diligent worker, complete all your tasks on time and try to get along with your boss and co-workers.
Don't get in a habit of living on line, with social media or in chat-rooms or gaming all the time.
Don't choose or watch inappropriate movies or videos -- cruel, bloody, violent, hate-filled, hard-core, vulgar, explicit content of many kinds, some include: 'R, R-17, X, XXX, porn',...
Avoid listening to crude music -- gang, violent, hate or trash-talk, i.e.: cussing like ""'bi-atch', glorifying of 'ho', 'pimp'..."" or other inappropriate content (unworthy of your time and attention).
Stay loyal to God and strive to be your best self .

See your need of Jesus.,
Believe that Jesus died on the cross for your sins.,
Repent which means, ""turn to God"" for salvation.",How to Be a Christian1," Take a look at the Ten Commandments for a moment. Have you ever lied? Blasphemed? Stolen (even something small)? Looked at someone with adulterous or lustful feelings? In Christianity, we are born with original sin, and act as sinners through our lives, even after accepting Jesus: as Jesus said, ""If you look upon a woman to lust, then you are guilty of adultery already"" (Matthew 5:27-28). He who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him. ( 1 John 3:15). You have to face God on judgment day to give an account of your sins. If you die in your sins, God has to send you away from Himself to Hell, called the second death, for transgressing His law.


Realize, however, that He sent Jesus to give Himself willingly on the cross and so: If you believe, receive the Holy Spirit, and repent of your sins, then after you are saved, you will also serve others as if it is to God himself.
As Son of Man, Jesus said, ""Father, if it is your will, let this bitter cup pass from me -- nevertheless, 'not my will but thine be done'."", giving Himself freely as the sacrifice for you so that you may now turn, ""repent (change your mind) therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out/wiped away, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;"" (Acts 3:19);
, Believe, further, that Jesus died and rose again from the dead to pay the penalty for your sins and make you right with God. Believe the basic doctrine of Christ's redemptive death and resurrection

, Verbalize your belief in Jesus' forgiveness and your regret for all the ways you have fallen short of His holiness. This is a good time to admit your personal failure and disobedience to God. Believe that Jesus Christ forgives you. Repentance always expresses itself in a changed life; you turn from sin and to Jesus Christ; then, accept your free gift of salvation by faith in Jesus' redemptive death through grace from God.


Express reliance upon God: Specifically, confess your spiritual need and acknowledge for yourself Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour.






You need the Gospel of Christ: The good news of Jesus Christ, that you broke His Law but Christ took your punishment, paying your sin-fine. It is not earned, it is strictly given by God's grace. He grants us repentance and faith in His Son in order to save us from Hell.
Learn the difference between churches of the Gospel. Choose a Christian meeting to attend and fellowship. Consider and decide on the Baptist, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, Nondenominational, Orthodox, Pentecostal, Mormon, etc. denominations in order to decide which one is the Church that Christ started, the ""Pillar and Foundation of Truth"" .

"
Find community and assembly with other Christians.,
Be baptised.,
Love Jesus and love others with the love that Jesus gives you.,
Be amazed when you understand what Ephesians 2:8--10 says:""""8.,
Read the Holy Bible as much as possible.",How to Be a Christian2," We cannot walk alone in life. It is important that as a Christian you find a group of supportive and seasoned Christian believers who can help you and encourage you in your new faith and continuing trust in God. You may find it helpful to talk to a Christian. Choose someone that you respect for his or her integrity and knowledge as a Christian., Baptism is about coming into the community of Christ. This is the second step of salvation, after repentance. It may be thought of as a self portrait of your joining with Christ in the death and resurrection in your heart (core of your being) and in the eye of the observer. “Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”Baptism was described by the apostle Paul as: ""Therefore we are planted together (united) with Him by baptism into death: that as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.""Continue your walk . After you have accepted Christ by receiving the Holy Spirit, fellowship with Him in your daily life by praying, reading the Bible, and following Christ's example.







, These things reflect your changed heart, and love one of the most important aspects of a Christian life.


Be truthful to God and Jesus. Truly repent of your actions and thought, and seek, then accept God's love and His plan and then be saved by His grace. It's really bad for you to not confess, repent and to be saved, but if you are not, you will then die in Hell (and nobody ever wants that to happen). If you ever want to see your friends and family in Heaven and to tell them all about your life. Well, isn't that what you want?

, For it is ""by grace"" you have been saved, ""through faith""--
and this ""not of yourselves"", it is the ""gift of God""--
9. ""not by works"", so that no one can boast.
10. For we are God's workmanship
""created"" in Christ Jesus ""to do good works"",
which God prepared in advance for us to do.""(Ephesians 2:8--10) So if you are saved, live to do good to others, according to God's law of love...


, Then you will begin to understand what you need to do with your walk with the Lord. In order to become a Christian, you need to grow in Christ:

"
"
Learn about Jesus and believe that He died, rose from the dead as your Savior and then pray for repentance to the one, true God repenting, similar to: ""Father, God, I turn from my sin, all my wrong doing; I want to change, and I truly thank you for everything you have done and that I am now freely forgiven and saved from the penalty for my sins -- as a free gift, and you do place a new life in me.,
Walk in love; follow Jesus, telling others that ""For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;"" (1 Timothy 2:5) the Son of God, who is Lord and Savior for everyone who believes, repents and follows Him, and, yes, you must follow -- and so, (walk in the Spirit):""""Following Jesus Christ"" will include going to Christian meetings with people of like faith, being Baptised, in the name of the Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit, as a sign of accepting your new life, praying to God, reading the Bible, and showing God's love by kindness, forgiving others, making peace, having a faithful, loving relationship with believers (don't live by feelings; judge no one harshly, not even yourself; live and walk in Christ's Spirit, The Spirit of God, in faith, hope and charity.",How to Be a Christian3," Thank you for your gift for me of receiving The Holy Spirit in Jesus' name.""
, So, live in the Spirit and no one can snatch you out of Jesus' hands and The Father's hands; that is safety, secured.) But, when you (in your mind) are convicted of sin, expecting consequences for it, ask for forgiveness (so that you can be forgiven), and you can keep on living as a Child of God, all in Christ Jesus' name -- with God as the one, true Judge of all things both good and bad. God's love is perfect and casts out all fear.

Be confident: ""Good Pride"" is clean, pure, seeking education and betterment for sharing it -- not neglectful, but prudent, not self-seeking, to shirk duty nor ""con"" people, not corrupt...,
Beware of pride: while restraining self-centered sensual living; for, ""Pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall."",
Access the promise of support, and comfort in the Holy Spirit: the presence of your Almighty Friend through His love, forgiveness -- and His ultimate judgment.,
Be humble, in the flawless power of His grace: ""Be humble even as I am humble;"" Jesus said -- (recall that Jesus drove the merchants from God's house...).,
Prepare to reign with Christ, but not in your own right: His saints shall reign with him.

,
Surrender all, comparing your best to Him, realizing that every ordinary thing gets old and cracks-up: The Bible says you will receive a crown of life -- and that in Heaven you shall wear a crown, but that you will lay it down at God's throne as mark of surrender.

,
Be a good winner in weakness.,
Fret not about tomorrow.,
Read about: ""I praise God because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well."",
Study the Bible and see that you are a child of the King and being one of God's children you are an heir:
""We are God’s children: Now if we are His children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ—if indeed we share in his sufferings, in order that we may also share in his glory.,
Understand what Jesus said:""I no longer call you children, but I call you brothers.""",How to Avoid Pride (Christianity)," According to the Bible outward circumstances will not separate you from perfect love; so that while in the path of everyday life, family and other duty, be satisfied and happy in many kinds of situations, by the exercise of your faith, hope, effort to improve for common good with prayer and supplying needs of God's lesser/little ones.


Yours is ""pure Christianity by your:~ a ~ ""Caring for orphans and widows in their times of trouble..."" and
~ b ~ ""Refusing to let the world corrupt you."" (James 1:27), in their need (to assist them as well as you might) and not taking their home, means or goods... but joyously enlarging their hopes and nurturing them!;
,
Is it really so destructive? Is pride related to greed, hate, defensiveness, jealousy and envy, yes... Well, stressing to be envied or to set flames of jealousy will hurt you, the most...

, In the most distant corners of Earth, in Heaven, or in Hell, you can rest in peace in God's piercing view -- in grace and His plan with its infinite hope and perfect charity...

, Do you know, ""You are the temple of God"" -- God wants to abide their, and as God's Son Jesus is the champion of Love (recall that ""God is Love"") in the flesh.


""When you think that you stand: Beware that you may fall."" for instance:
~ Not giving others credit and opportunity allow small success but severely limits your own leadership and growth -- lacking qualities of accepting others contributions with thankfulness.

,,, Winning through grace is a very humbling experience, if you realize that only God gives you this kind of victory over the world.

, Jesus Christ has overcome the world. The cares and fun of this world have no way to overcome the ""law of sin and death."" Should you lose your life, the grave cannot separate you from the promises of the Savior to raise you in a new body.

, (Psalm 139:14) , (Romans 8:17),

Recognize that faith is a sensitive subject.,
Know and be comfortable with the Bible Make sure you are well informed about the Bible.,
Wait for the appropriate time.,
Listen to the viewpoints of others without interrupting, objecting, or correcting.,
Don't monopolize the discussion.,
A friendly, respectful manner is one that will be greeted with reciprocal respect.,
Remember your goal.,
Resist the temptation to quote a lot of scripture.,
Don't be afraid to use humor.,
Accentuate the positive.,
But if you must.",How to Be a Christian Others Feel Comfortable Talking With About Faith," Be prepared to remain calm, friendly, and welcoming, as opposed to defensive, hostile and superior.;
, Carry a pocket sized Bible (like a Gideon's) so that you have some reinforcement.

, When you're in a large group of people, such as at a party, unless you're approached specifically, that's probably not the best time. The most agreeable circumstance is in a small group or one on one. Even then, watch for an opening - and recognize that if there isn't one, you shouldn't be the one to bring this subject up.

, Once the discussion has begun, it's very helpful to understand why a person believes other than what you believe. Hearing them talk about their own belief system will allow you to then, thoughtfully and calmly, say, ""I see, you know, I don't think I ever knew that about you. You know that I'm a Christian, right? (they nod or whatever) Generally, the Christian belief is ________."" Keep your response as brief as possible.

, As mentioned, particularly in a setting where there is more than one person you're chatting with, let them talk first. You respond.

, If you start getting hostile or frustrated, you will give the other person the impression that they are not only NOT entitled to their own beliefs, but that they're actually stupid for having them. Nothing will get you - and Christianity in general - shut out quicker than for the person you're trying to reach to think that you believe they are (1) stupid, (2) condemned, (3) misguided, (4) ignorant. Even if you do think so.

, You're not there to 'win' this argument. You're not there to argue. You're there to present the Christian faith in a positive way that is interesting enough to at least one other person that you will be granted the privilege of sharing your faith with them. You are not better than them because you're a Christian. You are simply blessed in a way they are not as of yet. Don't make this about you. Remember who you are - you are the face of Jesus that this person is seeing at that moment. Make sure you're presenting him accurately.

, Sometimes we feel that the Word is the most powerful tool there is for reaching the non-Christian. It is, no doubt. But it's only that powerful tool when used at the right moment - a hammer is a powerful tool, too, but it isn't much help in tying a fly fishing lure. At that first moment, the most powerful tool you have is your own charming personality. Believe in yourself - you're a nice person, you know how you want to be treated in a conversation. Just do that for the other person, and talk from your own heart. Pray for help. It'll be there.

, Keep it light - for now. A sense of humor about God is very appealing to many people who are seeking. A lot of these people are lonely, searching for meaning, but don't want to be involved in something they perceive as restrictive or limiting, and they really don't want to be all depressed. Reminding people that it really was God who said, ""Hmmm. Here's a... yellow horse... with a really long neck and brown spots... and ANTENNAS! I like it! We are SO keeping this guy!"" can be very attractive.

, Don't threaten people with damnation and hell. You will see their shields go up every single time. Instead, concentrate on explaining that the reason you're at peace, that you are confident and assured is that you have faith that all is well in God's hands, and that faith and hope that you have in Him is what makes your serenity possible in the face of the worst storms in your life. That's attractive. Fire and brimstone is not with some people.

, A conversation about Hell is necessary to people who don't already know that a particular habit or path leads to destruction and need or want someone to care enough to remind them. Fire and brimstone should only be spoken when you know that your relationship of heart will end up closer before the nightfall. WARNING: You don't want to do a disservice to them and Christ. Also, it shouldn't just be spoken as ""fire and brimstone"", but (also) more specifically. If your friend drinks heavily, they aren't facing up to where they are heading from subtle hints from society and friends, and you've gotten to a stage to talk to him or her about this, only then let them know directly the bad health, bad family picture, and disrespect of company that is probably ahead of them. Remember, this should only be done with people with whom you've had a long-standing relationship with and will continue to have a long standing relationship. The shorter and weaker the relationship, the more ""love quota"" in the ""grace bank"" you need to meet first before constructively criticizing.

, This will help you prepare for leadership and give you the opportunity to gather support.

, There are many ways to lead. You might be called to the clergy or asked to lead as a musician, counselor, educator or some other role.


Keep an open mind. Christian leaders are not only priests, pastors, ministers or nuns. Leading a bible study, prayer group or Sunday school class also offers opportunities for leadership.

, Christians believe God will not call them to do more than can be handled. Let your community support and assist you.

, Restore confidence to people who are suffering, lift up those who are depressed, and remind people of their value to God and others.


Provide comfort. As a Christian leader, people will look to you for help when people die, lose their jobs and get sick. A good leader will do more than read Scripture from the Bible. Listen to people and let them know they are not alone.

, Leadership means taking people through rough periods without losing them. Empathize with those who are hurting, and remind them of better days to come and blessings that exist in an otherwise miserable situation.

, You will need to show people how to compromise as a Christian leader. Conflicts may arise between the people you are leading, and instead of choosing sides, you will need to diffuse the crisis.

, Whether you are leading the choir or managing the youth group, you will have to get everyone on the same page and moving towards the same goals.

, A leader has to do what she says she is going to do. Build trust by demonstrating that you can be relied upon.

, Christians believe Jesus lived and died for their sins. Since he was the original Christian leader, you will want to live and preach as Jesus did.


Study your Bible and read what scholars and theologians have written about Jesus. The more you learn, the more you can share with the people you lead.

, In the gospel of Mark, Jesus said ""the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve."" Christian leaders will be humble and willing to put the people they lead ahead of themselves.

, Christians are taught not to collect material possessions and to give generously to people in need. A Christian leader in a mansion with expensive cars might not be very credible.

, Christians believe no human is without sin, so a leader who has the same struggles as the people she leads will be respected and trusted.

Also, most bookstores sell books that help you understand the scripture better, if you find the Bible a bit difficult to fully actualize – which happens to most of us!


Participating in Bible study groups can make this a fun, enjoyable activity that you stick with over the long-term. What’s more, you’ll make plenty of like-minded friends with whom you can share the word of God.
Jesus said in Matthew 24:35, ""Heaven and earth shall pass away but My words shall not pass away."" And by reading the Bible, you make sure His words live on.;
, It’s important to put God before everything, thanking Him for everything, too. Pray when you get up (and read the Bible), pray before you eat, and pray before you go to sleep (and read the Bible). Always keep Him with you, which is easiest done with prayer.


James 1:5 says that God wants to give you wisdom in abundance if you ask for it. Prayer can indeed be about anything, and regardless of what your prayer is about, God will answer you as He sees fit. Ask for advice, forgiveness, but also just drop into say hello from time to time!

, Be it through the way you talk to people or the way you are in the day-to-day, always praise the Lord. Let everybody see that God is present and within you. This means cultivating an aura of positivity and light, doing what He would do. Let Him live through you.


Part of this is up to interpretation. Does praising the Lord mean praying regularly to you? Singing? Talking about Him with others? All of these ideas are right! Praising him means living in His light – there's no wrong way to do it.
""This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad."" Think about this: today is a day from the Lord – how uplifting and powerful is that? Realizing that makes it easier to turn every moment into a moment of praise.

, This is one of the hardest things for many of us – we read the scriptures, we go to church, we try to live as He would, but at the end of the day, we still play the blame game, even if that means we blame ourselves. To be closer to God, make a conscious effort toward forgiving yourself and forgiving others. We’re all trying to do our best!


Instead of acting out with anger or malice, turn the other cheek. When someone rubs you the wrong way, show them that you’re living in the light of Christ and taking the higher road. Forgive them for their sins as Jesus would do. Who knows? They may be inspired by your actions.
The next time you’re beating yourself up over the tiniest thing, remember how perfect you are to Him. He would hate to see you treating yourself that way! Instead, concentrate on doing better next time, focusing on the future and not the past.
Ephesians 4:32 says, ""Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you."" When you're tempted otherwise, think of this simple yet beautiful sentiment.

, Never brag how close you are to God. This will just turn people off from the Gospel and you'll miss your chance to witness to others. No one cares for arrogance – Jesus certainly never did. In the book of Peter, it says, ""Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you."" Remember: we are all his sons and daughters.Unfortunately, some Christians come off as arrogant, assuming their faith is better than others’. Remember that Jesus preached that we are all sons and daughters of God, and that everyone should be loved equally. Keeping this in mind will make it easier to be humble in His image.

, Youth groups or other get-togethers with people who share your faith can be a great thing to do to bring yourself closer to your religion.

, Whether this means donating clothes to your church’s next fundraiser or buying a sandwich for that homeless man you pass on the street every day, take action. Proverbs 19:17 says, “Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will repay him for his deed.”Virtually every community has individuals that need a helping hand. And if you're uncomfortable giving money, that's fine – do you have some old clothes you don't wear anymore? Could you bake a dish for a family you know, or give it to a homeless shelter? Could you make a craft to brighten someone's day? Money isn't the only route to happiness!

, Tell the world of His glory! A simple way to be a better Christian is to be proud of your faith and to talk of how wonderful it feels, being so loved. Do your part to better the world by spreading His message. Who knows, you could change a few people’s lives!


When you see people who are sick or in pain offer to pray for them and expect God to heal them
You don't have to do this directly (some people will not be receptive and view even the smallest comment as evangelizing); instead, you can attribute your happiness and success to the Lord. Simply embodying Him is spreading His power.

, Don’t put on a show on the outside that you think He would approve of, but that you don't truly feel on the inside. The opposite is true, too: don't put on a show on the outside to blend in, asking for forgiveness later. When your religion comes up, be open about it. You have nothing to be ashamed of!


Be genuine about your doubts, too. It’s only if you open up about them that others can reinforce your belief, making it ultimately stronger.

, Give tithes to the church, as written in the Bible, for the betterment of those less fortunate that the church can help that one person alone may be unable to reach. This includes your time as well as your possessions. But other organizations would benefit from your time and money, too – so spread the love as much as you can!


In Corinthians it is said, “Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” Don’t give tithes out of obligation – give them as a cheerful giver, knowing you're doing your part.

, In addition to going to church every Sunday, help out! Going through the motions is not what God intended. Sing in the choir, lector, or just be a greeter – any effort is appreciated. This will help you feel more devoted to your community, too.


Find out how you can help – there’s usually more help that needs to be done than there are hands. Do you have any special talents? Cooking? Playing guitar? Sewing? Woodworking? Offer them up to your church. They’ll be able to make use of them somewhere!

, A great way to truly impact the world the way God wants is to vote according to your beliefs. Whether it’s for President or just a tiny neighborhood election, your vote matters, especially to Him. This way, you’re doing your part to better your community at large.


As the Bible is often subject to interpretation, think about what His words mean to you. If we are all sons and daughters of the Lord, what would be best for all of us, men and women, black and white, young and old?

, Going to church for an hour a week isn’t your “God time.” It’s 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. So take that time and do something with it where you can channel your energy and produce something in His name. Whether it’s a painting, a song, a story, or a dish, He’d be proud.


This ""creative time"" is good for you, too. It can help center you, relax you, and ultimately make you feel better about your situation. We all need to destress from time to time, and this may be the push you need to feel prepared to be a better Christian.
Proverbs 22:29 states, ""Do you see a man skillful in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.""Talk about an endorsement from the big guy upstairs!

, The Bible heavily advocates helping your sisters and brothers – Hebrews 13:16 says it well: ""Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God."" And in today’s day and age, that’s easier than ever.


Volunteer at soup kitchen, homeless shelter, or hospital. Work with neglected kids who need a mentor, organize your church’s next luncheon, or even walk a few dogs from the Humane Society! There are dozens of ways you can better your community in His name.

, This may sound a bit silly, but visiting other churches helps us understand other people, meet other Christians, and immerse ourselves in the Christian community, not just our one church. The more you learn about your faith, the stronger it'll be.


Experiment with other denominations, too. An orthodox Christian church could be a fascinating experience. However, don’t shy away from the other Abrahamic religions (Islam and Judaism) either – visiting a synagogue or mosque will also be a fruitful, enlightening experience. After all, we all share the same roots!

, There is much to learn in the lives of those great Christians who lived before us. Do some research and pick out a few individuals with stories that speak to you. How can you have their faith and their resolve? How can you live like they would?


You've heard of Jesus, you've head of Martin Luther King, Jr., but have you heard of George Whitefield, Dwight Moody, or William Carey? There are so many individuals who have stories that we can learn from and be inspired by. And all it takes now is the press of a few buttons!

, Devote a few minutes each day to your faith journal. You can talk about whatever you like – what you’re thankful for, what you’re thinking about that day, or what you’d like His guidance on. Just staying conscious of Him and His presence in your life is the goal.


As time goes on, flip back through the pages of your journal. You’ll likely be amazed at all the growth you’ve made!
Take it with you wherever you go – you may find a quiet moment where you feel particularly reflective and having it at your side will be handy to record how you feel right then and there.
Isaiah 40:8 – ""The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever."" This doesn't mean only the scripture, this can even be the word of God through you.

Realise that there are sub-types of Christian Universalism.,
There are two main perspectives on the purpose of punishment in Universalism.,
Christian Universalism and Unitarian Universalism aren't the same thing.,
Read the Bible.,
Read other Universalist books.",How to Be a Christian Universalist," For example, Evangelical Universalism emphasizes the Bible very strongly, Charismatic Universalism does so with God's will, and Liberal Universalists believe that reason and conscience are important in one's spiritual life. And many people combine different aspects from these traditions.;
, Most believe that Hell is for reconciliation, and emphasize that it isn't eternal. But a few are 'Ultra-Universalists', or believe that Hell isn't a literal place after death. Instead, they see that reconciliation with God occurs during this life on Earth.

, The latter is non-creedal, while most Christian Universalist groups have some sort of creed or doctrine to go by. But Christian Universalism is welcomed in Unitarian Universalist congregations, however.

, Even if you don't put a lot of emphasis on it, it's still a good idea to read it. This will help you not only strengthen your beliefs, but also help you defend them if you must. Even the most liberal Christians appreciate a good biblical argument. Plus, it might inspire you.

Yes, Christians are covered in God's grace, but God still has certain expectations for Christians. Paul says repeatedly that you are to ""walk in a manner worthy of your calling.""


There is the verse, ""There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."" However Romans 14:12 says, ""Each of us will give an account of ourselves to God."" Being a Christian doesn't completely get you off the hook, in a sense. Paul says ""work out your salvation with fear and trembling.""
There are verses about falling from grace and falling from the faith. There are verses about branches that do not bear fruit being cut off.
Romans 11:22 says, ""Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in His kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off."" God is just and, therefore, cannot put up with sin. If someone continues to habitually sin as a supposed Christian, God's justice will probably be seen then rather than His grace.;
, Yes, all Christians are chosen and called ""before the foundation of the world"", but also remember the verse, ""Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."" Salvation is an open invitation. It is not just for ""the chosen ones.""


1 Timothy 2:4 says, ""God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth."" Calvinism is not entirely true in saying that God picks some to be saved and some not to be saved. The truth is that God wishes that all people would come to be saved, but as He knows who will follow and what they will do.
Romans 8:29 says, ""Those God foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son."" God's knowing who would choose to follow Him, preceded whom He predestined (and thus saved unto the works that He prepared and foreordained, but we still have to receive Him, lay aside wrong ideas, follow Christ and do accordingly, or not, and He helps us in cooperation with others, if we let Him and others share).

, Every Christian receives the Holy Spirit when they are saved, but every Christian can be filled more with the Holy Spirit and with His gifts, of the Holy Spirit, in order to share the Gospel, etc.


Jesus' own disciples even received the Holy Spirit three or more times. John 20:21-22 says, ""Jesus said to them again, 'Peace be with you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.' And, when He had said this, He breathed on them and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit.' "" This was when the disciples first became born again essentially. This when they received the Holy Spirit and were baptized in the Holy Spirit.
Then at Pentecost it says, ""All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit."" So in this instance they were filled more with the Holy Spirit, but it was only temporary, because again in Acts 4 it says, ""After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And, they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.""
These are the same disciples that were filled in this extra way at Pentecost. So over the course of a Christian's life, they can be filled many times, in this extra way, by the Holy Spirit.

, Jesus said in Matthew 18:3, ""Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven."" What this means is that we are to trust God with our hearts as a child trusts their parent. It means that we are to have faith that God is real even when we can't see Him or fully understand Him. But, it does not mean that we are to have childish thinking. We are still called to reason, as Paul did in Acts with the Jews. Jesus said that we are to be ""as wise as serpents but as innocent as doves."" Don't have the intelligence of a child; only have the heart of a child.


One also needs the perspective to: ""speak the things (that are true), not in words taught or learned through human wisdom/philosophy, but in those words of God taught by following the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people."" (1 Corinthians 2). That is a higher calling than mere schooling, to follow God's Spirit, with Jesus as your main instructor (with Paul, James, Peter, Jude, etc. as mentors to us all).

, The Bible says ""Judge not lest ye be judged."" What this means is when Jesus said that we must first remove the plank from our own eye before we can judge our brother. If we struggle with something that we are condemning in someone's else, we need to look at ourselves first.


However we are called to judge certain things. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 5:12, ""What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?"" We are not supposed to judge non-Christians. Only God can do that. But, we are called to tell the truth with love to judge the fruit of our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ, so that we can keep them accountable. Christians are meant to be held to a higher standard to do the good that God has foreordained.
If a fellow Christian is not living ""in a manner worthy of their calling"" as Paul talks about, we are supposed to call them out on it. However, we only do this for their own good. It is a corrective act of love, not condemnation.

, The Bible at no time says that any spiritual gifts would cease. Most people use 1 Corinthians 13 to say that when the Bible was complete, certain gifts ceased. But, rather Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13, ""When the perfect comes, the partial will be done away... For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face."" This is referring to, in Heaven. People did not see God face to face when the Bible was completed. We will not see God face to face until we are in Heaven.


So all the gifts still exist today, but what does Paul say, for example, regarding the gift of tongues? 1 Corinthians 14:27 says, ""If anyone speaks in a tongue, two—or at the most three—should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.""
In communal worship tongues must always be interpreted, and only two or three people should speak in a tongue, and each in turn to give them a chance to be interpreted. It is not meant to be that the two or three speak in tongues at the same time to the congregation. Some churches practice whole group spontaneously praising, glorifying God and praying aloud (while some may speak in tongues). Some have an instrumental praise song be played and encourage people to pray or sing aloud in tongues. Thus they say that is decent, orderly, controlled and regulated. The gift is still in existence today, but it is meant to be decent, orderly, regulated and controlled in communal worship.

, Consider what Paul's life was like.


He says in 2 Corinthians 11, ""Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was pelted with stones. Three times I was shipwrecked. I spent a night and a day in the open sea. I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my fellow Jews, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false believers. I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food. I have been cold and naked. Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches.""
Therefore, do not expect to have a comfortable and happy life as a Christian. Sometimes becoming a Christian will only make your life harder. Why? Because Satan becomes more set against you once you are a Christian.
However in 2 Corinthians 4 this same Paul said about the Christian life, ""We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed...Therefore, we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So, we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal."" Amen! So even if the life of a Christian is harder due to persecution, etc., we still always have the hope of Heaven to look forward to. Someday we will achieve an ""eternal glory"" in Heaven thanks to Jesus' death. Praise God!

, The Bible says that Satan can ""masquerade as an angel of light."" Satan can and does imitate miracles or things that God's Holy Spirit can do in order to deceive people. Also, remember that the magicians in Egypt could do all that Moses did, but the magicians were empowered by Satan, not God.

, Paul says in 2 Corinthians 12:7, ""Because of these surprisingly great revelations... in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me."" Sometimes God allows us to be in pain, or to stay in pain, in order to humble us.


Paul was given a vision of Heaven, but then God allowed this ""thorn in the flesh"" to keep him from becoming arrogant on account of what he had seen. Paul notes that he prayed for his pain to go away, but God essentially said, ""No."" Paul says, ""Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But, He said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.'"" God told Paul, ""No."", of all people, and not just once, but three times.
Therefore, God may very well say, ""No."" to us also, many times, about many different things we request. Remember that God said, ""My ways are higher than your ways, and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts."" We may not understand why God tells us, ""No."", but know that it is probably for our own good somehow.
God says to Paul essentially that He wants Paul to be weak because then his power can be shown greater in Paul. The more that we are weak, the more that God's strength shines through us. Then it becomes all about God, as it should be and not us. Amen.

, Sometimes God says, ""No."", or ""Wait."" When Jesus was praying in the garden of Gethsemane, He said, ""Yet, not my will but your will be done."" Essentially, God told Jesus, who was God in the Flesh, ""No!"" That is, also, we should pray for God's will, and sometimes tell ourselves, ""No."" Jesus did say, ""You have not because you ask not."" But, James 4:3 says, ""When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures."" It may not be a lack of faith for why we don't get what we are asking. It might just be because we are asking with wrong or bad motives that we don't get what we pray for.


But dis-agreement and ""human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires. So, get rid of all moral filthiness and the evil that is in such general use, and humbly accept the word that has been planted in you, which can save you."", as James laid it out for us. (James 1:21).

, It's the only REAL ""How To"" about Christianity! Seek the baptism of the Holy Spirit because it is a promise given to everybody not only to guide but also to teach us.

, Many people have trouble with that one. Judging is for God to do, not us. As Christians, we are called to love each other, and that means leaving the judging to God. Rebuking others (preferably as compassionately as possible) is fine, but first you must do as Jesus says, and ""Take the plank out of your eye before you try to remove the speck from another's eye"", otherwise you will only be a hypocrite.

Participate in the worship service, which is called 'Divine Service'.,
Understand that Lutheranism, like Catholicism, usually contains these things in their worship service:


Hymn
General confession (i.e., of sins)
A reading from 3 passages in the Bible (one from the Old Testament, one from the Epistles or Saint Paul's letters, and one from the Gospels).,
Feel free to ask questions at the end.,

, Some are evangelical (such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America), and others are more conservative (such as the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod). Take this into consideration when attending the church's services.

, Lutheran churches, like Catholic ones, are liturgical. Some ('High Church') are more liturgical than others ('Low Church'). Attend whichever one seems more comfortable, or whichever one is the most interesting.

Use the Bible as a narrative, accurate and poetic source for understanding God intervening (interfering) in everyday events (but not forcing) and the development of Judaism through earliest Christianity, and that it is also a spiritual road map of creation and reveals God's higher purpose and plan for mankind.,
Ask those that do not believe in God to account for the Bible’s accuracy, i.e.,
Show the picture of God that the Bible paints in words as the revelation of the one-and-only-God who is omniscient (all knowing, observing and testing all things), omnipotent, having an image but no ordinary-material being, omnipresent, eternal, immutable, indivisible, giving free choices (freedom) with many resulting consequences/rewards, and His being all caring, accounting for His perfect love.,
Discuss how one known as Jesus fulfilled dozens of Old Testament Messianic Prophecies and did things which no ordinary person could ever do.,
Elaborate on the issue of an imperfect world but one in which the possibility of a focus on the ""good"" (or optimum) result conspicuously outweighs the hopeless life that anyone could imagine as possibly much worse -- if it were simply accidental or unintended and at the mercy of physical non-living aspects of the universe which features corruption, decay, breakage, erosion versus the amazingly self-healing forms of life and human-life which may visualize, be hopeful, build and improve many things.,
Explain that there are many examples showing God's existence, but one has to be able to look and realize its truth.",How to Argue That God Exists (Christianity)1," The opening statement of the Bible declares that “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” (Genesis 1:1) Ask, ""Who or what can say who or what did begin the universe?"" Contemporary science -- although not absolutely certain on exactly what, when or how:
~ State that scientific theories postulate that the known universe did in fact have a beginning with what is called as “The Big Bang”.
It makes no logical sense for anyone to assert that ""absolutely nothing"" could have produced that initiating bang or anything else: ""something existed"" and ""caused that"" -- producing those things that we know of as having a beginning.

, about:


There was a ""beginning of things"",
There was an outline of ""from-simple-to-complex-development"" in the creation of earth and life in a Genesis account of creation.
Explains our universe far ""in advance of humanity having theories/developed or technology"" to try to form such concepts and verify scientific assertions. For instance, the Bible says:


“He stretches out the north over 'empty' space, and 'hangs the earth on nothing'.” (Job 26:7)

How would the writer four thousand years in the past (2000BC) have known that the Earth is ""suspended on nothing"" -- not attached to anything, but mountains were called pillars of heaven in the poetry of Job 26:11, ""The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at His threatening."", ie: mountains ""tremble and are astonished"" (a poetic phrase).





, The Bible says that, “God is spirit…” (John 4:24), and it says that “God is love…” (1 John 4:8), and that ""perfect love casts out fear"". The awesome interdependence/relationships and amazing elegance pervading the entire universe suggest a planner, maker, superhuman architect having unlimited knowledge and power. The minds of human beings are taking time and, perhaps, eternity to discover what the originating mind (divine mind) actually accomplished in creating the universe and all it contains. The Bible says that God created mankind in his image (Genesis 1: 26-27), and it is logical to realize that the human mind is able to increasingly succeed, make progress, in understanding the universe because the human mind has a resemblance of the divine mind.

, Jesus was recorded to have been born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2) of the Tribe of Judah (Genesis 49:10), and to have visited the Temple (Malachi 3:1) and to have risen from the dead (Isaiah 53:11). Historical sources and archaeological evidence establish the legitimacy of Jesus of Nazareth as an actual person to an extent comparable to that of any other notable historical figure. The books called the gospels document the life and teachings of Jesus and the existence and expansion of Christianity as a major religion showing Christ's purpose to create free access to the all mighty through His advocacy/mediation.

, While the material universe provides us with the things necessary to sustain, enhance, and enjoy life, there are also exquisite luxuries which are not essential to survival and reproduction such as knowledge: art, music, and ever-evolving technologies. Is this indicative of an indifferent cosmos or more indicative of one which is somewhat friendly to self-teaching humans? It seems reasonable to conclude that the universe materialized due to the presence of an intelligent force/source when one takes the time to learn how so many things had to go right in order for us to be here and how difficult it would be to possibly explain how not one of those interdependent things went wrong without making reference to God pro or con (or beliefs). It also seems as though the universe were designed for people, considering how human beings are the phenomenal creatures with the rare capacity to ""be upwardly-mobile"" to maximize the somewhat hidden potential of creation.

, Accept it instead of doubting it, see it instead of shutting your eyes and you will believe that God exists. Consider how the usefulness and attractiveness of things produced by human beings are not accidental qualities when present but are a result of our intelligent nature and our natural delight in order, balance, and beauty. In a similar way, it is unreasonable to conclude that the surpassing usefulness and attractiveness of things throughout nature are accidental qualities but it is rather more reasonable to conclude that they are the result of the existence of a surpassing intelligence which also delights in order, balance, and beauty. Creativity is at the bedrock and pinnacle of the existence of all living and non-living things and it is up to each person to attempt to explain his or her natural reverence for this illustrious state of affairs. The Bible says that God created everything and was quite pleased with his work.

Understand who ""fool"" refers to.,
Consider the paradox.,
Allow God to guide you.,
Be wary of antagonistic attacks.,
Consider the significance.,
Let the opponent rant.,
Keep calm.,
Remain cautious yet open.,
Identify sincere inquiries.,
Speak up for the sake of truth.,
Respond with intelligence and love.,
Consider the crowd.,
Persist where truth prevails.,
Know when to walk away.",How to Answer the Fool (Christian Perspective)," In this context, a ""fool"" does not refer to someone who lacks common sense or academic wisdom. The term is used here to describe someone who lacks spiritual sense.


The sort of wisdom mentioned in the Proverbs is almost never the intellectual kind. Most of the book is concerned with the knowledge of living morally. As such, a fool in Proverbs is someone who rejects spiritual and moral truth.Elsewhere in Proverbs, the fool is described as someone who finds pleasure in misconduct (10:23), lacks integrity (19:1), is dangerous (17:12), and is unreliable (26:6), among other things.;
, One statement says not to answer the fool, yet the one immediately following it says to answer the fool. The two instructions seem to contradict each other at first glance, but when examined on a deeper level, they actually do work together.


The fact that these statements are found side-by-side reflects a type of parallel language used throughout the Old Testament. In essence, the second statement is meant to build upon the first.
This set of verses simply means that there are times when you should answer the fool and those when you should not.
The statement, ""do not answer the fool according to his folly, lest you also be like him,"" suggests that you should not answer when doing so would make you as foolish as your opponent.
The second statement in the pair, ""Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes,"" explains that you should answer when doing so would correct your opponent and show the inaccuracy of his or her argument.

, Knowing when to answer the fool and when to remain silent can be difficult, even for the most practiced apologists. Prayerfully consider the circumstances of each instance before making a move to help you determine the best way to respond.


It is worth noting that this passage refers specifically to the practice of answering, not approaching. In other words, the principles here should be applied to situations in which the fool makes a challenge or inquiry with the intention of forcing your reply.

, There are times when someone may launch an attack full of malice for the sake of humiliating or infuriating you. These individuals usually have no intention of listening to any counterarguments, no matter how sound they might be, and answering them would be a futile effort.


Luke 23:7-12 illustrates an example of such an attack. When Jesus was on trial before Herod, Herod ""questioned with many words, but answered him nothing"" (23:9, NKJV).Herod intended to make a spectacle of Jesus and had no real interest in the truth. Answering Herod under these conditions would have been futile and degrading, so Jesus remained silent., On some instances, the matter being brought up might be too important to ignore, regardless of the opponent's attitude. Oftentimes, though, the topic at hand might be relatively inconsequential and not important enough to address.


One major issue would be the existence of God. Someone who tries to tell you that there is no God will need to be answered, even if the conversation is brief. Once you've stated the truth and have determined that the conversation is going nowhere good, however, stop before being dragged down to your opponent's level.
On the other hand, a minor issue might include some controversial point of denominational doctrine not specifically addressed by the Bible. A fool who attempts to make a mountain out of a molehill can often be neglected from the start.

, When you determine that the best course of action is to remain silent, you may still have no option but to listen to the opponent's rants and attacks. It can be infuriating, but letting him or her ramble on will often be a better option than attempting to silence your opponent.


Don't be surprised if the fool attempts to abuse or agitate you into a response.
In such circumstances, your attacker is usually more interested in antagonizing you than in discovering or sharing any genuine truth. This vitriol can be caused by many different underlying reasons, but regardless of the cause, the result is the same.

, The fool might try goading you into losing your temper. If you join your opponent at his or her level, though, you will become just as foolish. That won't do anyone any good.


Responding to the fool using his or her tactics will drag you down to the same level. Using abusive language will invite hatred and disrespect into your heart. Once you become a hateful person, you become just as morally deprived, or foolish, as your opponent.
Additionally, refusing to respond to the fool deprives him or her of the fuel needed to spread the attack. Someone who only wants to anger you will usually stop once he or she realizes that the attack isn't accomplishing its goal., God can change hearts and minds, and someone who is an unanswerable fool today may not be one tomorrow. Don't write someone off completely after one negative incident.


Approach future confrontations with this sort of individual cautiously, but with an understanding that your opponent's attitude may one day change for the better. Recall the changes that God has made in your heart and mind throughout your own life. That alone should be proof that God can soften hearts and open minds.

, Sometimes, the fool is unknowingly misinformed instead of being willfully ignorant. He or she may confront you with frustration, but not with hatred. These are usually the people you need to respond to.


It is possible that the person speaking to you has never heard the truth. The opportunities may have been there if he or she had sought them out, but if no one has tried to engage your opponent on such matters in the past, it's very possible that he or she never saw the purpose in looking for the answers without external prompting.
Pay attention to the way the argument is presented. Polite language and statements that seem thought-out are usually promising signs that the person you're speaking with is making a sincere effort to converse with you. On the other hand, personal attacks, rude language, and arguments that seem like nothing more than rehearsed lines are generally signs of a closed-minded fool who isn't worth answering.

, If keeping silence can be misinterpreted as agreement with a foolish argument, you need to speak up. This is true regardless of your opponent's attitude.


For instance, when you're amidst a group of people and your opponent follows a morally deprived declaration with a statement like, “I'm sure you all get what I mean,” that would be a time to voice your objections.

, When you choose to answer the fool, you will need to do so with the intention of correcting misunderstandings and misinformation. Your own attitude can be just as important as your opponent's attitude, and responding out of a desire to humiliate or infuriate is the wrong way to go about things.


This doesn't mean that your words will always be sweet, though. Conviction and correction can be harsh. Hard words spoken in tough love can be beneficial, though, while hard words spoken in anger and hatred can only destroy.

, When others are reading or listening to your debate, you need to consider how the things you say will affect them, too. There are times when your opponent may no longer accept arguments based in reason, but if your words are reaching an onlooker, continuing to speak might still be worthwhile.Those who don't have an emotional investment in the argument are more likely to perceive truth and foolishness correctly, even if they don't have a solid understanding of moral truth yet. If you behave with dignity and speak with reason while your opponent speaks irrationally and displays appalling behavior, you will leave a better impression with unbiased onlookers, and your argument will appear more sound than your opponent's.

, If you are making any progress in correcting your opponent's foolishness—even if it is only a frustratingly small amount of progress—continuing the discussion is often in everyone's best interest.


For example, if you've been having a civil conversation via e-mail over the past month and your opponent has acknowledged, once or twice, that you've made a point he or she cannot argue against, it could be a sign that you're gradually getting through to that person. As long as the conversation doesn't take a turn for the worse, it might be worthwhile to continue it, even though it appears to drag on endlessly.

, Even a discussion that started in an appropriate manner can sour and take a turn for the worse. Once it becomes clear that further conversation will be useless, you will probably need to walk away from it.


Walking away from a specific person or specific conversation once doesn't mean that you can never return to it. If the matter comes up again under better, calmer circumstances, both of you may wish to continue where you left off, and doing so may not be a bad idea.

Talk to other Scientologists.,
Consider completing an audit.,
Commit to improving your life.,
Start ranking your emotions on the tone scale.,
Consider the dynamics of your actions.,
Receive periodic audits to stay on track.",How to Join Scientology," Scientologists consider their religion to be a practical philosophy or self-actualization method, more so than a religion in the strictest sense of the word. As a religion, Scientology is relatively new, extending from writer L. Ron Hubbard’s mid-century method of self-improvement via past-life exploration and auditing, called dianetics.


There is a spiritual mythology related to Scientology which can sound a little sci-fi to the uninitiated, but Scientology itself is about the practice more than the belief in the system. Scientologists do believe that the inner self is a ""cosmic"" being, something that lives beyond the body and which needs to be properly maintained when in your care.
Applying the principles of the Tone Scale and Dynamics to your life is thought to help eliminate the reliance of modern society on mood-altering substances and other primarily commercial methods of “self improvement.”;
, More than perhaps any other contemporary religion, Scientology is widely criticized and mocked in pop culture, for a variety of reasons. Scientology calls itself a religion, but it is often accused of being a cult, a pseudo-religion, or a pyramid scheme. If you're planning to join Scientology, it's crucial to learn about it from a variety of sources rather than relying on official statements from Scientology only.


According to Scientology, the organization does not make it impossible to ""leave"" the church, nor do they outlaw the use of certain medications. However, Scientology has been accused of behaving like a totalitarian system which disconnects its members from friends, colleagues, or family members deemed to be antagonistic towards Scientology.Furthermore, Scientology does strongly oppose the medical specialties of psychiatry and psychology., If you choose to explore Scientology, there's a lot you should expect to learn and study. Some of the vocabulary can be momentarily disorienting, so having some idea of what to expect when you're first exploring can help you negotiate the somewhat complicated waters of Scientology.Dianetics is the original method invented by Hubbard as a self-improvement method, regarding a mind-body connection. The goal of dianetics is to get your ""reactive mind"" out of the way, leading to a happier, more fulfilled state of being.

Thetans are believed to be immortal beings, insubstantial in nature, that rule your body. Scientologists believe Thetans create life and exist independent of our bodies beyond death. This is the Scientologist conception of the human soul, essentially. Practicing Scientology and finding practical benefit from it doesn't require that you ""believe"" in Thetans in the strictest sense of the word.

, It would be impossible to give an accurate primer on the wide body of thought that represents Scientology in a few hundred words. The church is known for the easy access to and volume of reading materials associated with it, so get in touch with the Church of Scientology, via their website and request literature. It’s generally free of cost.



Scientology: A Religious Philosophy by L. Ron Hubbard outlines the basic tenets of Scientology, though more easily digestible volumes are frequently produced by the church for more easy consumption.
In general, if you request materials, you’ll likely be inundated with more boxes than you know what to do with. This is a promotional tactic used by the church to spread the word. Be forewarned and expect lots of books.

, One of the most common ways to learn more about Scientology is to attend a regional conference in your area, where Scientologists gather for discussion and recruitment. These tend to meet in large cities, yearly, and are an excellent opportunity for interested persons. It's also a great place to pick up free or cheap Scientology literature so that you can learn more on your own.

, If you want to attend Scientology services and gatherings on a more regular basis, find a church in your area and make contact. Express your interest in joining the church. You can find a branch of the church of Scientology in your area by clicking here.


The actual process of joining the church will differ slightly depending on the particular branch of the church itself and the other Scientologists. Most cities won't have more than one branch, however, so it's difficult to do much exploring.
If you don't like the church in your town, consider just reading up and developing your own practice on your own. Again, it's a practical method, which means you'll do most of the work yourself.

, Scientologists are not a part of some mysterious celebrity cult or shadowy Illuminati, and meeting some for discussion and fellowship can answer a lot of your questions and assuage a lot of your concerns. Regular people from all walks of life practice Scientology. Meet and talk to them.


Church and regional conferences are obviously the best place to meet other practitioners, but you might also be able to find more informal discussion groups in your area. Consider starting one, like a book group, in your town.

, Auditing is completed by meeting with an experienced Scientologist who will guide you through the process, asking questions and reading your Thetan quality with an E-meter.It's a lot like Scientology ""confession."" Completing an audit is a lot like a cross between past life or regression therapy and a simple visit to the doctor. You'll basically sit, chat with a Scientologist, and answer some questions. That's it.


Church audits are done regularly, should you join a church. Field auditors and mission auditors are also dispatched frequently to travel, like an old-style Evangelical Revival, to get the word out and to show people what Scientology is all about. This can be an excellent way to experience your first audit and see if it's right for you.

, The Church of Scientology claims that the method works 100% of the time for people who commit fully to using it. In that ""commit fully"" though, is a lot of real work. Do you want to improve your life and reach a state of contentment and happiness? Are you willing to do what it takes? If you're interested in Scientology, approaching it with an open mind and a full commitment to change your life for the better is necessary.

, The Tone Scale is used in auditing to place your overall attitude and emotional state somewhere on a quantifiable scale, which runs from +40 (Serenity of Being) to -40 (Total Failure). Depending on your situation, your attitudes will fall in a variety of places on the tone scale at any given time.


It's fine to explore the tone scale by yourself, but it's also important to let an experienced auditor guide you through the process to more thoroughly integrate the concepts into your practice.

, Dynamics are an essential part of Scientology, referring to the eight classifications of survival, which Scientologists believe is an essential part of changing your life for the better. A person progresses through various dynamics over the course of a life, the first of which is your innate desire to survive. Babies have this desire, and animals, but we gradually progress through various mind-body stages of improvement over the course of a life dedicated to improvement.This is a life-long struggle. The Eight Dynamics are as follows:


Self
Creativity
Group Survival
Species
Life Forms
Physical Universe
Spiritual Dynamic
Infinity

, The life of a Scientologist involves receiving period audits, assessing your personal growth and the stages of your improvement, and realigning your practice in accordance to where you're going. Receiving periodic audits is an essential part of improving your life and your practice as a Scientologist, to get your mind-body alignment in harmony.

Advise people to look around and look at the world.,
Show how these natural, interdependent systems point to God when you look at the little factories needed within the cell to build and run the single cell (or from other cells within an organism, and from nowhere else in nature).,
Consider where did meaningful plans (purposeful instructions) for life to exist come from: within the ""living"" cells.,
Realize that complexity does not matter, it's the interdependence of the materials and instructions (plans) to function for a specific system.",How to Argue That God Exists (Christianity)2," Does he or she see only the trees but not the interdependent forest? Obviously, God exists, because His creation is not only one thing, but all the instructions for all the physics of the biosphere of the world, the galaxy that the world is in, and the universe that the galaxy is in -- and is the driving force behind it all. The living cells that were designed and created to be self-replicating cells or organisms.


Each system intermingles, is interdependent, with others. The ""universe of life"" operates according to sophisticated and precise instructions to form trillions of cells to correctly make one life, for example, one human. Who or what conceptualized and formulated these interdependent instructions? The Bible indicates that God is the being who spoke the first words and that God is the source of all life (which would entail all the plans, genes, and the living cells needed to process the plans).;
, For example follow the interdependence of the sequence of events as proteins are assembled solely in the living cell (which came first the cell or the instructions used within it -- and nowhere else).


These proteins become part of the structure of the organism in its instructed manner and perform a multitude of functions, but forming them requires stepwise processing of materials of nucleic acids, called ""nucleotides"", of sugar plus nitrogen and phosphates -- so where did those originate. They were all manufactured by that single cell (or by cooperating cells in a multicellular organism) following very specific plans.

, The instructions only make sense when processed by existing, ""living"" cells and they function only there.

, Why? Dead/non-living cells do not need or use plans, no processing, nothing constructive (can not read or follow the genetic plans).


Visualize how an existing, living cell was necessary to use DNA and RNA (acid molecules) which are assembly line worker following instructions on an ""automated assembly line"" (explained below) by matching opposite DNA nucleotides to ""messenger RNA"" plus ""transfer RNA"" together with the ""ribosome"" (form of RNA) which proceeds on the assembly line: which is the messenger RNA. At every third nucleotide on the messenger RNA, the ribosome stops and a transfer RNA attaches an amino acid as the next link in the growing chain which will finally comes of the line as one protein of the trillions of these in forming living systems.
DNA polymerase, catalyzes the formation of DNA. This raises the question, which came first, DNA or the DNA polymerase? This is only one of many similar functions and cycles which make up the chemical apparatus found in all living cells. If any of these cycles were broken, life would not exist. The instructions either exist, or the life does not. That is another gap which cannot be explained.

"
"
Mention that we are all born with a knowledge that there are right and wrong plus many capacities to appreciate simplicity and elegance, and to communicate, analyze, synthesize and calculate -- plus design and build so that it is natural for people to take pleasure in creativity and not pointless destruction.,
Discuss the fact that we each have a desire to seek love and acceptance (God is love...).,
Familiarize yourself with some thoughts, famous quotes, that you can use to argue that the Christian God exists.",How to Argue That God Exists (Christianity)3," Read the Bible and see where the knowledge of good and evil comes from: from God.

, From childhood on, we try to fill that gap that exists within us. Sharing a life with another person, enjoying the companionship, stems from Adam and Eve who desired to love and be loved, as companions and as a means of creating a world of mankind. The Christian idea that humanity is God’s most prized creation is quite tenable. We need air and it is all around the planet we call home, we require water and it falls in purified form from the sky, we must consume food to live and it grows from the ground and roams water and land in abundance, and a family model of having parents, a spouse and children exists to satisfy our greatest vacancy for love. Consider that ones strength, beauty and knowledge exist for the edifying, maturing and uplifting of the full spectrum of humanity. No other religion besides Christianity most forcefully establishes that life is a gift of love from God and that our lives are to be lived in service to humanity (and credited is unto God). If we believe that there is a cause for every effect, as if things are designed, then it follows that there is a builder and maker: a God of creation.

Answer a question like If God gave us intelligence, wouldn't he want us to examine our beliefs with reason?",How to Answer Common Atheists Questions About Christianity," Could He choose to do evil? question with something such as this:


God is the definition of purity and goodness. There is no evil in him. He created the concept of free will so God automatically has free will. But in regard to the common questions about what he can or cannot do, he has no limitations. But also, you must understand that you cannot compare God to humans. Technically, asking the question ""can God do something evil,"" is actually a loaded question, because if I say ""no he can't"", then you will say ""so God is limited,"" but if I say ""yes he could,"" then you could say ""so God is imperfect and therefore limited."" So this would require a better definition of evil, which the Bible calls ""anything that is imperfect and not from pure love and selflessness."" This includes impure thoughts, hate, and any kind of dishonesty or selfishness, not even mentioning the bigger stuff like murder, theft, fighting, etc. But killing is not evil, murder is. Murder is hate and therefor selfish. Killing can be done through self defense or killing an evil person who will harm others if not stooped (like in the military). The human definition of evil is ""anything that causes pain, displeasure, sadness, deprivation or death."" This is not a complete definition of evil. The Bible's definition of evil is so much higher than human's definition. Therefor, God cannot lie, die, or cease to exist. Humans can lie, die and cease to exist. Since lying is imperfect, dyeing is weakness, and ceasing to exist, is powerlessness. Therefore, God has no limitations.;
, with a response such as that which is shown below.


""The wages of sin is death"" (Romans 6:23) Since God is perfect, he only wants perfection around him. Sin is anything contrary to goodness, purity, selflessness and anything that breaks the laws of nature and breaking the laws of God. 100% Purity is acid to evil. Even the smallest Evil is a cancer to good (remember the definition we established in the first question). Even a thought of hate can turn into Hitler size hate and destruction. Evil wants to destroy everything including itself, and Good (purity) can only build and heal. God gives humans plenty of time to decide if they want heaven or hell. Free will is in effect, because without free will, God would not be Good, he would be controlling. Freedom is a form of love. Hell was for the fallen angels (demons) that knew better than to rebel. If you read the bible, you will remember that Satan convinced one-third of the angles to rebel against God. Since they never experienced rebellion, it was easy for that little evil to deceive them. If God did not kick out Satan, he would contaminate heaven and no angel would have been able to be in his presence. The question comes up, ""why did God create Satan?"" God created Satan (A.K.A Lucifer) perfect. Remember, free will is allowed everywhere, even in heaven. A theory is that God may have allowed Lucifer to rebel in conjunction with the creation of earth and humans. He knew that Adam would be deceived and fall, and from the beginning, he planned a salvation rescue of humans that is hinted throughout the Bible, mostly through Bible prophecies speaking about the messiah (who was Jesus). Pure love is displayed much more clearly in chaos and pain. Therefore, Lucifer, hell and sin is one option for humans to choose, while Jesus, heaven and love is the other option for humans to choose. My personal opinion is that God's love is so powerful that evil is allowed to take its course just enough where choosing God and heaven has to be a struggle, causing only those who truly want it, to find it. ""When you seek me with all your heart you will find me"" (Jeremiah 29:13)

, Can you form an analogy to make this more clear? with an answer such as this:


There is one God. God is not a person but a force, the source of life, an entity of the engine of existence. God can appear in any form so he has chosen to appear as a spirit called the holy spirit and in a human body called Jesus. These two forms serve very important purposes. In revelation, it is mentioned that God is a ""consuming fire"" (Hebrews 12:29) and no one can see God and live (Exodus 33:20). Sin separated humans from the ability to know God. This requires Jesus to die in our place to fulfill the law of perfection which require death to anything that sins. When Jesus died on the cross, he became sin for us. Now Jesus can be a mediator between God and man. The human part of Jesus has connected with humans, but the God part of Jesus connects with God, making a bridge. The holy spirit is a helper to humans. Humans naturally reject Jesus (because of our sin), so the holy spirit helps us ""find"" Jesus. No one comes to Jesus except by the holy spirit. Evil cannot hear Jesus, and evil cannot even be in the presence of God, so the holy spirit helps us speak to Jesus, and Jesus (after dying on the cross) makes us perfect (temporarily) enough to speak to God. Jesus and the holy spirit are parts of God (almost like the left hand and the right hand of God). When we die, we will rise to heaven and live forever like Jesus did so we can fellowship face to face with God fully.

, with an answer such as this:


Those who pray with doubt, should not expect anything. (James 1:7) Seeing the answer to the question above will answer this.

, with a response such as that which follows:


God must make another form for humans to interact with. We cannot come to God without first being cleansed from sin by Jesus. Without that, we would die in God's presence. Seeing the answer to the question above will answer this.

, with a response like this:


God did not create evil. Evil exists alongside Good. Without evil, there is no such thing as Good, nor would their exist free will. (1 Peter 3:17 ) Remember, that this earth is not home, and everything that causes pain will only last a ""moment"" compared to eternity in heaven (James 4:14). Earth is not heaven, so you cannot expect no pain or suffering on earth. God cannot make humans decide to choose him. There must be a balance of Good and Evil on earth. Flood and disease are not evil, they are merely obstacles. Simply because they cause pain does not mean they are evil. When someone dies, their ""timeline"" is up. ""When absent from the body, you are present with God.""(2nd Corinthians 5:8) Everyone is given a certain amount of time to choose God or choose Satan. Choosing nothing is equal to choosing Satan, because God designed life to have challenges that force you to decide. It's like boot camp, which has obstacles in order to determine who is fit for the job. The obstacles are not evil, but necessary, just as mistakes and accidents are not evil but common to nature. Only those who endure and are fit for the kingdom of God will make it to heaven. (Luke 9:62)

, How do you know when to reject supernatural explanations for things like UFOs or spontaneous human combustion? with a response like the ones shown below.


Well, you asked the right question. The supernatural or spirit realm is scientifically proven throughout history and even now, on TV shows like Ghost hunters. www.syfy.com/ghosthunters/ They claim they were skeptics and started their investigation to prove that the spirit realm was not true. Now they are firm believers and have so much evidence that they can make an entire show on it.
Now with UFO's and aliens I personally believe these are demons. Simply because there are countless testimonies of encounters with aliens and all of them have been weird or painful and never kind or beneficial. Also, they can never be properly photographed just like in Ghost hunters, where the Ghosts are always perfectly out of focus. If these are spirits, this would make sense, since you can't capture spirits with physical imagery. If they were truly from another planet, their encounter would have been to exchange information, rather than cause confusion, and pain to the people who encountered the aliens. Spontaneous combustion is scientifically proven to be possible because of chemicals in the body that can cause this. There have been about 200 cited cases worldwide over a period of around 300 years.

, Where do false religions — including false Christian sects — come from? about other religions with a response such as:


There are many false religions. A saying goes ""if there is a counterfeit, their must be an authentic"". There are three ways to explain why Christianity is true. First, To tell Christianity apart from other religions, you must realize that all other religions say they are ""searching for God,"" while Christianity says God is searching for us. Second, the Bible has been proven scientifically, archaeologically and historically to be accurate.Third, Christianity is the only religion where people's lives get changed from the pure teaching in accordance of God's word. Atheists become Christians, hardened criminals become normal citizens, healing miracles (no other religion claims to do miracle healing) and many other strong testimonies from hostile witnesses (people who were against Christianity who testify that it is true).

, Are there any groups of people who call themselves Christians that are not really Christians? with a response such as:


A Christian is someone who knows God (personally and passionately) and believes he exists by faith and believes Jesus died for their sins and accepts that they are sinners but want to be perfect (pure) and try to live out life in that way daily, to one day go to heaven. The antithesis of a christian is an atheist who says they do not know God, nor believe he exists, nor is their absolute morals that determine what is or is not ""right and wrong"" making life have no objective meaning, living life by your own rules. Polar opposite views of the same life.
There are other religions that are loosely based on Biblical beliefs but have allowed themselves to interpret smaller parts of the Bible to fit false ideas. Mormons (who believe God was married and deny the deity of Jesus as God), Jehovah's Witness (believe most of what Christianity believes but deny the deity of Jesus based on misinterpreting quotes in the Bible that mention human traits that Jesus claimed to have), and others.

, with:


Studying Bible history and prophecy, the Holocaust was a judgement against the Jewish people. Throughout Bible history, when the Jewish people rejected or lost love for God (turning to other gods), he would send pain and suffering until they came back to him. God always sends warnings before he does this (by prophets). Any punishment or pain he allows is an example that he loves that person or nation to wake them up without forcing them to choose him. He must give them a choice, but sometimes evil is so strong that he must cause the wrong choice to inflict pain to persuade them to turn back to him. If he didn't do this, an entire nation can be swallowed up in sin (like Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19), where everyone in these cities were very evil except Lot). This also happened at the beginning where God had to flood the world (scientifically verified to happen by the way) to destroy all humans because they were all evil, and during the tower of babel where everyone was so evil God had to create all the languages (scientifically verified to happen by the way) in all the people to separate them. (Sodom and Gomorrah's actual remains www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgQHQ992Wnw)

, Is that fair? with:


Prayer in and of itself does nothing. It depends on who you pray to and what your intentions are in your prayer and if you have faith that your prayer will be answered. Prayer is important, but the motive behind the praying is what God looks for. (Romans 2:15,16; Jeremiah 11:20; Hebrews 4:12) God judges everyone by their heart (their true intentions that can't be expressed in words). This is the most fair way to determine who goes to heaven or hell. If a person was born poor and they stole to get food, and they prayed to get out of poverty but God never took him out, and this person kept his faith in God anyway and eventually died of hunger, God would usher him into heaven with open arms. On the other hand, if a Christian who was kind and loving, but was proud and prayed to God in pride, thanking him for not making him poor and a thief like the man who died hungry, God would see his true intentions in his heart and when he dies, he will be sent to hell. (Luke 18:9-14) Christians can go to hell, just as sinners can go to heaven. It is all about faith and your heart.

, If God told someone else to kill a child, would you interfere? with an answer as shown below:


""God cannot sin, nor does he tempt anyone else to sin"" (James 1:13) Some children die because of evil, but everyone must die sooner or later. I assume you are referring to the killing of children in Deuteronomy 21:18-21 and other places in the Bible. In the old testament, punishments were made severe because they didn't have policemen and jails like they do now. Believe it or not, because the threat of death was made, very very few children were bad. Only the really bad children were put to death and this was usually the last of the last resort. Any child punished this way was extremely bad and possibly murderous. Since there was no law enforcement back then (especially when traveling through deserts and open plains), this was the only way to control an outbreak of evil from overtaking their camps. Before a stoning took place, multiple witnesses were required for a conviction. (Deuteronomy 17:6) Like many societies of the time, Israel had a patriarchal society. The word of the father in the family was law. Thanks to this law in Deuteronomy, a father who was displeased with his son—whether justly or unjustly—could not simply kill him himself. Previous verses had already made it impossible to disinherit an unfavored son (Deuteronomy 21:15–17), and now these verses essentially guaranteed due process of law to protect the rights of the accused son. The trial was to be held in the city of the accused, where the trustworthiness of the parents and the son’s own character were likely to be well-known. Since capital crimes required the testimony of two or three witnesses for a conviction, the word of the father would be insufficient.

, with an answer such as:


Amputees have been reported to have been healed. There are not that many, and most do not get documented. There has been people's thumbs healed, eyes have been restored (people with no eyeballs), and people with half-livers healed with full livers. Unfortunately, most of those do not get before and after pictures. Many are in third world countries or revivals. But there are other ailments that have been healed that are even more impossible to be healed that have been documented. Delores Winder had major pain and had a percutaneous cordotomy, in which they went into the brain and burned out the nerves to the lower part of her body to stop the pain. This is permanent and cannot be restored in any medical way. She was healed and is currently the only person in history to ever be healed from this surgery. It has been documented in medical journals. She wrote a book about it and went on a show that talks to people who have had miracles like this.

Jesus said that his disciples will do the same or greater miracles than he did. (John 14:12) Many have happened her in America and books have been written about them. Many others have been done in third world countries by missionaries who have also been documented, some with pictures.

, If so, does that make sense? with a response such as....


Whatever it takes to believe in God, God accepts it as faith. Whether it is by evidence only (like the doubting Thomas in the New testament where he needed to see Jesus' scars in order to believe he rose from the dead) or by faith alone (like Abraham in the old testament where a voice he never heard before told him to leave his homeland, and eventually almost kill his son as a test of his faith). Whichever way you choose, choose to believe rather than doubt.

, with a response like:


There are several ways God answers prayer. But remember, your prayer must be prayed with the intent of something positive and something related to God. Selfish prayers are also answered with a NO through silence. Either God uses his word, the Bible to answer it. (You run into a bible verse that directly refers to your current problem).
God said ""his word will not return to him void"" (Isaiah 55:11) meaning that if he said he will answer you when you call for him he will. You must pray through Jesus to God. Only Jesus can send your prayer to God. If you believe in your heart he will and do not ask for something evil, selfish or ""stupid"", you WILL get an answer, no matter if you are an atheist, Buddhist, Mormon, etc. Its that simple.

, with a reply such as...


God is all-powerful. He will not let Satan interfere with a prayer that would deceive you with a wrong answer, especially if you are looking with all your heart for an honest answer from him. ""God is not a god of confusion"" (1 Corinthians 14:33)

, with a response such as that which follows:


I don't believe in coincidences. Everything happens for a reason. You just don't know what it is or why, until later, sometimes not until you reach the end of your life. God works in your entire life. Abraham prayed for a son and he didn't get it until he was 90 years old! God WILL answer you, just not always in the time you think he should or the way you are expecting. God is in control of this world, he knows your needs before you ask them, so God will not confuse you when he answers you.

, with:


Well, I go by the philosophy of the atheist, I don't go by feelings, if I cannot verify it or use an established way of doing something, it is not true. The Bible is the verification that every thought must go through in order to determine truth. If you go by emotions (which are up and down based on outer circumstances), you will be deceived.

, Is that just? with:


Based on careful study of the Bible, everyone (including the prophets) who died, where held in a holding place near heaven. They call this ""Abraham's bosom"". When Jesus died on the cross, he went there (in spirit) to speak with Abraham and all the people held their explaining his salvation (the three days he was dead in the tomb). When he rose again, this opened the gates of heaven for the first time. Since Jesus is the bridge back to God, everyone who were faithful to God went to heaven.

,


Yes, its based on your heart. If someone truly wanted to know the true God and never heard the Gospel, God would judge the heart of that person and ""grade"" his heart as if he knew. God's grace would take over, giving him the ability to go to heaven without first knowing about God. This also applies to babies and children under the ""age of accountability"" which is between 9 and 12 years old. No babies or very young children go to hell, neither do some people who never heard the gospel.

, with a reply similar to this:


Absolutely. God has given enough evidence to prove his existence. ""The heavens declare his glory"" (Psalm 19). The Bible is his words he speaks and the logic behind everything he has made. God also allows alternate belief systems to arise so it will be a fair choice. His choice can never overpower the choice of wrong in order to not interfere with free will. He wants humans to choose from multiple choices. We must logically deduct which belief system is true. Also belief systems have some truth, but only one belief system is the true explanation for this reality. Unfortunately, now of days, there is a lot of lies masquerading as truth, deceiving many people. Only a few ever find the true belief by going as deep as they can in their reasoning and logic.

Understand faith.,
Be in direct contact with the highest authority who surprisingly said, ""Whatever you do to the least of my children you do to me."",
Show a wanderer/stranger the way off of the shadowy, crowded expanse, as that stranger is on the broad open way to destruction.,
Realize that you have opportunities to clearly warn and save the wanderers so that you may ""all fly away,"" so be the ""heroic witness"".,
Think of the supernatural quality of existence in and through the Master of the Way the one who in a supernatural way bears all your weaknesses and trespasses: ""For there are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one.,
Hone your talents to as sharp an edge as possible, and put your talent to work for God--to their best uses.,
Dig up your buried ambitions, abilities and talents, but be humble and confident.,
Accept the freely offered approval at the super level: ""For the authorities are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad.,
Put on the whole armor of your profession.,
Prepare to make your testimony of the facts or events.

,
Testify of what you know, understand and have experienced.,
Testify means give or be ""witness"" as:attestation of a fact or event: testimony

one that gives evidence; specifically: one who testifies in a cause or before a judicial tribunal

one asked to be present at a transaction so as to be able to testify to its having taken place

one who has personal knowledge of something
a: something serving as evidence or proof: sign
b: public affirmation by word or example of usually religious faith or conviction ""the heroic witness...""

,
Don't forget to smile and have fun with your conversation, testimony and witnessing!

,
Start by walking boldly, not unlike sauntering across the room and say meekly, ""Hello."",
Look around observing the matrix (visual parameters), the setting, of your view.,
Derive a compliment from an honest impression and explain why you say that.,
Tell why you said that nice remark: A sincere compliment has to be explained to get someone to warm up to you.,
Ask some interesting questions!,
Deal with and accept any conversation-starters he or she might offer; take something he or she has said and run with it.,
Look your friend (person you are meeting) in the eye (like one eye then the other, or look at the face area like reading lips), it brings out trust -- but don't stare.

,
Use the person's name a couple times during the conversation; it will help you remember the name.,
Ask, ""Would you like to experience the miracle of receiving the Holy spirit just like the disciples in the Bible?",How to Act As a Christian Super Hero," Faith is the origin of all good Christian acts, but also realize that faith doesn't only produce good acts.


Faith is believing in something unseen, that there is evidence of
Faith produces action; but action isn't always faith;
,--good, mediocre or bad. So, if you cheat versus help someone -- you do it to He Himself says the Master of Super Heroes of all time. So be sure yours is a purpose (vision or mission) such that it is possible to help people to understand life's challenges in a special way, and then live that vision; do the good plan; walk in the path.Know about conflict: ""For ours is not a conflict with mere flesh and blood, but with the despots, the empires, the forces that control and govern this dark world--the spiritual hosts of evil arrayed against us in the heavenly warfare.""(Ephesians 6:12)Seek and find the light of the Good News and you can help friends to see the light and to escape condemnation and to escape ""imprisonment"" in darkness like dungeons of the second death., You can help people to find the light and to be saved from that ""second death"" through the plan of God, by grace through faith in Jesus. Tell people how to avoid the quicksand like the ""Slough of Despond"" in their progress through the darkness of night. The Slough of Despond is a deep bog in John Bunyan's allegory The Pilgrim's Progress, into which the character ""Christian"" sinks under the burdens and weight of his sins and his sense of a guilty conscience, like into a bog of sludge, but is saved by God's plan.

, You may know that ""If I had the wings of an angel, over these prison walls I would fly"" were the words of an old spiritual which inspired the author of I'll Fly Away to speak of flying ""like a bird from prison bars has flown."" in the song ""I'll Fly Away."" That song saying that I will fly away has been called the most recorded gospel music song of all time.,""(1 John 5:7) Realize that Jesus is called the Word, Way, Truth and Life in the Gospel.

, Your talents and abilities are shown by what you do and how and why you do those activities in which you participate like volunteering as a singer in a singing group or choir, or in a group or team at school, work or church. Or if you want to do something really amazing, go out and be a miracle worker and heal the sick and get people baptised in the Holy Spirit just like they did in the Bible. Don't wait to be asked or begged to join, as that is the wrong approach for a ""Superhero"" as a Christian...

, Bragging often seems like lack of confidence, but if you ""bury"" your talents (as if you are embarrassed or ashamed), then they are not serving their best uses.

, Would you like to live without being afraid of the authorities? Then do what is right, and you will receive their approval.""(Romans 13:3))

, Professing the knowledge of the Truth through faith:



Be covered by protection: ""Put on the full armour of God so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.""(Ephesians 6:11)Stand as victor: ""Therefore put on the complete armor of God, so that you may be able to stand your ground on the day of battle, and--having fought to the end--to remain victors on the field.""(Ephesians 6:13),, ""But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the person who hears the word, understands it, and produces a crop that yields 100, 60, or 30 times what was planted.""(Matthew 13:23).

,,, Tell the wanderer your name (alias or nickname) then ask, ""What is your name?"" while shaking hands or offering a high five, upon his/her responding to you that way. (If you go to other cultures, greet the person according to the particular culture, e.g. in Spain greet by saying Como esta? with an extended hand).

, Register any worthwhile conversation piece in your eye. Point out something unusual about it--zingy!--you've got a starting place for diving into the swirl of conversation.

, Don't lie and say you love someone's grunge hair when you think it's a mistake, but if you like his or her skates or shoes, or a noteworthy shirt or blouse because..., say so and explain what you like about it.

, But be careful not to say something so personal that you scare the person off or make him or her feel uncomfortable. It is best not to compliment a person's looks or body. It might even seem like criticism in a sense or as a challenge...

, Most people love to talk about themselves--to get them going. ""What classes are you taking this year?"" ""Have you seen/heard (Insert-Something-Here)? What did you think of it?"" Again, keep the questions light and not invasive. Don't ask too many questions, if he or she is not seeming responsive to them.

, Agree, disagree, ask a question about it, or offer an opinion, just don't let it go by without saying anything...

,, ""Oh, yeah, Jodie, what do you think about Jesus Christ?"", and as it draws the person's attention to what you're saying, continue to seek a statement of belief in God, Jesus. ""Well, Jodie, would you like to have a quick prayer together about ____ (salvation, healing, daily-life, school, or such)?

, If not, ask ""Would you do that? If so, say repeat after me"": ""Father, I come to you to accept your plan of saving me from sin and death. I repent of my sin and my need to be saved. I accept your death, burial and I'm willing to be baptised to identify with that and resurrection to new life that you will share with me so that I can experience the miracle of spiritual salvation. I ask you to accept me as your own child. I thank you. You are worthy of all praise. Let me be a blessing to others. In Jesus Christ name I pray. Amen!""

""If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."" (1 John 1:10)

,


Jesus said: ""I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."" (Luke 13:5)

,


""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" (John 3:16)
""But God commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners. Christ died for us."" (Romans 5:8)
""If you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."" (Romans 10:9)

,


""For with the heart (core being) man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."" (Romans 10:10)
""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."" (Romans 10:13)

, I believe that Jesus Christ shed His precious blood and died for my sin. I am willing to change and turn from my sin. I now invite Jesus Christ to come into my heart and life as my personal Savior.
""But as many as received him, to them He gave power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name:"" (John 1:12)
""Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new"" . (2 Corinthians 5:17)

,, Read the Holy Bible, the guide and tool to kindness and the right path to eternal life. If you encounter questions, resolve them by asking someone at your church to help you with them.


""Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing (aligning and applying) the word of truth."" (2 Timothy 2:15)
""Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path."" (Psalms 119:105)

,

""Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God."" (Philippians 4:6)
""However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says, 'LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?' 17 So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ."" (Romans 10:17)


,


""Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:"" (Matthew 28:19)
""Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching."" (Hebrews 10:25)

I know that you place a new life in me. Thank you for your gift to me of receiving The Holy Spirit in Jesus' name."";
, You must repent and be baptized in the name of the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit as a sign of accepting Him, for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the promised gift of the Holy Ghost. The five ways to grow your relationship with God are: praying to God, reading the Bible, praising, worshiping, and fasting. Also, through Jesus and the Holy Ghost/Holy Spirit we show God's love by kindness, forgiving others, making peace, having a faithful, loving relationship with believers (Don't live by feelings; judge no one harshly, not even yourself; live and walk in Christ's Spirit, in The Spirit of God in faith, hope and charity. So, live in the Spirit and ""And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man snatch them out of My hand"", Jesus said; that is safety, secured.) But, when you (in your mind) are convicted of sin -- repent, asking God for, accepting forgiveness, expecting consequences for some wrongs -- and going on as a Child of God, all in Christ Jesus' name -- with God as the one, true Judge of all things both good and bad. God's love is perfect and casts out all fear.
