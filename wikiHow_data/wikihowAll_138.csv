Understand God's Holy Nature.,
Seek to understand God's plan: ""So, I need to be saved from what, and why?,
Understand who could save you from spiritual death.,
Admit that you have sinned.,
Profess Jesus as your savior.,
Understand that Jesus said to receive or accept Him we must receive whom He sent.,
Remember to ask for the Holy Spirit.,
Taste and see that the gifts of the Lord are good.,
Talk to God in your own words.,
Tell God what you want to say to Him.,
Be baptized in accordance with the New Testament.",How to Accept Christ As Your Savior," Many people do not understand the concept of the Holy Trinity, and some explain it the wrong way. To state early Christians' beliefs about the Nature of God says: ""God is one while being in a Trinity"". The explanation of this is that The Father, The Son (Jesus) and The Holy Spirit are all one, the three of them refer to one and only one God, not by person, but by power, will and love. The Son has the same power and will as The Father and The Holy Spirit: that is why they are one God, and the three of them cannot be apart in anyway, they complete each other in everything.
This does not mean if you pray to Jesus you are only praying to Him, this way, you are praying to God at once (The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit). The Father and the Holy Spirit sent The Son to pay the price of our sins, by acceptance of the Son, because again, God is one by will, by power and by love. So when we say that God sent Jesus to earth, we do not mean that God and Jesus are not the same, it is in the Trinity that they are different, but are one at the same time.;
, Believing in God and The Bible is crucial to understanding ""What is a savior?"" and ""Why be saved?"" The Bible is God's revealed word to mankind, written by people so yielded to God's will that God chose them to write it. The people who wrote the books of the Bible were inspired (given the words) by God. They all agree in purpose and point to Christ, the Messiah, though they were written over a period of more than a thousand years: The Bible teaches that all people have sin in their lives.
Sin is any act that displeases God, as sin separates us from God, who is perfect, such that the payment we are to pay for sin is spiritual death -- permanent separation from God.

Romans 6:23: ""For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.""


Spiritual Death entered into the world when Adam sinned.

Genesis 2:17: ""But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eat thereof thou shalt surely die.""


Romans 5:12: ""Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned""


Romans 5:14: ""Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.""


, Because we are all born sinful, we are unable by our own whimsical or very deep reason--or in our own strength and morality--to please a perfect God. However, God sent His son Jesus as your representative and as your ransom from being captive.

John 3:16-17 (NIV): ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.""

This belief is trust and faith that God is who He says He is. He provided the payment for our sin by His own son’s taking our place as a substitute. All sins, past, present and future were forgiven by Christ at the cross, although men condemned Him who knew no sin to a cruel, physical death.

Hebrews 10:10: ""And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.""


Someone had to pay with his life for all of our sins. Hebrews 9:22 (NIV)""In fact, the law requires that... without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.""

Jesus died to pay for the sins of man. However, he rose again, conquering death and making it possible to be saved; so we accept Jesus when the Holy Spirit calls you--not merely our thinking and reasoning it out, but realizing that it is based on God's provision and His gift. In fact, Christianity is not just a volunteer religion. (Jesus called his disciples, they generally didn't come to him already determined to follow him.) In the same way we cannot merely ""accept"" Jesus, but we can receive what he gives us through the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit does call us--all to repentance and to follow God--through the preaching of God's Word and accepting the Good News (Gospel). Those who do not believe have rejected God's free gift, those who do believe only have faith because it is the free gift of God (grace).

, It is a prerequisite to accepting Christ. Once you understand that we are and you are a sinner and that all have sinned, turn to the Lord Jesus Christ for forgiveness by repenting of your sins.

, Romans 10:13, ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."" Say, ""Father in Heaven, I believe that Jesus died for my sins."" And God will impart eternal life to your spirit.

,(John13:20) That is the Holy Spirit (John15:26)

, The Holy Spirit does not come automatically when a person believes but Jesus says everyone who asks receives (Luke11:9-13)

, Believe that God loves you; He has shown this by giving His Son to face your punishment and die in your place as your sacrifice for all you've done wrong and for all your sins.



Repentance is the decision to turn away from sin and to turn to God and obey him. Once you have done this, every other step will fall into place. If you still have a hard time with this concept, trust Jesus as Lord over you as well as Savior.

, There is no protocol to follow in order to talk to God. God listens to your prayers even if you do not say them. But this does not mean He does not like to hear you seek His help and His forgiveness. God does not judge you violently, because He just is not a human being like us! He is your Father; He is your Brother and your personal Protector/and Mediator, and He wants to become you Best Friend! God wants you to confess your sins to Him, because He wants to forgive you, and He wants you to tell Him your secrets, even though He knows everything about you. This is a promise:
Matthew 7:7-9 ""7 Ask and it will be given to you ; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. 9 Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?""

, But realize that: John 9:31 ""Now we know that God hears not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and does His will , him He hears ."" Talking to God can be in many forms, whether in a prayer or in an ordinary way as in talking to others. Here's a prayer suggestion, please read this suggestion and use your own words. Without reading such words, just tell God what you want to say to Him in your own words, expressing all your love to Him:""My God and my Savior, I know I have sinned before you, and I know about all the bad things I have in my life. But with you my God, I shall never fear even the worst things in life, because you have sent your only and true Son, Jesus, to be crucified, and to pay the price of my own sins. I come to you my God to confess everything I have done in my life, and to tell you I am sorry. I am here to declare you King on my life, my thoughts and my actions. I want you to be my Savior. Please God, forgive me, for I have sinned before you. My God and my LORD, reign over my life, because your reign is perfect and your kingdom will never see an end. Amen""
Feel the presence of God in faith while kneeling. Kneeling is efficient, if you want to concentrate on nothing but your prayer.

, Baptism is used to signify the death and burial of our sinful person and our resurrection as a forgiven Christian through the power of the Holy Spirit just as Jesus was (Romans8:11, Col. 2:12,13). Baptism is commanded ""for the forgiveness of your sins"" (Acts 2:38) Prayer and faith was not enough to save the devout Cornelius in Acts 10. He was commanded to be baptized. (v. 48) After every example of a person having faith and believing in Christ, he or she is always baptized to complete his or her salvation! (Acts 2:41; 8:13; 8:37,38; 9:18; 16:30-33, etc)

Realize that ""speaking in tongues"" was promised by Jesus and was to accompany belief: ""And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name ...they will speak in new tongues.,
Realize that it is the Holy Spirit who gives the words that you speak and not you yourself: ""And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance."",
Understand that when you speak in tongues you are talking to God: -- even though occasionally it may be understood by someone as a human language as it was at Pentecost.,
Use speaking in tongues to edify yourself or build yourself up spiritually.,
Don't expect to understand what you are saying.,
When in private, use ""speaking in tongues"" as much as you can.,
When in public, it is much better to speak in the language of the region in order to benefit those you are speaking to.,
Understand that when you pray in tongues, you give thanks to God: and that you bless with the Spirit.,
Be assured that when you speak in tongues, you're not saying anything bad about God or our Lord Jesus Christ: Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.,
Understand that speaking in tongues is defined as praying in the Spirit: We should pray both in the Spirit (tongues) and in the understanding (your natural language).,
Pray in the Spirit (tongues) to build yourself up in your faith.,
Understand that speaking in tongues was prophesied by Isaiah in the Old testament as a sign to the Jews.,
Understand that praying in the Spirit is part of the armour of God: and we are told to put on the whole armour of God Ephesians 6:10 and 18 ""Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion.,
Understand what it means when the Bible says ""Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not.,
Remember that when using speaking in tongues, or even talking about it, you should be aiming to edify others: and that it must be done in the context of love.,
Understand that there is a procedure for speaking in tongues in a church meeting: Don't all speak in tongues at once, but instead only up to 3 people can use speaking in tongues in any meeting and each one should then operate the manifestation of interpretation of tongues, given to us by God .,
Understand that speaking in tongues which is from the Holy Spirit is promised to everyone.",How to Appreciate Speaking in Tongues," Mark 16:17;
, Acts 2:4

, Its principle purpose is for talking to God.

""For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries."" (1 Corinthians 14:2)


, This is not a selfish thing, but rather the purpose is that when you are built up in your spirit then you can build up or encourage others. He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church. 1 Corinthians 14:4

, You have control over the volume and the speed at which you speak but not the content, for example as prayer language: For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. 1 Corinthians14:14

, Paul appreciated the benefit of speaking in tongues, that's why he said, I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:"" 1 Corinthians 14:18

, Yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."" 1 Corinthians 14:19

, But again it is mainly meant for private use -- as it does not help others who can't understand what you're saying. (1 Corinthians 14:16-17)

, 1 Corinthians 12:3


""For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent."" Zephaniah 3:9

, 1 Corinthians 14:14-15

, Jude 20

, (Isaiah 28:11, 1 Corinthians14:21, Matthew 11:28-30)

, Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere."" (Ephesians 6:18)

,"": (1Corinthians14:22) This is not a contradiction to when Jesus said believers would speak in tongues as a sign. Think about what a sign is. Your hometown may have a sign at the entry saying ""Welcome to my town"" and also local street signs to help you find your way around; this is very helpful for a first time visitor, but if you live there -- then you no longer need the sign -- because you know that you live there and know your way around. However, the signs remain, and you wouldn't want to take them down. This is similar to speaking in tongues. Once you know you have it, it is no longer a sign -- but for someone about to enter in, it is a sign.

, (1 Corinthians 14:26, 1 Corinthians 13:1)

, Everything should be done decently and in order (with courtesy for example) and tongues should not be forbidden from meetings. (1 Corinthians 14:23-27 and 39-40)

, (Acts2:39) If you have not yet spoken in tongues and would like to, then read about how to ""receive the Holy Spirit as per The Bible"" for more information."
"
Recognize your need of Christ: He said, ""I am the vine and you are the branches.,
Repent and change your mind towards Jesus in faith.,
Pray.,
Read the Bible.,
Give thanks and rejoice!,
God delights to satisfy his children in Jesus!,
Ask God to give you the strength to keep His commands.,
Study Jesus' words in the four gospels.",How to Abide in Christ," No branch can bear fruit of itself."" In order for Jesus to help, you need to be ""willing to be made willing"". Humble yourself to do God's good and perfect will so that Jesus can work through you. ""How To Be Like the Publican"" has some suggestions on humbling yourself.;
, Believe that Jesus died on the cross for the forgiveness of sins so that those who trust in him may have true life and be free from the present evil age - accept His free gift of salvation. Confess your sins/wrongdoings to God, asking for God to transform your inner being and life. Turning away from sin, and towards the great love of God in Jesus is how to daily have a relationship with your Heavenly Father.

, This is not only a major opportunity but a need. We need to be constantly connected with our Lord. Jesus prayed while he was on earth, and taught us to pray. If Jesus felt the need of prayer, how much more do we need to pray as well? God cares about you and everything that happens - from the smallest plea to the biggest need; what an opportunity. He is always listening and knows your needs, even if it sometimes feels like He isn't. Psalm 55:22 says, that if you ""cast your burden on the Lord,"" then ""He will sustain you."" Prayer is both telling God about your goals in life, and asking for him to make you more like Jesus. That is why you would do well to ask for God's blessing before you read Scripture.

, Psalm 119:9 says, ""How can a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed according to Your word."" Setting aside time every day for the Bible is extremely important. Keep your mind fixed on it, and allow your heart to be grafted to Christ and molded by it. The Bible is God's word, and in it the story of God's redeeming work in this world is told! As you begin to see your place within God's story, you'll see why your life matters, and where it is going. By reading the Bible, you open your ear to listen to God. John 17:17 says, ""Sanctify them by your word, your word is Truth.""

, God tells us in James 1:17 that ""every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father."" That means we have hundreds of reasons to thank God! For breathing, for food, for jobs, friends, the family of God, forgiveness of sins, power to overcome evil, and more! The greatest reason to constantly rejoice and thank God is that, if you are trusting in Jesus, then you will be resurrected in the last day to enjoy an eternal life in the New Heavens and Earth, where God will dwell with us. There is no better hope.

, We may call out to God and say, ""We are hungry to know you, to be full of your Spirit, to be free from the penalty of our sin! We want Jesus who satisfies more than even food!"" Fasting is a way of putting your trust in God instead of in physical comfort. Christians are expected to fast, not out of any obligation, but because knowing Jesus means that we need to find satisfaction in him more every hour.

, John 15:10 says, ""If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love."" No one is able to do anything for God by his own strength: God is our strength. Without him, we can't do anything of importance! It can be hard to not sin, but with God's help through His grace, we can do our best. Be confident in Him.


Realize that there is liberty in Christ Jesus, to live in the Spirit, to not be tempted more than you can bear, no longer being a slave to self, as pride of life -- putting away habitual deeds of the flesh, as lust of the eye, envy, greed, judging others, prejudice and hatred.

, Read ""Matthew"", ""Mark"", ""Luke"" and ""John"", also ""Acts"", ""Romans"" plus other scriptures as time allows. Be quickened, mindful of God's still small voice, as in the Bible. For if you have God's life in you, you have the love of God, then ""understand"": Your thoughts should line up with Jesus' teachings, and His commandments such as, ""Love one another."" Do as He tells us in His word. Realize His empowerment and preach the gospel and heal the sick.But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.

There will most likely be some wild and crazy ideas on there that would spice your life right up. Don't have a bucket list? Write it! Here are some example ideas: 1) Follow a stranger for an hour and see if you can figure out their life2) Go to your local department store and ride around on the bikes till you get yelled at3) (If you are single) Ask everyone you would even consider dating for their phone number, just for a day. This might create some great relationships!;
, No matter how embarrassing they are, who you run into, whatever, this will be a fun experience that you will remember for a long time.

, Now find a way to face them. ALL of them. Arachnophobic? Next time you see a house spider, deal with it yourself. Without killing it. Claustrophobic? Ask yourself what small space freaks you out the most, and you spend a half an hour there without breaks.

, Whether it be, ""Hello,"" or, ""Okay,"" or anything, really, find a synonym for it and replace that word for one day. This may seem very small or stupid, but it is very hard and, in a way, entertaining to do.

, Make sure this isn't a day at work or school. If you choose your favorite fictional character or your role model, copy their personality and style for a day. The way people react will make it all worth it.

, Don't take these failures as a sign you should give up. In reality, it means you should keep trying. If you are good at something naturally, than great. If not, you can work to be the best. Just do what you enjoy and keep finding new things to do.

Notice how he treats you in a disagreement.,

Evaluate if he makes you feel good about yourself.",How to Know if He's Husband Material," Everyone has moments they aren’t proud of. Often, they reveal themselves during an argument. Watch how your partner treats you when you disagree. How he behaves says a lot about how much—or little—he respects you.


He should never resort to name calling, physical or aggressive behavior, or anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. He should always treat you with respect, even during a heated argument. If not, it may be time to cut ties.;
, It’s been said that the way a person treats someone who helps them says a lot about their character. For the most part, this is likely true. Watch the way he interacts with others. It’s a bad sign if he is rude, mean, or disrespectful to others more often than not.


You can often get an idea of a person’s level of respect towards you in how they engage with people you are close to. The man you are considering spending the rest of your life with should treat the people you love with kindness and respect, even if he doesn’t get along with them. If nothing else, he should treat them this way because he cares about you. You may consider ending things if he can’t do that., No one is perfect, not even your potential husband. You are likely willing to accept his flaws ‘till death do you part, and he should do the same. He should understand that there are good, and perhaps not so good, aspects of your personality, and accept them happily.


A person who is husband material shouldn’t make you feel guilty for having flaws. You should feel comfortable around them to be honest and not try to hide who you are. It’s probably time to find a new partner if they can’t accept the real you., It’s not your potential husband’s job to protect and shield you from the world. It is his responsibility, however, to make sure you never feel threatened by him. You should always feel comfortable enough to share your thoughts and feelings.


It’s time to move on if you don’t feel safe when talking about potentially upsetting topics with him. Sure, he can be upset or mad if he doesn’t agree, but it’s never an excuse to behave in a way that makes you fearful. Ask yourself if you really enjoy spending time with him or if you’ve just formed an unhealthy attachment before you consider marriage.If you find that you feel afraid to speak up about something or feel genuinely afraid to break up, that is a red flag.

, Being a happy couple takes work for all involved. A successful marriage typically isn’t the result of one person doing everything while the other is content with simply showing up.


Take a look at your history and ask yourself if he’s put in the same level of commitment to making the relationship work as you have. If he hasn’t, he likely doesn’t value your partnership as much as you do., You may think your partner would make an excellent husband, but how you feel is neither here nor there if he’s not interested in marriage. Inquire about his marital beliefs when you begin to feel he could be “the one.” There’s no point in continuing the relationship if you know you want to get married one day and he doesn’t.


Ask him casually how he feels about marriage. You could say, “Do you ever see yourself settling down one day and getting married?” Listen to how he talks about other people’s marriages, as well. What he says about marriage in regards to others can reveal a lot about how he really feels.Do not get attached to the idea that he will change his mind for the right partner. While beliefs can change over time, it has to be his personal choice, not your pressure. What you see is what you get.

, There’s truth in the belief that opposites attract. However, there’s also the potential for major trouble down the road if you don’t share common values. What seems cute now could result in constant fighting a few years into the marriage.


Couples don’t always have to share the same beliefs when it comes to faith and other important values. However, they should be respectful of what each other holds dear to them. Your relationship likely doesn’t stand a chance if your beliefs aren’t compatible with one another’s.For example, if you strongly value honesty, but your partner lies repetitively, this will be a major point of contention. Similarly, if you value spending time with family while your partner places priority on work relationships, you could be pulled apart due to your differences.

, A good marriage doesn’t have to be one in which each spouse wants the same exact things in life. However, it does help if they are similar. Taking the plunge with someone who has a totally different outlook on life than you can cause trouble in the future.


For instance, if you want to purchase a home, but he is comfortable with renting for the foreseeable future, you may encounter troubles. On the same token, if you know you don’t want kids and he already has names picked out, there’s probably heartache ahead., It’s unrealistic to expect that each day will be filled with hearts and butterflies. However, you likely found the love of your life if you feel you are a better person with him in your life than you are without him. True partners bring out the best in each other and make them feel better about themselves.


Take a break if you’re unsure about the relationship. This will help you determine if you like your life better when he’s around. If not, it may be time to move on., Does your prospective life mate encourage you or try to bring you down? Does he give you compliments and believe in you or does he think what you do is silly and pointless? Part of being a good spouse is building up the other.


You may not have found the man of your dreams if he is only interested in supporting you if it benefits him. You might have a keeper, however, if he is willing to take a step back to allow you to pursue your goals., Couples that are able to enjoy themselves around each other are often the ones that last. You are able to have fun together when you complement each other’s personalities and allow each other to be yourselves. You don’t have to possess the same personalities, but your relationship is much more enjoyable when they work off of each other successfully.


A sign to move on is when you’re unhappy more often than happy. Relationships aren’t about having fun all of the time, but there has to be some enjoyment in there to make them last., He isn’t required to give you compliments all of the time, but he does need to make you feel good. This means not criticizing your weight, appearance, or IQ. You should feel like you are valuable to him. Consider looking elsewhere if he doesn’t make you feel like you are worthy of his affection.He should feel fortunate to have you in his life. He does not have to constantly praise you, but he should let you know how much he values you from time to time.

Consider your child's age before you make any introductions.,
Before you introduce the child to the new man in your life, consider name dropping or voice calls.,
To make the introduction on the child easier, keep the venue neutral and in an area where the child feels at ease and happy.,
When introducing the child to your partner, it's probably best to introduce him as a friend at the beginning.,
To make the transition as easy as possible for your child, try to keep things as simple as possible, particularly in the beginning.,
Help your partner bond with your child by telling him about what your child likes & dislikes in advance.",How to Introduce a Child to a New Boyfriend," Make sure that you and your partner have a stable and happy relationship with potential for a future before making any introductions. Chopping and changing partners and introducing your child to every man you meet can be emotionally damaging and confusing to the child. Children are susceptible to forming bonds with people quickly and if the relationship is unstable and your partner leaves, your child will also suffer the loss. Be sure of your relationship before making any decisions.;
, There is no harm in a baby (less than a year old) meeting your new partner, because if they leave, the chances of your baby remembering or forming a bond is less likely than those bonds formed with an older child. However, limit the amount of time your new partner is around the baby if you are unsure of how the relationship is going to progress.

, Mentioning your partner in conversation (depending on your child's age), will let the child know that you have a new friend who you spend time with. Also, if your child has started talking already, it might be a nice idea to allow them to speak on the phone occasionally so that your child will have some time to get used to this new person, if only on a vocal level to begin with.

, For example, if your child is being uncooperative at mealtime, bedtime or when you go to the store, it's best not to invite your new partner over. This is because again, depending on the child's age, they will associate the meeting of this new man with times they find distressing and may act up in the future when your new partner makes an appearance. However, if you go to the park or the play house, the child will be at ease, in a social environment where the meeting of people is somewhat the norm, making the introduction something that's associated with fun.

, Most children don't understand relationships between men and women, particularly in the early years, so there is no need to complicate matters by explaining. If your child is older and does understand relations between men and women, still consider calling him a friend while your child gets used to him being around.

, Limit physical contact between you and your partner around the child and keep the nights he stays over to a minimum. Remember, it has only been you and your child together for as long as he/she remembers and the new partners involvement in both your lives can make the child feel insecure, especially if they think that their 'time with mommy' is being compromised.

, That way he can strike the conversation to a great start with something that interests your child.

Plan a weekly dinner with your family.,
Throw a family reunion.,
Make time to grab lunch with a family member.",How to Keep in Touch With Family4," Choose one night of the week to meet every week if you all live near each other. Use the dinner as an opportunity for everyone to come together and share stories and updates about their lives.


Try to alternate where the dinner is hosted each week so no one family member feels overburdened.
If you do meet for dinner at the same family member's house every week, try a potluck-style get together. One person can make the main course, another can do snacks, and someone else can make dessert.

Communicate.,
Get on better terms with your siblings.,
Remember that pets are family as well.,
Set aside time for family.,
Reach compromises.,
Talk to a trusted friend about your family problems.",How to Improve Your Family Relationships (Kids)," It can help a lot! Don't be afraid to talk about all things, small and big, with your siblings and your parents. Talk about school, an interesting book you read, something that will capture their attention. Ask them how they are, and learn about their interests. Some well-guided communication can help you all feel a lot closer.


Keep in mind that picking the right time is important, too. If you parent is stressed or overwhelmed, it's probably not a good time to ask about their favorite book. Pick a time when you guys are just relaxing at home, or having dinner together, or in the car going somewhere together.;
, Your relationship with your siblings is likely to be the longest in your life, even longer than the one you have with your parents or your future partners. Try to get and stay on good terms with them.


If they are older siblings, don't nag at them constantly; try not to annoy them, and just talk to them. You can ask them for help once in a while to let them know that they mean something to you. Ask them for advice to show you respect their opinions. Give them a chance to notice and start respecting you.
For younger siblings, help them when they ask for it, answer the questions they ask, and give them advice about growing up. Be patient and be nice.

, Play with them, make sure they're fed, keep them clean and love them. Pets take everything in and most likely will return the kindness. Never abuse them or treat them with less respect. This will help you in relaxing and getting a better perspective of your own troubles.

, Sometimes you might want to hang out with your friends, but sometimes you just want to sit down and have a nice time with your family. Try to make time for both of these, and be clear about the boundaries between them.


Younger siblings may be particularly interested in playing with you and your friends. Sometimes, this is great, but there may also be times when you would like to play/ hang out with your friend alone. Communicate that to your sibling politely, setting a boundary clearly, especially for younger kids. Tell them something like, ""We want to play this level alone but when we're done, we'll come get you and we can all play basketball outside."" Try to compromise about your time together and apart, and get your parents involved if necessary.

, You will need to work out any problems that happen; you will face some disagreements in any family, and it's easy to get caught up in arguments. Be willing to talk about these issues. Apologize if you make mistakes.


Discuss with a family member if something he did hurt or confused you in any way. They most likely apologize. You must learn to forgive and forget. With a simple explanation of what happened, or maybe an ""I'm sorry,"" you can both move on and let bygones be bygones.

, In most cases talking to a friend or someone you trust can lift a heavy load off your chest, making room for fun and joy in your life. Of course if the issue is bad or even unacceptable, you should seek help to therapists or counsellor.

Therefore, it's a good idea to be open and honest with your children from the outset and make them aware of any possible changes in family structure.The more information they have, the more prepared they will be.


Present the idea of having new relatives to your kids. This will help you to gauge their responses and how they feel about the possibility of having a step-father, step-mother or step-siblings later on.
Create an open dialogue with your children. Initiate open and regular communication with your kids. This will enable them to open up to you about any concerns or reservations they might have.;
, Usually, there is no ""ideal"" time to tell them about your plans to re-marry. You just need to do it as gently as possible, when the time feels right. Just make sure to remember the following factors:


Surprise announcements won’t work. You have to break it to your kids slowly and gently to make sure that you have the ample time to talk and listen to each other’s opinions.
Make sure that your kids and your partner have already met prior to your engagement. They're likely to digest the news much more easily if it's someone they've met.
A one on one discussion or spending a day with your kids is probably the best approach when it comes to telling them about your plans. You can take them out for dinner or spend a day out-of-town, this allows you to have quality time alone with your children where you can explain the situation.

, Allow your kids to spend some time with their future step-parent and step-brothers and step-sisters. This is an important part of the process of getting to know each other.


Blending two families together is not an easy task. It is important to find the right time to introduce your kinds to the future members of your family. As soon as you inform your kids about your plan to re-marry (or before this, if possible), you may start planning their first meeting. Remember, first impressions last so be sure that the timing is perfect for everyone.
Pick a fun place where they can bond and get to know one another. You can choose to take them to their favorite amusement park for a perfect day of bonding together.
Let your future partner and your own kids spend some time alone together. Allow them some bonding time to get to know each other’s personalities. Eventually, your kids will find some common ground with their future step-parent.

, When you and your children move in with the new additions to your family, expect them to need some time to adjust to the situation. Common issues kids in this kind of situation may experience include:


The feeling of being isolated or left out.
The feeling of being replaced.
The feeling of being restricted and given ultimatums.
Lacking trust or respect for the new family members.
The feeling of being pressured to accept these huge changes before they are ready.

, The blending of a family is an emotional time for children. Take a moment and put yourself in the child’s shoes—are they mourning the loss of a deceased parent or grieving after a difficult divorce?


Listen to each child’s fears and concerns and make their emotions a central part of your new family bonding plan. Don’t expect each child to adjust or accept the change at the same time, and don’t push them to love their new life right away, but rather let them adjust and heal at their own pace.
Recognize that your child is going through a major change and that they might react differently to it — accept that and slowly motivate them to become integrated into their new step-family.

, Give each of your children — biological and step — enough time to adjust to each other’s personalities.


Each person has different ways in coping with changes in the family, so give them room and allow the situation to sink in. Respect their feelings and show them that they are important, loved and appreciated.
Changes should be made gradually. Don’t force or expect them to accept any changes instantly. That may just put extra strain on your relationship.

, A common fear of children joining a step family is that their biological parent will love their new stepchildren more than them.


Take time to maintain a strong connection with your biological children and do things with them one on one. Make them feel special and loved by taking the time to listen to them or to do a special activity that they love.
If your child loves art, take time to go to an art class together, or take a trip to the arcade if your child loves video games. You may feel the need to establish strong relationships with your new stepchildren, but don’t forget about the kids you already have.

, A new stepfamily doesn’t become a perfectly blended family overnight. There will definitely be ups and downs for everyone during the adjustment process. Practice patience and keep trying to bring the family together in natural ways.


Don’t pressure your children to be best friends with the members of their new step-family, but do encourage respect and teamwork among family members.
Not every family is perfect, and trying to corral everyone into thinking they are instantly one big, happy family can cause major resentment from the children.
Take things slow and find natural ways to bond with each member of the new family.

, Encourage relationships within the step-family, but don’t push anything before children are ready. Try to find similarities between members of the family and encourage them to explore those interests together.


For example, if you have a biological daughter and a stepdaughter who both love soccer, take the entire step-family to a soccer game that the girls will enjoy and that will hopefully foster a new relationship between them.
New step siblings naturally feel some competition with each other, so don’t push instant friendships. Pay attention to each child individually and point out their similarities and opportunities for friendship.

, Allow time for your child to spend one on one with your new spouse. #*Some children have a difficult time adjusting to a new parent and may not know how to best handle the situation. Others may worry that they are betraying their biological parent by bonding with their new stepparent.


Allow the relationship between child and stepparent to grow at its own pace, but encourage both sides to communicate and spend time together at whatever pace they need.
If your child is comfortable, encourage them to go on an outing or do an activity individually with their new stepparent. This can be as simple as a walk to the park or a trip to get ice cream, but can allow a new relationship to grow and for both parties to become more comfortable with each other.

, Children adjust better if both biological parents are involved. This isn’t always possible, but when it is, make a conscious effort to involve both parents.


Allow your child’s other parent to come to major events, like recitals and graduation, and let them have regular one-on-one time. Make sure your child knows that their new stepparent isn’t there to replace their biological parent, but to be another person you loves them.
If you are sharing custody with the other parent, try to have regular check-ins where you share information and updates about the child so that everyone is on the same page.

, Listen to each member of the family and make sure each child’s voice is heard. Holding regularly family meetings creates an open environment to discuss progress and problems and to work through issues as a team.


Make sure the opinion and feelings of every child are heard so that no one feels overlooked or invisible, which can easily happen in a blended family.
Encourage open and free communication and work to create a calming and supportive environment where children feel free to discuss their feelings.

, As a family, create a list of family rules and display them in a prominent place.


Discussing the rules as a new family helps everyone’s voice be heard and gives each child a buy-in to follow the rules.
Children from different backgrounds and upbringings may have different ideas of rules, so do your best to mediate the situation and find a compromise without playing favorites.

, Create a safe environment for your new family and have roles for each stepparent. Be aware that your biological child may react differently to guidance and discipline from their new stepparent.


At the beginning, it may be helpful to maintain control as the main disciplinarian to your own child instead of risking your child alienating their stepparent.
It can be helpful for the stepparent to fill the role of friend or counselor, at least at first, in order to build a strong relationship with your child.

, Use your already established routines to bond with everyone. Examples of fun bonding activities include:


Spending Friday movie night together.
Cooking weekend breakfasts.
Having family dinner together.
Monthly hiking or biking trips.
Going on your annual summer vacations together.

, Creating opportunities for all members of the blended family to participate in an activity together will help each child feel welcomed and accepted.


Many new blended families go on a vacation together to celebrate their new life. This can be beneficial to some families, but the key is to establish routines and rituals in everyday life, not just in vacation mode. Find a tradition or activity that works for your family, such as weekly game or sports nights, eating a special food each week, or a monthly trip to the zoo, and follow through.
Getting the input of each child when deciding the activity can also help with a smooth transition. Regular family activities give children something to look forward to and help them feel that they are part of something bigger. It also creates a fun environment for the family to connect on a more casual level.

, When it comes to holidays and existing traditions you may have with your biological child, don’t throw them away or disregard them now that you have a new family.


Children crave consistency and having a tradition from their old life can be a comforting reminder of how things were while also strengthening your bond with your child.
If you and your child have always baked sugar cookies together around Christmas, make sure to keep that tradition alive even after you join a step-family.

Be a perfect planner of every task that you undertake on daily basis.",How to Have Time with Your Husband with Kids in the House1," For example, you can jot down the daily chores and estimate the time they might take. It seems something like this:


7 to 7:30 AM: Getting kids ready for school and preparation of breakfast (make the kids' favorite, to remind them that you keep their priorities your priority). Don't forget to kiss and hug them before leaving for school. Physical gestures matter a lot to children.
7:30 to 8 AM: Once the kids are off to school, rush back to your hubby (always wear some good scent to entice him), wake him up in the most romantic manner, take a hot, fresh breakfast tray to his bed (this will keep him cozy and warm). Softly strike his face or kiss him tenderly to wake him up without growing grumpy. A sudden, loud wake up call always disturbs the sound sleep and often leaves the person in a bad temper for the rest of the day. Enjoy your breakfast together, and have a hot cup of coffee with his favored breakfast. This, along with your warm company, will surely brighten his mood and ignite his passions for your closeness. Help him in getting ready for work, keep his laptop bag, car keys, mobile, etc. at proper place and always kiss him before he sets off for his job. All this will make him depend on you and long for you while he'll be away. Try to feed the dog, put yourself together, find your car keys and finish that report your boss needs at the same time if required.
9 AM until the kids are back: Try to finish all household chores before the return of your kids. Prepare lunch and dinner while you are alone and do not indulge in wasteful activities. Do not delay the basic chores; laundry, cleaning, cooking, shopping and the other stuff that might hinder your evening enjoyment. Go to work, drop your baby off at childcare if required. Or, if you have pre-school children at home and work from home, simultaneously work and do childcare at the same time. Pick up the kids from school at the correct time and ferry them around to any after school activities they do. If possible, multitask by picking up your dry cleaning, dropping by any elderly relatives you care for or returning library books at the same time.
When the kids are back: You must greet the kids and hug them passionately when they are back to assure them that you've missed them the whole day. Talk about their routine at school, including any interesting things happening, and encourage them to speak up about their feelings, regrets and dreams. Try to feed and spend their time helping the kids with homework before the arrival of your husband. Give them time to play and feel relaxed and vilified in the comfort of their home.
The time your hubby comes back: It is a crucial time, after the hectic day out at work, your husband needs to revitalize himself, he must feel refreshed once he enters the premises of his home. Be prepared! Refurbish yourself, wear light makeup, do your hair the way he likes, dress up nicely (enticingly) and most importantly, wear a warm smile to welcome him. Don't get disappointed if he gives you a wry or indifferent look. Get him a hot cup of tea or a chilled drink (it depends on the weather). Let him cool down and fresh en up. Do not start discussing an issue or family matter, or complain at that moment. Give him a break! If you have been working all day too, your husband can still get this special treatment, as long as he treats you equally as well as you treat him.
While he is taking a shower or a nap, be with your kids, make their favorite snack to fill those hungry bellies. Remember, a satisfied child will be a satisfying child! Children should consume around 1600 calories a day. Check with your childcare professional to ensure you are not over feeding your children and setting them on the path to obesity.
Once your hubby cools down, he looks forward to your company, and all he desires are peaceful and harmonious family moments. Engage in such activities that involve the whole family and strengthens the bond between each member. Remember, moments spent together are cherished and always remembered. Watch a movie together, play a board game to keep the fun alive, share the interesting incidents and laugh together.;

Treat your kids fairly and be consistent.,
Listen to both sides of any argument.,
Recognize each child’s unique qualities.,
Don’t compare your children.",How to Improve Your Children's Sibling Relationships1," If you’re lavishing praise and gifts on one child but not the other, the neglected child will feel sad and/or angry. Similar feelings might occur if you’re constantly punishing one child but not the other for the same offense. The anger might be directed at the sibling, at you, or at both of you. From the child’s perspective, you and the favored sibling are in cahoots against them.Being fair doesn’t mean you need to do the exact same thing for one that you do for the other – though with very young children this is often a good idea. However, it is important to be consistent with your rules and punishments, even if the rules are slightly different for each of your children.
For example, if your children have different bedtimes, then makes sure that you are consistent with enforcing each of their bedtimes.
Divide your time with both kids. Whether it’s helping with homework, going to their events or sports games, or just spending leisure time together, ensure both your children receive an adequate and roughly equal amount of time with you.;
, When your kids fight, they often want to be listened to and acknowledged as much as they want a swift and just resolution to their conflict. Begin by separating your children into separate rooms. Tell them both that you want to hear what happened, but will only listen to one of them at a time.Ask one child to leave the room, then talk to the other.
Listen carefully as your child explains their side of the situation. Make eye contact with your child and nod your head to show that you’re engaged in what they are sharing. Ask follow-up questions if you are confused or need clarification.
Once they’ve told their side, dismiss them to another room. Bring their sibling in and have them share their side of the story.
Try to act as a mediator and help your children develop solutions to their disagreements. For example, you could sit down with them and allow each one a chance to talk and share their feelings. Then, ask questions to help them come to a solution, such as, “What is the main thing that you are upset about?” “What do you think would make you feel better?” “How do you think you could prevent this from happening in the future?”

, It is important to see each of your children as a unique individual. Take time to tell each, privately, “You’re very special to me. I love you and there is nobody else like you!”


As kids get older and come into their own as individuals, you should acknowledge their differences in your displays of affection. For instance, it’s probably not necessary to buy both kids toy trucks if only one of them likes toy trucks. Instead, think of their specific likes and dislikes. If the other child likes planes, buy one a plane and the other a truck.
Be specific when praising your children. Instead of saying, for instance, “You are a great kid,” say, “I think it’s great that you’re so creative and love writing music on the piano. I’m sure your talent will take you far.”
If one child has a physical disability or emotional issue, show extra sensitivity about it. Help the other child understand that their sibling needs a different level of care than they do, but not because the child with the issue is better or loved more. Talk openly with your child about their sibling’s condition, and encourage your children to talk about the condition together.

, If you tell one child that they are not as intelligent or as clever as the other, their feelings will be hurt. This kind of treatment could lead to long-term resentment and emotional frustration. It might also cause them to harbor anger towards the sibling who you said was better. Think carefully before ever criticizing your child.Instead of making comparisons between your children, make suggestions. For instance, instead of saying, “Your brother always cleans up. Why don’t you clean up as nicely as she does?” say, “Please clean up your room.”

Never let fun be out of your life.,
Do not grow extra mature and old with your age, having serious countenance all the time will cause distances between you and your children.,
Be a source of motivation and encouragement for your husband and kids.,
Try to be friends with your husband and then be a lover.",How to Have Time with Your Husband with Kids in the House2," Sentiment and passion is the basic spirit to keep any relationship alive and worth cherishing. Remember, your countenance and demeanor effects the mindset of your family members towards life and towards the family unit. Ignite the flame of felicity and glee to strengthen the bond of your family as a unit. It is not that hard to spread the vibes of buoyancy while still playing a dual role of a lover and a mother.

, Stay upbeat and bubbly, full of enthusiasm and life. Your husband will also feel exhilarated to have a jubilant and exciting partner. Play, laugh and live your life to the fullest with your husband and kids. You will find a clear change in your life once you will bring laughter and giggles in your talk and walk.

, Do this to make them feel secure and loved in the boundaries of home. Your husband will be attracted towards you naturally when he finds mental and physical peace with you.

, You must understand his feelings, desires and priorities. You should be too close to him to actually connect with his soul, the wrinkles on his forehead and a sparkle twinkling in his eye must convey the right message at the right time. You must strive to be soul mates and not only roommates.

"
Keep all family members closely connected with each other.,
Plan your weekends in a way that the whole family enjoys together.,
Have at least one meal of a day together with the whole family.",How to Have Time with Your Husband with Kids in the House3," You must play a positive role to knit the bond of strong family unit. You should develop a habit of discussing and sharing your problems and concerns with your kids and husband and similarly must keep them connected with each other's matters too.


Encourage your kids to talk to their father and spend some time with him. Kids must share their life happenings with their father and seek his advice. This way, you all can spend time in each others' company and will come even more closer.

, Family gatherings, picnics, a day at a farmhouse, watching a movie together or a simple long drive can add a fresh verve in your family life.

, Dinner is the best time when everyone sit around the table and share their daily affairs. Make the best out of this time to fortify the family bondage.

"
"
Do not let  the flame of sensuality fade away from your married life.",How to Have Time with Your Husband with Kids in the House4," Your husband should not and must not sacrifice his sexual desires for the sake of you nurturing your kids. Do not take love making as a routine or a monotonous practice.


Bring vigor and fervor in your sex life by alluring your husband and make him feel important and wanted. Do not let him look for better options elsewhere. Put kids early on bed, get a cup of green tea for two and enjoy the erotic evening together.

Build family traditions with your kids.,
Provide opportunities for your kids to spend time together.,
Give your kids time away from each other.,
Help your kids overcome differences.,
Encourage helping behaviors.",How to Improve Your Children's Sibling Relationships2," One of the great ways you can help strengthen your children’s bond is by encouraging them to participate together in various holiday outings and annual events. For instance, supply your kids with a pumpkin and allow them (when they reach an age where they are able) to cut it into a jack-o-lantern (with adult supervision). During the winter, build a snowman in the yard, or provide them with the means to construct their own gingerbread houses., If your kids never have opportunities to bond and spend time together, they won’t have a strong relationship. Take your kids bowling, or to the park, or just allow them time to play in their rooms together. These shared experiences can give your kids’ relationship a solid foundation.Young children who play together will fight at some point, too. But unless their conflicts occur frequently (at a rate of more than one conflict per five positive interactions), don’t encourage them to stay apart from each other.
If you know that your kids get cranky and are more likely to fight at certain times of day – for instance, in the late evening – don’t schedule joint playtime during those times.

, Growing up, especially in a small house, kids might feel that they are overexposed to their siblings. This feeling that their siblings are always around might make them feel trapped and frustrated, leading to a deteriorating relationship. It is just as important, therefore, to give your kids time away from each other as it is to provide time when they can be together.Instead of taking both children everywhere with you or insisting that they play together when one or both don’t really want to, provide opportunities where they can be apart for a time.
For instance, take one child to the zoo this weekend, then take your other child to the baseball game next weekend. That way, you’ll be able to spend an equal amount of time with each even though the time spent isn’t always together.

, If there is a significant difference in your kids’ backgrounds, find ways to help them bond that acknowledge and accommodate their differences. For example, if one child is 5 and the other is 15, it might seem hard to find ways for them to bond. Identify activities that they both like to do and facilitate opportunities to enjoy these activities together.For instance, if both children enjoy baseball, allow the older child to take the younger one to a baseball game.
Without relinquishing your responsibilities as a parent, encourage your older child to watch out for their younger sibling in certain situations. For instance, if both children ride the same bus to school, encourage the much older child to protect the younger one.

, If your siblings feel like they are in competition with each other, then it may be difficult for them to be supportive of each other. To improve their relationship with each other, try to encourage helping behaviors among your children.

For example, you might encourage your children to be supportive of each other during stressful times, such as before a big game that one of your children will be playing in, or before one of your children has a big test at school.
Try saying something like, “Don’t forget to wish your sister good luck on her history test today! She is really worried about it and it will mean a lot to her if you give her some words of encouragement.” Or, “Let’s all cheer for Danny when he comes out onto the field! It will make him happy to know we are all here to support him.”

"
"
Express pleasure when your children are kind to their siblings.,
Remind your kids how well they usually get along.,
Teach your kids to monitor their emotions.,
Ask your children to think about how they like being treated.,
Use roleplaying.,
Let your kids work things out.,
Be patient.",How to Improve Your Children's Sibling Relationships3," When you praise your children for independently nurturing their relationship, you help ensure they will continue to show kindness toward and understanding of each other. For instance, if one child shares a toy with the other, say, “Wow, I really liked how you shared your toy truck with your sister.”You could also use moments of positive behavior to encourage even more good behavior by encouraging the child on the receiving end of the original positive action to thank their sibling.
Expressing thanks helps people of all ages feel happier, and your siblings will learn to associate that feeling of joy with their sibling.
Of course, it is okay to offer vague or general praise once in a while, too.

, After a conflict, mention to your kids how surprised you are that they were fighting, when just a short time ago they were getting on swimmingly. Reference a specific, recent occasion when their relationship was good. You might say, for example, “You two were getting along so well when we were at the park! What happened?” They will then remember the good time they had with each other at the park and cool down., Since siblings often like to needle each other, it’s important to empower your kids to recognize and reflect on their own feelings. They will then be better equipped to communicate in a healthy way with their siblings (and with others) about how they’re being treated and why they don’t appreciate their treatment.When your kids are frustrated by you, their sibling, or a friend, help them identify their emotions. For instance, if your child is angry they can’t go out to play, ask directly, “How do you feel?”
Offer suggestions as to what they might be feeling. For example, you could ask, “I see that you’re angry, but are you also disappointed or sad?”
Let your kids know that all emotions are okay, and that it is normal to feel angry when faced with a frustrating situation or person.Expressing or recognizing emotions in others is the first step toward empathy. Getting your child to engage in these emotion-sharing exercises, therefore, is useful for defusing frustrating situations they have with their siblings, too.
Encourage your child to always pose the question, “Would you like it if I did that to you?” to a sibling they are in conflict with. When one sibling sees that they are making the other feel bad, they’ll be less likely to engage in negative behavior.

, Teach both your kids the importance of the Golden Rule – treat others as you would like to be treated. Begin by sitting down with both of them and helping them write a list of “friend qualities.” For instance, you might verbally provide your kids with a list of words and ask them to identify and write each word that they want to see in a friend.Your word list might include kind, funny, mean, sharing, generous, and selfish. Your children should understand that friendship and positive relationships require being kind, generous, and sharing with others.
Ask your children to remember the Golden Rule and to enact the “friend words” when dealing with each other.

, Roleplaying is especially effective with younger children who need guidance on how to act towards others. Through roleplaying your children can discover what it’s like to be on the receiving end of abuse. Roleplaying can equip your kids to identify alternatives to deepening a feud with their sibling.Bring your children together for a roleplaying scenario in which someone is, for instance, name-calling. Ask your child what they would do.
Explain that the first step in dealing with a conflict is to slow down and take a deep breath. Help them understand that if they respond with aggression and anger, the conflict will only get worse.
Encourage them to instead locate an adult to help them resolve the situation.
Roleplaying is especially effective after a conflict ensues. Once the dispute is settled, you can bring your children back together, go over the roleplaying scenario, and end with a review of the roleplaying exercise to confirm your children understand the process.
Ask them simple questions like, “Next time your sibling is bothering you or treating you badly, what should you do?”

, As a parent, of course, it’s natural to do everything you can to swiftly bring any conflict to an end and maintain peace in the house. But if you allow your kids to manage their own relationship and take responsibility for their own actions, they will become more active in building and managing their sibling relationship. Even if your kids are fighting, fight the urge to jump (unless they’re engaged in really hateful speech or physical violence). This approach works best with older children (adolescents and teens) who should have conflict resolution skills that a younger child probably will not.
Allowing your kids to work things out on their own also keeps you neutral and out of the conflict altogether. You won’t, therefore, get blamed later for taking one child’s side over the other.

, Learning social skills takes time. Some kids don’t get along for years while they’re growing up. Have faith that they will blossom into young people who appreciate and value each other’s company. Continue doing all you can to support and improve their relationship.If you’re doing all you can to encourage a healthy relationship between your kids and they still don’t get along very well, don’t blame yourself. Some people just rub each other the wrong way.
Get help from a therapist if behavior problems between your siblings persist beyond normal levels of sibling rivalry and conflict. Serious, ongoing conflict issues may suggest that one or both children have underlying issues that need to be dealt with before the sibling relationship can improve.

Find a battery that works with your model.,

Look for your laptop model near the top of the About window. You'll need to know the size and manufacture date of your MacBook Pro in order to choose the correct battery.;
, Before you decide to install the battery yourself, make sure tools and know-how for the job. Ideally, you should review an online guide specific to your model, but there are three general categories of repair:


13-inch and 15-inch models from Early 2009 or earlier have removable batteries.Some 17-inch models do as well, which you can test by looking for release catches on the underside of the laptop.These batteries are very easy to replace.
Since 2012, the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros with Retina displays have had glued-in batteries.These are relatively difficult and dangerous to remove, and may require a specialized tool such as the iOpener. If you have not repaired computers before, consider using the Apple Store.
All other MacBook Pro batteries are ""non-removable,"" but easy to handle if you have taken apart a computer before. You may need a Y1 Tri-wing screwdriver, plastic spudger, and Phillips head screwdriver.

, Apple may replace your battery for free in one of the following circumstances:


Your laptop was purchased from Apple less than a year ago, or less than three years ago if you bought the AppleCare Protection Plan.The problem is due to a manufacturing defect and not later damage. A defect is more likely if the cycle count was below 1000.Visit  → About This Mac → System Report → Power and look for ""Cycle Count"" to check this number.

, Even if you aren't covered by warranty, Apple officially recommends that you take laptops with built-in batteries to the Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider. Although you can ignore them and replace the battery yourself, check the estimated repair cost on the Apple website first before you shop for other options. This is usually more expensive than third-party options, but you are guaranteed to receive a genuine Apple battery appropriate for your device.


In the US, Apple's battery replacements are covered by warranty for one year.Different terms may apply in other countries.

, If you decide to go the Apple-recommended route, look up Apple Authorized Service Providers in your area using the Apple website. Contact these to get an estimate of the price, and how long the replacement might take.

, Unfortunately, the cheapest batteries online are often knockoffs or heavily used. These typically have a short battery life, and there's a small chance of a dangerous defect. Avoid auction sites, and look for sellers with some signs of legitimacy. These include:


Positive user reviews, especially on other website (not their own)
A physical address and telephone listed on their company website (call the number if you suspect the site is impersonating another business)
A return policy with full refund within a limited time of purchase

, Make sure the seller lists the exact models the battery is suitable for. A MacBook Pro from 2010 does not use the same battery as a MacBook Pro from 2015.


See the instructions at the start of this article if you're not sure what model you use.

, Batteries that match one of these descriptions are likely to be poor quality. Buy at your own risk:


""Brand-new Apple batteries"" are probably counterfeit unless sold by Apple or an Apple Authorized Reseller.
Batteries that cost less than half of Apple's replacement fee (see above) probably have something wrong with them.

, If the seller claims the battery was made by Apple, test the claim while you still have the option to return it. After installing the replacement battery, return to About This Mac → System Report → Power. Look for the following information:


Check the Serial Number under ""Model information"" and compare it to the serial number provided by the seller or listed on the packaging. If these do not match, the product is likely a fake. A number beginning ""0123456"" is another sign of a fake.The Manufacturer should be SMP, or DP for some older models.Under ""Health Information,"" the Condition should be Normal. The Cycle Count should be 0 or a single-digit number if the battery is new.

A laptop is portable. This is the primary reason for purchasing a laptop. Laptops can go almost anywhere you can, and they're only getting lighter and thinner.
Laptops can perform more and more tasks that desktops can. There are very few programs these days that a desktop can run that a laptop cannot. While you're generally sacrificing some performance for portability, you still have the ability to perform most computing tasks.
Laptops can save a lot of space. A desktop computer, with a tower, monitor, keyboard, and mouse, can take up a lot of space in your home office or bedroom. A laptop just needs a little desk space.

, While laptops are becoming more powerful and lighter, there are still some drawbacks that you should consider if deciding between a laptop and a desktop.


A laptop is limited by the battery. You can only roam so much with a laptop. Eventually, it will need to be plugged in.
Can be lost or stolen much easier. Because of their portable nature, laptops can be stolen or lost much easier than a desktop. If you're setting up an office, you'll probably want to stock it with desktops instead of laptops.
Laptops cannot be upgraded like a desktop can. This means that they become obsolete quicker than a desktop computer. While you can usually upgrade the storage or the memory, you cannot upgrade the processor or video card, which will eventually leave your laptop lagging behind.
Laptops get heated very quickly if you are using it heavily.
Laptops are hard to build yourself. One of the benefits of a desktop PC is that you can build it yourself, potentially saving money. While you may be able to find a few kits, nearly all laptops are sold complete by the manufacturer, which means the costs may be a little higher than a comparable desktop.

, It will be helpful to have a budget in mind as you start looking at laptop models. The different types of laptops will be explained in-depth later, but generally you're looking at around $300-$400 for a netbook or Chromebook, $500-$1200 dollars for a standard laptop, and $900-$2500 for a desktop replacement.


If you are considering a Mac, be aware that Macs are generally priced higher than a comparable Windows or Linux laptop.

, The operating system is the interface and structure of your laptop. Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and ChromeOS are all operating systems. When choosing a laptop, the operating system is usually installed already, though you can change operating systems later. You cannot install Mac OS X on a non-Mac laptop, but you can install Linux onto either a Mac or a Windows laptop, or Windows onto a Mac laptop.


Windows - The most common operating system available, and compatible with the most software.
Mac OS X - Designed for use with Mac hardware. OS X is only available on MacBooks.
Linux - This is a free operating system that comes in a variety of flavors, or ""distributions"". These include Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, and more.
ChromeOS - This is Google's Chromium-based operating system. It is designed for laptops that are consistently connected to the internet, and can only run special web apps. ChromeOS is only available on specific Chromebooks, though you can get Chromium for any system.

, The programs you use on a day-to-day basis will have a large impact on the operating system you choose. Many programs are only available for a single operating system. Do some research as to what operating system your favorite programs require, if you'll have to pay again if you switch operating systems, and whether or not there are alternatives available.


If your business uses operating system-specific programs, that may limit your options if you intend to use the laptop for work.

, Windows is the most widely-used operating system, which is great for compatibility, but it's not without its faults. Keep the pros and cons in mind when thinking about your new laptop.


Windows is the most common and compatible operating system around. Office is the de facto standard in word processing and spreadsheets.
Windows will work on virtually any computer, from the cheapest laptops in the store to the most expensive.
Windows is much more susceptible to viruses than other operating systems. This isn't to say that it's not secure, it just means that you will need to practice good habits while online.
Windows has the largest game library of any operating system.

, These days, you can find much of the same software on a Mac OS that you will on Windows.


If you are a heavy Apple user, a Mac computer will integrate seamlessly with your iOS devices. Managing your apps and media is all handled natively.
They are less prone to viruses. Mac operating systems are more secure than Windows, due both to architectural and population differences between the two operating systems. There are still threats if you use a Mac, just not as many.
While there are more and more software options on Mac, there is still a lack of compatibility for a lot of key programs. The biggest drawback is OS X's lack of game selection compared to Windows, though more and more Windows games are being ported over.
Macs are regarded as the best place to do media editing. The video and image editing software on a Mac is unrivaled, and most musicians use Macs for recording and production.
Mac hardware will cost you a pretty penny. Since getting OS X requires Mac hardware, you'll be forced to buy a MacBook from Apple or an Apple-authorized retailer. This means you'll be paying a premium price, but many Apple users are major supporters of the construction quality of their MacBooks. The actual price of the operating system is much cheaper than Windows.

, Linux is a free, open-source operating system that has been modified and expanded by a large number of groups and individuals. These modified versions are called ""distributions"", and there are quite a few to choose from. There's a good chance that you won't see many, or any, Linux laptops at your local computer retailer.


Linux is a free operating system, and many of the programs available for it are open-source and free. You are free to try out any Linux distribution before installing it.
Linux is notorious for being difficult to learn. Advances to the graphical front-end have been made by most distributions, making it easier to transition from Windows or Mac. That being said, Linux does require a bit more time invested getting used to navigating and manipulating files.
Linux is one of the most secure operating systems, as everything requires express consent of the user. There are very few viruses that target Linux machines.
Linux scales very well and can work on virtually any laptop.
You will experience compatibility problems. The biggest drawback to Linux is the lack of compatibility between it and other operating systems. You will likely find times when you need to jump through several hoops to open a file that was simple in Windows or OS X. The gaming library on Linux is also quite limited compared to Windows, though more and more games are releasing Linux versions.
Linux is not installed on most laptops available in stores. It will need to be installed later alongside or replacing your default operating system.

, ChromeOS is Google's operating system, and is only available on a handful of laptops. ChromeOS is designed for laptops that are always connected to the internet.


ChromeOS is lightweight and fast. This is because ChromeOS is essentially just a web browser. All the apps are installed inside the web browser. Because of this, most of ChromeOS's functionality requires an internet connection (you can do some work offline, such as working with Google Docs).Most Chromebooks are very inexpensive, ranging from $200-$250 USD. The exception to this is Google's Chromebox, which starts at $825 USD.
Because Chromebooks rely on Google Drive for file storage, most have very limited onboard storage.
You can only use apps that have been designed for ChromeOS on the Chromebook. This means that your software options will be very limited. Google Drive provides a decent Office alternative, but you can forget installing games or programs like Photoshop.
ChromeOS is best for heavy Google users. If the majority of your computer work takes place inside the Google ecosystem, then a Chromebook may be your most affordable and attractive option.

, There are four main types of laptops: Netbook, Standard, Hybrid Laptop/Tablet, and Desktop Replacement/Ultrabook. Note that if you are choosing a Mac, your choices will likely not match much of this section.Netbook - This is the smallest laptop available, and is best suited for heavy travelers.
Standard - This is your standard laptop. Suitable for a wide range of situations, and available in a wide range of configurations.
Hybrid Laptop/Tablet - These are the newest style of laptops to the scene. They have touch screens and some have detachable keyboards.
Desktop Replacement/Ultrabook - These are the largest laptops, and therefore the most powerful (and most expensive).

, Netbooks are the smallest laptops available, and are perfect for packing in your carry-on or sticking in your purse.


Netbooks are super lightweight, usually only weighing a couple pounds.
Netbooks don't have very powerful components, meaning they can only run basic programs such as Office and other productivity software. Because of this, however, they have much longer battery life than other laptops (up to 12 hours in some models).Netbooks have the smallest screens and keyboards. This means that typing on a netbook will take some getting used to, and you may have to sit pretty close to it.

, The standard laptop is the most common, and the most varied.


Standard laptops come in a variety of screen sizes. The size of the screen is what determines the overall size of the laptop. The most common size for standard laptops is 14""-15"".
Standard laptops have limited battery life, and the more powerful the laptop, the quicker the battery will drain. Batteries will also wear out over time.
Standard laptops are heavier than a netbook, which makes them harder to fit in small bags. They have more comfortable keyboards and larger trackpads.

, Hybrid laptops are a relatively new addition to the laptop market. Most run Windows 8, which is designed for the touch interface.


The biggest draw of the hybrid is the touch screen. If you prefer this method of input, you may want to consider the hybrid.
Hybrid laptops are typically smaller than a standard laptop, and may be able to fold over to become a tablet. Some hybrid laptops allow you to remove the keyboard and work solely as a tablet.
Because of their smaller size, hybrids are generally less powerful than a standard laptop.

, Desktop replacements are the largest and most powerful laptops available. They can run the latest games and have large, easy-to-see displays.


Desktop replacement laptops provide the most power you can get in a portable form. They can often run most of the same programs at the same levels of efficiency as a desktop computer.
Because of the increased power, desktop replacements have the worst battery life. This usually isn't an issue if it's always plugged in at your desk, however.
The large screen on a desktop replacement means that you don't have to sit as close or squint, and also means that the keyboard will be full-sized.
Some desktop replacement laptops have limited upgradability, such as the ability to install a new video card.
Desktop replacements are the most unwieldy laptops, and do not travel as well. They are also the most expensive.

, If your job or lifestyle puts your laptop at risk of getting damaged, you may want to look at the most durable options. This includes steel construction and laptops specifically designed to withstand punishment.


Toughbooks are a type of laptop that is very expensive but much more resilient than a standard laptop.

, Laptops are public devices, and will be seen by a lot of people as you use it. Make sure you like the way it looks. Many laptops come in various colors or with other aesthetic features. You can also add skins to your laptop later to give it a personal touch.

, Every laptop is different; even two models that cost the same will have different hardware inside. Make sure to take a look at the specifications of each laptop you consider purchasing.

, The CPU, or Processor, is the piece of hardware that performs the bulk of the work in your laptop. CPU speed doesn't mean as much as it used to, thanks to multi-core CPUs that can handle much more than processors from a decade ago.


Avoid older processors like Celeron, Atom, Pentium, C-, or E-Series processors.

, RAM, or Memory, allows your computer to store data for multiple programs at once. In general, the more RAM you have, the better your computer will be able to multitask. 4 to 8 GB of RAM is standard for regular laptops. Netbooks will likely have less, while desktop replacements might have significantly more.


Retailers often disguise an otherwise mediocre laptop by stuffing it with RAM. Most users will not need more than 8 GB.

, Most laptops use integrated graphics cards, which are fine for simple games, but typically can't handle the new big releases. A dedicated card will provide more power for a higher cost and less battery life.

, Listed storage space does not take the operating system and bundled programs into consideration. For example, a laptop with 250 GB of storage may only have 210 GB of storage free when you purchase it. Most laptops allow you to upgrade the hard drive later, though you will need to reinstall the operating system when you do so.


SSD is becoming standard and is preferable due to increased access speed and extended battery life. As a result SSDs are more expensive than standard hard drives for less storage. SSDs are often smaller than standard drives, meaning you may need an external drive to store all of your media files.

, Does the laptop have enough USB ports for all of your devices? Does it have an HDMI or VGA port in case you want to connect it to your TV or a projector? If you use a lot of external devices, ports will be very important.

, Many laptops will leave the optical drive out in order to save space. While this will help the battery life and cut down on the size, it means you will need an external drive in order to install software or burn discs.


Some laptops now come with Blu-ray drives, which can read and write standard DVDs as well as read Blu-ray discs, which can contain much more information or HD movies.

, 1600 x 900 or 1920 x 1080 is preferable for the clearest picture, though smaller laptops may not be able to attain this. A higher resolution will result in a clearer picture, especially if you plan to watch movies or play games. A higher resolution also means that the screen can display more, which means your viewable area will be larger.


Determine how the laptop looks in direct sunlight. Cheap screens are often very difficult to see in direct sunlight.

, Don't let a sales rep talk you into something you don't need. Do your research ahead of time and stay firm on your needs. Make sure to read reviews online for the laptops that you are considering, as salespeople will rarely tell you the downsides of a product.

, Try to find a way to test your desired laptop before you buy. If you intend to buy online, see if a local retailer has a demo model to try before you buy. Ask your friends if they have the same laptop you are considering.

, Computer parts fail, and do so fairly often. Having a solid warranty is very important for laptops, especially the more expensive ones. Make sure the warranty is a manufacturer warranty, and that they do a good job with their warranty work.


Craigslist laptops rarely have warranties.

, Buying used can save you a lot of money, but you may end up with a very subpar product. AS laptops get older, they start to experience significant performance decreases. Used laptops often no longer quality for manufacturer warranties, and may people sell their laptops because they're fed up with how they're performing.


If you are buying a refurbished model, ensure that the refurbishment comes with a very strong warranty.

If you do this method with the wrong battery, the battery will likely be destroyed.


Turn the computer off, then open the battery cover (typically on the bottom of the laptop). If the battery says something like Li-ion, Li-on, Li-ion II, Lithium, LiPo, you do not have the proper battery for this method.
If you are unable to read the text on the battery (perhaps it rubbed off), call your computer manufacturer to find out, or use a different method.
If your NiMH or NiCD battery no longer holds a charge at all, this method may only get you an additional 30 minutes or so of battery charge capability, which is much better than 0 minutes. If the battery is simply draining too quickly, you may be able to get better results with this method.;
, The battery should come out without having to use much force.

, Any high-quality sealable bag will work. It’s important to make sure the bag is completely sealed and contains no holes.

, Don’t leave the battery in there much longer than that, as freezing it for too long could cause it to explode.

, Take the battery out of the bag and let it warm up to room temperature, drying it occasionally with a towel if it appears damp. Let the battery warm back up to room temperature for up to 30 minutes before continuing.

, If there is a cover that goes over your laptop battery, slide it securely into place as well.

, Without turning the computer back on, plug the machine back in to a power source and leave it this way overnight (or for several hours during the day).

, To drain the battery quickly, it’s best to turn the computer on, unplug it from the power source, and do something system-intensive, such as watching a video with the screen brightness turned up.

, Do this step at least twice, but preferably 4-5 times. Once you’ve followed these steps, your formerly-dead battery should now hold a charge for a least a half hour, hopefully more.

Update the device firmware every 6 months.,
Clean peripheral devices as needed.,
Follow the recommended maintenance schedule as directed by the manufacturer.,
Adhere to the manufacturer's recommended best practices for use.,
Use the recommended device settings.,
Use only the type and quality of media recommended by the device manufacturer.,
Keep device media in a well protected, low traffic area.",How to Maintain Computer Peripherals," The term firmware refers to the software program used by the device's components to communicate with the network and perform the various tasks required to accomplish its primary function. Manufacturers are continually offering firmware updates for computer peripherals that can significantly enhance the performance of any peripheral device.


Navigate to the manufacturer's website and determine the location of the firmware downloads page. This page typically can be accessed from the ""downloads"" or ""customer support"" links located on the manufacturer's home page.
Provide the required information when prompted. In most cases, you will need to provide the name and model number of the device, as well as the operating system installed on your computer, in order to locate the correct firmware update.
Follow the instructions provided for downloading and installing the firmware update. Once downloaded, the installation wizard will guide you through the process of installing the firmware update.;
, Dirt, dust and debris can impact the performance of peripheral devices.


Power down the device and disconnect it from the computer prior to cleaning. Neglecting to do so could cause damage to peripheral devices.
Use a can of compressed air to blow off dust particles and other debris from the exterior of the device.
Use a damp paper towel to wipe away any dust particles that remain after using the compressed air. Use a cotton swab lightly dipped in rubbing alcohol to remove grime and dirt from inside cracks, seams and other hard to reach places.
Use a microfiber cloth to clean LCD displays, camera lenses and device control panels. Do not use multi-purpose cleaners, which can cause serious damage to control panels, lenses and other types of displays on peripheral devices.

, This information can typically be found in the operating manual included with documentation that came with the device at the time of purchase.

, These recommendations will vary by product and manufacturer. However, some of the more common examples include the following practices.


Power down or turn off the device when not in use. It is almost always recommended to turn off peripheral devices when not being used. When left on, devices, such as printers and hard drives, will wear out much more quickly.
Protect peripheral devices from moisture and extreme heat. Stacking devices, placing them too close to other devices or heat sources, and storing devices in moist or humid environments can cause significant damage.

, Follow the operating instructions specific to the task the device is being used for. For example, when printing photos from a multi-function printer, confirm that you are using the correct settings and media as recommended by the manufacturer. Likewise, remember to change the settings back before printing regular documents.

, Peripheral devices are designed to work with specific types of media. Attempting to use media other than that recommended by the manufacturer can seriously damage the device and often will void any warranties.

, Device media is easily damaged. Media like memory cards, disks, ink cartridges and paper should be stored in a cool, clean, dry space.

Assess what you use your computer for.,
Decide on a number of cores.,
Research performance.,
Don't bottleneck other components!,
Keep it compatible!",How to Select a CPU," Make note of which applications you use. Do you do any gaming? Do you do video editing? 3D Modeling? Once you have a good idea of what you plan to do with your computer, move to the next step.;
, Most modern microprocessors come with more than a single core. Each core is like its own processor, and they all work together as one processor. Processors with several cores have the capability to run more processes at the same time by splitting workloads among each core. It should be noted that you will only see performance gains from having more cores if you run applications that are optimized to take advantage of extra cores.


Typically if you plan to do things such as 3D modeling or video editing then you will want at least four cores. If you plan on gaming, despite popular belief very few games actually see any benefit from having more than two cores, although there are some games that do see performance improvements when you give them more than two, they are not as common. If you are just web browsing, depending on speed, one core should be fine for you. However, some programs and games require a minimum number of cores to even run, so make sure you choose a CPU that will be able to meet those requirements.

, Many people will tell you that higher clock speeds (measured in GHz) means better performance, but it cannot be stressed enough that GHz alone does not tell you anything about the performance of a microprocessor. Comparing CPU performance with GHz is like comparing the speed of cars with engine RPMs.


You also have to take into account how many actions a CPU can perform per clock cycle. If CPU A runs at 2.0GHz and can perform one action per clock cycle, and CPU B runs at 1.0GHz and can perform two actions per clock cycle, the performance is going to be the same regardless of the difference in clock speeds. Keep in mind that being able to perform more actions per clock cycle is not directly related to the number of cores you have. With that said, it really isn't as simple as comparing a few numbers, and more research is involved than looking at the specifications.
It is recommended that you look online and see what other people report about the performance of the CPU you are considering. There are some great websites that publish benchmarks for different computer hardware, which shows the performance of the CPU under different types of workloads.

, A bottleneck is when one of your components is too fast for another component, and the fast one has to slow down so the slower one can keep up. If you are running a GTX 590 and are ready to play the latest games at maxed settings, ""don't get a cheap CPU!"" If you have a dual-core at 2.0Ghz paired with the most expensive graphics card in the world, your CPU is going to weigh down your GPU, keeping you from playing those games on maxed settings. Be sure to keep your CPU cost and GPU cost close.

, Do not buy an AMD motherboard with an Intel CPU! Make sure the CPU you are buying fits in the type of socket your motherboard has. If you look at the specifications of your motherboard and your processor online, they almost always have the socket type listed.

Open SD Formatter.,
Adjust your formatting options.,
Give the card a name.,
Verify the size.,
Start the format.",How to Format a Memory Card1," While formatting a card erases all the data in the process, it is different than simply selecting all the data and deleting it. Formatting a card sets the file type and optimizes it for use in specific devices. Simply deleting the data often leaves fragments behind which can affect the capacity and performance of the card. It is recommended that you format new cards and old cards that you want to use in new devices instead of just deleting the old files.;
, This is a free tool provided by the SD Association and is the recommended tool for formatting SD, SDHC, and SDXC cards. The program is available for all versions of Windows and Mac OS X. Using this tool will increase the performance of your SD cards as opposed to formatting them with operating system tools.


Read and accept the terms and conditions on the SDCard.org website to start the download.
Only download the SD Formatter tool from SDCard.org.

, If you are using Windows, the installer comes in a ZIP file that will need to be extracted. Double-click the XIP file and then copy the ""Setup"" file to your desktop and then double-click it to run it. If you are using a Mac, simply double-click the PKG file.


You may need to enter the Administrator password in order to proceed with the installation.
Most users can keep the default installation options.

, Insert your SD card into your computer's SD card slot or external SD card reader. The SD card should be automatically recognized by your operating system.


Ensure that the Write Protection lock is switched off. See this guide to fix broken locks.
If you are inserting an SDXC card and a message appears asking you to format it, do NOT accept. If you format the card using the operating system's formatter, the card will no longer be SDXC format.
You may need to download the SDXC driver for Windows Vista or 7. The links to the driver download can be found on the SDCard.org site in the ""About SDXC/microSDXC"" section. Not all SD slots can support SDXC, even with driver updates.

, Formatting your memory card will erase all of the data on it. Make sure that any pictures or other files that are currently stored on the card have been properly backed up to another location if you wish to save them.

, With your card inserted, you can open SD Formatter to begin the formatting process. Select your card from the Drive drop-down menu. If your card is not listed, click the Refresh button.

, Click the Format Options button to set a few basic formatting options. Most users can leave these at their defaults, but you may want to switch the FORMAT TYPE option to FULL (OVERWRITE) if you don't want someone retrieving your old data.


In the Mac OS X version, these options are all selectable from the main window and there is no Format Options button.

, In the Volume Label field, you can enter a name for your SD card that will appear when it is inserted in a computer. This can be useful for organizing data across multiple memory cards, or helping you to remember what that card contains.

, The capacity of the card is displayed in the Size field. The actual capacity of the card is often slightly less than the advertised capacity due to the way storage is calculated and the space that formatting the file system takes up.

, Click the Format button to begin the formatting process. Depending on the format options you selected and the capacity of the card, the formatting process may take a while. You can monitor the progress in the window that appears.


Do not remove the card during the formatting process.

A driver is a piece of software that allows your computer to communicate with the drive. All operating systems are designed to automatically download the required drivers, but if you have no Internet connection, or if the instructions specify to install the driver manually, you should do so.


The driver will generally be included on a CD if manual installation is necessary. Insert the CD and follow the prompts that appear to install the driver.;
, If your USB drive has a power switch or power cord, turn the drive on before attempting to connect it to your computer. Turn on your computer as well.

, Small storage drives will typically have an integrated USB connector, but portable hard drives and other devices may need a cord. Plug the cord into the device to ready it for connecting to your computer.

, USB ports look like small, rectangular openings with 4 metal contacts inside. The ports will have the USB logo next to them, which shows a circle and a 3-pronged arrow. If you plan on using the device on a permanent basis, use a USB port located on the back of your computer. Front ports are a better option for quickly attaching devices and removing them shortly after.

, After deciding on a port to use, simply plug the drive's USB connector or cord into the port. The connector should fit easily and snugly into the port; it will only fit in 1 direction, so flip the connector around if the fit seems wrong.

, If attaching the drive for the first time, your operating system may search for and install the necessary drivers. You will see a prompt after a few seconds that the drivers have been installed and that the device is ready for use. If you already installed drivers manually, you don't need to wait to use the drive.

, After using the device, you need to eject or ""unmount"" it first. In Windows, you can right-click on the drive's icon in Explorer and select ""Eject."" In Mac, drag the drive's icon to the trash bin, which will show an ""eject"" icon while you have the drive selected. After doing this, physically remove the drive by pulling on it gently.

, If there is any plastic piece of the old lock switch still attached or dangling, use nail scissors to gently snip out the remaining piece.

, You will need a thin, clear cellophane tape with a strong adhesive grip. Scotch brand is the most common, but any brand will work as long as it is very adhesive. Make sure that roll is not very wide. 1/2"" is the standard.

, Remove a small piece of tape from your roll. Remove a 1/2"" piece of tape from the roll, creating a 1/2"" x 1/2"" square of tape.

, The tape should be wrapped around both the front and the back of the SD card, creating a level surface along the edge with the lock groove. Make sure to firmly press the tape down so that there are no wrinkles or bubbles.


Ensure that none of the contacts on the back of the SD card are covered by the tape, or the card will not read.
Bumps in the tape or raised edges could cause the SD card to get stuck in the slot.

, Storage unit sizes can range from small storage lockers up to 10 × 30 units. Assess how much space you are going to require and start searching for locations with that size unit available.

, Different storage facilities have different amenities: climate-controlled units, security cameras, gates with access codes, multiple stories. These are some of the things to keep in mind while making your decision.

, Most facilities will have the size unit you are looking for, but it may not be available the time that you need it. Plan ahead and make sure that your unit is available during that time that you are going to be needing it.

, These days, the internet makes it easy for you to comparison shop for units online, allowing you to find the perfect unit to fit your needs. Use a search service online to search for facilities in your area.

, A lot of facilities will offer special discounts for students, veterans, or just for special times of the year. Make sure you do some research to see if you qualify for any of these.

, With the services listed above, you can easily reserve the unit online for free. Nothing will be charged to you for the reservation and as long as you move in on, or before that move-in date, that unit is yours.

, As previously mentioned, that unit is yours before or up until that reservation date, so make sure you claim it by then. Bring your payment with you as this will be the time that you will need to pay some, if not all of the owed price.

, This may be on the same day that you show up to claim your unit, but it doesn’t have to be. Depending on how much stuff you plan on storing, this could be an entire day’s worth of work. These days facilities have drive-up access for you to bring you stuff in your car, truck or moving van, so take advantage of that. Plan accordingly and make sure you read the storing tips to ensure that you place your items in the unit properly.

, After your unit has served its purpose, don’t forget about it. You are not required to do anything post move-out, but don’t abandon your unit while there are still things inside. That is where storage auctions come into play, and if you have ever seen an episode of Storage Wars, you know that people sometimes leave some pretty valuable stuff in their units.

, This will open the Device Manager window.

,, There are three main video card manufacturers that your adapter is almost guaranteed to be using: NVIDIA, AMD/ATI, and Intel.


If you see Intel and NVIDIA, your computer is either switching between them as necessary or you've installed an NVIDIA card on a motherboard with Intel graphics. In either case, you'll be getting the NVIDIA drivers.

, You'll need to know the video card model and model number in order to download the correct drivers. You'll see all of this information after the manufacturer name.


For example, ""NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670"" is made by ""NVIDIA"" and the model line is ""GeForce."" The model number is ""GTX 670.""

, Now that you know the video card information, you'll need to download the driver software from the manufacturer.

, Each manufacturer has a website dedicated to driver downloads for their cards:


NVIDIA
AMD
Intel

, Use the drop-down menus and the model number you noted earlier to find your specific video card. All three websites also have an auto-detect tool that you can run, which will determine your video card. You may need to accept some security warnings when running these tools.


If your video card is older than four or five years, it may no longer be supported by the manufacturer and new drivers may not be available.

, Once you've found the drivers for your card, click the download link or button to begin downloading the installers. Video card driver installers can be fairly large, and may take a while to download.

, After the installer has finished downloading, click it to start installing the drivers. You'll find the installer at the bottom of your browser window, or in the Downloads folder.

, The process is different for each manufacturer, but you can generally leave all of the installation settings at their defaults.


During the installation process, your monitor may flicker or shut off for a moment.

Buy it online!",How to Pick a 3D Card," Most new cards are AGP 8x or PCI-Express. If you don't know, ask your computer's manufacturer.;
, For example, if you're a hardcore gamer, go for top of the line (~$500). If not, you could get almost as much performance for around $300. Since there are many different tests out there for determining which card is best, you'll have to pick one. The results are sometimes conflicting, and some people take issue with certain methodologies.

, If you're completely sure about which card you want, get it online! Shop based on features and GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) , not brand name. Two cards with exactly the same feature set and GPU (for example, the nVidia 7800 GT) can vary in price by over $50. The website referenced in step 2 has some pricing information as well, but shop around. Make sure you're buying from a reputable vendor.

Set the torrent's bandwidth allocation to high.",How to Speed up Torrents," Some of the more popular BitTorrent clients have become bloated with extra features and ads. Installing a lightweight client that just focuses on downloading torrents may help speed up your transfers.


One of the most popular free torrent clients is qBittorrent. This is a very light torrent client that is not ad-supported, and can be downloaded from qbittorrent.org.;
, This will enable the torrent client to automatically open the ports necessary to make connections to other users. Most modern routers support UPnP.


Open the Options or Preferences menu in your torrent client.
Select the ""Connection"" options.
Check the ""Use UPnP"" box and click Apply.
You may need to enable UPnP for your router if it has been disabled. Open your router's configuration page and open the Advanced section. You should be able to check a box to toggle UPnP on.

, Torrents survive on users uploading, so you don't want to turn uploading off completely, but you don't want to max out your connection. Capping your upload rate will keep your upload connection from maxing out, which can drag down all of your other internet traffic. Set your maximum upload speed to 80% of your upload rate to prevent it from choking your connection.


Open the Options or Preferences menu for your torrent client.
Click the ""Speed"" or ""Bandwidth"" option.
Set your upload rate limit to about 80% of your maximum upload rate. For example, if you have a 1Mb/s (125kB/s) upload speed, set your upload speed to 100kB/s.
While you're in this section, make sure that your Download rate is set to ""0"" (unlimited) or that the download rate limit is disabled.

, Windows XP includes security patches designed to reduce the spread of viruses. Unfortunately, this patch also limits the number of connection you can have at once, which can have a massive impact on your torrent download speed. Download and install a TCP patch to fix the problem. Note that this problem is no longer present in newer versions of Windows.Download the patch from here. Note that some antivirus programs will report this as a virus, but this is a false-positive since it employs some of the same techniques a virus would to modify your network settings.
Double-click the downloaded folder and drag the other .zip file to your desktop.
Double-click the new .zip file and enter abc as the password. Drag the files inside to your desktop.
Run the EvID4226Patch program and type Y at the command prompt. This will increase the number of open connections from 10 to 50.
Open the Advanced section of your torrent client's Settings or Preferences menu. Set the ""Maximum number of half-open connections"" or ""net.max_halfopen"" to ""50"".

, You can set how many users can be connected to you. Limiting the number of users that can connect to you will help prevent your connection from being overloaded. You may have to experiment with these settings, as they will have different effects for different users.


Open the ""Connections"" or ""Bandwidth"" section of the Options or Preferences menu.

,


Set your ""Global maximum connections"" to 150.
Set the ""Maximum connections per torrent"" to 100.
Set the ""Upload slots per torrent"" to 3-5. This will limit the number of people that can connect to you, but still keep you in good sharing standing.

, Windows Firewall may be blocking your torrent client, which can prevent you from connecting to other users.


Open the Start menu and type windows firewall. Select ""Windows Firewall"" from the list of results.
Click the ""Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall"" link. This can be found on the left side of the window. If you're using Windows XP, click the ""Exceptions"" tab.
Click the Change settings button at the top of the list, then scroll down to find your torrent client.
Check the boxes for Private and Public, then click OK.

, Many internet service providers (ISPs) will throttle BitTorrent traffic, because they view it as a strain on their network and potentially illegal. Most BitTorrent clients allow you enable protocol encryption, which masks the traffic to your ISP. This can help prevent them from throttling your connections.You can find the encryption settings in the ""BitTorrent"" section of the BitTorrent client's Options or Preferences menu.
When you force encrypted connections, you'll only be able to connect with other encrypted users. If the torrent doesn't have many seeds, this could actually slow you transfers down.
Encryption will not protect you from the potential legal repercussions of downloading illegal content. In order to download anonymously, you'll need to use a VPN. This may slow down your transfers.

, Seeders are users who are sharing part or all of the torrent. The more seeders a torrent has, the more users that you can connect to to download the file. The download speed you get is dependent on the combined upload speed of all the users you are connected to.


All torrent tracker sites list the number of Seeders and Leechers/Peers that each torrent has. Leechers/peers are users that are downloading without sharing the entire file. If the number of leechers or peers is way higher than the number of seeders, you'll likely experience slower speeds since there aren't enough connections to go around.

Only download programs directly from the developer. If you download the program from another location, you risk malware or adware infection.;
, You can usually leave most of the default options as they are. Some programs, such as ImgBurn, come bundled with lots of ad software that need to be disabled during installation, so make sure that you carefully read each screen before continuing.

, Copying a disc to ISO format is called ""ripping"", and allows you to create perfect backups of any disc in single files. Make sure your drive supports the disc you want to rip. For example, you cannot rip a Blu-ray disc in a DVD drive, but you can rip a DVD disc in a Blu Ray drive.

, Find the ""Create Image from Disc"" button. The wording may change depending on the program you are using. For example, it may say ""Copy to Image"". There is often an image of a disc in the button icon to signify that the ISO is coming from the disc's data.


You may be asked to designate the source. Make sure the proper disc drive is selected.

, You will need to save the file somewhere on your computer while it is being created. Keep in mind that the ISO file will be the exact same size as the original disc, so make sure that your hard disk has enough space to store it. This is especially important with BDs, as they can reach sizes up to 50 GB.


Make sure to give it a name that you can remember or recognize easily.

, Once you've set where the file is to be saved, the ripping process will begin. This can take a significant amount of time, especially with BDs. Once the process is complete, the ISO file will be in the location you specified earlier, and can now be burned or mounted.

, The role of the adapter is essentially to connect the VHS player to your computer or laptop. One end will have A/V cables (the red, yellow, and white cables used to connect the VHS player to a TV) and the other end will have a USB port, typically.

, If your device comes with an installation disc, insert the disc and follow the instructions.


Alternatively, you can download and install any number of freeware applications that may offer more versatility. This is a good option if you acquired a used adapter that didn't come with software.

, Insert the VHS tape and fast-forward (or rewind) to the portion of video you'd like to record. Generally, you'll be asked to ""Start a New File."" Name it something (""Video Project 1"") and select your format from the file menu.


If you're using the open-source software, you'll also have to select your device from an accompanying list of capture devices.
Try playing the VHS tape at this point. You should be able to see it in a pop-up window for the software you've installed. Check the audio levels and frame rate, making any adjustments for playback quality. Then return to the portion of video you'd like to record.

, Make sure the software is in capture mode before you start playing the video or you'll miss the first few seconds of the tape in your recording. This process will vary slightly depending on the software you've installed, but regardless you'll have to wait for the video to finish playing before moving on to convert the file to a DVD.

, If you want to edit the video at this point, you can open it in iMovie or a freeware program like VirtualDub and trim out any unwanted parts.


Make sure that the audio and video are in sync. If they are not, you can adjust the audio skew by selecting ""Interleaving..."" from the audio menu and entering a positive or negative number for the audio delay. When figuring out how much to delay the audio, it is helpful to select ""Audio display"" from the view menu.
After trimming the video and/or adjusting the audio timing, you can quickly save the edited video by selecting ""Direct stream copy"" under both the Video and Audio menus, then saving the file as a new AVI.

A new combo player will probably run between $100-$200, but will probably be available for cheaper on eBay or craigslist.
Alternatively, you can connect a separate VHS player to a DVD player with recording capabilities. For this, you'll need a regular set of two-directional Audio-Visual cables. Plug the outputs from the VHS player into the inputs from the DVD player and follow the rest of the instructions as if you were using a combo player.

, Depending on the quality of your VHS tapes, this can be either an over-cautious step or a necessary one. If you're working with old irreplaceable family tapes or extremely dirty tapes you'll want to make sure that you're not going to ruin them by running them through the player.


Roll the protective tab back to reveal the magnetic tape. Forward the tape by turning the spindles and wiping the tape with a soft cloth or piece of cotton.
If the tape is wrinkled or twisted, gently smooth it with the cloth. Turn the spindles the other way to run the tape out if it's severely twisted. Be very careful.

, Check the player's specifications about DVD formats, whether or not it will write over DVD-R discs or DVD-RW and make sure you've got the right kind of disc for your player.

, This process will vary depending upon your machine, but typically you'll need to press play on the VHS controls and hit record on the DVD controls. Often, though, there will be a single ""record"" button that engages the transfer process automatically.

This offers less control over editing and care of the tapes, but requires little on your part other than delivery. It's also a good way to convert more obscure formats like 8mm film or Betamax.


Walgreens, Costco, Walmart, imemories.com, Southtree, Target, CVS, and Sam's Club all offer this service for somewhere between $10 and $30 dollars a disc. Typically a single disc will hold two hours of VHS tape., If you want all of your daughter's VHS birthday tapes on one disc and your son's on another, make a note of this and include it with the package. Make sure all tapes are clearly labeled and that you have already made a copy of important tapes. Also be sure to make the staff aware of any fragility or damage on the tapes.


Depending on where you drop the tapes off, there may be other custom editing options available.

, This is a great option for people with a small amount of personal material to transfer, avoiding the separate costs of blank discs, hardware, and software. There are also online services available that offer the same transfer options, though you'll have to ship the VHS tapes, which could be costly.

",How to Email Your Crush (for Girls)," Make it cute-first impressions do count! Try not to do anything boring such as ""hi"". Something cute or enthusiastic ""Hey, what's up?"" is better.
, That's the boy's job. Most boys will do enough bragging or whining about their lives for both of you. They do seem to enjoy it, somehow, so try to encourage it. For example, if they play basketball, say, ""Hey, I really liked that three-pointer you made last night."" or something like that. Don't make it all about them, however. That just gets them started, and it gets really annoying., It's okay to act flirty, most boys like it. Say, ""I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow!"" rather than ""See you tomorrow."" Go for the gusto., After you ask them a question or compliment about sports, or whatever hobby they have, connect it with yourself. For example: ""I really liked that three-pointer you made the other day. By the way, I've got a baseball game next Saturday, at Example Park. You can come if you want--it's at 4:30."", ""Can't wait to see ya tomorrow!"","
,How to Email Teachers1,
"
Write a clear subject line.,
Address your teacher formally.,
Use proper English.,
Be straightforward.,
End the email.",How to Email Teachers2," Your teacher may receive many emails each day, so it's important to be clear about who you are and why you're sending the message. Include your name. Include the name of the class, especially if your teacher runs multiple classes. If you are emailing about a specific assignment, write the title of that assignment.Check the course syllabus: the teacher may have already suggested an email subject format that he/she prefers.


The subject line might be: ""Russian History Research Paper"" or ""Calculus advice."" Use your name along with a contextual identifier, such as, ""Billy Jones (6th period chemistry class).""
If you are in a very large class—say, a college lecture in which the professor doesn't know you personally—then write the name of the class. For clarity, you may even include the title of the assignment or project that you're emailing about.

, Start with ""Dear Mr. Smith"", ""Hello Mr. Smith,"" or just ""Mr. Smith,"". Feel free to be a bit more casual if you know your teacher especially well. Nonetheless, try to err on the side of formality.Do not simply begin with ""Hey,"" or ""Hello."" Most formal emails begin by respectfully acknowledging the name of the recipient. Do not call your teacher by his or her first name unless he/she has asked you to do so.This formality still applies if you are a parent emailing a teacher on the behalf of your child. As an adult, the teacher may be your peer. In a school context, however, you should still treat the teacher with the respect that he or she is used to.

, Make sure that your message is well-written and grammatically correct. It's important to make a good impression, especially if you're asking for a favor. You might get a bit more casual with your language if you're on good terms with the teacher. If things are tense, you should use a formal tone.


Do not use emojis or chat acronyms in your message. Err on the side of formality, even if your teacher is laid-back and casual – and even if your teacher uses emojis herself!

, Make your email quick and to-the-point. Don't waste your teacher's time. Begin by explaining why you're sending the email. Ask any questions that you need to ask. Keep your message to five sentences or fewer, unless you have a very detailed question.The first line of your email (after ""Dear Mr. So-and-So,"") might be: I'm emailing to ask you about the homework that you assigned for this Monday. It might be, ""I was hoping to ask for an extension on the big research paper."" If you are emailing on the behalf of your child, then the first line might be, ""I am Billy's mother, and I'd like to talk about his grade in your English class for this past semester.""
If you are asking for a favor or a letter or recommendation, then you may want to flatter the teacher a bit. Play up the positive aspects of your relationship with a given teacher. However, if you are apologizing or trying to recover from a mistake, you should probably keep your tone respectful and to-the-point.

, Thank your teacher for reading the email, and sign your name in a formal way. Preface your name with ""Thank you,"" ""Regards,"" ""Your Student,"" ""Best,"" ""Much obliged,"" or another traditional and respectful closing. Write your name on the line below the closing words. For instance: Thank you. Sincerely, Kevin Baker.

Find your teacher's email.,
Send the email.,
Be patient.",How to Email Teachers3," Send your message to the teacher's professional, school-issued email account, unless he/she has provided you with a personal address. Your teacher may have given you an email address in the course syllabus. If not, you'll need to track it down yourself. If your school has a website, check the ""Faculty"" page or the contact page for the teacher's particular department. Consider simply asking your teacher for his/her email!


If you can't ask in person, and you can't find the email on the school website: try asking around. One of your friends or classmates might know. Ask the school secretary, or other teachers, or even parents.
Deduce the email address. School-issued email addresses often follow a pattern: for instance, @yourschool.edu, or just @yourschool.org. If you know that Mr. Blumpton's email address is mblumpton@yourschool.org, then it might be safe to assume that Mrs. Audrey Pratt's email address is apratt@yourschool.org.

, Make sure that the address is entered correctly. Check that you've said everything that you need to say. Consider running a spell-check before you click ""Send."" Once you have sent the email, check the ""Sent"" box to be sure that the message went through., Teachers are often busy people, and you should not expect an immediate response. If your concern is very complicated, or not very urgent, then you might be waiting for a few days. It might take your teacher longer to respond if you send your email over the weekend or during a holiday.


Try to figure it out on your own. If you're emailing your teacher with a question about the course material, look for another source. Refer to the Internet, a textbook, a library, or a classmate.
Send a follow-up email if you have an urgent question that you can't otherwise resolve. Be brief and polite. Acknowledge the first email, explain why you need to know the answer as soon as possible, and say, ""I just wanted to check back with you in case you didn't get my first email!"" Do not send more than one follow-up email.

Open the file in a mail client.,
Change the extension to view it in a browser.,
Download and install FreeViewer EML File Viewer.,
View the file as plain-text.,
EML files are not opening in Outlook Express, even though it is installed.,
Check the extension.",How to Open EML Files1," EML files are essentially emails in file form. The easiest way to open them is to use an email client such as Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows Live Mail, or Thunderbird. For most newer versions of these programs, EML files should be automatically registered so that double-clicking the file opens it.


When you open the EML file in an email client, you will be able to download any attachments that are included in the file, as well as view the proper formatting and pictures.
If you don't have an email client, or can't open the files in your email client, read on.;
, EML files are very similar to MHTML, and changing the file extension to *.mht will quickly convert it into a format that can be opened in Internet Explorer. While other web browsers can open MHT files, Internet Explorer is the only one which will format them correctly. This method won't allow you to download any attachments.


Enable file extensions if you have them hidden. In Windows 8, you can check the ""File name extensions"" box in the View tab of any Explorer window. In older versions of Windows, open the Control Panel and select Folder Options. Click the View tab and uncheck ""Hide extensions for known file types"".
Right-click on the EML file and select ""Rename"".
Delete the .eml extension and replace it with .mht. Windows will warn you that this could cause problems with the file. Confirm that you want to change the extension.
Open the file in Internet Explorer. This will usually be the default program for MHT files. You can right-click the file, select ""Open with"", and then choose Internet Explorer from the list. Internet Explorer will display the MHT file in virtually the same format as the EML file would appear in a mail client.

, Available for free from the developer site. http://www.freeviewer.org/eml/


Now browse to the folder where your EML files are located.
Double Click on that folder. Now all EML Files will get populated in order. At this point you can click on any EML message to view them.
You can also view any associated attachments of that email.

, If you can't open the file in an email client and can't convert it to open in Internet Explorer, you can view the file as a plain-text file. There will be a lot of nonsense characters, but you'll still be able to see the body of the message, as well as any links. You won't be able to see any images or attachments.


Right-click on the EML file and select ""Open with"".
Select Notepad from the list of programs.
Find the <html> and <body> tags. These signify the start of the email message. You can find the content of the email message in this section, though you may have sift through some HTML code.
Find the <a href= tags to find links. You can copy and paste the URL displayed here into a web browser to visit the links included in the EML file.

, This is usually caused because another program has hijacked the EML extension. You'll need to reset the file associations for Outlook Express.


Close Outlook Express if it is open.Press ⊞ Win+R.
Type msimn /reg and press ↵ Enter. This will reset the file associations for Outlook Express. EML files should now open in Express automatically when double-clicked.

, Some users have reported that backups created with Windows Live Mail have corrupted EML extensions (*._eml instead of *.eml). If the EML file isn't opening, check that the extension is not messed up.See Step 2 in the section above to enable file extensions if you have them hidden.
Rename any EML file that has the *._eml extension to remove the _.

Attach the receipt to your email.,
Send the email.",How to Email Receipts to Expensify," Compose a new message using any webmail or email client application you have, and address it to receipts@expensify.com.;
, You need to write the correct information regarding the receipts you’re about to send:


If you’re sending multiple receipts with different types, specify in the subject line of your email any common information that can be used to classify those receipts as one.

For example, if you’re sending plane tickets, and taxi and hotel receipts from your trip or vacation, put in the subject line “Vacation Receipts” to put these documents into one group of expense.


If you want to create a new expense on your account, enter in the subject line the amount of the receipt followed by a short description.

For example, if you want to create a new expense for the $500 credit card receipt you’re about to send, put in the subject line: “$500 – Credit Card.” The next time you send a credit card receipt, all you need to do is to take a picture of it and email it to Expensify.



, Expensify needs the proof of purchase (receipt) before it can add the expense. Attach the receipts you want to add to your expense to your email. You can simply take a picture of the receipt and attach it to the message. File formats that you can send to Expensify are as follows:


Picture files that have the JPEG, GIF, PNG, or PDF formats
Text or HTML email files (email receipts that are sent to your email account when you purchase something online)
Document files that have the DOC or Rich Text File formats

, Click the “Send” button of your email application to send the email with the receipts attached. Expensify will add the receipts to your account and expense reports.

Download apps that may help.",How to Organize Emails," Organizing your emails means finally making a decision about all of those emails you’ve been unwilling or unable to act on. To make this process simple, give yourself only two options: file or delete. You’ll need a method of criteria to determine which emails you will save and which you’ll ultimately delete. Keeping in mind your primary goal will help with this.


If your primary goal is to have an empty inbox each evening, you’ll need to create file folders that correspond with your important emails and you’ll need to be open to deleting a lot of emails.
To develop your criteria ask yourself this: Have you already taken action on the email? Is there any important information in the email that you need to keep for your records? How old is the email? Is the email still relevant somehow?
Generally, most emails older than 30 days should be tossed.Exceptions would be emails with critical information, such as correspondence between you and a supervisor or receipts. Most emails dated within the past 30 days may be kept because you still may need to act on these newer emails; or they may contain relevant information you need to keep.;
, The process of creating a library of folders will be unique to your email provider. However, there is a general way to create folders that can easily be applied to any email provider, such as Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, Outlook and iCloud.


Once logged in to your email account, look along the top of your inbox or along the panel on the left side for an option to add a new folder. You may have to click a “Folders” tab to open up a dropdown menu or scroll down along the left-side panel to find this option. Once you find and click the option to add a new folder, a new window will appear allowing you to type in the name of your new folder. When you’ve named your folder, press “Enter” or click “Create” or “Add,” to finalize your new folder.
If you have years’ worth of emails, first create sweep folders to jumpstart and simplify your organizing efforts. Sweep folders allow you to “sweep away” large batches of emails at once. It makes more sense to do this by categorizing your emails by time. Create new folders and label them by year, quarter or month, whichever works best for you. You don’t need a folder for the current time period because your inbox will act as that folder.For the emails you currently receive and wish to save, create folders to arrange them into separate categories. If you’re organizing your personal email, your general categories could be: Monthly bills, Children’s school or daycare, Deals, and Important. If you’re organizing work email, some suggested folders are: Meetings, Accounts, Invoices, Customer Service, and Important. If your emails are difficult to narrow down, simply label a few files: Very Important, Important, and Not Very Important.

, You can create folders within folders. This may be necessary if you receive tons of emails that can’t be adequately organized into basic categories. For example, if your personal email has a folder labeled Receipts, you may need a sub-folder to separate school-related expenses, household expenses, and entertainment receipts. The process for creating a sub-folder should not be much different from creating a folder. Repeat the process of adding a new folder, but look for an option to place the folder within an already existing folder.

, Once your new folders have been created, they should appear in the “Folders” panel located on the left side of your inbox or under the “Folders” tab along the top of your inbox. Locate their placement, so that once you tag or file your emails, you’ll know where to find them. You can navigate between your inbox and folders by clicking “Inbox” to view items in your inbox and then clicking a folder name to access that particular folder.

, Before beginning the process of clearing out your inbox, sweep away a bulk of your “old” emails to narrow the focus of your organizational efforts to your current emails.


To isolate emails by date, you’ll need to perform an advanced search of your inbox. Look near the right edge of the search bar for a down arrow and click it.
If your email program is Outlook, you will likely have to put your cursor in the box by clicking the search box. Now look for a link that specifies “advanced search” or “search options.” Click it to select your search options.
Locate the option to search by date and fill in the date range you’d prefer. You can choose to isolate emails within a certain date range, before or after a certain date, or emails sent on a particular day.
The emails left in your inbox will be the primary focus of your organization efforts today. You will eventually tackle older emails following the same methods detailed here, but to make this a simple and quick process we’ll focus on current emails. Some older emails may get deleted or moved to a folder if they come up in search results during the clearing out process.

, This will keep many of the emails you soon delete from returning. Notifications and/or from sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ are candidates for this, as well as promotions from stores you no longer visit.


To unsubscribe from an email, open the email by clicking on it. Scroll to the bottom and look for a row of links that are gray colored and underlined.
Click the “Unsubscribe” link. The link will open a new page, which will either notify you that your request has been granted or require you to take additional steps to confirm your intention to unsubscribe.

, Spam messages are essentially junk mail, unsolicited messages that people send out to coerce you to give them your personal information or get you to click on a link that may upload malware onto your computer. If some of these messages made it into your inbox, it’s important to weed them out.


If you find an email in your inbox that you think is clearly spam, click “Report spam” at the top of the page instead of trying to unsubscribe. This will move the email automatically into your spam folder. Do a quick search by typing in the sender’s email address to see if any other spam messages made it into your inbox and need to be reported.
Emails identified or reported as spam are placed in a separate folder labeled Spam or Junk. To clear out your entire spam folder select all of the messages, either by clicking the checkbox above the first email or clicking a link that says “Check all,” then click “Delete.” Depending on your email provider you may also see a link that says “Delete all messages.”

, Typically anything over 30 days that you haven’t done anything with and/or doesn’t have any important information you need can be deleted. This may be somewhat time-consuming because you’ll have to sift through your inbox slowly and get rid of the emails individually that meet this criteria. However, you can do this quickly and simply by deleting several related emails at once.


You can isolate several emails at once by typing the name of the sender in the search bar. Look near the right edge of the search bar for a drop-down button and click it. If your email program is Outlook, you will likely have to put your cursor in the box, as if you going to type something, by clicking the search box.
Click the link for “advanced search” options to specify your search method. Select the option to search by sender only. For best results, copy and paste the sender’s email address. This will isolate emails that are an exact match.
Depending on which email program you use, click the option to select all, and then click “delete.”
This isolation method will work well to delete the emails from senders you’ve unsubscribed from.

, Emails you may want to hold on to, include unread messages you’ve yet to take action on, promotional emails you enjoy receiving, records of recent purchases, or correspondence about a significant matter. Knowing where each message should go shouldn’t be difficult since you’ve already created your new folders.


The process of moving a message from your inbox to a folder is not the same for all email providers, but this same basic process can apply to most.
Select the message you’d like to move by either clicking the checkbox next to it or by clicking the message directly.
Then look along the panel on the left side of your inbox, or along the ribbon at the top of your inbox; you should see a tab for “Folders” or a tab that says “Move to.” Click it, and then select from the dropdown box the name of the folder you’d like send the message to.

, Moving emails to new folders one by one can be a daunting task. You can simplify the process by isolating several related emails to send to a folder at once.


If you’ve received several emails from the same sender, you can type the sender’s name in the search box to show only those particular emails. If you want to move all of your emailed receipts to a particular folder, do a general search for the word “receipt” to show all of the messages containing that term. Or if you want to save promotional emails from your favorite store, type the name of the store into the search box, and click search.
Once the related messages are separated from the rest of your inbox, you can click the checkbox or link to “Select all,” click the tab “Move to,” and then click on the name of the folder you’d like the messages to occupy.
If you can’t isolate related emails in a search, scroll through your inbox and select the related emails individually. Click on the checkbox of each message to select it. If there is no checkbox next to the message, click on the first message you’d like to select in order to highlight it. To select additional messages, click on them while simultaneously holding down the Control button (if you’re on a Windows computer) or the Command button (if you’re on a Mac).

, If you’ve filed away emails you’ve already handled but needed to keep, and deleted emails that were no longer important, you should be left with emails that are less than 30 days old and still deserve a response or action on your part. If your goal for organizing your inbox is to have an empty inbox, go ahead and respond or act on those emails, and then file or delete them. If you’re fine with having emails left in your inbox, let the emails sit. But make sure you respond to them in a timely manner, which should be within 30 days of their receipt.

, If you struggle to keep up with your messages from several email addresses, merging those email addresses could be the best option for you. You won’t have to update accounts with the new address or tell friends, family or clients about the change. While you’ll no longer log in to the old email address, it will still be active, and your messages will simply be routed to the address you’d prefer to use.Most email providers will allow you to add up to five separate email accounts. If you have more than five, you can have emails from your old email address forwarded to the preferred address.
This basic process for consolidating separate email addresses can be applied to most email providers. Click “Settings,” click “Accounts,” then click “Add Account.” Type in the email address you’d like to consolidate to your account, and then click “Next.”
Your email provider will process your information and then automatically fill in the remaining information it needs. Type in your password, and then click “Next” or “Add” to connect your email address.
If it’s successful, you’re all done. If not, you may be asked to try again following the instructions on the screen, or you might have to try to manually connect your email address.
Unfortunately, iCloud mail does not allow for you to consolidate 3rd party email addresses.

, Keeping your inbox orderly can easily becoming a time-consuming process if your inbox fills up quickly. Creating filters for incoming messages will automate organizing efforts, helping you to maintain an organized inbox and freeing up your time for more important tasks. The process for setting up filters or rules will differ depending on which email provider you use.

, A smaller window will appear, allowing you to enter the specific search criteria for the email you want to filter.


Let’s say you want to filter notifications from Netflix, type “Netflix” or copy and paste Netflix’s email address in the corresponding box. Then select the action(s) you want the filter to take. Do you want Gmail to automatically archive and label your messages from Netflix? If so, select “Skip the Inbox (Archive it)” and “Apply the label. Then click the “Create filter” button.
You can also filter particular emails by accessing the email directly. Continuing with Netflix emails as an example, select an old Netflix email, click “More,” and then click “Filter messages like these.” The filter criteria window will open again, allowing you to fill in the appropriate information.

, You can create rules to automatically send incoming emails to a particular folder or to perform an action, like deleting certain messages.


To create a new rule, open the Microsoft Outlook program, click the “File” tab, and then click “Manage Rules & Alerts.” A Rules Wizard window will appear to guide you in creating your new rule.
Select the conditions you want the email to meet in order for the rule to apply, or the actions you want Outlook to take towards the email, then click “Create Rule” when you’re finished.

, To create a filter in Yahoo Mail, select “Options” from the toolbar above, and then click “Mail options.” Under the “Filters” category, click the “Add” button to create a new filter.


You can label the filter by typing what you’d prefer in the box for ""Filter Name,"" then enter the desired sender’s e-mail address under ""Sender: Contains.” Do not check the ""Sender match case"" box, which would make Yahoo Mail generally apply the filter.
You can select (or create, if needed) the folder you want the message to be automatically sent to by selecting “Then deliver the e-mail to the following folder.” When you’re finished, click “Save.”

,


To create a new rule, select “Mail,” then “Preferences,” and then “Rules.” Click “Add Rule, and then create a name for the rule. Select whether one or all of the conditions must be met for the rule to be applied to the message. Choose the conditions you want the rule to have, then specify the actions you want iCloud to take on messages that meet those conditions.
Add additional actions by clicking “Add” or the plus sign (+). To apply rules to messages, select the message, click “Message,” and then click “Apply Rules.”

, You may have already set up systems to route emails to archive, file, or delete certain emails, but you still have to take action on archived or filed messages or messages that may not fit the filters or rules you’ve created.Determine to maintain your primary goal. If your goal was to have an empty inbox or at least see the bottom of your inbox, try to each achieve it weekly.
Pick a day each week to go through your inbox and clean it out.
Take action immediately. If an email is time-sensitive or urgent, it goes without saying that it deserves your response and attention quickly. Make it a habit to treat non-time-sensitive emails the same. Either immediately respond or take action, or plan to within the next day or two.
Quickly rid yourself of emails that don’t require action. Set a time each day to do an overview of your new messages. Delete those that are unimportant or that don’t require a response.
Choose one day a week to file away emails that need to be kept. This depends on how many emails you receive daily. If things can get out of hand within a few days, then you may want to make it a habit at the end of each day to file emails.

, There are several email apps and online tools available to help you maintain an organized inbox. If you feel you need more automated help, perform a search online for an app or tool that’s compatible with your email provider and/or smartphone.

Follow e-mail etiquette.,
Don't think you are anonymous.,
Avoid sending e-mail to the wrong person.,
Don't use one e-mail address for everything.,
Remember to check all of your e-mail accounts.,
Don't click ""Send"" too fast.,
Set a timer.,
Remember the attachment.,
Use your own domain name.,
Assuming someone else hasn't already grabbed it, you can have your company in the domain name.

",How to Manage Your Email Professionally," Consider the old adage, ""You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."" There's no point in belaboring the etiquette issue. We all know we should be polite. But here are a few points to consider:


Don't write when you're angry--wait 24 hours and calm down. Be reasonable.
Have someone else edit your e-mail.
Don't use sarcasm. You may think you're clever, but the recipient will be put off.
DON'T USE ALL UPPERCASE! That's the e-mail equivalent of yelling, and your recipient won't be appreciative.






Go easy on the exclamation marks, too. Overuse dulls their effectiveness.






Use clear subject lines. That will help people decide whether to read the e-mail now or later. We're all busy. Your correspondent will appreciate your thoughtfulness.






Keep it short. If your e-mail is more than two paragraphs, maybe you should use the telephone.






Change the subject line if you change the topic of a thread.






Unless the recipient has previously agreed, don't forward poems, jokes, virus warnings and other things. You're just wasting valuable time and bandwidth.





;
, If you are sending nasty missives, you might think no one will be able to figure out that the e-mail came from you. After all, you set up a phony web address. Think again. E-mail contains invisible information about the sender. That information is in the header. All major e-mail programs can display header information. Here's how:

In Microsoft Outlook, double click the e-mail. Then click View > Options. In Microsoft Outlook Express, click the e-mail. Then click File > Properties and select the Details tab.






In Eudora, double click the message. Then click the Blah Blah button.
In Netscape, click the message to open it. Then click View > Message Source to display the header.
The sender's revealing information is in the sections that begin with ""Received:."" There may be several of these, depending on the number of computers the e-mail traversed. The originating computer is in the bottom ""Received:."" That section will have an Internet Protocol (IP) number, such as 124.213.45.11. It can be traced on a number of Web sites.







, Today's e-mail programs want to make it easy to send e-mail. This means that when you start typing the address of a recipient to whom you have previously sent mail, the ""To:"" field may already be populated. Be careful. Always double-check the recipient is the intended one. In addition, if you're writing something ugly about Joe Smith, you'll have Joe's name on your mind. Don't send it to him.

, Have several e-mail addresses--for private use, public use, for online mailing lists, and for shopping online. Most providers will give you a half-dozen e-mail accounts. You can also use addresses on the Web for personal accounts. Both Gmail and Yahoo! are good. You can reach those accounts from anywhere, assuming you have Web access.

, Checking all these accounts can be a chore, especially from home. To cut down on time, you can use ePrompter (www.eprompter.com), which can check 16 different password- protected accounts. Best of all, ePrompter is free. There are other programs that will do this for a fee, including Active Email Monitor (www.emailmon.com).

, Reread every e-mail before you send it! Even if you're not looking for a job, you want to be careful. People will judge you subconsciously on mistakes. None of us are perfect. But you can catch 99% of these problems by rereading the text. And don't depend on the spell-checker. It will catch misspellings. But if you use ""four"" instead of ""for,"" or ""your"" for ""you're,"" it won't tell you. It also is not likely to catch any missing words in a sentence that you inadvertently failed to include. So take a minute and reread your text. Don't look like an ignoramus.

, You can do that in Outlook by adding a rule that delays sending, preferably by 1-5 minutes, during which the email is in your outbox and can be deleted. This prevents you from hitting the wrong button and accidentally sending a half-finished mail, as well as giving you one minute to gather your bearings and delete that litany of florid insults you've typed up in your fury before it makes it to the boss.

, Since we all do it occasionally, it shouldn't be a huge deal. However, if you consistently make this mistake, people (perhaps important people) may think you're losing your marbles. They might even hesitate to do business with you in the future. When you get ready to send your e-mail, think: ""What am I forgetting?""

, Make your company look big. If you use a Web account or an ISP's name for your business, you're not going to look professional.

Use Web forms on your Web site or blog. Set them up to allow a person to request information and require their email address for delivery.
For each email address you collect, keep records showing time, date and collection method. If you're ever reported for SPAM, those records are the proof that can prevent you from getting a fine.;
, There are many autoresponder email delivery options available. Some of their services include:


Double opt-in methods that can legally protect your business. Double opt-ins prove you received permission not once, but twice to send commercial email to each person on your list.
Opt-out features enable consumers to remove themselves from your mailing list without your intervention and keep you in compliance.
Customizable email templates can match the look and feel of your business.
Fully automated campaigns can be created well in advance of actual promotions.
Highly targeted customer profiles coupled with intuitive programming can automatically move a person from one campaign to another.
Enhanced tracking enables the user to view opt-ins, check delivery stats and track each person's progress through assorted marketing campaigns.
Split testing allows you to try different messages for effectiveness so you can tweak your campaign.
Autoresponder platforms offer management capability over multiple campaigns in different stages at once.

,


Choose your promotion. Are you launching a new product? Discounting your services to new customers?
Select a time frame and set quantitative tracking goals for success. What do you want to achieve? During what time period?
Outline how many emails you will send out and when. Timing can be important. Do you want people to receive your messages at the start of their workday when they're fresh? Shortly before they go home? On a particular holiday?

,


Create messages with mobile Web users in mind. Keep the message brief, with no more than 60 characters per line.
Be sure every commercial message contains the information required by law, such as sender contact address and opt-out instructions.
If using an automated delivery service, create every message in both plain text and HTML. The service will bundle the messages, and the recipient's email settings will determine which one to display. (Note: If sending messages manually through a program like Outlook, send only one. Bundling does not occur in all email programs, and sending both plain text and HTML can result in the receipt of dual emails.)

, Make frequent comparisons to the goals you set when developing your campaign. (Are you meeting your target sales quotas? Generating the expected percentage of new clientele?) Be willing to make adjustments if necessary. Take detailed notes, and you'll know how to use email marketing to greater advantage in future campaigns.

Debrief.",How to Not Be Afraid of Receiving Abusive E Mails," When you provide an email address, you are saying to the world/your classmate/that guy you just met on the bus, that it is OK to contact you. This might be the very step you should stop at if you don't know what the outcome of giving out your email might be. It can be especially problematic when you join a social media networking site or a forum, where any person online can access your email and follow up things that you have said ""privately"", so to speak. If the potential for that bothers you even just to think about it, draw your line and don't give your email address.;
, Sometimes, no matter how much you aim to prevent a nasty email occurrence, someone will get one through to you, for reasons of their own. It might be someone you thought you could trust, in which case, their sudden change in behavior will be shockingly surprising. Leaving that aside, however, don't expect your email in-box to be pure for all time. If you are aware of the possibility of an e-nasty occasionally, you are least ready for it.

, Nasty, abusive emails are unpleasant and can spoil things for a time. How you respond though is what makes the difference between coping with it, or making a mountain out of a molehill. The only time that you should truly worry is if it is threatening in a way that makes you feel worried (for example, if someone says they have your address and they're coming to ""get you""). In that case, hand it over to the police immediately. Generally though, most nasty and abusive emails are a case of venting, jealousy, poor restraint on behalf of the sender, anger-in-the-moment, and arrogance. None of those emotions are worth your time of day. Here are some response methods to adopt:


Ignore the message. Nothing fuels a fire more than pressing reply. Just don't and let it extinguish.
Reply in a short manner only. Say something like ""Your inappropriate language has been noted and will be reported to XYZ.""
Engage them. If you're willing and wanting to discuss the situation further, and you don't mind the potential for a little more abuse before things settle somewhat, say something like: ""I'm sorry you feel that way. I didn't mean to provoke such a feeling of ill-will. When you're feeling better, perhaps we can talk this through.""

, The most outraged people in life are those who lack a sense of humor and see personal injustice everywhere they look. It is better to laugh off the cranky behavior of others and not let it stick to you. So they said a bunch of nasties – see it for the childish temper tantrum that it is and have a good chortle.

, It may be hard to be compassionate when somebody has said some abusive and reprehensible things but trying to understand what drove them to this point can help you to see that it was likely a momentary lapse of better judgment and that they're probably already quivering in their boots about your response to it. Being compassionate can open up dialog between the two of you, to unmask what is hurting them so much that they are driven to say such hateful things.

, Anybody who hides behind a cloak of anonymity to say vicious things doesn't deserve your time of day. Ever. Do not engage.

, If a nasty and hurtful email has upset you, don't keep it to yourself. Find somebody you can talk to as a good sounding board. A friend, a parent, a teacher, a work colleague, another online friend, etc., all are potential help. If there is nobody that you feel you can trust, perhaps call a charity talk line and speak with a counselor or similar person. Get off the computer and take a brisk walk or play a ball game, etc. to unwind. This can help get the jitters out and clear your head about how to approach the email.

, Make sure that you do use this tool accordingly, however, and that you don't just label them all ""urgent"" in an attempt to just push off dealing with them to another time. Doing so will just defeat the purpose of managing your email in the first place.

, Besides the obvious information, such as your position and address, make sure that your signature also includes a website or blog, should you have them.

, Create groups in advance, and where necessary, by dividing your contacts into groups also.

, This habit will make you more productive during the day, as long as you take that time to actively deal with all the email you receive, whether that means responding to certain emails or deleting them. Checking your email at specific times will ensure that you respond to them in a group.

, Ideally, you want to browse your email subject lines to determine which emails can be deleted without reading them. This would include junk email and obvious spam. Filtering your messages in this manner will make it less daunting dealing with the remaining new messages.

, Take 1 email at a time and deal with it then and there, if possible. You don't want to leave emails until later or read all your emails before going back and responding to them.

, Not only will this make the process of email management easier but it will be beneficial to the respondent of your message, especially if that person is equally overwhelmed. Therefore, when writing a brief email, make sure you stick to the point and narrow your message down to the essentials.

Clean out your contact list periodically.",How to Manage Contacts," Email providers often allow you to include phone number, address, company affiliation, and other information. Plus, people are easy to find by using the search feature.


Most email providers have the ability to import data from other files. This is a quick way to input information all at once, while minimizing the possibility of errors.
Some providers give you the option of automatically adding someone to your contacts the first time you receive an email from them. Taking advantage of this helps assure that no one gets missed or lost in your contacts.
Email accounts are often available through mobile devices, enabling you to find the information you need when you are not near a computer.;
, Memory cards allow you to transfer contact information from one phone to another phone or to the computer. Smartphones may also have apps you can download to make syncing information simple.


Sync contacts regularly so you have an updated list on all devices. Otherwise, you may find yourself searching for a phone number on a device where you do not have it stored.
Families can also sync contacts with each other so that parents have important numbers of their children's friends and employers.

, By creating categories like Personal, Business, and Family, you not only keep contacts organized, but you also have the ability to filter through hundreds of contacts to find the one you for whom you are looking. You can also send emails or text messages to a particular group of people by organizing them in this manner.


On mobile devices, these categories are often referred to as Groups; on email accounts, they may be called Distribution Lists or Categories.

, Managing contacts implies that you are making choices about who gets added and who does not. For contacts you do not interact with regularly, there are other ways to find their information should they not appear on your contact list.


Search through past emails to find someone's email address. This way, you still hold onto the information you need without adding yet another person to your contact list.
Create a larger, all-inclusive list of contacts on your computer. Keep your primary contact list limited to those with whom you interact on a regular basis.

,, This is my favorite way of doing this. Make sure whoever you're inviting has a Gmail account. If they don't? It's free and easy and takes about 2 minutes.


Now, go to your inbox and find the small, blue words in the top left corner. The 2nd from the left should say 'calendar' and click on it.
Go to the date on which your event is and click on it. A little speech bubble-like thing will pop up and you should click ""add event details."" Fill the areas out which ought to include What, When, Where, and that type of thing.
It should also say 'My Calendars.' Right above this it will also say 'Add.' Remember where this is and call yours friends and have them do everything you just did while guiding them through it on the phone. Tell them to find the 'Add' button and click on it. Now have them select ""Add friend's calendar"" and follow the given steps.
Eventually you will have all your Gmail friends be able to see your calendar, so next time it will be much easier for you to send out invites over the computer!

,
Now, go to the calendar on your group and enter the information on the event.
This is a great way to do things because it's like having a mini website for you and your friends.
Your friends will get a reminder a couple days before the event.
You can also blog on your group which may help if anyone has any questions.

Fill in these areas with the info in non-bold.
Be specific so that your guests will understand what they're being invited to.

Avoid emailing when you are breaking bad news.,
Avoid emailing to cancel at the last minute.,
Avoid emailing when you are seeking to negotiate a price.,
Avoid emailing when something has to be done now.,
Avoid long emails and complexity.,
Avoid using email to propose.",How to Know when Not to Use Email," This is bad form and it lacks sincerity and emotion. Breaking up with someone over email is unfair, and you should never inform a close family member of a death via email. The exception concerning death is to inform people not closely related to a person in a more general manner well after the family members have all been informed.;
, It is not sensible to assume that somebody is going to be reading their email as you decide five minutes before a rendezvous that you can't be bothered going. Use the telephone (don't text!) and make sure you tell the person directly. People are also wise to the covering-your-backside routine of using email to say ""Oh, you didn't know? I sent you an email"". They can read the time and date after all...

, While it's OK to send a PDF invoice for payment via email, it's not OK to negotiate price via email. Misunderstandings occur all too easily. Call them up, arrange a meeting time for a face-to-face discussion and proceed from there.

, Again, as with canceling a meeting, how do you know that the person has even read it? The best way to deal with urgency is to meet face-to-face, to hammer in the urgent aspects, and to be assured that all parties concerned know its urgent.

, When the email is about a lengthy, difficult and complicated matter, email can make a mess of it. Again, have those face-to-face meetings, confirm understandings as the project proceeds by using phone conversations and only use email to flip documents between each other.

Use Gmail as it has one of the best spam filters available.,

Processing the rest.,
In any case, you should be able to get your inbox empty in a minimal amount of time using these methods.,

Be liberal with the delete key.",How to Maintain an Empty Email Inbox (Inbox Zero)," It easily filters all spam headed towards your inbox.;
, If you often get notifications from the many online services you use, such as Amazon, WordPress or PayPal and others. When you notice these types of notifications filling up your inbox, immediately create a filter, or rule as it is sometimes called, that will automatically place these into a folder that I had set up, and mark them as read or trash them,depending on what is appropriate for that type of mail. For example, my PayPal notifications can always be located if you set up a payments folder for it, and yet it will not clutter my inbox.

, For specific emails that require quick action, create a filter called batch folder. Once again, they require separate action and require processing a few times a day, and yet they do not land up in the inbox.

, Use this name or something similar for those jokes, chain mails sent by family and friends. Most of the time they are not even read, so why keep them in your major email area. Create a filter that would send them directly into a separate file, named appropriately, then all you have to do is glance at them, and then send them to the trash. If you would rather have them instead go directly to the trash, create a folder that says Pest message, and have them sent straight to the trash. The only problem with having these directly trashed without you gazing over them, is they might just be important mail that should be saved.

, The idea is to separate emails into subjects or uses. A folder for bills could be created, along with a folder for paid bills. Or a folder can be for permission requests sent, and permission granted and each title would automatically receive the proper titled mail. Try to set up as many folders as possible for email to be automatically directed to. This would make it easier for you to check on each easily and daily, deleting those that have already been cared for.

, you should not have most of your email going directly into appropriate folders, and new messages, or messages that do not fit into any specific format received on a daily basis.

, If however, if you receive a daily deluge of hundreds of messages, you should create a temporary folder, similar to the desktop boxes, new mail, outgoing mail', or to be done. this way you can quickly read your daily email, and tag them to go to one of those folders. later on in the day, you can check those folders and take care of them as needed.

, Work your way from top to bottom, one email at a time. Open each email and dispose of it immediately. Tag appropriately as you read the emails.

, Go to the permission requested folder. When email comes in, without permission, tag the folder permission denied', if permission came in asking for further information, tag the folderfurther information sent, and finally if the permission is given, tag permission received, or permission refused. Tags now come in different colors, so you can easily color code the folders.

, Reply with concise responses, short and to the point. Limit your replies to five sentences for each reply (at the maximum — many replies are even shorter). Be concise, choose only the essentials of what needs to be said.

Learn the pros and cons of email compared to traditional mail.,
Display important information as quickly as possible.,
Tend toward shorter paragraphs.,
Be prepared for a slightly more ""relaxed"" tone than with normal letters.,
Make your emotional intent as obvious as possible.",How to Make an E Mail1," Email uses the same medium as ""snail mail"" — text. However, the two forms of communication are far from identical. Email offers many benefits over traditional mail as well as a few negatives.



Pros:



Sent instantaneously
Easy for your recipient to respond right away
Generally requires a less formal tone
Email programs automatically keep track of correspondences for you
Appropriate for: most business correspondence, non-formal tasks, conversations with friends, relatives, etc.





Cons:



Less personal
Carries less weight (for example, sending an email to someone who's just lost a relative isn't as meaningful as sending a handwritten letter)
Not appropriate for: Intensely personal matters, very formal correspondences



;
, One of the most important rules of writing great emails is to be as brief as possible. An easy way to do this is to position it at the top of the email so that it is as visible as possible. For example, if you're emailing an online merchant to ask for a refund, you might start your email with: ""Greetings. I am writing to request a refund on a recent purchase I made with you."" Putting this in the first line of the email ensures the recipient will get the message right away.


As another example, if your message requires a quick response, you might put the word ""URGENT"" in the subject line to make this obvious, rather than hiding this information deep in the text of the letter. This is the email equivalent of marking a letter's envelope with a message like ""response requested immediately.""
Some digital sources recommend putting information in the body of the email instead of in an attachment when possible. The reasoning for this is that every additional action needed to access the information will make the recipient less likely to read it.

, Email doesn't lend itself well to long, block-like stretches of text. Reading a long, detailed email can be torture for many recipients. Words on a computer screen often look denser and less detailed than those in a real letter, making them uncomfortable to read for long stretches.In addition, computer users are often used to getting the information they need from their emails quickly and directly, rather than having to dig through long, roundabout paragraphs. For these reasons, it's best to be quick, terse, and to-the-point in your emails.


One email etiquette authority recommends limiting your emails to just a few paragraphs and no more than 25 lines of total text whenever possible., Unlike with normal letters, when you write an email, you can reasonably respect a response within a day or two. Sometimes, your recipient may write back in just a few minutes! The speed of email correspondences has led to the wide popularity of using a semi-formal tone for ""serious"" email correspondences. While some very grim or serious occasions will still call for a formal tone, don't surprised to see somewhat casual standards for tone (as well as spelling and grammar) in everyday emails.


For example, it's common for customer service representatives to take a friendly, familiar tone when writing emails to customers. You may see emails that start with the greeting ""Hi"" and that include non-formal features like colloquialisms and exclamation marks.

, As with real letters, it can be more difficult to detect emotional subtleties in email text than in personal conversations or even phone calls. Things like sarcasm, double entendres, and subtle emotional cues don't ""translate"" well to text. Since it's easy to be misunderstood, try to make your intent extra clear whenever you think there's a chance your text may be taken the wrong way. Below are a few ways you may want to do this:



Bold, italicize, or CAPITALIZE words for emphasis.



Example: ""Yeah, that will definitely work"" versus ""Yeah, that will DEFINITELY work.""




Use short disclaimers to explain yourself.



Example: ""I'm going to kill the boss"" versus ""I'm going to kill the boss (kidding!)""




Use emoticons — smiley faces made from text characters.



Example: ""Gee, have a real great trip"" versus ""Gee, have a real great trip :-)""

,, The code below is to be pasted as one line and will burn the avi file onto your CD media:mkisofs -V ""Volume.Title"" -q -J -r Film.Name.DVDRip.XviD-GRoUP.avi | cdrecord dev=9,0,0 driveropts=burnfree gracetime=0 -eject -overburn gracetime=0 tsize=`mkisofs -print-size -q -J -r Film.Name.DVDRip.XviD-GRoUP.avi`s -dao -pad -v -


-V means volume title. Otherwise known as the CD name when you insert it into a CD drive. It can contain spaces if the name is encased in the quotes. The title may not be larger than 32 characters.
-q means quiet. If we do not put this option down, then the cd burning progress display will be flooded with unwanted updates from mkisofs.
the -J option means to create a Joliet file system (improves windows compatibility).
the -r option enables the Rock Ridge extensions for the file system (improves Linux compatibility).
the | (pipe) symbol is the most important part of the operation. The data being created by mkisofs is being fed into cdrecord at the same time data is being written onto the disk.


tsize= is another important option. Since this cd is written is -doa mode cdrecord is going to want the track size in sectors. So what we do is: `mkisofs -print-size -q -J -r Film.Name.DVDRip.XviD-GRoUP.avi`s . And of course remember the s and the end.


Remember a single dash - and the end of the line of code because this dash tells cdrecord that the file it is writing to is coming from the pipe. It's important to use the same set of options in the main mkisofs call and the one with the -print-size switch because many options (like -J and -r) have a small impact on the size.

, The volume name, and the full file name which cannot be longer than 64 characters that has to be entered twice.

, Hit enter and wait about 205 seconds and then the CD should be finished. Label the CD how you want and your burned film is ready to watch on your TV using a compatible player.

, When you're finished with your message, you need to specify who you want to send the message to. Click the ""To"" or ""Recipient"" field, then type in the email address of the person you want to send your message to. This will always contain an ""@"" sign and end with the recipient's email domain, like this: JaneDoe123@emailservice.com.

, Sending the same email to multiple people at once is easy. You will generally have three options:Simply list multiple addresses under the ""To"" field, separated by commas, like this: JaneDoe123@emailservice.com, JohnSmith456@superemail.com. Every email you list will receive the email

Cc: This stands for ""carbon copy."" List email addresses here to have copies of the email sent to these addresses. Cc: is usually used for people that are not the intended target of the email but who would benefit from seeing it.

Bcc: This stands for ""blind carbon copy."" List email addresses here to have copies of the email sent to these addresses without anyone else knowing. In other words, people listed under the Bcc: will get the email, but won't appear on other recipients' copies.
In Gmail, when you click the ""To"" field, buttons for ""Cc"" and ""Bcc"" will appear in the top right corner.

, Under the ""Subject"" header, write a brief description of your email. You don't have to do this, but it's nice to give your recipient some idea of what they're about to read.


It's common to use the abbreviation ""re:"" here. For instance, if you're emailing a customer about a refund request, you might give your email the subject ""re: Refund request.""

, Just like letters aren't the only thing you can send in the mail, text isn't the only thing you can say with email. You can send pictures, spreadsheets, slideshows, and much more with your email account — basically, if you can find it on your computer, you can usually send it. To add an attachment, most email services have an ""Add attachment"" option or else an icon that looks like a paper clip.


On Gmail, the attachment button is the small paper clip button at the bottom of the email box. To attach a file, click this, then locate the file on your computer that you want to attach and click ""Open"" or ""OK"" to attach it. You may proceed to send your email normally after this.
Note that most email services have limits to the size of the attachment you can use. For Gmail, this is 25 megabytes, though you can get much more if you use Google Drive.

, When your email is written and you've filled out all of the necessary fields, it's ready to be sent. Usually, the button for sending an email says ""Send"" or looks like an envelope with an arrow extending from it.


In Gmail, the button you're looking for is the blue ""Send"" button in the bottom left corner.
After you send your email, your message will appear in the recipient's inbox (usually within a minute or two).

Some can be downloaded while others can be added as an extension to the window. A few email trackers can also be used directly on their sites. Do a bit of searching online and find which tracker best suits you. Remember — some of them are free, while others may require a paid subscription.;
, Some email trackers require a hidden image that you paste onto your email before sending. Others scan your email account and find messages that have been read. Note the mechanisms of the tracker you're using so you can get a sense of how you are going to send your email., When following this step, activate your email tracker. This will track the email you send, allowing you to know whether the recipient read the email or not., After you've waited for a while, take a look at your email tracker to see if your email has been read. (Of course, you wouldn't need to do that if your email already received a reply.) Keep in mind that email trackers can be prone to inaccuracies., These things can be quite a convenience when you're in an emergency for a quick reply, or when you're just curious if you're best friend is purposely ignoring you."

Limit how often you give out your email.,
Don’t forward chain emails.,
Consider setting up a dummy address.,
Never click a spam link or reply to a spam email.",How to Keep Your Email From Spammers1," Don’t give your email address to untrusted or unknown entities. From retail rewards programs to weekly newsletter services, everyone wants your email address. When you put your email address out there, remember that you don’t know exactly where it’s going. Don’t give your email address to just anyone!;
, Be wary of forwards and passing them along to friends. If you’ve forwarded something to a friend and then they forward it on, now your email address is part of a chain that will be passed around to people you don’t know.

, Set up an alternative email address to use when creating logins or signing up with something you can’t verify.

, Doing so tells the spammer that your email address is good.


This includes “unsubscribe” links found in spam email. These links will not actually unsubscribe you, and they will not reduce the amount of spam you get but rather put you at risk. On the other hand, selecting unsubscribe links in emails from trusted sources—to which you have previously subscribed—is fine, as these links are what they say.
This also means don’t buy anything from a spammer. Someone must be buying from them, because spammers are sticking around and even multiplying. Make sure you’re not the one keeping them in business.

Under the “General” tab you’ll see an “Images” section—check the box labeled “Ask before displaying external images”. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and select “Save Changes”. (This is not the default setting.)

Consider switching to a different email client.,
Change your settings so you don’t download pictures automatically.,
Turn off the preview pane in your email settings.",How to Keep Your Email From Spammers3," The one that came with your operating system is likely highly targeted by spammers. Certain email clients, such as Gmail and Outlook, are more secure than others.


Gmail automatically filters most spam, but if something makes it past the filter you’ll want to select the “Report Spam” option.
Outlook also filters spam, but you can increase its effectiveness under Tools > Junk Email Protection. Here you can increase the level of protection and specify “Safe Domains” and “Blocked Senders”.

, Spammers can send a different graphic to each person they email. If your computer loads that graphic from their server, they now know your address is working, and they learn your IP address and what browser and operating system you use. Your goal is to keep information out of spammers’ hands.


To do this in Gmail, click the gear icon at the top right and select “Settings”. Under the “General” tab you’ll see an “Images” section—check the box labeled “Ask before displaying external images”. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and select “Save Changes”. (This is not the default setting.)
To do this in Outlook on a Mac, select the “Outlook” menu at the top, then select Preferences > Reading. Under “Automatically download pictures from the internet”, select “Never”. (This is the default—it should already be set to “Never” if you haven’t previously changed it, but it’s always good to check!)
To do this in Outlook on a PC, select the “File” menu at the top, then select Options > Trust Center. Under the “Microsoft Outlook Trust Center” menu, select “Trust Center Settings”. Uncheck the box labeled “Don’t download pictures automatically in HTML e-mail messages or RSS items”. (Again, this is the default setting, but it’s always good to check!)

, Email clients that show you the message without making you click them are essentially ""reading"" your email for you. This automatically lets the spammers know your address is good if they’ve added an image or requested a read receipt.


To do this in Gmail, click the gear icon at the top right and select “Settings”. Under the “General” tab you’ll see a “Snippets” section—check the box labeled “No Snippets”. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and select “Save Changes”. (This is not the default setting.)
In Outlook, select the “View” menu at the top, then select Reading Pane > Hidden. (By default, the reading pane is enabled.)

Make your subject line clear.,
Open with a business salutation.,
Introduce yourself.",How to Introduce Yourself Via Email1," Your recipient should have a good idea about what the email is about before they even open it. Keep it short as well; a long subject can be cumbersome. For an introductory email, it is usually perfectly acceptable to write ""Introduction - Your Name"".


Make sure to write the subject line first! A common mistake is to save the subject line for last, which can lead to forgetting to write it at all.
Mobile devices will typically only show about 25-30 characters of the subject, so keep it short.;
, Don't start off with ""Hello"" or ""Hi"". You can use greetings like that once you've gotten to know the person. Start off with a tried-and-true business greeting. Avoid using the recipient's first name in the salutation.""Dear Ms./Mr./Mrs."" - If you are at all unsure about the marital status of the female you are emailing, you should always default to using ""Ms."" as it is less presumptuous.
""To whom it may concern"" - This should only be used if you are not sure who will be receiving the message.

, Your first sentence should introduce yourself to your recipient. This allows them to associate a name with the rest of the email message.


""My name is...""
Give your title if applicable. If you have multiple titles, don't list them all out, just the most important or relevant one.

"
"
Explain how you got the recipient's email address.,
Talk about the last time you met (if applicable).,
Share a common interest.,
Give your reason for getting in touch.,
Keep your email focused on one subject.",How to Introduce Yourself Via Email2," Let the recipient know how you found out their contact information. This helps show that you went through the proper channels to reach them.


""Your office manager directed me towards this email address""
""I found this email address on your website""
""So-and-so said that I should get in contact with you""

, Jogging the person's memory can lead to more engagement.


""We talked briefly at the conference last week""
""We spoke on the phone yesterday""
""I saw your presentation on...""

, This can help you relate to your recipient, and keeps your business emails from seeming too cold. In order to determine mutual interests, you may need to do a little research on the recipient. Possible research areas include Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.


Make sure you let the person know where you found this mutual interest, otherwise you'll come off as a stalker.
If possible, try to keep the mutual interest business-related, such as something in your field or a professional passion you both share.

, Don't wait too long to get to the point. No one is going to read an email that is multiple paragraphs long before anything resembling the point appears. Explain clearly and straightforwardly what you want and why you're contacting that person about it. If you are asking for advice or making some other request, make sure it is manageable, especially if this is your first contact.


""I'm interested in learning more about...""
""I'd like to meet with you sometime to discuss...""
""I would like your opinion on...""

, Letting your email meander can cause your recipient to lose interest or forget about why you were emailing in the first place. Keep your introductory email simple and only ask the recipient one thing.

"
"
Thank the recipient for their time.,
Provide a call to action.,
End the email.,
Include your signature.,
Proofread the email.",How to Introduce Yourself Via Email3," No one likes going through all of their email, so make sure to thank your recipient for taking the time to read yours. This simple courtesy will greatly improve your recipients mood and increase the chances of you getting a response.


""I appreciate you taking the time to read this email.""
""Thank you for taking time out of your schedule to read this.""

, Ask the recipient to write you back, call, think about your proposal, or anything else to get them engaged. Asking a question is another great way to increase engagement.""Give me a call when you have some free time""
""Let's meet for lunch sometime soon""
""What are your thoughts on...?""
""I look forward to your response""

, When ending a professional email, make sure that your ending is grateful but concise. A simple ending salutation will keep your email professional while still expressing your gratitude.


""Sincerely,""
""Thank You,""
""Kind/Warm Regards,""
""Best,""
Avoid ""Yours Truly,"" ""Sincerely Yours,"" ""Cheers!,"" ""Peace,"" ""Thank you for your consideration.""

, If you haven't configured your email service to include your signature, make sure to end with your name, title, and contact information. Don't overload this part with five phone numbers, two email addresses and three websites. Keep it simple so that the recipient knows the best way to get back in touch with you.

Look closely at the subject lines.,
Watch attached files.,
Check the sender.,
Read the message.,
Know that email viruses may pretend to be sent from an existing company.,
Do not follow links unless assured or necessary.",How to Spot a Computer Virus in an Email Inbox," For those who don't know, a subject line is a summary of an email. If you happen to be getting subject lines such as: ""Make.Money.Fast,"" most likely the email contains a virus.;
, Most of the time a file that is a virus has an .exe or .vbs file extension. (A file extension is a type of file.) What most hackers would do is name a file followed by a file extension, followed by another file extension. (blank.jpg.vbs for example.) The first extension (.jpg) is just part of the name if followed by another (.vbs).

, If the sender is someone you don't know or a company you're not familiar with, the email probably contains a virus.

, Although it might be sent from someone you know, the message may leave you clueless about why it was sent. (For example, the ""here you have"" email virus simply says ""This is The Document I told you about,you can find it Here,"" followed by the virus' download link. Upon reading, it will send itself to everyone in the Microsoft Office address book with the victim as the sender.) That is an obvious indication that the email contains a virus.

, It is important to read each email thoroughly; an email may seem to be sent from a legitimate company when it was really sent from a hacker. (This is called forging email.) A forged email may contain multiple spelling/punctuation errors, another indicator that the email contains a virus.

, Sometimes the virus is located on a website, rather than attached to an email. The hacker would require the victim to follow the link to a website in order for the virus to be downloaded. If not contacted/assured prior to receiving the email that the link is safe, do not follow it.

Learn to touch type on the Dvorak keyboard layout.,
Before you type, warm up your fingers by making fists with both your hands.,
Try not to look at the keyboard when typing.,
Use websites that allow you to practice touch typing.,
Find a touch typing tutor (preferably with the Dvorak layout) and learn to type.,
When you are ready to take a shot at beating the world record, go to and choose a test, preferably with a three minute duration to get a more accurate result.",How to Type Really Fast on a Keyboard," If you are going for speed, choosing the standard keyboard layout is out of the question. The standard keyboard layout, called Qwerty, was - to cut a long story short - designed to be inefficient. The Dvorak keyboard was designed to be fast, comfortable and easy to learn, and you should be able to achieve 20 to 25 % more speed with it, even if you switch after you've learned to type on another layout. You must remember where are the buttons on keyboard. If you are a beginner at typing try to write your name or something you are familiar with your school name or your address etc. To learn more about the layouts, go to . Notice that you don't have to buy a new keyboard, just change a setting on your computer.;
, Open them slowly, and bend your fingers back until they can't physically go further without external help. Repeat this five times and you'll be typing faster than you did before.

, Challenge yourself at all times until you can type without looking at all, and get the typing accurate.

, For example ""typingtest.com"". Practice at the various levels until you are using the fastest typing levels.


Use timed typing tests that require you to beat the clock to finish a paragraph.

, There are tons of free alternatives that should fit most people fine. Don't look at the keyboard, and if you have decided to go for the Dvorak layout, don't move the keys around. This will only slow down your learning. To speed up your learning, try to practice with text that makes sense, and not the usual repetitive sequences of characters - these do not really work.

, To motivate yourself, make notes of your results before, during and after your training to see the increase in speed. Choose different tests, so that you don't end up memorizing a text (which gives inaccurate results).

Receive less email.,
Resist the temptation to subscribe to mailing lists, google alerts, and anything else that automatically sends you email.,
Use a spam filter.,
Identify and filter out your bacon email.,
Check less email.,
Read less email.,
Write less email.,
Send less email.,
Store less email.,
Sort less email.,
At the end of the week, spend the time you have saved by doing something pleasurable.",How to Spend Less Time on Email," The less people know your email address, the less mail you will receive. Especially you don't want spammers to know it. If your email address is already too widely known, consider getting a new one. Use the old email address for registering on dubious websites, and don't bother checking it much. Just let it fill up with irrelevant messages. Only tell your real email address to people you really want to communicate with. Don't put it on any website or publicly accessible directory.;
, Unsubscribe or filter the ones you are already signed up for. Only a small proportion of the information they send you will be relevant. You save more time by searching for the information you need when you need it, rather than being constantly inundated with mostly irrelevant emails.

, Many web based email programs such as Gmail or Yahoo Mail automatically filter most spam. It's just that SPAM! Unwanted email and time should not be spent going through this folder and you better not be clicking on links or asking your IT dept why you have so much in there.

, Bacon is the unsolicited email you get that isn't spam, but you don't really need to read urgently.Example bacon email includes Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace friend requests, mailing lists, e-commerce purchase confirmations, etc. Create a filter for all these types of emails and have them bypass your inbox and go to a folder or label. Checking that folder only once every few days will help you batch process these non-urgent emails faster.

, Every time you check your email, you waste precious seconds seeing if anything new has come in, as well as getting distracted from something more worthwhile. It's more efficient to set aside certain times when you deal with your email, and keep away from it the rest of the time. After you've had your email session, close your email program down. If you have a lot of work-related email, you may need to deal with it twice a day, say morning and afternoon. Otherwise, try keep it to once a day. If you succeed in reducing the volume of your email going in and out, you could manage to limit it to every two or three days, or even once a week.

, The most time-saving way of dealing with unwanted email is to delete it before you read it. If you can tell from the sender and subject line that it is irrelevant, resist the temptation to open it just in case. Just delete it with gusto. The second fastest way to deal with email is to open it, glance at it, and then delete it if it is irrelevant. If it is relevant, you can read it carefully so the information is registered in your brain, and then delete it immediately. Don't wait until later to delete it. If you wait, you will probably waste time later opening it again and glancing at it to remember what it was. Your goal is to process each email only once.

, Don't feel you have to answer or acknowledge every email. If you do need to reply to an email, the most time efficient way is to reply immediately and briefly, and then delete the email. Try to have as few emails as possible that are stored waiting for you to reply to.

, Try not to use the “Reply All” option. Don't send copies of your email to people who don't really need them. Ask yourself, “Will the person who receives this email of mine be glad to get it?” If the answer is, “Not sure,” think twice about sending it. By spending less time writing and sending emails, you will help other people to spend less time reading them.

, Some emails have important information that you need to keep, so it is good to file them systematically in folders. Otherwise you spend too much time looking for them later when you need them. But don't spend more time storing emails than absolutely necessary. Use filters or message rules to automatically store emails from certain senders or with certain subject lines in particular folders. The best way to save time storing emails is to delete them after reading, as mentioned above. The less emails you store, the less you will be tempted to look at twice.

, A great way to waste time is by reorganizing your email folders, or going through old emails deciding which ones to throw away. If you are in a deleting mood, it is better to delete whole folders at a time. Otherwise just leave them. If your old emails are taking up too much space, sort them by size and delete a whole bunch of the bigger ones.

, This might involve going for a walk with your sweetheart, calling up an old friend, reading a good book, making music, helping someone in need, or whatever else that gives more joy than sitting at the computer with piles of email.

ALWAYS use chat by text!,
If the first thing your chat partner says is ""ASL?"",
Put actual conversation in the interest box and some other interests - don't put stuff like girls, dating, porn, sex or you will find a total pervert.

,
Before entering the chat, prepare yourself to read something really disgusting and have your hand ready on Esc.

,
If after 5 chat attempts, if everyone has just advertised porn, requested nudes, or ask ASL stop using Omegle.",How to Use Omegle Safely As a Kid," You might end up with some pretty weird people on video.;

Brb is shorthand for ""be right back"".,
When instant messaging/text messaging, say 'brb' whenever you are going to leave.

,
When you are talking to someone you love and you don't want them to go away, while you have some urgent work that needs immediate attention, say 'brb', but make sure don't make them wait too long.

,
Understand that even though you literally said ""I will be right back"", you are under no obligation to actually return.

,
Know that you aren't actually committed to any particular time period.","How to Use or Interpret ""BRB""",";
,,,, You may take as much time as you would like to return, here is a system to decide approximately when you will return.

Less than 5 minutes- you are talking to a good friend and are having a good conversation, you actually mean you'll be right back.






5-15 minutes- you aren't really leaving, but you want to get out of the conversation for one reason or another, you might actually be going somewhere, but you don't really intend to return to the conversation, this is an easy way to end a conversation short.






More than 15 minutes- you never really wanted to talk to this person, so right when the conversation is initiated you respond ""hold up, brb"" but never return, you probably don't like this person very much, and they are not a good enough friend to be honest and say that you are too busy to talk to them at the moment.

Use a version of “My Best” when signing emails to people you work with frequently.,

End the sign-off with a comma.,
Sign your first name when emailing most people, especially those you see often.,
Include your contact info in a signature.,
Avoid large corporate logos that can show as attachments on other people’s programs.",How to Sign an Email1," Other versions of “Best” include “All Best,” “My Best to You,” simply “Best” and “Best Regards.”Remember that the more words you use, the more formal your sign off will be. Judge the formality based on the person to whom you are writing and their relationship to you.;
, Expressing sincere thanks is best done in the body of an email. If you must do this, try using “Many Thanks,” which carries a note of finality.

, This is a very traditional form of signing a letter; however, it should really only be used in the “To Whom it May Concern” addressed. Use it when you don’t know the person who is reading it.


“Sincerely” or “Thank You For Your Consideration” may be appropriate for job applications.
Try “Continued Success” if you are looking to leave a partnership or correspondence for a while.

,, Then, start a new line.

, Use your first and last name when you are writing for the first time.

, Try to keep it short. Include your title, company and contact info.

, For example, offer a percentage off for bringing in the direct mail piece, an invitation-only sale or coupon books.

,


Your formatting options include postcards, letter-size mailings, coupon books and any other format that you can mail. The format depends on your offer and your budget. For example, postcards are less expensive to mail than a multi-page sales letter.
You can create the piece on your computer using graphic design or word processing software, or you can hire a printer to create it for you.
Use eye-catching graphics and bold text to make your direct mail stand out from the rest of the mail in your customer's mailbox.

Consider the person to whom you are writing.,
Save “Love,” “x,” or “xo” for those you truly love, such as family and spouses.,
Use “Cheers” if you want to imply an informal, but fun tone.,
Try “Many Thanks” if you are genuinely thanking the person for something.,
Use “Be Well,” “Get Well” or “Thinking of You” when you are trying to refer to an illness or event.,
Opt for “In Haste” if you haven’t had time to think too long on a subject.,
Finish the sign-off with a comma and a signature.",How to Sign an Email2," The closeness of your relationship should determine your closing sign-off.

, For succinct emails, the use of a thank you in the signature can help save space.

, Only use it if you are being sincere.

However, if you can avoid entering your email on sites you only intend to use once or twice, you'll notice a significant reduction in the number of emails you receive.
, When you receive an email from a service such as LinkedIn, Best Buy, or a blog site, you can usually opt out of future correspondence by opening one of their emails, finding a link or button that says ""Unsubscribe"", and clicking it.

,
Exercise caution.",How to Use BCC in an Email6," Bcc is best used to maintain the privacy of your communication. If you used your To field, or CC to list multiple recipients, everybody on the list has their email exposed to everybody else. While this might be good in a small team environment, this can cause problems when people on the list don't know each other.


Not only does it expose private email addresses, it opens the door for either a flood of responses—most of which will not be relevant to most of the other people on the list—or even being used by spammers.
If, for example, you are emailing a few key people in a workgroup, and keeping others informed about the process, but want to silently let upper management know what you're sending out, you would include all the members of your workgroup in the To: field; include all the people who might be interested but aren't directly affected by this email into the Cc: field; and finally, anybody who you wish to include without letting others know about it into the Bcc field. You can also include yourself in the Bcc: field to get a copy of the email sent to yourself.
Place all ""blind"" recipients into the Bcc: field. Nobody will see the other recipients, which is great way to maintain privacy for everybody when sending to a public list.

,, Bcc is useful, in general, but it's not a perfect solution if you're trying to keep emails private. While there are standards set out for how Email clients should handle Bcc addresses, it's not a requirement. An email client may send the Bcc recipients as part of the header information. Search the help for your particular client, and chat with the online community to make sure your chosen client will send truly blind Bcc emails.

View the information that is provided to you.",How to Trace an Email," If there are suspicious attachments, do not open them. You can find the information you need without opening image or document attachments.;
, The header contains information about the routing of the email and the IP address. Most email programs like Outlook, Hotmail, Google Mail (Gmail,) Yahoo Mail and America Online (AOL) hide the header information because they see it as non-essential information. If you know how to open the header, you can still find this data.


On Outlook, go to your inbox and highlight your email using your cursor, but do not open it into its own window. If you are using a mouse, right click the message. If you are using a Mac Operating System (OS) without a mouse, click while holding down the ""control"" button. Select ""Message Options"" when the menu appears. Find the headers at the bottom of the window that will appear.
On Hotmail, click on the drop down menu next to the word ""Reply."" Select ""View Message Source."" A window will pop up with the address information.
On Gmail, click on the drop down menu next to the word ""Reply"" in the upper right hand corner of your message. Select ""Show Original."" A window with the IP information will pop up.
On Yahoo, right click or press ""control"" and click when you are on the message. Choose ""View Full Headers.""
On AOL, click ""Action"" on your message, then select ""View Message Source.""

, Following any of these methods for your chosen email carrier, you will have a window that pops up with a lot of code information. You will not need all of this information.


If the window is too small to effectively pick out the IP address, copy the information and paste it into a word processing document.

, This is the easiest way to spot the IP address; however, it may not be listed in those terms on all email programs. If you cannot find this term look for the word ""Received"" and follow the line until you see a numerical address.


Use the ""Find"" function on your computer to easily spot these terms. Click ""Command"" and the letter ""F"" on Mac OS. In Internet Explorer click the ""Edit"" menu. Select ""Find on this Page,"" then type the word into the box that appears and click ""Enter.""

, An IP address is a series of numbers with a period/full stop between the numbers. An example is: 68.20.90.31.

, There are many to choose from and most of them are free.

, Press ""Enter.""

, Most results will show the originating state or city of the IP address and possibly the computer name that the IP address is associated with.

You don’t necessarily have to log back into your account. Look for the “Unsubscribe” button, and click it again.

Mark the email as spam. On the top bar above the email title, there is a stop sign symbol with an exclamation point. Click on the icon to report the spam.

, If you continue to be emailed after you have unsubscribed, call the company and request to be taken off their email list. Tell them if they persist in sending you unwanted mail that you will file a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, the nations customer protection company. Follow the in-line citation to go to the page to file a complaint with the FTC. , Unsubscribing is something that you will have to continue to do in the future. Even after you use a website to clear your email, you will have to keep up with it. Any new emails you get, unsubscribe using the steps above.

Use the phone.,
Have someone else read your email message.,
Be very brief and don’t use offbeat humor in your emails.,
Consider the recipient’s state of mind.",How to Stop Writing Emails That Are Misunderstood," If you are truly having trouble with a friend or are having a difficult time expressing yourself, skip trying to email and instead pick up the phone.


Send a quick email to the recipient that you’d like to chat by phone instead of email. Be honest about why you’d prefer to talk on the phone. Tell your friend that you may be having a hard time expressing yourself via email and would prefer to talk.
Write down what you would like to convey in your phone conversation. Especially if you have something heavy to deliver make sure you have all your ducks in a row and points outlined before making the call. That way you can still attend to the matter at hand and avoid meandering away from the reason why you called.
Don’t be accusatory. Either by phone, text message or email, never just outright accuse someone of making you feel a certain way. Or tell someone that they “need” to do something to make you feel better. If someone did something to upset you, instead say, “I felt upset in reaction to ‘this’ action.”;
, If you are going to send an email that could be misconstrued have an outside party read your message.


Let the other person know what is your intent with the message. Especially if you are writing the message in the heat of the moment, you may be sending a highly charged message and could receive an even more highly charged response.
Be open to criticism. You may think your email is pleasant, but your friend thinks is pretty obnoxious. Take the feedback for what it is and use it to avoid getting a result you don’t want.

, If you want to simply communicate a message like, “Let’s meet for lunch” or “Can you send me that report” get to the point and be brief.


Emails are meant to be an easier way to get your point across without having to exchange pleasantries on the phone. If you simply need something, begin with a pleasant greeting such as, “Hi ______” and then dive into your request or question. Be sure you sign your email with a “thank you” or “regards” to remain cordial.
Avoid trying to be funny. Humorous delivery can sometimes be misconstrued via an email. For example, if your friend had to cancel a trip to visit a relative due to financial constraints; don’t ask your friend if he/she feels guilty for neglecting his/her brother, followed by a smiley face. You may think you are being playful, but in reality your friend may really feel bad but unable to afford the trip. What may sound hilarious or cute to you may be cutting and annoying to someone else.

, For example, if your friend is freaking out about a test score his/her daughter just received, don’t tell him/her that she should remember her child is still little, in the long run it really doesn’t matter and he/she should just get over it. Perhaps in a few days your friend may realize it isn’t the end of the world but at the time he/she is extremely upset and charged--an email like that will only ignite his/her anger and most likely cause problems.


Be supportive in your emails. Don’t offer advice (unless asked) but offer support and empathy. Your friend may have sent you an email, venting about something that happened. Although you may not understand why your friend is so upset or charged, instead of going after him/her and telling that person to chill or “get over it” just tell him/her you are here to talk.
Don’t answer emails immediately if your receive an email that upsets you. If you feel as though a friend sent you an email that is rude or maybe misdirected, wait to respond until you are no longer angry or upset. Your friend may not be in his/her usual state of mind when he/she sent the email so instead of firing something back immediately, give him/her time to simmer down and perhaps think about what he/she wrote.

Find a reputable file hosting service.,
Compress multiple files into one archive.,
Upload your file.,
Send your file.",How to Transfer Large Files Without Clogging Up Email," File hosting services will allow you to upload your file to their servers, and then send the link to that file to your email recipient. The recipient can then visit the link provided, and download the file from the server. Popular hosting services include:


Dropbox – Provides 2 GB free storage, and you can link directly to specific files. Uploading through the website limits files to 300 MB, while using the desktop or mobile app does not have a limit on file size other than your total cap.DropSend – Allows you to send files up to 2 GB, 5 times per month.
WeTransfer – Allows you to send files up to 2 GB, as many times as you’d like.
Send this file – Allows you to send a file up to 2 GB, which can be downloaded up to 3 times for 3 days.;
, If you have multiple files that you need to send to one recipient, it will be much more convenient for the recipient and for you if the files are compressed into a single archive. This will not only reduce the overall file size, but will also save you from having to upload multiple files.


In most cases, you can select multiple files, right-click on the selection, select Send To and then select Archive. For more detailed information on compressing multiple files into one archive, check out this guide.

, The process is different depending on the service. Some services, such as Dropbox, require you to create a free account before you can upload files. Others, like WeTransfer, only need your email and your recipient’s email.


You will need to transfer the entire file to the server before it can be sent. If you are sending a large file and have a slow connection, this could take some time.

, Either send the email through the web service, or send an email containing the link to your file (this depends on the service you are using). Your recipient can then follow the link and download the file to his or her computer."

, Keep this email address as your ""must check everyday"" email and keep your other, more bloated email as a weekend hobby. Use this email address as the one that you have subscriptions sent to so that you don't become bogged down in them.

, Create folders that you can instantly divert incoming emails to for checking at later times. Create folders for emails from friends, from groups you've joined, from news sources, from charities etc. You can come back and read some at a different time and only pay attention to those that need immediate attention. More importantly, press that delete button - if you've read it and it's not worth replying to, or it's junk mail or it's a subscription newsletter and you've noted it etc., then delete it. Don't let it clutter up your mailbox making it harder for you to navigate around and stopping you from being efficient with your emails.

, People will soon get the message that you don't reply instantly or send back huge emails all the time. Reserve the email for special things like anniversaries, sending photos or cheering someone up.

, It's an old tradition that has its value. People love receiving letters and postcards, even postcards from your hometown. And love notes are always better handwritten...

You'll be surprised when you know the real reason they were created. Chain letters exploit every human emotion and desire there is, from alarm to humor to outrage and sadness, all to achieve one goal, to get people spreading them. A few sites that deal specifically with chain letters of all kinds: Break The Chain Truth Or Fiction and Snopes.com These sites are extremely useful when a naive friend sends you that scary headlight gang initiation story or that sad Amy Bruce dying kid hoax. Neither of those are true, and these sites have information about them and much much more.;
, Have you ever broken a chain before? Nothing bad happened to you then, so why is this time different? Also, why wouldn't they display an article in the newspaper about something bad happening to someone who broke a chain letter. The chain may claim there was a news report when there really wasn't. This is a bid to look more believable. Hoax-busting sites deal with many chain letters that masquerade as news, going as far as to claim that CNN or NBC or some big name news outlet reported on a story that didn't actually happen. Just think to yourself about all the things that would happen if there really was some type of killer email or letter out there; News-reports, public warnings, etc. Remember that technology is not magic. No email can kill you if you don't forward it. It is just an ominous, sad or other emotion-yanking message designed to push your buttons so you will forward it. We don't like people pushing us around in real life, so why in the world should you let some anonymous chain letter hoaxer push you and your friends around via the internet? That's all a scary chain letter is, a con that uses you and your friends fears to make them pass around a bogus story or claim.

, Did you recently break up with someone? What's really going on in your mind? Did something bad happen to you recently? If you answer yes to any of these, your mind might be thinking deeper thoughts than you think, and you are more prone to be scared or upset, even by things that simply aren't real.

, Read a good book, hang out with a friend, cuddle a pet (If this is possible), watch television or just do something that you enjoy doing.

,, Back it up with a reference to an article on a hoax-busting site such as Break the chain if you can. They might respect your feelings and stop.

, We are all human and one of our many emotions happens to be fear. Just calm yourself down and relax. Nothing will happen. Some might scare you initially, But think past the computer about the loser who is writing it.

, The person who wrote it added threats to it precisely for naive people who actually believe them, so the chain letter reaches more and more people. Now, how likely it is that the event mentioned in it would actually happen? And how do you think a spam can influence the course of your life? Millions of people receive chain letters; the person who sent it can't predict the future of everybody who receives the chain letter, so let's just face it: chain letters are jokes people send to annoy others. There's absolutely nothing true about them.

, Doing so, you're only scaring people like yourself, who believe in them, or annoying those who don't. Do you really want them to be the victims of this joke? Probably not.

, It only is scary AFTER. There's no switch or something that knows that you read it and you are going to have bad luck.

If the person responds similarly, bid farewell one last time.",How to Stop an Online Conversation," For example, if someone is trying to change the topic, the conversation is certainly not over.

Stop thinking so much about it.,
Pick a convenient time.,
Start small.,
Ask about a common interest.,
Compliment the person.,
Ask a question.,
Be careful with stock pickup lines.",How to Start a Conversation Online1," If you're trying to get to know someone (and, perhaps, to woo them), the goal of these first few online conversations is to help them understand who you are as a person. You want to be yourself, and a script will only get you so far.


Striking up a conversation online is hard for almost everyone. You're not the first, and you won't be the last.
Worst case, it'll be a learning experience. Best case, you'll connect with somebody in a deep way. Neither case applies until you try.;
, Try to message the person when they're online. It may be easier to get a conversation going in real-time than to count on someone to respond later on.


Pick a time when you don't have anywhere to be. You don't want to be stressed-out, and you want to give the conversation a chance to grow.

, Send the person a short message and ask them how they're doing. A ""Hey. How's it going?"" will do. You may find that you feel much looser once you get the conversation going--there's no turning back now!


They will likely respond with how they're doing, then ask you how you're doing. Be prepared to say how you're doing.
Avoid dead-end answers like ""I'm good."" Anyone can be ""good"". Respond with something that tells your conversation partner about who you are, such as ""I'm good! My friend and I explored this abandoned house up in the hills today. It was really cool but super spooky"" or ""My dance team just made it to nationals. I'm so excited!""

Mention things that make you seem interesting, but avoid bragging.

, This is a classic, tried-and-true conversation opener. If you're in a class together, ask what the homework assignment is. If you're in a club together, ask about an upcoming club event. This can break the ice in a very natural way, opening the gates to a deeper talk.


Try something like this: ""Hey- I completely blanked and forgot to write down the homework for English today. Did you happen to get it?""

Or this: ""Hey, do you know when our next track meet is? I must have tuned out when coach announced it during practice today...""


, If a person does something worthy of praise, it's natural to compliment them. This can be another great way to break the ice and make the person feel appreciated. Don't overdo it--be sparing with your compliments, or they may come across as flattery.


If you're in a class together: ""You did a great job on your presentation today! I never thought I'd learn so much about Ulysses S. Grant!""

If you're on a team together: ""Nice work in the 100-yard sprint at the meet today. You really put the team on your back""


, If you've met someone on a dating site like OKCupid or a dating app like Tinder, then you probably don't have any real-life connections to talk about. Ask the person an open-ended question about themselves. Take your inspiration from their profile.For example: ""I see you're into hip hop. Been to any good shows lately?""

Or: ""I dig your beard. How long have you been growing that sucker?""


, Pickup lines can backfire: they work on some people, but they turn off others. These lines can come across as cheesy or manipulative, especially if they aren't something that you thought of yourself. Try to come across as genuine, and if that includes a pickup line--then you do you!

"
"
Decide how formal you need to be.,
Find the person's name.,
Follow the person's lead.,
Fall back on ""Dear."",
Try ""Greetings,"" when you don't know the person's name.,
Consider ""Hi"" or ""Hello"" in slightly less formal emails.,
Skip ""Hey."",
Use a title in place of a name when necessary.,
Add the person's honorific to make it more formal.,
Place the greeting on the first line.,
Use a comma.,
Move to the next line.,
Introduce yourself in the opening sentence, if necessary.,
Get to the point.",How to Start a Formal Email," Even if you are writing a ""formal"" email, how formal that email is depends on the person who's receiving it. For instance, you wouldn't use the same level of formality when writing a professor that you would when applying for a job.


When you're first contacting someone, it's better to be more formal than you need to be, just to be on the safe side.;
, Do some research to dig up the person's name if you don't already know it. Knowing the person's name makes the greeting seem more personable, even while you are employing formal techniques for your email., If the person has emailed you already, it's fine to copy their greeting style. For example, if they use ""Hi"" and your first name, it's acceptable to reply in the same style, by using ""Hi"" and the person's first name when you address the email., ""Dear"" (followed by the person's name) is an old standby for a reason. It's formal without being stuffy, and because it's used so often, it often becomes invisible in a greeting, which is a good thing. You don't want your greeting to stick out because it's inappropriate., Greetings is a relatively formal greeting that you can use in business emails, particularly if you don't know the person's name. However, it's always better to find out the person's name if possible.You can also use ""To Whom It May Concern"" if the email is especially formal and you don't know the person's name. However, this greeting can be off-putting to some people.

, Emails tend to be less formal than letters in general, so you can get away with something like ""Hi"" in a somewhat formal email. For example, if you're emailing your professor, particularly one you actually interact with, ""Hi"" or ""Hello"" should work just fine., While ""Hi"" may be acceptable in a semi-formal email, ""Hey"" is probably not. It's a very informal greeting, even in speech, so you should avoid it in any type of formal email. Even if you know your boss fairly well, for instance, it's probably best to skip ""Hey"" when emailing them., Sometimes, when you're writing to a person, you only know their title within the company or organization. In that case, you can just the person's title in place of the person's name, such as ""Dear Hiring Manager,"" ""Dear Hiring Committee,"" or ""Dear Professor."", When possible, add ""Mr.,"" ""Mrs.,"" ""Dr.,"" or ""Professor"" before the person's name to make it more formal. Also, use the person's last name or full name to be more formal, rather than just the person's first name., The top line should be the greeting you've chosen, followed by the person's name. Use a title for the person when possible, such as Mr., Mrs., or Dr., followed by their first and last name., Generally, you'll use a comma after the greeting. In formal letters, you can use a colon, but that is usually too formal for an email, even a formal one. A comma will suffice in most instances, though you might use a colon if you are writing a cover letter in an email., The greeting goes on its own line at the top, so once you've written it, hit the return key to move to the next line. If you're using line breaks instead of indentions to make paragraphs, you'll need to leave a blank line between the greeting and the first paragraph., If you are writing someone for the first time, you should provide an introduction, even if you know the person in real life. Giving the person a clue to who you are encourages them to keep reading.For example, you could write, ""My name is Jessica Hills, and I am the marketing director for XYZ Company."" You could also include how you know the person: ""My name is Robert Smith, and I'm in your marketing class (Marketing 101 that meets Tuesdays and Thursdays at noon).""
If you already know the person and have written them before, you can use the first sentence as a greeting. For instance, you could say, ""Thank you for getting back to me so quickly,"" or ""I hope you are doing well.""

, Most formal emails need to get to the point quickly. That means that your first or second sentence should introduce the reason why you're writing to the recipient. Remember to be as concise as possible when describing your purpose.For example, you could write, ""I'm writing to ask for your assistance with a marketing problem,"" or ""I'm writing you because I'm having trouble in class, and I was hoping you'd have suggestions for extra material I could read to help.""

"
"
Be present and engaged in the conversation.,
Ask questions.,
Don't be nosy.,
Turn your answers into questions.,
Don't be afraid to talk about yourself.,
Use emoticons and emoji, but don't overuse them.,
Don't force it.",How to Start a Conversation Online2," Read and respond carefully. Conversation is all about taking cues and riffing off of what people say. While you are talking to the person, be aware of what the conversation has covered and where it is going.


In this respect, talking to people online can even be easier than speaking in person. You should be able to scroll back through the conversation if you need to remember a specific detail.

, Be genuinely interested in the person. It's a scientific fact that people love to talk about themselves. If you ask questions about someone, odds are that they'll have a lot to say.


Ask questions that lead into other questions. If you ask ""So what kind of music are you into?"" and they respond ""I like a lot of music- some rock, some pop, some punk. I go to a lot of local shows""--ask them something like, ""Been to any good shows lately?""

Avoid asking yes-or-no questions. A simple ""yes"" or ""no"" can stop a conversation in its tracks. If you must ask questions with basic or binary answers, be prepared to ask follow-up questions.

, Be respectful of sensitive topics. You'll have to use your intuition on this one, but as a general rule of thumb: Don't ask anyone a question that you wouldn't want to answer yourself.

, There is a back-and-forth flow to conversations, and you need to keep up your end if you want to keep the talk going. When you send a message, try to end each thought with a question that will prompt your conversation partner to respond.Think of a conversation like a game of catch. If you catch the ball, then that's great--but the game cannot go on until you throw the ball back to the other person.
Do not merely say, ""My day was good. I think I did really well on my math exam!"" Say, ""My day was good. I think I did really well on my math exam! How was yours?""


, There is a delicate balance to be struck here: if you dominate the conversation and only talk about yourself, you may come across as selfish or cocky; but if you don't let out any personal details, you'll just be another mystery.


Be honest. If you weave a web of lies--building yourself up to be something you're not--it may come back to bite you later on. Things have a way of coming to light.
If your conversation partner asks you about yourself, answer- but try to turn your answer back into a question. If they ask you about your dog, for example, consider something along the lines of: ""His name's Duke. He's a border collie mix. We saved him from a shelter three years back, and he's like one of the family now. Do you have any pets?""


, Emoticons like "":)"" and "":3"" can give your words emotion and flavor to offset the detached online setting. They can endear you to a person and make you come across as more friendly. However, your emoticons can reveal much about your feelings: if someone uses a lot of smiley faces, for instance, there is a good chance that they like you.


It is not wrong to reveal your feelings, but depending on the situation you may want to play it cool until you've gotten to know someone better. Be careful with your emoticons and what they tell your conversation partner.
If you want to subtly let the person know that you're interested, then make use of the "":)"". As a rule of thumb: use it at points in the conversation when you would actually smile in real life :)

, If the person is giving you one-word answers to questions, despite your best efforts, then they may just not want to talk to you right now. If the conversation seems forced, it's always okay to end the conversation and try again later.


It is not necessarily your fault! It can be so difficult to tell how someone is feeling, especially online. For all you know, the person doesn't want to talk because they're feeling depressed, or they have a lot of work to do, or they've just had a fight with their parents.
If you try to talk to someone over and over again and they do not seem interested in conversation--let it go. Try to get to spend more time with them in person, if possible, but only if you have a good reason to do so.
Give them space. Nobody likes to feel pressured. It is better to let someone go than to make them feel uncomfortable.

"
"
Talk until you don't have anything left to say.,
Don't feel the need to make formal plans.,
Be careful.",How to Start a Conversation Online3," Perhaps you've genuinely run out of conversation topics, or perhaps you need to be somewhere. Either way, you will want to bid your conversation partner goodbye.


Say something along the lines of, ""Alright, I need to go to practice. Nice talking to you! Have a great day"".
Consider saying that you have to go, even if you don't actually have to go. This is an easy way to get out of a conversation without feeling rude.

, Online conversations follow a slightly different protocol than offline conversations. They're not so formal. Unless your conversation partner is subject to limited internet access, you don't need to arrange a ""second date"". At the most, you might say, ""we should talk again sometime!""


If the conversation went well, simply message the person again in a day or two when you are both online. This time, you should be more familiar with each other. Build upon the information and the jokes that the two of you shared in your first conversation.
If your conversation partner can only access the internet at certain times or in certain places (say, for three hours each afternoon, or only at the public library), then feel free to make a formal plan. Type something like, ""I really enjoyed talking to you. I know that you aren't online all the time- can I plan to talk to you again on Tuesday?""


, If you make plans to meet up offline, exercise your best judgment about the situation. One conversation can only tell you so much, and people are not always who they say they are on the Internet.Consider talking with the person more online before you make the leap to meeting in person.
If you are using an online dating site like OKCupid or Tinder, then you may very well decide to meet up with the person soon--or immediately. Again, exercise your best judgment. If you meet up with a stranger, tell a friend where you are going, and with whom. Bring your phone with you and, if possible, meet in a public place (such as a coffee shop) during the daytime.

Use spell and grammar check tools.,
Create email templates.,
Punctuate correctly.,
Figure out homophones.,
Look up larger words.,
Have references for dates, etc.",How to Write Error Proof Emails," The original spell check was the exclusive province of word processors, but now many of these modern innovations have moved to hosted email platforms. That makes checking spelling and grammar for email as easy as clicking in the corner of an open message tool bar. Grammar and spell check can be one of the most effective ways to get typos and errors out of an email before hitting send.;
, To decrease chances of grammatical or spelling errors, or any other kinds of immediate mistakes, build a framework for emails that makes much of the writing automatic, allowing the rider to focus on the quantity of emails without worrying about quality.


Develop an IBC approach. This old standard of Introduction, Body and Conclusion works well for an email. Template each of these three parts separately, and provide a good basis for quick and accurate emailing in the future.

, For some, punctuation is one of the primary problems with creating professional emails. Keep good desk references on hand that give rules about when to use the comma, period and other parts of the English language that are neither consonants nor vowels.

, These like-sounding words will trip many people up, and spell check will not catch them.


Take a look at the most common homophones and immunize yourself against errors. Spend time working with word pairs like ""you're"" and ""your,"" ""their"" and ""they're, not to mention ""there,"" and other common tricky articles and pronouns.

, For accuracy with the big four-dollar words, keep a paper dictionary or an online reference handy.

, Make sure that the errors in your emails are not related to actual facts by having all of the materials cited at hand.


Refer to paper documents or other good sources for emails based on upcoming events or other relevant topics. Going by memory often gets email writers in trouble when their relayed messages end up being inaccurate. A better-safe-than-sorry approach can help tighten up most emails.

Edit your email for typos, spelling, and grammar mistakes.",How to Write an Email to Human Resources1," Check the human resources directory and see if there’s a person assigned to handle the type of problem you need addressed. There may also be a point of contact assigned to your department in the company. If you’re concerned about your issue being taken seriously, you can also reach out directly to the head of human resources.


Double check that only the person you want to contact is addressed in the email. Especially if this is a private or sensitive issue, you don’t want to send it to the wrong person by accident. Be especially careful to remove any lists that would send the email to a set group of employees.;
, A clear subject line communicating both your problem and the level of urgency you’re assigning to it will help human resources prioritize your problem. If you leave this line blank or unclear, your correspondence may get buried in someone’s inbox.Use lines such as: “Legal Problem - Action Required,” “Personal Circumstances Changing - Immediate Attention Needed,” “Urgent Policy Question,” or “Recent Interview - Thank You.”

, You want to set a formal and professional tone early on in this conversation. This will help human resources know that you’re treating the issue seriously. Even if you know the representative personally, remember that this is a professional, rather than just a friendly, discussion.Start with “Dear ” and end with “Sincerely” or “Thank you for your time, .”

, Keep your sentences short and to the point. Don’t provide more information than is necessary, as you don’t want the reader to get bogged down in the email. Don’t include any details that could confuse human resources about your issue. You can address complicated details in person., Explain the exact nature of your problem. Provide a timeline of when the issue started, or will start. Clarify whether you think this is a legal problem or an issue that can handled by the company itself.If you’re contacting human resources to ask about job opportunities, you won’t be introducing a problem. Rather, introduce yourself, and explain your past contact with the company. Be clear about what actions you expect or would like the representative to take.

, Human resources will want to know right away how to address legal or policy problems. Your documentation may affect their response, as it will help clarify both the seriousness of the issue and the legal repercussions a particular employee may be facing. Make your representative aware of any and all “proof” you have in your possession, and offer to bring it to an in-person meeting.


If possible, you’ll want proof of any legal problems to present to human resources. Unfortunately, most human resources departments will try to protect the company if they can.If you’re experiencing harassment or discrimination, keep a record of the dates of the incidents and save any written correspondence that includes incriminating language.
Retain both electronic and paper copies of any documentation you provide to human resources. You should keep the original, and provide human resources with copies.

, You may have already tried to solve the issue before you contacted human resources. Perhaps you had a conversation with your boss or co-worker, or even notified them that you’d be contacting human resources. The representative will appreciate having this information, as it will help them understand who’s already aware of the problem.For issues of changing personal circumstances, this communication may feel less formal. If you’re going on maternity or paternity leave, for example, you’ve likely already informed your boss of your status and are simply following through with human resources.

, A meeting where you sit face-to-face with your representative will help you discuss the problem in detail. This will provide the representative with the opportunity to ask any follow-up or clarification questions. Your email is the perfect place to begin scheduling that critical meeting. Inform them of blocks in your schedule, and ask them to plan accordingly., Human resources may want to contact you via phone, so include several methods of contact at the bottom of the email. This information can go directly below your name after you sign off from the correspondence. Double check the accuracy of the phone numbers and emails you’ve provided., Most email services have a spell-check service. Next, read through your email to catch grammatical mistakes, missing words, and issues of clarity."

Thank human resources for any response they send.,
Organize any necessary materials for your in-person meeting.,
Consider hiring legal counsel if you’re bringing up legal issues.,
Email a second time if you’ve waited a week with no response.",How to Write an Email to Human Resources2," First, thank the representative for taking the time to look into your case, as this will immediately set a tone of courtesy in your conversation. Be sure to reply to any response human resources sends quickly. This will indicate that you remain concerned about the problem, and it should also communicate your desire to address it sooner rather than later.

, Prepare yourself for the meeting by creating a special file folder containing any documents you plan to bring. If you have a policy question, bring the employee handbook with the specific policies bookmarked. This will help the meeting run smoothly once you arrive., If you’re worried about protecting yourself from any actions the company may take against you, talk to a lawyer. They can provide you with information about your rights, and you may decide to bring them to any in-person meetings. You might want to inform human resources of your plans to employ a lawyer if you choose to go this route.Be sure you’re aware of the costs associated with hiring a lawyer. Most will be costly, so you’ll need to weigh these budgetary concerns with your need for legal protection.

, A week is generally considered an appropriate amount of time to wait before sending a follow-up email. If you’re dealing with an especially urgent problem, you can send a follow-up after 24 hours. Rather than worrying that you’re nagging your representative, remember that they have many responsibilities. They may need a reminder that you’re one of them."
"
Solve the problem on your own if you can.,
Review your employee handbook to check on your company’s policies.,
Contact human resources immediately if you’re being harassed at work.,
Contact human resources if your personal circumstances are changing.,
Contact human resources if you need government protection.,
Contact human resources if you want access to job training.,
Ask human resources for help with necessary accommodations.,
Reach out to human resources if you’re looking for a job.,
Avoid contacting human resources with personal grievances.",How to Write an Email to Human Resources3," If you have a simple and non-legal issue that doesn’t relate to company policy, you may be able to address it on your own. If possible, discuss the problem with your boss or co-workers to troubleshoot the issue with them. Human resources will appreciate knowing any steps you took to find a solution before coming to them.If, for example, you feel your boss is scheduling you for too many weekends, talk to your boss first. You also don’t want to go to human resources with a non-critical complaint like “I don’t like my office space.”

, You may feel that you’re experiencing a violation of company policy. Before you contact human resources, re-read the specific policies having to do with your problem. You’ll want to be able to cite those examples in any discussions you have with human resources.For example, if you’re concerned you’re not receiving enough breaks during work hours, check the written rules on break times. It’s possible that your company only has an informal, rather than codified, break policy, which means that human resources can’t do much to help you in an official capacity.

, Do not hesitate to reach out if you’re experiencing any kind of verbal, physical, or sexual harassment from any source at work. You are legally protected from this kind of behavior, and human resources is obligated to help and protect you.Do not expect that human resources can have off-the-record conversations about these issues, however. Once you report it, they are required to act.

, Human resources can help you plan for any upcoming changes in your work situation, such as if you’re getting ready to take maternity leave. They’ll be able to ensure you receive all your benefits and coverage. They can also contact people at the company who need to be made aware of your changing circumstances., Certain situations may arise at work that entitle you to protection or compensation from the government. If, for example, you’re injured on the job, human resources can help you coordinate coverage of your medical expenses.This will likely require you to fill out paperwork with human resources, so be prepared for this process.

, There may be training or mentorship programs available that would allow you to advance in your company. Human resources can provide you with any necessary information about these options and possibly coordinate your entrance into these programs. This could be a great opportunity to take your career to the next level., Human resources can also help you address any individual needs you may have at work. Your work environment should include resources that allow you to enjoy the same opportunities to succeed as any other employee.If you feel that there aren’t appropriate handicapped resources, for example, human resources will address this problem. The department can also work with you to ensure there’s a designated place for nursing mothers.

, Occasionally, contacting a human resources representative at a particular company can allow you to receive information about current job openings or opportunities for informal, “informational” interviews with current employees. You can also contact human resources to say thank you for a recent interview you completed with their company.If you don’t receive a reply after a week, you can send one follow-up email. After that, you may need to let this company go., Remember that human resources works for the company first, so they’re not the people to go to if you just want to vent. While you absolutely shouldn’t avoid reporting any situations that make you feel uncomfortable or discriminated against, be careful to distinguish between issues that might simply be annoying or petty and more serious, legal problems."

Many companies have answers to common questions on various pages of their website, usually FAQs and support pages.


You can usually find access to these sections of a company website by scrolling all the way to the bottom of any page and clicking a link that says “Contact Us” or “Help” or “Customer Service.”

, If you don’t see a link for customer service at the bottom of their website, you may be able to use the search box. There is often either a field you can type into or the icon of a magnifying glass in the upper right hand corner of a company’s homepage. Type in search terms like “customer service” or “contact” and hit enter.


Often the “Contact Us” page is where companies will provide an email field for customers to submit their comments or complaints.

Check this page to make sure that you will be emailed a copy; if not, search the website for an email address to use in your personal email account so that you can keep a record of your correspondence.



, Search for the item you have a question about in the same search bar that you used to find the customer service email address. Searching for your issue or question this way can reveal the answer without having to send an email at all.This is essential to appearing intelligent and garnering respect when you do send an email. If you write about something that already appears on the website, the customer service team may see you as a demanding and lazy customer, and therefore not profitable.
Check the FAQs as well. Many times the answer to your question has already been asked and published in the form of a Frequently Asked Question. That’s why many websites have such a page: to keep customer service emails to a minimum.

, If you don’t find an answer to your question in the search bar or under the FAQs, you may be able to find it in the “About Us” or return policy pages. Again, scroll to the very bottom of the website and look at the links available. Search for any link that might contain the answer to your question: About Us, Index, Credit Card, Product Availability, Return Policy, Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, and so on.


Even if you don’t find an answer under one of these links, it is useful to look through them because you can use your extra knowledge of the company to get what you need from them in your email.

, Not all email communications with customer support have to be complaints or questions. You may simply want to thank them for their good customer service. Positive emails like this are welcomed by most companies just as much as emails posing questions.


The truth is that sometimes, registering a complaint by phone call is faster and more direct than an email. Email is great for submitting your gratitude or asking a question that doesn’t need an immediate answer, but if you want an issue resolved instantly, the best way is to call.

, Make your subject line meaningful and to the point. You want the customer service rep who looks at their inbox to notice yours first so that you get a faster response. Make the subject short, contain a summary of your email, and beg to be opened.For example: “Dog Chewed My Lifetime Warranty Chacos—Need Replacement”

, Once you’ve nailed down a solid subject line, the next step is to greet the customer service rep. Don’t just launch into your problem. You wouldn’t skip the greeting on a phone call or in person, would you? It can be as simple as “Dear Customer Service Team.”Try to find a name to insert in your greeting. Some smaller companies may list the names of their customer service reps, and utilizing this can make you seem more personable and desirable to work with.
You can end this greeting with a comma or colon. Dear Customer Service, OR Dear Customer Service:

, Maintain the rep’s respect by using standard type. Don’t use all caps, a mix of uppercase and lowercase caps, or script fonts. Just type using standard punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. This will help your email to be taken seriously., Keep a courteous tone, even if you are registering a complaint or expressing your frustration. You will be more valued as a customer and probably given more courteous treatment in return., After your greeting to the rep, introduce yourself. Offer your name and explain what type of customer you are, whether a first-time or repeat. In both cases, the rep will want to keep your business. If it is relevant, mention your geographic location (such as for an outdoors product or service).

, Use specific language in your email. Avoid using generic terms, like “my product;” instead, describe in detail what the product or service is and why this item is worth emailing about. Describe any relevant events associated with it so that the rep knows exactly what the problem is. Offering this information in the initial email prevents a long email conversation.


Use the URL of the product, if available, so that the rep has an immediate reference for your description.Include your order ID in the email as well, since most reps are going to ask you for it anyway. This ID number is how your order is tracked and maintained in their system., Get right to the point in your email. Don’t beat around the bush. Once you have greeted the rep and introduced yourself, start a new paragraph that tells the rep exactly what is going on, using the specific language mentioned in the previous step.


Directly ask for any concessions you want. You may feel shy about asking for them, but set that aside in your email. If you want something in exchange for a defective product, say so.

, Make sure your paragraphs are short. Keeping them to one, two, or at the most three sentences is easier on the eyes. It also allows the rep to quickly scan the email for how to prioritize it, and if your email is a block of text, they will likely lower it to the bottom of the list just because they don’t have time to figure out what you’re saying.

, End the email with a final sentence to summarize your request or compliment, followed by a salutation. Signing off as “Sincerely” works fine, but you can also leave off a salutation and just insert your email signature. You can also indicate your urgency by signing off with “Eagerly awaiting your reply,” or something along those lines.


An email signature is a short block of text that includes your name, occupation, and contact info. You can format an email signature in your email provider’s settings and set it to automatically appear in new messages.

, Try not to attach any documents to an email you are sending to someone for the first time. Many websites have spam filters that target emails with attachments, making it likely that your email will get moved to the trash before it is ever read.You should of course include an attachment if you are submitting an email application to a job and are asked to attach your resume as a Word document.
Don’t include any usernames, passwords, or credit card/payment information either.

, After your email is complete, don’t get excited and hit the submit button quite yet. You need to proofread this email, making sure no careless typos interfere with the excellence of your words. Even if you typed the email using your smartphone, the automatic “sent from my iPhone” tag does not excuse errors in grammar and punctuation that make you look less than professional., If you haven’t heard a reply to your email after a few days, it is likely that the email was caught in a spam filter or moved to the bottom of the stack. Send an email noting your previous email and asking if your first one has been received.

, You may not realize it, but part of maintaining a polite tone includes using good grammar and spelling. Taking care to communicate yourself clearly shows that you respect the other party, as well as demonstrates that you are generally a polite person.

, Don’t be pretentious, but do allow your education to shine through by using good vocabulary. Also, if you have scoured the company website and learned a bit about their policies, mention that you have read them and still can’t find an answer to your problem.

, Witty remarks and joking have their place, and that place is not in an email that you want to be taken seriously, at least not in the first correspondence. Such language can be interpreted as inappropriate, something you want to avoid when dealing with any business.


Once you build a rapport with a rep through a series of emails, joking will more readily be accepted and understood.

, Even though you may be angry at how a product or service has been handled, expressing this in an email will not get you the results you need. Communicating your issue with respect and courtesy will go much further than a mean or aggressive email.


Keep in mind that you can’t properly express emotion through text. If you are upset enough about your issue to want immediate attention, resorting to a phone call might be more effective., Finally, mentioning how loyal you are to a company and how grateful you have always been for their service in the past makes it easier for reps to appreciate your email and respond more quickly.

Having a blank subject line will also make you look lazy. Most importantly, it certainly won’t make your reader feel like they need to open or respond to your email quickly., Your subject line may feel like an afterthought that’s not as important as the actual content of your email. Since it’s the first thing your reader sees, however, it’s just as critical - if not more so! - as what’s inside. To make sure you dedicate enough time and attention to your subject line, write it before you write anything else., Unless you’re sending off a quick note to someone you know well, you should treat your emails like formal communications. Capitalize your subject lines in the same way you would capitalize the titles of your presentations.Remember a few basic rules to help you capitalize correctly. For example, always capitalize the first and last words of your subject lines. You should also always capitalize nouns (Mountain, Presentation, Building), pronouns (He, She, They), verbs (Go, Change), adverbs (Quickly, Slowly), and adjectives (Sloppy, Excellent). You should not capitalize articles (a, an, the), prepositions (in, out), or coordinating conjunctions (and, but)., While your subject lines should be grammatically correct, view them as titles rather than sentences that always need punctuation. Your subject lines don’t need to be capped with a period, question mark, or exclamation mark.


Be aware that some spam filters will automatically slate emails with punctuated subject lines to the junk mail filter.
You may occasionally want to use a question mark to grab your reader’s attention. Don’t overuse this strategy.
Connect multiple phrases in subject lines with dashes. For example, the subject line: “Scheduled Meeting for Tuesday - Your Attendance Required,” contains two distinct phrases connected with a dash.

, Your subject lines should be as brief as possible. This may occasionally require you to leave out some details in favor of others. It’s most important that your reader know what they need to do by when as soon as they read your subject line.It may not always be possible to keep your subject lines at or under 50 characters. Sometimes, you’ll go ten or so characters over. If you start to shoot for the 50-character rule, however, you’ll automatically begin writing shorter subject lines.

, What these words are will differ depending on the purpose of your email. Your name and title might need to come first in some emails, while the action required by you or the reader may be up front in others. Think about what will make your reader most likely to open your email, and put the words that correspond to that topic at the very beginning of the subject line.Generally, you should start your subject line off with a word that indicates why you’re contacting your reader. If you’ve recently changed office regulations, for example, write: “Changed Company Regulations - Needs Your Review Today.”

, Don’t include vague or unclear nouns and verbs in your subject line. Instead, use words that specifically indicate exactly what you want from your reader. This will cut down on the length of your subject line while still providing the details you need in your subject line.Instead of: “Contacting you to check out new info,” write: “Revised HR Rules - Needs Approval by Wed.” In the second version of the subject line, you’ve clarified exactly what the “new info” is, and why you’re contacting the reader. You’ve corrected any confusion as to whether the recipient needs to read the email and what they need to do once they open it.

, Tell the reader why you’re contacting them. Be as specific as possible. This will help the reader know right away whether they should open your message.A subject line asking for a letter of recommendation or reference could look like: “Requesting Reference for Tamara G. by Friday 6/2.”
If you’re offering your reader a benefit, try something like: “Change Your Oil at Jim’s 50% Off This Week Only.”, As soon as they see your email, your reader will want to know what they need to do. Having this knowledge immediately will prepare your reader to look for further details within the content of your note.Instead of writing, “Reaching Out for a Favor,” make your subject line: “Need Your Help Writing Project Proposal Next Week.” This lets the reader know not only that you’re asking for help, but also explains exactly what you hope the reader will do for you.

, If you don’t let the reader know when you need them to take action or respond, they may not open your email until tomorrow, next week, or even next month. This isn’t because your reader doesn’t want to help you. Most people receive tens or even hundreds of emails per day, so emails without clear deadlines are easily lost in the herd.If your email is especially important and needs immediate reply, you can use the words “Urgent,” “Critical,” or “Immediate Response Needed” to let your reader know that they should pay particular attention to this note.

, Sometimes, you’ll email people you’ve never met before. In these cases, it may be important for you to provide your reader with your title, company, or name so they have a reason to open your note. Otherwise, you may appear to be just a random person whose email can go straight to the trash!Maybe you’re a student getting in touch with a local politician for a school project. Write: “High School Senior Requesting Interview for Project, Due 6/24.”

, You may be getting in touch with this person because you’ve just met and are hoping to develop a closer relationship with them. Jog their memory in the subject line so they remember meeting you. They’ll be more likely to set up a follow-up if they recall your previous encounter.Perhaps you had a brief discussion at a conference or dinner about some of your mutual interests. Make your subject line: “Following Up on our Chat at Writers’ Conf, 4/30.”

, If someone else put you in touch with your recipient, it’s important that you clarify that fact. Your reader will be much more likely to open an email with a subject line that includes the name of someone they know, rather than an anonymous person they’ve never met. Your reader may also choose to reach out to your mutual contact to confirm the introduction.For example, write, “Dr. Smith’s Student @ Hopkins, Requesting Meeting Next Month.”

, You don’t want your reader to have trouble understanding your subject line. Avoid using overly long words and complex vocabulary. Pretend you’re sending your email to a middle schooler, and ask yourself whether they could understand each word in the subject line.Avoid using obscure vocabulary when a simpler word will do. Choose: “New Office Rules - Review and Respond Quickly,” instead of “New Office Rules - Review and Respond with Alacrity.” “Quickly” and “with alacrity” mean the same thing, but the first option is less off-putting and confusing.

, Many words can be shortened without leaving the reader confused. Use only common abbreviations and symbols, and read over your subject line to ensure there won’t be any confusion about your email’s purpose.


For example, days of the week can all be shortened. “@” is a common symbol for “at.” You can also use “RE:” to mean “about.” “EOM” may be used for “end of message,” and “EOD” may stand in for “end of day.”

, Just like any other part of your email, your subject line needs to be free of errors. This will ensure that you don’t look unprofessional or lazy right off the bat, before your reader even has a chance to open your note.


Email spell-checkers may not cover the subject lines, so be especially careful with spelling mistakes. If you’re worried, copy and paste the subject line into a Word or Google doc and run spellcheck there.
Your subject line may not need to be a complete sentence. However, avoid common grammatical errors such as confusing “they’re,” “their,” and “there” or “you’re” and “your.”

, The best way to ensure that your subject lines are simple, concise, and correctly written is to read them out loud to yourself. When you hear your words spoken, you’ll catch mistakes you wouldn’t if you had just checked them over on the screen.


If you’re in a public place, read the words softly under your breath.

If you want to ensure a customer automatically deletes your email upon reading it, fill it with a ton of questions. If you want to keep the customer interested, ask one or two questions and leave it at that., Rather using yes/no questions, ask question that elicit fuller answers. Instead of asking, ""Would you recommend us to a friend?"", ask ""How would you describe us to a friend?"" These kind of questions give you more information in the answers than a simple yes/no question., This makes the customer feel as though their opinion isn't just going to some giant inbox, where it may or may not be read or considered. You'll also likely get more candid feedback, if they know you'll respond.When you do respond, be candid and professional. In today's viral internet culture, you can ruin a company's reputation in a second if you respond with anything other than professionalism and sincerity.

, If a customer has a slow connection, they will likely delete the email immediately when they see it's failing to load. Remember that feedback is often more important to you than them. , You want your email to look clean and professional. An email with shoddy graphics or comic sans font is unlikely to impress your customers. Instead, use standard fonts like Times New Roman or Arial if you are unsure of a font, and keep excess graphics to a minimum., A single-column format is more flexible than multi-column designs. You'll also want to make sure your fonts aren't too small. You'll want the email to appear to advantage on laptops, phones, and tablets.

Make it easy.",How to Write an Email Asking for Donations," A headline is the first line of an email and functions like a title. Only about 15% of emails are ever opened, so writing a great headline is extremely important for keeping the attention of that 15% and compelling them to keep reading.In fact, in most email accounts, you can read the first line of an email in the field next to the subject, so headlines are not only a reason to keep reading an email, they are a reason to open one in the first place.


Use active verbs and nouns to grab attention, as well as bolding, centering, and a larger font.
Make the headline short and to the point, making the purpose of your email clear from the get-go. Compel the reader to think that reading this email will be useful, timely, and very relevant to their lives.
Answer the question the reader wants to know: What’s in it for me?Your subject line can tease the reader, be a call to action, be a current events subject, or be about a local place or event if your organization is strictly community-based.
A good headline example is, “New York City Challenges State Natural Gas Regulations in Court”

, Get to the point right off the bat. Readers don’t want to be wondering what your email is about halfway through, which is a reason they might delete the email without making any donation. Be very clear in this paragraph what you want the reader to do and why you are sending this email.


In this first paragraph, you should ask the reader for their donation. Although in person you might want to break it to them gently that you want money, emails demand your “ask” right at the beginning. Make this request easy to see, such as in bold or larger font.In your “ask,” tell readers what their money will do. If a small amount will do something if not everything, tell them. For example, if $50 will feed 100 children, you might get more responses than saying that you need $1,000 to build a hut.
Tell them it’s ok to say no. Statistics shows that more people give when they feel freedom to make the choice about giving, rather than feeling pressured to do so. Explain and describe your cause in this first paragraph so that it’s clear that you want the money in order to do something, not just get money for the sake of having money.

, Microcontent is all the short phrases and subheadings that decorate an email. You want to use your microcontent to highlight your main points so that readers who like to scan through the email before reading feel compelled to read the text.Microcontent includes headings, subheadings, the subject line, and links and buttons.
Use active verbs, descriptive adverbs, and nouns. Your goal is to get them to read the actual text.
A good heading might look like this: “Donate $50 to Save a Dolphin”
Make them bold or larger text so that they stand out. They tend to appear at the beginning of paragraphs or new sections.
Write simple subheadings. You may or may not have subheadings, but they are useful to include when you feel that a heading is too short. Follow the same principles—short, actionable, bold.

, Telling a story with your email is more engaging to readers. The body of your email will contain this story. Remember that stories have a beginning, middle, and end. You may want to use an emotionally charged story to compel readers to join your cause financially, one that has actually happened within your organization or as a result of your activity.

, Craft the body of your email in short, to-the-point paragraphs. This is because readers are worn down by the sheer amount of emails they receive. Limiting the length of your email makes you stand out.Bring in only one or two main points.
Be very concise, no matter how many edits and revisions the email needs to go through in order to achieve this.
Don’t include the history of why you’re asking for money. The uses that you give in the opening paragraph and your story in the body paragraphs are sufficient to explain why you need money.

, It may be tempting to add tons of links to your email, but this can become a distraction and easily derail the reader from your main message — to get a donation. An easy way to provide the curious reader with information without adding many distracting links is to have all relevant information on your website, then include a link to your website only. For instance, if there is research proving your statements are true, instead of linking directly to a long, complicated study for the reader to get lost in, have a link to that study on your website (and make sure the option to donate is prominent on your website).

, You may want to add one or two images to emphasize your point, but this is not necessary. In fact, colors and images can make emails feel like spam.Try to insert images only at the top or bottom, and restrict their use to when you feel an image is absolutely necessary for communicating your point or eliciting sympathy.


A useful image might be a subject of your charity experiencing the effects of donations, like an impoverished little girl receiving new clothes for the first time.
Inserting your logo in an unobtrusive location, like a bottom corner, can be an exception to this rule, as it provides instant reader recognition.

, The final portion of an email is the call to action, and making it stand out allows readers to scan it before they read all the reasons why they should donate. This serves to inform readers why you’re emailing them so that they stay engaged. Be clear about how to make the donation.


If a reader doesn’t know why they’re reading an email, they are much more likely to discard an email.
Make sure this final “ask” stands out from the rest of the email, and be very clear about what you are asking for. Make it have its own paragraph, be in bold or larger/different font, and contain a brightly-colored link or donate button.
If readers have to click the button or link, tell them to do so. If they have to reply to the email for further instructions, tell them to do this is no uncertain terms: “Click the button to save a monkey right now!” or “Hit your reply button this very instant and type the phrase ‘donation information’ into the body.”
It makes more sense to readers to be able to click a link right then, and you will likely get more donations this way, so try to provide a link or button to your organization.
Set up a website or online donation page so that readers can contribute online. This is what readers expect from a donation email anyway.

, If your email is long, it’s not easy to scan. Keeping paragraphs and headings short will ensure that your email gets a proper scan before the reader decides to continue reading or not.

, A formal letter sent in the mail from an organization to an individual is often formal and distant because of the mode of communication.However, an email, like a blog, is less formal in its tone.


Use second person “you” when addressing the reader.
Use familiar expressions to help the reader relate to you, like “It cost an arm and a leg,” or “He was knee-high to a grasshopper.”
Use direct, honest, open language when addressing the reader so that they feel connected and see you as authentic.

, Use basic fonts and streamline the visual appeal of the email. Don’t try to use a fancy, cursive font—just a basic serif font will do. And don’t use two different fonts for the headings and text. Simply bolding or making some text larger than others will emphasize points just fine.


Your email should also be easy to read from a language standpoint — your writing should be at an 8th-grade reading level. Don't get too wordy or complicated. Your writing should be clear, mistake-free (no grammar or spelling mistakes), and easy to read.

, If you want to make sure that your emails are being opened, or determine what kind of people read your emails more than others, you don’t have to wait for replies or donations. If you sign up for an email service like MailChimp, you can measure a whole list of different metrics each time you send an email in order to tailor your emails to your actual readers.You can review metrics like click-through rates, open rates, and read reports.
Open rates are especially helpful for determining what subject lines are popular, increasing how many people read your emails.
Another reason an email service is helpful is if you regularly send mass emails asking for donations, your email provider may become suspicious, even cutting you off as a suspected spammer. It also takes a lot of time to compile lists, break down your send-to list to fit the requirements of your email account (most email providers set a limit of around 50 recipients per email), responding to individuals, and dealing with emails that come back from inactive email addresses.

, Regularly review your email list to make sure you are sending it to people who are more likely to read it, especially ensuring that people who have expressed interest are on it. Your metrics will improve this way, and you will waste less time.

, Use a different tone with different groups of donors. For example, if you have a group of people who regularly respond to your emails, send them an email with a personal tone. Compile another list of readers you know don’t usually open your emails with a less formal tone. And have an email with an explanatory tone for first-time emails.


With an email service provider, you can also customize individual emails with the names of your addressees, like “Dear Henry.”

, To keep your audience engaged, you may want to provide them with encouraging data showing them how their money worked or is going to work. This information can go in the opening paragraph or the call to action, or both. People like to give when they know they are already doing good things.

, Don’t forget to send personal thank-yous to donors after you receive a donation. This is a simple act that can guarantee a repeat donation in the future. You want to send this email as promptly as possible; look at it as a type of receipt.


If you get a large amount of donors each month, you may want to consider creating a template so that you can paste it into an email draft and quickly customize it.

, Selling and buying a list of email addresses of potential donors is illegal according to the CAN SPAM Act of 2003.There are companies that will allow you to ""rent"" a list for one-time use, but this can be very expensive, as you will likely have to buy thousands of email addresses to see even small returns. It is probably better to put that money toward something else and look for more solid ways to build your email list.

, Put out a pen, a clipboard, and a few sheets of paper with space for interested parties to write their name and email address. Make sure the paper states that they are signing up for your email list.


Try a raffle or contest to get more names. At the event, try hosting a raffle or contest for those who sign up to your email list., It is easy to reach people through social media, and if you have compelling content, people may begin sharing your posts or calls for donations. Ask your followers to sign up for your email list so they never miss an important announcement.

, Your website should give visitors the opportunity to sign up for your email list. It doesn't need to be flashy, but it should be easy to find and sign up.

Proofread your email before sending it.",How to Write Professional Emails," Rather than filling the subject with one or two vague terms, let the recipient know up front what they can expect from your email. Otherwise, it might fail to make the impact that it’s supposed to. Be as specific as possible when supplying a subject for the email without becoming overly wordy.”Upcoming Health Inspector Visit” is a stronger subject title than just “Health Inspector”When in doubt, think about what prompted the email in the first place and describe the situation in a few words.;
, Stating your name and formal title or position will help the recipient tell who the message is from without the need for guesswork. This is especially important if you’re writing to someone you've never met. Even if your name is contained in your work email address, letting the other person know who you are is a common courtesy.Pique your recipient’s interest by highlighting a common connection or shared experience (“We met at the annual Women as Leaders conference in Toronto last year”).It's alright to skip the introduction if you're already acquainted with the person you're writing.

, The header of the email should consist of a brief but friendly greeting and the name of your recipient. In most cases, it’s perfectly fine to open with a simple “Dear Marie.” If the nature of your correspondence calls for something a little more formal, it's safest to use the recipient’s name alone as the greeting to keep things short and sweet.If you’re not on a first name basis with the person, stick with their last name to avoid potentially offending them.
When you don't know your recipient's name, or it's unclear who might be answering the email, you can either open with ""to whom it may concern"" or simply substitute the name of the company.
Keep in mind that most workplace emails are sent over public servers, and that other individuals may also be copied in your email. If privacy is a concern, you may wish to find a more discreet method of communication., Your reader is a busy person, so acknowledging them for taking the time to read your email is a gracious gesture. Additionally, this will be your first opportunity to inform them of your reason for writing. “Thank you for considering my research grant proposal” sets a friendly tone while telling the recipient what they need to know.Beginning an email by expressing your appreciation also demonstrates respect, which can keep the message from coming across as cold or impersonal.

, When sending business emails, it's important to be especially mindful of the language you employ to avoid confusion or misinterpretation. In general, you shouldn't say anything in an email to your boss or coworkers that you wouldn't say to them in person. Your words should always be calm, polite and congenial, even in situations where you don't feel that way yourself.Once you've written your email, read it back to yourself to determine whether you've captured the right tone.
Though it should go without saying, refrain from using any type of slang or profanity.
While humor is often a valuable quality in the workplace, work-related emails are usually not the right vehicle for it., As previously mentioned, you should assume that your recipient has a lot on their plate and make an effort not to take up too much of their time. After thanking them for their attention, get straight to the point. Don’t mince words or feel the need to come up with an overly detailed introduction. Unlike more casual methods of correspondence, professional emails should be polite yet direct.Try an introductory sentence like ""I'm writing to inform you that your membership has expired and needs to be renewed in person before you can continue receiving member benefits."" You can then follow up with whatever pertinent details the recipient needs in order to take action.
Most people tend to scan emails rather than reading each and every word. The nearer your main objective is to the beginning, the more likely your recipient is to pick up on it., There’s no sense in rambling aimlessly once you’ve stated your purpose. With the space you have remaining, provide any other details that you think are worth mentioning. Always use short, simple words and phrases to take as much of the work out of interpreting your meaning as possible.Observe the “five sentence rule”—messages shorter than five sentences may come off as brisk or rude, whereas anything longer than five sentences puts you in danger of losing your reader’s attention.If for some reason you have to include a large amount of information, do it as a separate attachment.

, Once you’ve stated your reason for writing, articulate to your reader exactly how you’d like for them to respond. If there’s something they need to know, tell them; if there’s something they need to do, ask them. By the time they finish reading your message, your recipient should be ready to formulate a response.Experienced communicators refer to this as a “call to action,” and it’s a good way to ensure that your dialogue maintains a distinct sense of purpose.A call to action in a professional email might say something like “it’s important that you memorize the security clearance number provided with this email” or “please update your summer availability by the end of the month.”

, Confronting your recipient with too much information at once can leave them feeling overwhelmed. It’s best to limit the scope of your email to one or two relevant subjects. Not only will this allow the reader to understand what’s going on much faster, it will also help you keep your message succinct.Multiple topics or requests should be reserved for multiple emails.

, Now that you’ve offered a call to action, give your reader a nudge in the right direction. A request to look over a financial report, for instance, might be accompanied by an entreaty like “let me know what you think of these numbers.” That way, the other party won’t be left wondering what to do with the information they’ve been given.Offering a definite time frame in which you’d like to hear back (“it would be ideal if we could have these documents organized before the meeting on Thursday”) may ensure a swifter response.
Try to reply to important emails within 24 hours., The signature at the bottom of the email should offer the recipient all the information they need about who you are so that there’s no need to introduce yourself at length within the message. Be sure to include your full name, the name of your company, your title or position, your preferred email address and a phone number at which you can be reached directly.

To save yourself some trouble, save your custom signature in whatever email platform you use so that it will be displayed automatically in future messages.Providing links to your social media accounts will give unfamiliar contacts a more complete picture of you.Don’t bog down your signature with unnecessary details, quotes or graphics., Go back over your message thoroughly to make sure it’s free of any typos, misspellings or unclear sentences. Careless mistakes can reflect poorly on you and the company you represent.Use your email platform’s spell-checker feature to avoid accidental oversights.
You can also take this time to make any last minute changes to the formatting that you think may make your email easier to digest."

Build an email list.,
Set a goal.,
Develop a message that will inspire the audience.,
Be specific.,
Instruct the email readers on how to donate.,
Send a thank you once a donation is received.",How to Write an Email Asking for Money," Sending an email asking for money to a large number of people will be a lot more effective than sending an individual email to people one by one. Develop a list based on individuals who have supported your organization in the past or who have been known to give money to organizations like yours in the past. Put their email addresses into a database so they can all get the same email at the same time.;
, Establish and communicate how much money is expected to be raised during the email fundraising campaign.

, To get the recipients to donate money, tell them a story about the good their money can do. Share information about the organization or the purpose behind your fundraising. Talk about what you need the money for, and describe the people or the cause which will benefit from it. Keep the tone of the email casual and authentic so as to resonate with the readers.

, State exactly how much money is needed to fund the program at hand. Ask for an actual dollar amount, and explain what will be provided for that amount.

, Give them an address to send a check to, a phone number to call, or a button to click that takes them to an online donation portal. Make it as easy as possible for them to give you money.

, Send another email expressing appreciation to the individuals who contribute, or follow up with a phone call. Continued communication can lead to continued donations.

Address the person best qualified to comment on your work.,
Be polite and humble in the email.,
Be specific in your feedback request.,
Send a thank-you email once they’ve responded.",How to Write an Email Asking for Feedback2," Oftentimes this will be the manager immediately above you. In any case, you should start with them, or with a more senior colleague or co-worker. They will have the experience to help you and give you the feedback you need., You should follow the norms in your office for emails. Humility goes a long way in asking for feedback, but don’t be so humble that your boss or manager thinks you know nothing about your job. Rather, frame the questions in ways that show your progress on a project or task.This will let the boss know you aren’t just sitting on your hands waiting for feedback. Also keep in mind the following tips.You can say, “I was working on the presentation for tomorrow when I ran into a snag with the format—I’m not sure if I’m following the company’s standard. I’ve attached the presentation. Do you have any suggestions for the format? Thank you for your help with this.”
Don’t forget to thank them in the email.

, This can help you avoid overly broad feedback that is unlikely to help you at your job. Avoid yes or no questions, unless necessary. Instead focus on specific parts of a project that need work. Try not to bombard your boss or co-worker with all the possible questions you could have about your job all at once.You can say, for example, “I wasn’t sure how to proceed with the Eastman file. The client hasn’t responded to my emails, and since it is a high-priority assignment, I thought it best to email you to see what I should do.”
If you are looking for more general feedback in the form of a review or report, request that specifically. Being polite, concise, and as specific as you can will help. For instance you could ask for a report on your efficiency or creativity. If you are asking for feedback from those who report to you, you may need to conduct an anonymous survey., If the feedback suggested you need a lot of improvement or that your work is not up to par, make sure to include a brief statement of how you’ll fix it. Give yourself time to process the emotions before immediately responding.Make sure you reply within 1-2 days at most.

Identify yourself.,
Keep it formal.,
Keep it brief.,
Don’t wait to ask for feedback until the night before an exam or due date.,
Use file formats your teacher has requested.,
Ask for feedback on a paper or exam you've already turned in.",How to Write an Email Asking for Feedback3," You teacher may have hundreds of students, especially if they’re a college professor. You’ll need to include your name (first and last), your class, and section. If you are still in high school, this might mean your period or time slot. This way you won’t waste the teacher’s time with making them figure out who you are, and they’ll spend more time on the feedback you need., Sometimes students struggle with this when first emailing teachers. You can say “Hi Dr. Smith” or “Dear Ms. Turner.” If your teacher has emailed you, do not be less formal than they have been. Keep the tone professional. Instead saying, “Hey, what do ya think of my paper? It isn’t the greatest,” say, “I’m not sure I understand the assignment. I had some specific questions regarding the paper.”, Don’t worry about explaining all the context of your questions unless the context is necessary for those questions. For instance if you’re requesting feedback on a possible extension, your teacher may need context, but if you are simply trying to ask a question about an assignment, don’t tell them the story about how your dog made you run late and why you’re emailing now (unless it’s very close to the assignment time), or anything else that might be irrelevant to the assignment at hand., Not only is your teacher not likely to give you feedback that close to a due date, they are likely to be irritated that you’ve waited to the last minute to ask them for feedback. If you must send last minute questions, be brief, specific, and apologetic. It will make the teacher more likely to respond, assuming they see the email in time., Oftentimes, the teacher will tell you on the syllabus what file formats they will accept for assignments or in emails. For instance, if your teacher specifies a .doc file, don’t send a .pdf or a .pages file. If you are unsure, you can send an .rtf or .pdf file, or simply ask., You simply need to email the professor and be polite. If the professor has office hours, you can visit those, or make an appointment. You can say, ""Dear Professor Smith, I didn't do as well on my exam as I expected. Could you help me work through some of the mistakes I made so I can do better on the next exam?"" Your professor should typically respond favorably to such a request.

Email someone you know first.,
Email an expert.,
Don’t cold-email someone a manuscript.,
Be specific about what you want from their feedback.,
Give your reader time to respond.,
Thank them for their help.",How to Write an Email Asking for Feedback4," If you want attentive feedback, the best person to give it is someone you know, preferably a friend or a colleague. When emailing someone you know for feedback, make sure you email them how you usually would. If you'd usually call them, then you should probably do that instead. Don't send the manuscript in the first email, unless you know they are likely to say yes (someone for whom you've read a manuscript, or someone who's offered to read yours).You can include a brief description or an abstract, depending on whether the person you're emailing is a friend or a colleague.

, If you really do need expert advice, send an email to an expert you know of and explain your project and why you need feedback. Don't be pushy, but rather kindly thank them for their consideration, and say, ""I understand if you don't have time to give me feedback."" You may even want to ask if they know anyone with the time and expertise who can help you if they can't., This will likely go unanswered, unless you specifically tell them you will pay for their help. If they are a famous author, they are unlikely to respond to such an email as they receive a ton of such emails.Instead, ask your friends, colleagues, professors, etc., first. They are more likely to be able to help you, and more likely to want to help you., If you only want positive feedback, tell them so. Tell them whether you detailed feedback, local or global feedback, and whether you want aesthetic, grammatical, or structural feedback. This can go a long way in helping your reader know what you want from them.Positive feedback need not be un-constructive. If they explain why they like what they like, you can learn a lot about your manuscript.If you get negative feedback, give yourself time to respond. If they are your friend, they likely only want to help. If they are a professor, no matter how angry or upset you feel, you should not respond in that manner. Instead, thank them for their help, and move on. After some time you may find that the feedback was helpful, even if the manner in which it was delivered was not., If you have asked for detailed feedback on a novel manuscript, don’t expect feedback within a day or even a week. It takes time to edit a manuscript of that length. If you have a deadline you’re working toward, let your reader know this. You can also simply ask them if they can have the edits done by a certain date. Remember they have their own life and obligations., If it is a friend, you might want to buy them a gift like a box of chocolates, or simply return the favor in time. If it is a professor, you may want to write a thank you email to let them know you appreciate their work and time. Forgetting to thank your reader can leave them feeling used and/or unappreciated, and may make them less likely to help you in the future."

Use a professional email address.,
Stick to a professional font.,
Use a short and accurate subject line.",How to Write a Formal Email1," Ideally, your email address should be a variation of your real name, not a username or nickname. Use periods, hyphens, or underscores to secure an e-mail address that's just your name, without extra numbers or letters, if you can.


For instance, coolguy0127@theemail.com will seem unprofessional. Meredith.Athena.Calhoun@theemail.com, however, is suitable.;
, Most email services now allow you the option to write using a variety of fonts and text styles. For a formal email, however, keep things conservative, with fonts like Times New Roman and Arial. Avoid decorative fonts like Comic Sans or Old English. In addition:Write your email in a legible font size, such as 12 point type.
Avoid special styles like italics, highlighting, or multicolored fonts unless they are warranted by the content and purpose of the email.
Do not use all caps. These make it seem like you are shouting at the recipient.

, Use keywords in the subject line that suggest exactly what you are writing about, in just a few words. This helps make sure that readers don’t overlook your email because the subject line is missing, is too vague, or suggests the email is unimportant.Subjects like “Quick question,” “Contacting you,” or “Email about an important matter” are too vague or obvious to be useful.
“Schedule, Guest List, Lunch Requests, and Meeting Overview for March 12th,” on the other hand, is overwhelmingly long and covers several topics.
“Meeting RE: damaged escalator on March 12th,” however is short and to the point. It alerts your recipient to a single primary topic, and a specific date.

Make sure you've got the right email address.,
Look at your own email address.,
If he doesn't know you then start your mail introducing yourself.,
Wait!,
Now, what do you wanna write ?,
It's time to start with the interesting part of your mail.,
You want to meet him alone?,
Or are you too shy to see him ?,
End your mail just with ""Bye!"",
Try to relax while waiting for an answer.,
If you see him at school or somewhere ... - if he has answered just say ""hello"" and maybe talk with him longer.",How to Write an Email to a Guy," Ask one of his friends or try if you can find his email address at his Internet profile. If you have the wrong address it could be very embarrassing!;
, Maybe it's too childish or something, then go and make a new one.

, Tell him a few facts about you and don't be afraid to let him know you're writing that email just because you're a bit shy. (If you know he will laugh about it - don't write it in the first mail, tell him later!)

, How to start? Hello, Hi, Hey, Dear xxx ... ? Don't be too formal, don't be too close - write ""Hey xxx"". That would be okay.

, You could start with some questions that are not that personal. Ask something bout the football match last week or just something like that. Write you've seen him at the cinema or another place, maybe he has seen you too - so tell him you were for example that girl sitting on the bench on the other side of the street. Please don't write a whole book, that's just the beginning part.

, You wanna see him again ? Tell him you will meet your friends at the park and that you would like to invite him there (maybe you ask him to bring some friends with him, if you don't wanna let him know you really like him.)

, If you're brave enough ask him out. You two could meet at the mall but remember your/his friends could be there too.

, Do you just wanna write mails only or rather meet him after you were writing with him for a month ? Then tell him about your aims, it's better to let him know what you really want.

, and your name - for your first mail that is fine.

, If he won't write back at the same day - chill. Maybe he's too busy to answer. If you've waited for one or two weeks without a sign ... then he's not interested or he deletes your mail. Be strong !

, If he has not answered yet don't say anything, but if he smiles, smile back.

Use email to contact human resources.",How to Write an Email," If you do not already have an email address, you will need to sign up with an email provider before proceeding. Thankfully, there are many free web-based email providers who you can get a free email address with for no cost. Some of the most popular ones include:


Gmail
Hotmail
Yahoo mail;
, Before you can write an email, you will need to open a new, blank message box to write your email in. The exact method varies depending on the service you use, but there will usually be a button toward the top of the page with a label like “Compose,” “New,” or “New Message.”


If you are uncertain about how to create a new message, check the help pages for your email service to learn more about it in greater detail.

, You do not need to list your own email address, but you do need to specify the email address of the person or people you intend to send the email to.


A space is often enough to separate multiple email addresses, but some services do request that you separate multiple addresses with a comma or some other form of punctuation. If this is the case, these instructions should be specified by your specific email provider.
Type the email address of the main receiver or receivers in the “To:” field. The main receiver usually refers to anyone whom the email is directly meant for or addressed to in the body of the email.
Type other email addresses in the “CC:” field. This is the “copy” field. A receiver should be listed in the “CC:” field if the email does not directly mention them but does refer to something that individual should be aware of.
Use the “BCC:” field to hide email addresses. If you do not want the receivers of an email to see a list of email addresses the message went to, you should type those email addresses in the “blind copy” field.

, Every email service will let you type a subject or title for your email in the “Subject” box.


The subject should be brief, but it should also give the recipient some idea of what the email is about.

For example, a casual email to a friend could simply say “What's Up?” If you are emailing with a question about an assignment, though, the subject line might read something like “Math homework.”
Similarly, a question to a supervisor or professor could be labeled with a subject line like “Question” or “Question about...” followed by a brief label describing the topic in question.


Note that a message without a subject will appear in a recipient's inbox with the label of “(no subject).”

, The body of your email should be written in the large text box below the subject line.


The body of each email should typically include a salutation, message, and closing.
The nature of email is fast, so you should generally keep the length of your message fairly short.

, After you finish typing your email, review it to verify that there are no spelling or grammar mistakes and that the message clearly addresses the matter you wanted to bring up. If the email is ready, hit the “Send” button on the message box in order to send it away to the listed recipients.

, Friendly emails should be reserved for loved ones, including friends, family, and romantic partners. If the message is casual in nature and you are sending it to someone you are on informal terms with, you can send a friendly email.


The only time you would not send a friendly email to a family or friend would be if you are sending a group email of an official nature, like a plea for donations or sale advertisement. Since these emails will likely be sent to people who you are not on casual terms with, as well, you must gear the email toward them.

, A subject line is not strictly essential, but it is still a good idea to include a subject. Keep it short, sweet, and to the point.


If you are just writing an email to catch up with a friend, you could include a humorous subject line or one as simple as ""Long time no see!""
If you are writing with a purpose, mention what that purpose is. For example, if you decide to write an email about a group outing, label the email with a subject that specifically mentions that outing.

, For a friendly email, this is not strictly necessary, but it is still a polite way to begin the body of your message.


Your salutation can be as simple as stating the person's name:

""Bob,""


Alternatively, you can include a friendly greeting with that name, as well:

""Hey Bob!""
""Hi Bob,""
""Morning Bob!""



, The body of your message should be easy to understand, but the tone should be informal and conversational.


Read your email and ask yourself if the content of the email sounds like the way you speak in person. If so, then you've achieved a good tone for a friendly email.
Use contractions. Contractions are not a part of formal writing, but they are a common part of everyday conversation, making them appropriate for a friendly email.Feel free to use slang. If desired, you can include Internet slang: ""thx"" instead of ""thanks,"" ""4"" instead of ""for,"" ""l8r"" instead of ""later,"" etc.
Also use emoticons when appropriate. :)

, Like salutations, a closing or signature is not strictly necessary for a friendly email, but it can be a good way to end the message.


Your closing can be as simple as your name:

""Jen""
""-Jen""


You can also get a little more creative with your closing:

""Later! Jen""
""This email will self-destruct in 3...2...1...""



, You should use a formal email when you are writing someone you are not on casual terms with. This includes, among others, supervisors, co-workers, clients and customers, instructors, and community or political officials.


Note that you may find that strict formal emails are not necessary with someone who falls into one of these categories once you build a working relationship with that person. When a ""formal"" email becomes a little too rigid, you should write a ""semi-formal"" email.

The tone of your message can be a little more conversational but you should stay away from Internet slang.
You should still include your signature, but you may not need to provide all of your contact information below your name.



, The subject should be brief but accurate. Get straight to the matter at hand.


Example:

""Essay question"" (when writing an email to a professor asking for details about an essay assignment)
""Application for Management Job Ad"" (when sending an email in response to a job ad)
""Problem with Part #00000"" (when typing an email to request customer service or to report a technical problem)



, A formal salutation should include the word ""Dear"" followed by the receiver's name. Use the receiver's last name and an appropriate title, and follow the salutation with a colon.Example:

""Dear Mr. Smith:""
""Dear Ms. Jones:""
""Dear Dr. Evans:""



, Restrict the content of your email to a few paragraphs that directly address the subject of your email. Use formal language and make sure that your spelling and grammar are accurate.


Avoid the use of contractions.
Do not use Internet slang or emoticons.

, The most common closing is ""Sincerely,"" but there are a few others that can work, as well. Keep the closing polite and follow it with a comma.


Other possible closings include:

Regards
Yours faithfully
Best regards
Thank you
Best wishes



, Include your full name below the closing of your email. Below your name, you may want to include your official title and any contact information that come in handy.


Your title, if you have one, should include your position and the name of the company or institution you are a part of.
Include your telephone number, fax number, and email address, at minimum. You may also wish to include your mailing address and website URL.

, If a friend, relative, or loved one has recently moved to a new location, write an email to check in by asking about how the move went, what the new neighborhood is like, and so on.

, If you got a casual friend's email address from a third party, it is important that you use your email to verify that the address is correct and that you quickly clarify who you are.

, If you're a girl writing an email to a guy for the first time, you might feel a little unnerved. This is especially true if the guy you're writing to is potential crush material. Try writing an email that seems casual yet intelligent and composed.


While it's a pretty risky move, you can also use email to tell a guy you like him.

, If you're a guy writing an email to a girl for the first time, the task may seem pretty daunting. Keep your cool and write a message that is both casual and well put together.

, If you want to be cute and playful with the recipient of your email, use the same sort of language you would use to flirt with that person in reality. Emoticons and “hugs and kisses” (xoxo) also come in handy.


Similarly, write a flirty email to someone on an dating website. For an email like this, though, you need to be both flirty and informative so that the recipient gets a good idea of who you are.

, In this digital age, the love email can be viewed as an equivalent of the love letter. If your romantic partner is away and you want to send a quick note expressing your love, email is the fastest way to do it.

, When sending in your resume and job application via email, you need to explain which job you are applying for, why you want it, and what qualifications you have that make you well-suited for the job. You should also include your resume as an attachment.


Similarly, you can also write an email applying for an internship. Describe what sort of internship you are looking for and how it will help you meet your career goals. Also provide reasons why you should be selected for the internship.

Send a follow-up email if you have not yet received a reply about the position you applied for.

, Emailing a professor may seem intimidating, but it is no more difficult than any other formal email. Your professor is likely a busy person, so keep your questions as concise as possible.


If your professor knows you well enough, you can also email your professor when asking for a letter of recommendation.

, A query letter is a letter asking an editor if he or she would consider accepting a work of writing for publication consideration. You need to describe the work in question well enough to give the editor a good idea of what it is about.

, If you have a human resources concern about your company, the fastest way to address it is by sending an email to the correct people in HR. Make sure that the email clearly addresses the issue.

Use a proper salutation.,
Introduce yourself in the first paragraph (if necessary).,
Prioritize the most important information.,
Get to the point.,
Keep it brief.,
Use formal language.,
Use a proper form of closing.",How to Write a Formal Email2," Always open a formal email with a salutation. Addressing the recipient by name (if known) is preferred. Include the person's title (Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr., etc.) with their last name, followed by a comma or a colon. You can precede the salutation with ""Dear..."" if you like.If you don't know the name of the person you're writing to, use a salutation like “Dear Sir/Madam,” “Dear Sir or Madam,” or “To whom it may concern.”
Do not use “Hello,” “Hey,” “Hi,” or other informal salutations.

, If you are writing to someone you don't have an existing relationship with, such as a new customer, hiring manager, or government official, tell them who you are and why you are writing. Do this in the first sentence or two of your email.


For example, when writing to a potential employer, you might say: ""My name is Earl Rivers. I'm contacting you to apply for the administrative assistant position listed on CareerXYZ.com.""

, Once you’ve introduced yourself and the general reason you’re writing, you can follow up with the body of your email. Put the most important content near the top. This respects your recipient’s time, and makes the purpose of your email clear.When writing to a government official, for instance, you might start by saying: ""My name is Arlene Rivers. I obtained your email address from the Westchester County Clerk website. I am writing to contest the traffic citation I received on December 31, 2009. ""

, For a formal email, it’s ok to be direct, as long as you are polite. Beating around the bush will only lose your reader and make it harder to figure out what you want or need from them.For instance, when writing to a professor, don’t waste space with unnecessary padding like: “This is Darlene Frankreich. Do you know me? CHEM 221 is my favorite class right now. I love the way the lectures are so organized. I can always follow along and know what will be on the tests. Speaking of tests, I was thinking about the next exam.”
Instead, it would be much clearer to write something like: “This is Darlene Frankreich. I’m a student in your CHEM 221 class, and I'm writing about a potential exam time conflict.”

, There’s no set length for how long an email should be. However, it’s a good idea to keep an email to about one (laptop or desktop size) screen length.If your email is relatively lengthy, break it up into short paragraphs. Insert a line break between each paragraph instead of indenting.

, Since formal emails are written for professional contexts, you’ll want to give a good impression. Use complete sentences and polite phrasing. Avoid things like:Slang
Unnecessary contractions
Emoticons and emojis
Profanity
Jokes

, As with salutations, there are a variety of closings that are acceptable in formal emails. Make sure to follow up with your full name and job title or other signature (if you have one). Examples of potential closings include:""Yours sincerely,""
""Yours cordially,""
""Respectfully,""
""Best,""
“Your student,”

Include any necessary attachments.,
Proofread your message for content, spelling, and grammar.,
Make sure that the email does not contain any sensitive information.",How to Write a Formal Email3," If you need to include any attachments, make sure to mention them in the body of the email to let the recipient know that they are included. Be courteous by trying to keep the number of attachments and their file size down, and by using common or widely compatible file types.For example, include a note like “I am attaching a copy of my resume and portfolio, in PDF format.”

, Don’t just rely on your email service’s spelling or grammar checker. Reading your email aloud or asking someone to proofread it is a great way to catch any typos, mistakes, or unclear phrases., Always keep in mind that email is not a secure communication system. Remember that email servers can be hacked, or that your recipient might intentionally or unintentionally share information that you didn’t want divulged.Avoid including things like passwords, account numbers, and confidential information in an email.

Identify the target audience.,
Determine the contents of the email.,
Start the real email.,
Write the middle section.,
Narrate your future assignment, and the importance of the past associations in achieving success in future.",How to Write a Farewell Email When Transferred Within the Company," Categorize them into multiple mailing lists, if required. For example, one may have been part of a core functional team, a cross-functional team, a task force, etc. This categorization may be important, because you may want to write (a) one email to all people/ mailing lists; (b) one (same) email, but separately to the mailing lists; and (c) separate emails to separate lists.
, The email is likely to about the past associations, and be nostalgic in tone. Hence, do not hurry the script. Dig into your past emails, blogs, handwritten notes, and photo gallery (your machine as well as on social network)., As with any script, there needs to be a beginning, a middle, and and end. Depending on your style, you may want to begin with a quote such as ""The woods are lovely, dark, and deep; but I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep"". Alternatively, you may begin with a simple ""Thanks"" (or you may wish to keep the thanks for the end). Or, you can also start with how you began your journey with that group/ project and mention some of the key highlights., You may choose to elaborate on the achievements, and note specific assignments along with the names of some people who have/ had made significant contributions towards your success. Writing specific names, though, is always tricky, since you'll always feel you've missed out on someone. But don't worry too much, because if you're feelings are genuine, the ""left out"" person will know it was not deliberate., Thank everyone (once again, if you've started like that as well) and close the note.

Wait a day.",How to Write an Email That People Will Read," Don't say it multiple times. Try not to be repetitive... (as you might be able to tell, it gets boring and annoying). A lot of people will start skipping over a lot of your email that way.;
, Being vague just leads to misunderstandings and no true delivery of information. Use numbers and specifics instead of adverbs and adjectives. ""The project is behind schedule with all of the important tasks,"" is not as clear as ""The project is a month late delivering the yoyos to the factory in New York."" (If you don't have numbers, still get rid of the adverbs and adjectives.)

, Does your reader know that delivery of the yo-yos are required so that the company can collect what it's owed? If you're not sure, remind them.

, Should those yoyos get shipped because the delay is embarrassing for the company, because it's costing children their ability to play with the yo-yos, or because it's costing the company tens of millions of dollars? Maybe all three, but one of those reasons (and it depends on your reader) will be enough to get the yoyos on the road.

, The best emails are ones that don't have a lot of vague parts to it. They concentrate on one thing.

, ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"" works for Dickens, not status reports.

Do a final edit.",How to Write a Lead Generation Email," Begin with a rough draft of the lead generation email that addresses all of the main points that you want to include.;
, As you write your rough draft, be sure to include key identification of your enterprise as well as the offers that you want to promote to customers. A lead generation email with unclear identification does not direct customers in the right way and can be confusing.

, Along with the business and product identification, work in an applicable talk or orienting clause toward the bottom of the lead generation email. This should have appropriate contact information and clear directions for those who want to take advantage of what you are promoting or advertising.

, When you have your rough draft in hand, you will want to provide some adaptations that can make the general lead generation email reach out to a particular customer in your email list. The level of personal adaptation depends on your previous market research, as well as many other factors.

, Go over your lead generation email after it is done and address any spelling or punctuation errors as well as grammar, typos or style problems.


Utilize good email structure. Some experts recommend sketching an outline with applicable points to drive the creation of your rough draft. It can also be helpful to follow a three-step process of penning the introduction, body and conclusion of an email or letter.
Roll out products in the lead generation email. The products or services in question should be fleshed out enough to give the reader an idea of what you are offering. Otherwise, the people reading the email may not make the connection between the promotion and the actual meat of the deal.
Prepare adequately for a response. Your lead generation email is part of a comprehensive master plan for driving commerce. Time and time again, companies have put serious work and effort into outreach but failed to come up with effective customer retention. Have a plan and put systems in place for using the leads that you get from your promotions..

, If it has a formal tone, you should respond in a formal way.


Try to give people the benefit of the doubt, if an email comes across as aggressive or rude. It is far more difficult to convey emotions in email than in a call.

, Try to respond to all important emails within 24 hours.


Use your email program's flagging option to place emails in order of priority in your inbox.

, For more confusing emails, read it 3 or 4 times.


If the email is confusing and the person can be called, pick up the phone and talk to them. Sometimes a short phone call can stop email replies from becoming distorted.

, You should reply to all, and take into account the managers or other departments that will use and see your email.


The more people who are copied in on the email, the more careful you should be when sending a reply. If you were copied in the cc line, you most likely do not need to respond.

, Unless you are close with the person and writing about personal matters that are unrelated to business, you should use a greeting, salutation and signature.

, For instance, if your boss sends out an email to all employees, but you have a specific question regarding it, only reply to your boss.

, It will be easier for the person to understand its importance and find it at a later date.

, People view emails on tablets, smart phones and other devices that do not always take into account formatting decisions. Remove italics, bolding and never write in all caps.

, This can be formal, such as ""Dear Mr. Gentry:"" or it can be less formal, such as ""Hello, Joe:""

, A little flattery can go a long way. Keep it very short.

, Anything that is included in the first paragraph will get the most emphasis.

, If there are more than 3 questions, copy and paste the questions in your reply, then answer them below the written question.


You can place a dash or bullet underneath the question to indicate your answer. Some people use different font colors, but this may not translate to all devices.

, As with greetings, do a formal greeting like ""Sincerely"" or a less formal ""Talk to you soon.""

, Many email programs have automatic signatures, but others require manual insertion.

,, Email is a short form of communication, and emails should aim to be only a couple of paragraphs, unless you are submitting a report.

Utilize links in your email if the response is extensive.,
Include additional support information to your customer.,
Consider the tone of the email.,
Politely conclude your email.,
Proofread your email.",How to Write a Customer Service Email," Good customer service is often considered quick, effective, and appreciative. Thus, you should make every effort to respond to a customer’s email as soon as you as acquire all of the necessary information. The best response time is between 24 hours and three days. Anything longer than that, the customer will question whether you received the email or if you simply do not care.
In today’s society, customers are conditioned to receive immediate responses to their questions, thus a quick reply can build customer confidence and, in return, become a competitive advantage.;
, Subject lines are important because they often determine whether an email is opened to be read or not. A blank subject line is most likely to get deleted or lost frustrating the customer who has to open the email before knowing what it is about. Keep the subject line brief and specific, and place the most important word at the beginning. Remember that most email subject lines only allow 60 characters, while a mobile phone shows just 25 to 30 characters. Placing the most important word first to draw immediate attention to the email.
Be careful not to use all capital letters or excessively use punctuation, like exclamation points. Both are perceived as yelling or excitement and not appropriate for a customer service emails.

, Customers appreciate personalized emails that are addressed to them by their name. This proves that they are not just a number and, instead, indicate that you appreciate their business by being respectful and polite. A personal email will make a stronger connection with the customer than an informal, generic email.
Choose a salutation that reflects your customer’s status. For example, a medical doctor should be addressed as “Dr.” If unknown, simply use the standard “Mr.” for men and “Ms.” for women.

, Similar to using the customer’s name, you should also use your name to personalize the email. After all, this should be framed as a conversation between two people rather than a transaction between a business and a customer. In addition to your name, include your title and contact information so that you establish some rapport for future communication.

, All customer email should be appreciated whether it is good or bad because it is an opportunity to improve your product and make stronger connections with your customer base. Customer emails are also a good source to discover what does and does not work with your product. If an apology is in order, go beyond saying “I’m sorry” by being more specific. Being more specific demonstrates that you actually read their email and understand the problem.
Any emails that focus on problems, you should readily admit that your company is having trouble resolving the issue. Hiding the problem is not a good idea since you are trying to build trust. Also, by admitting to the trouble, you let the customer know your company is working hard to resolve the issue.
Make sure to ask questions to dig deeper into the issue. This is a perfect opportunity as a company to conduct live research on your products. For example, “How can we improve our product?” gives you feedback on how to fix something that could potentially benefit and retain all other customers who are experiencing the same frustration.
Show appreciation by going beyond a simple “thank you.” The customer who took extra time to write an email deserves an equal amount of time (or more) getting a heart-felt thank you in return.

, In order to make sure the customer can easily follow or comprehend the sometimes difficult language of a complex product, avoid using words or instructions that only somebody in your industry would understand. Simplify your response to complex issues by using numbers or bullet points to clearly separate the various steps or actions that need to be taken.
Employ the ELI5 (Explain Like I’m 5) technique. Before sending instructions that are technical or extraordinarily difficult, try rereading them as if you are five-years-old so that you can ensure your customer will understand them. The key is to remain respectful and not to treat your customers like children.

, Remember to keep your email personalized and not to treat email as a reply to a FAQ. No doubt, as a customer service representative, you will come across the same relative questions on a daily basis. Although it might be simpler to have a stored response to these common questions, be careful how and when you use them. Using canned responses are acceptable, but always take time to personalize them so that customers do not feel that they have just been “copied-and-pasted” a reply.
Try keeping the canned response part of your reply to the detailed instructions part of your email, but change names, dates, and locations where it is suitable to keep some semblance of personalization.

, Nobody enjoys plowing through long emails trying to find the solution to their problem. It is tedious and annoying. Therefore, if you have to reply by giving extensive instructions or lengthy feedback consider placing links in the email so that customers can quickly find what they are looking for. If your instructions contain three continuous steps or more, consider placing a link to connect them to the information.
Customers are more likely to click on the link than read all of the steps or information.
Consider developing a knowledge base with helpful articles to FAQs. This way, you can provide links to this information, making it available to customers 24 hours a day.

, It is important to let the customer know exactly when they should be hearing about a solution, or at least an update. This is another way to build trust between you and the customer. Stay proactive in keeping your customer informed and keep them posted to any updates.
Anticipate any additional needs or concerns prior to the customer asking them.
Provide contact information so the customer can reply directly back to you. This keeps fewer people involved and quicker responses.

, Engaging customers through email emphasizes the importance of how words are used to express the appropriate attitude. Recent studies indicate that casual tone is preferred among the majority of customers (65%) except when they are being denied a request, then a more formal tone is preferred. Therefore, in most cases, you should strive to use a polite, personal, and professional tone. Avoid using slang or emoticons, all capital letters, and excessive punctuation as these are considered inappropriate even for casually toned emails.
Although “Sir” or “Madam” are appropriate, they are often considered too formal.
Try to be empathetic to the customer’s needs when replying to their problems.
Substitute positive for negative words. Positive words have a powerful way of influencing how your customer’s read your email.

, It is always a good idea to finish with a “thank you” for using your product or services.


Provide a personalized signature and end the email with “Sincerely,” or “Best Regards.”

, It is easy to skip over this process because so many emails are responding to the same or similar questions. In a busy day, it is easy to leave out words, miss typos, repeat words, or use the wrong punctuation.


In addition to grammar and word choice, try making your email look appealing by opening the page up with set margins, short and easy-to-read paragraphs, and bullet points for multiple steps.

A remailer is a service that receives emails with instructions on where to send them and then forwards them anonymously.,
Understand the difference between traceable remailers and untraceable remailers.,
Send your message to the remailer service you choose.",How to Send An Anonymous Email3," There are several types of remailers.


A pseudonymous remailer, also known as a nym (short for ""pseudonym"") server, replaces the real email address with a fake, untraceable one and then sends it on to the recipient. The recipient can then respond to the remailer. A cypherpunk remailer allows you to encrypt a message, send it to the remailer, who will then decrypt it and send it on to the recipient. This method protects your message from any monitoring of your outbox.
A Mixmaster remailer encrypts your messages before sending them and protects them from traffic analysis.
A Mixminion remailer also encrypts your messages and allows replies from recipients, unlike Mixmaster, which is one-way.

, There are benefits and downsides to both options.


Traceable remailers keep an internal log of its clients and their real email addresses so that they can forward on responses from message recipients.
Untraceable remailers do not keep a list of actual users, so message replies are not possible.

, The service you choose will include instructions, which will generally include the following steps. Address your email to the remailer and write a subject.
On the first line of the body of your email, type two colons (""::"").
On the second line, type “Anon-To:"" followed by the recipient's email address.
Leave one blank line and then type your message.
Send the email to the remailer.

Know what might be behind problems with MBOX.,
Be particularly alert if you are using Apple Mail.,
Find a fix.,
Rebuild the mailbox.,
Restore the preferences.,
Export mailboxes.",How to Resolve MBOX File Errors for Apple Mail," MBOX uses a single file format to store e-mails, so it is possible for the file to get over-sized due to the number of mails. Even one bulky e-mail could significantly increase the size of the entire file, or a problem with a single email could make the entire database corrupt or unusable.;
, The issues related to MBOX are most prominent while importing MBOX files into Apple Mail. Some of the most common errors while importing MBOX files into Apple Mail are as follows:


""Some messages could not be imported; the partially imported mailboxes are located in the mailbox named ""import"" in the mailboxes list.""
""Your Mail Index has been corrupted"". This message usually appears after updating to Mavericks OS.
You might face a situation where Mail messages suddenly go blank.

, There are several means to tackle such errors. Depending upon the severity of the error, there are different types of fixes, ranging from a simple rebuild to complex recovery operations. The total time taken to fix such issues depends solely upon the level of damage and the number of email messages with the folder.

, This is the simplest solution to get rid of any unwanted files clustered in the mailbox folders. You can also use this option to rebuild a mailbox to update the list of messages it has. For example, in case of missing or garbled messages you can use this option. In order to rebuild the mailbox:


Open the Apple Mail e-mail client.
Select the folders to be rebuilt
Click Mailbox -> Rebuild
Note: Locally stored messages and attachments are discarded, when you rebuild mailboxes for IMAP and Exchange accounts. In addition, the messages and attachments are downloaded again from the server to your Mac. However, your mailbox appears empty until the download is complete.

, This is the most crucial process, as removal of wrong files can add to your woes. This process recreates the .plist file to show up the email messages. However, it does not guarantee certainty of resolution. In order to restore the preferences:


Navigate to the following directory if you are working on any OS above 10.7 (OS X 10.7+)* :~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences. However, for OS X (10.4-10.6), the proper directory is ~/Library/Preferences.
Drag the file: com.apple.mail.plist to the Desktop.
The Application will allow creating a new preference file once you re-open Apple Mail.

, MBOX files use a very simple and robust format to keep emails and can be easily imported on any other platform. You can use the Exporting or Archiving feature to export the mails from Mac OS X. Exporting or Archiving allows you to move data to a user-specified location. This frees up the space and allows you to access mails anytime in future. It is advised to keep the folders together while exporting; however, you can select multiple folders to export. In order to export the mailboxes:


Locate the mailbox folder to be imported
Navigate to the root mailbox folder and locate the mailbox folder by double-clicking the .mbox file
Launch Apple Mail and click File->Import Mailboxes
Choose the e-mail client as Apple mail and click Continue
Locate the mbox file and click Choose
A confirmation screen pops up informing you about the location of the imported files.

, Add your own message above the forwarding text, enter your recipient(s), and press “Send”.


If this message has been forwarded to you from someone else, you may want to clean up the subject line. A “Fwd” tag is added every time the message is forwarded, which can make the subject line look cluttered.

Hit decline or accept, if the email includes an automated button.,
Click the return receipt option.,
Send a follow up email if you change your plans.",How to Reply to an RSVP Email," Your first step and decision will be to determine when you are going to the actual event. You should reflect on whether you’ll go to the event as soon as you get the RSVP email.


Consider the location of the event and if you’ll have to travel. For example, if someone invites you to an out-of-town wedding, you may need to buy airplane tickets to get there. This could be costly.
Plan to make sure you don’t have any other events that time and day.
Talk to your partner and other members of your family to make sure they are available. You may wind up declining for some members of your family and accepting for others.;
, Different types of occasions require different tones and levels of formality. Thus, you need to think about the occasion before replying to the invitation. This will help make sure that you’re not making a social misstep.


Is it an informal event. For example, is the occasion a BBQ that your neighbor is having for no reason and sent out an informal email about? This type of event may merit an informal tone in your reply and you may have less time to respond.
Is it a formal event. Events like weddings, birthday parties, Bar or Bat Mitzvahs require you to respond in a formal tone just as you were invited., After you’ve made your decision and reflected on the event, you’ll need to respond in a timely manner. Ultimately, this is one of the most important aspects of replying to an RSVP email, as you need to give the person sufficient notice of whether you are attending the event or not.


Read the invitation for a “RSVP by” date. This date is not a suggestion. Make sure you RSVP by the date.
Respond as quickly as you can. While the person who invited you may have given you a month or two to respond, this doesn’t mean you should take that entire window of time. Instead, you should respond as soon as you’ve made a concrete decision about whether you will attend., After you’ve decided how and when to reply, you’ll need to draft your letter. You’ll do so by beginning with the subject line. The subject line should include your acceptance or decline of the invitation and reflect the tone of the event.


For formal events, you should use a formal tone. For example, write “Roger and Anne Decline Your Invitation for the Ball and Banquet on May 11.”
For informal events, like your neighbor’s BBQ, you can write “Unable to make it to your BBQ on the 11th.”, Addressing the letter properly is important because it sets the tone of your response. In addition, by using an appropriate salutation, you’ll give the person who invited you to the event an idea of how you view them.


Choose salutations that might include “Dear,” “To,” or “My good friend,”
An informal event requires a simple addressing to the person who emailed you. For example, “Dear John and Marcy,”., The body of the message is perhaps the most important part of the email RSVP. It reflects the tone of the event and directly responds to the invitation. Some examples of how to accept or decline an invitation include:


A more informal event merits an informal reply, such as: “We really appreciate the invitation to your BBQ, Tom, but we’ll be out of town that day.”
A formal event merits a more formal tone. For example: ”The Higginson family accepts your invitation to Josh and Belinda’s wedding on the 5th of November 2019.” Another example is: ”John and Sarah Appleby happily accept your invitation to Marta Rodriguez’s Quinceanera.”
A formal decline might look like: “The Parker family will be unable to make it to Josh and Belinda’s wedding on the 5th of November, 2019.”, After writing your message, you need to sign the RSVP email. Signing the email is more than a mere formality – it represents the type of relationship you have with the person. It also signals how you feel about the person.


Pick a formal salutation. For example, pick from “Sincerely yours,” “Yours truly,” “Best wishes,” or “Best regards.”
Pick an informal salutation such as “Yours,” “Best,” “Regards,” or “Sincerely,”
Choose a sign-off that is appropriate for whether you are declining or accepting. For example, pick “With regrets,” or “Thank you.”
Sign your name after your ending phrase. For more informal events, feel free to sign your first name along with the first names of anyone else who was invited. For more formal events, sign the first names of everyone invited and last name after the last person’s name. In some circumstances, such as those in which you are very familiar with the person, you may sign “The Smith Family.”, Many people scheduling formal events are increasingly relying on automated RSVP services to send emails. If someone uses such a service to send you an RSVP email, the email will likely be generated from a third party. In addition, it will probably have buttons embedded in the email allowing you to click them for “accept” or “decline.”


There is no need to email the actual person if you receive one of these emails.
Once you’ve accepted or declined the invitation, the information will be sent to the third-party mailer and forwarded to the person who planned the event.
Automated third-party RSVP service emails are often used for semi-formal events like birthday parties, 4th of July gatherings, and more.

, If you’re worried about the person getting your reply, you may want to consider hitting the “return receipt” button on your email screen. By clicking this, your email service will have generated a confirmation email when the person you’re replying to receives or opens your reply. This way, you’ll know they got your message.


The return receipt may be in different locations depending on the email service you are using.
Some email services may not offer this option., On some rare occasions, you may have to change your response. Whether you’ve accepted and you find out you can’t attend, or you declined and you are suddenly able to go, you’ll have to contact the person who invited you to let them know.


If you accidently accepted an automated – button-based – RSVP email, you should email the person directly to correct your mistake.
If you need to decline an invitation you originally accepted, let them know. For instance, send them an email under the subject “Changing my RSVP” and write something like “Due to unforeseen events, Sarah and I will be unable to make it to your 20th anniversary party on the 14th. We apologize for the change and hope to see you soon.”
If you need to accept an invitation you already declined, tell the person. For example, email them under the subject heading “Changing my RSVP” and write “I would love to attend your event, if you still have the availability to host more guests.”
RSVP changes should be done as soon as you can. Informal events may be changed within several days of the event, however, changes to RSVPs in formal events (like weddings) should be done at least a month in advance."

Avoid unnecessary stress: Resign gracefully and leave things with your old employer on good terms; so, you can move on to your next endeavor without burning bridges.,
Consider talking to your manager in person, about your intentions.,
Avoid blindsiding them with an unexpected email.,
Don't be intimidated, but be polite and professional, above all.,
Follow business email format.,
Leave your manager feeling warmly toward you, rather than angry about your resignation, by maintaining a friendly tone.,
Leave gracefully.,
Beware of leaving without giving notice.",How to Resign by Email," It is customary to provide written notice of resignation, and if your employer will accept it, you might like to resign via email. You might present your situation using your phone (email), tablet, lap-/desk-top to do email (avoid using a fax, as the print is often not clean -- and although a postal letter should work, as well, that can be very slow).;
, If you have a good relationship with your leadership and your resignation might come as a surprise, it may be better to broach the subject in person, less formally, first..

, Be ready to provide notice in writing shortly after stating your intent to resign, to make sure there's a record of your notice.


Happy feelings for all depends on your job environment and the terms you're leaving on; if the situation is tense or your work environment is very formal, providing written notice immediately might be beneficial so that you have a paper trail of all communication regarding the resignation.

, Just because you're resigning doesn't mean you should air or discuss your grievances about your boss, coworkers, or company. You want to maintain good terms to maintain the lines of communication. You may need references from your employer in the future, and maintaining a network of positive work relationships can be very valuable to your career growth.

, There's generally no need for a letterhead on an email, but follow the conventions for regular business emails. State all the necessary and relevant details about your department, designation, work experience, date of leaving and the reason of leaving.


Open the email with a greeting. Try to match the tone normal to your company correspondence, erring a bit more on the formal side; if in doubt, be professional but friendly.
Mention clearly that you are intending to resign from your position. You may say something like, ""I hereby submit my resignation as effective on July 12, 2015"" or ""Please accept this email as notice of my resignation. My last day of employment will be July 12, 2016.""
Optionally, state the reason for your leaving straightforwardly. This isn't the time to air grievances or dive into your family drama, and giving a reason is unnecessary. If you do want to explain why, just let them know, for example, ""I have been offered a position elsewhere and decided to take it"". Or for instance, ""I'm leaving for personal reasons"".
Clearly note the last date of your job there, that is most agreeable with your employer.
Offer, if appropriate, to help with finding or training a replacement. You don't necessarily ""owe"" your employer that, but you may hold a lot of company knowledge that needs to be transferred to someone new. If you're willing to help with recruitment and knowledge transfer, state that.

, End the email on a sincere note:


Thank the employer for the opportunity they provided you in the company.
Point out something in particular that you appreciated about your role, the company environment, management or your employer.
Explain why you liked that, because sincerely explaining your appreciation about the job can make a lasting, powerful impression. It can reflect well upon your future career, including employment references.
Close with,""Kind Regards"" or ""Wishing you the best,"" followed by your name or signature.
Give it a final read to correct any grammatical or spelling errors.

, Try to focus on the positive; you may well have worked there for a considerable amount of time and would have learnt some valuable things there. A good rapport with the office colleagues goes a long way. You may also need their references in the future for your new job.


When you seek jobs after leaving one, you may be asked about your previous work experience, and you want it to be positive, as they may get in touch with your previous employers to talk and learn more about you.

, It's customary to give at least two weeks notice before leaving, and in more senior positions, it's often best to give even more. If you must leave without notice be aware of your company's policies. Some employment contracts specify requirements and consequences for failure to give notice, and it may affect the benefits you receive.It will almost certainly have an impact on your relationship with your former boss and coworkers.

Contact the email service.",How to Recover Deleted Email1," When you mark an email for deletion, it is typically sent to your Trash folder for a few days before it is permanently deleted. Different email services keep messages in the Trash for differing amounts of time, but emails may sit there for up to 30 days.


If you are using Outlook.com, click the Deleted option in the left menu, and then click the ""recover deleted messages"" link at the bottom of the page. Outlook will attempt to retrieve as many deleted emails as possible.;
, If your inbox is crowded, There's a good chance that the email you are looking for has simply been lost in the shuffle. You can use your email service's Search function to look for the email you want, or sort your inbox by date received and then browse for the day that you received the email.


You can try searching by the subject of the email, the sender's address, or keywords in the message itself.

, Many services allow you to reorganize your mail by placing them in folders or filing them under custom labels. It is not uncommon for people to forget that certain messages have been filed away, so go through your folders to ensure that you didn't accidentally file it somewhere it shouldn't be.

, Gmail archives messages instead of deleting them (unless you specifically choose ""Delete""). This means that the message is removed from your inbox but kept on your account to be retrieved later. You can access archived messages by searching for them or by clicking the ""All Mail"" option in the left menu.

, If you have deleted a message from your web-based email account and it is no longer in your Trash, it is usually no longer retrievable. You can try contacting your email service provider, but chances are that the message is gone for good.

Many people file the messages into custom folders. If you've accidentally files your message, it may be difficult to find. Use your email client's search function to try to track it down.

, If you are using an email client to access messages from a web-based email service like Gmail or Yahoo, your message may still exist online. Log into your account and check the Inbox, Trash, and any other locations for your missing message.

, This is only possible if you are using a Microsoft Exchange server for your email (typically in a corporate setting). Click the Folder tab, and then click the ""Recover Deleted Items"" button. Outlook will attempt to recover deleted messages from the Exchange server.Your Exchange administrator dictates how long messages are retained before they are permanently deleted.

, Your email server administrator may have backup copies of all the email messages that pass through the server. Contact the administrator to see if he or she can access the backups for your account. The chances of this succeeding depend on how your company manages its email servers.

, If you have permanently deleted emails from your email client, your last resort will be using a data recovery program. When files are deleted from a computer, they are marked to be overwritten by new data. If you haven't saved anything or accessed your hard drive since the message was deleted, there is a chance that it can be recovered.


As soon as you realize that you've accidentally deleted a message you need, avoid using your hard drive.
Use another computer to install a portable file recovery program on a USB drive. A portable recovery program is essential to ensure that your hard drive is not modified by the program being installed.
Some popular programs include PhotoRec, Recuva, Glary Undelete, and Puran File Recovery.
These programs can be used for recovering any type of file, including deleted email messages.
Using a recovery program is not guaranteed to recover your deleted messages. It is very possible that the files have been overwritten, even if you act immediately.

Recognize unsolicited commercial emails.,
Create a complicated email address.,
Create an alternate email account for site registrations and general Internet usage.,
Use a spam filter.,
Avoid putting your email address in its standard form on the Internet.,
Use discretion when forwarding emails.,
Read the privacy statement and any other terms before signing up for anything on the Internet.",How to Prevent Unsolicited Commercial Email,"


Such emails often have topics that are tailored to gain your curiosity. For example, it may indicate that it has a joke about a well-known figure or that action is required on your part.
These emails typically come from people or businesses that you do not know.
Such emails may identify the sender as having a common name, such as Joe.
Such emails occasionally use the names of well-known institutions, such as major banks or retailers. Keep in mind that your bank or any other legitimate business won't ask for personal information through an email.;
,


Spamming software looks for simple email addresses first.
Consider opening a new email account that has a more complicated name than your current account. For example, if your current name is Joe@yahoo.com, switch it to something that has a combination of numbers and letters that is more complicated.

,


Various Internet sites offer email accounts that are free to users.
Creating an alternate email account will allow you to only see your business and/or main email account for trusted purposes.
Many websites require you to submit an email address to use their services. Some of them then advertise their products or send other unwanted emails after receiving it, so it is best to use an alternate address for that purpose.
If you eventually get too many unsolicited emails, you can simply abandon or close the alternate account.

,


This is a tool that automatically helps identify and limit spam.
Some email providers automatically filter spam emails to a spam folder.
If your email provider does not have a spam filter, search for 1 on the Internet.

,


Posting your email address on forums, websites or anything else on the Internet allows spamming software to retrieve it for future use.
For example, put ""Joe at Yahoo dot com"" instead of Joe@yahoo.com. Your intended reader will still learn your email address without spamming software retrieving it.

,


Read the subject line and determine if it is worthwhile to open the email. For example, an urgent email forwarded from a manager at your place of employment that asks you to forward it to your group is acceptable, while a joke email from your cousin would unnecessarily expose any listed email addresses to potential slammers.

,


Make sure you are comfortable with the usage of your email address that is specified in such documents.
Make sure that your email address will not be sold to third parties.

Viewing someone’s photo is the first step people take before reading through someone’s profile and initiating or accepting a request to connect.
If you follow the guidelines described above, you will be able to choose a LinkedIn profile picture that is professional and represents you and your personal brand.;
, Going to a photographer who does professional headshots will guarantee your profile picture to be the most professional.


It may be beneficial for you to research your local photo studios because they may offer a professional headshot package. There may even be coupons and other deals.

, If you are unable to use a photographer for a professional headshot, you can do it yourself or choose a picture you may already have.


If you decide to take the picture at home, ask someone else to take the picture for you — no selfies! Even if the other person is not a photographer, it is best to have someone else take your picture to easily ensure better angles, lighting and distance.
To keep your picture professional, follow the advice given in the steps below.

, Choose an outfit that you would wear to the office or to an interview. This will help any potential employers that are viewing your profile to easily envision you in an office setting.A nice dress shirt with or without a jacket with limited accessories is fine.
Choose a solid dark color shirt and/or suit. This will avoid you from looking washed out and will make your photo look sharp.
See How to Dress Professionally for more information.

, A solid background will keep focus on you!

, Smiling as naturally as possible helps with your approachability. No cheesy or awkward smiles if you can help it! To learn how to smile more naturally, see this article.

, While animated avatars can be slightly funny and cute, it does not show your actual face and may be a turnoff to some potential connections. They may wonder if you have something to hide. People want to see the real you before connecting., Profile pictures are very small. Using a full body prevents others from seeing your face clearly and can look awkward.

, When you use busy backgrounds you take the focus away from you. Keeping it simple and professional cannot be stressed enough.

, Your LinkedIn profile is about you. Therefore, the picture should just be you, so there is no confusion as to who you are. Also, this is a professional site where you can make connections with those you do not personally know. Do you want pictures of your family shown to these people?

, This means someone else’s neck, arm, ear, etc. These are distractions. Again, the picture should contain you and only you in that small window. , Dramatic, funny or anything that can be viewed as unprofessional is not the place on LinkedIn. This includes “duck faces”, “selfies”, pictures with alcohol or cigarettes and use of hand gestures of any kind. Save these for other social media sites.

, It's not a good idea to be wearing casual clothes in your LInkedIn profile picture — you should always be dressed in a professional manner.


Tank tops, sleeveless shirts, no shirts and/or lots of cleavage must not be viewed in your profile picture.
Also try to avoid wearing excessive jewelry. When it comes to jewelry keep it simple! Do not use accessories that will be distracting in the picture.

, A personal brand is how you represent yourself across all mediums. It should be consistent, professional and leave a good impression on those who don’t know you.


A perfect LinkedIn profile picture will portray you as a strong and professional individual, encourage someone to read through your profile and entice the reader to make a connection.

, Putting a face to a name and accomplishments makes it easier to form connections with people you do not know. People are more inclined to request or accept a connection if the person looks nice and professional.


Non-approachable photos are those that seem arrogant or unprofessional such as unnecessary hand gestures, props or facial expressions.
For more information on how to look approachable, see this article.

, The purpose of using LinkedIn is to make connections that may be helpful to you in the future. Your photo will be the first step to making these meaningful connections.


As stated in the section above, representing yourself professionally and seeming approachable is key when choosing a perfect LinkedIn profile picture.

Keep your e-mails informative, not just advertisements.,

Be sure to grab business cards at parties, professional and social.,
Make sure your website has an easy way to grab your visitors' e-mail addresses; the form box can be labeled as ‘E-mail Updates’ or ‘Free Newsletter.’ (Be sure to remind them that you won’t sell or share their e-mail addresses.),
Add all your colleagues from your current position, and friends from your former positions.,
Add your vendors, suppliers, and those who prospect you to your e-mail list.,
Offer to send your colleagues e-newsletters to your list, or to include their tidbits And then ask if they would reciprocate.,
Take advantage of member lists.,
Hang around blogs and website forums.,
Seize upon CC (carbon copy).,
Don’t forget your professional neighbors: the businesses in the next suite, office, store, and around your block.",How to Grow Your Email List," Answer: “What’s in it for them? How can I educate them?” Less is more: E-mail newsletter articles should be less than 300 words, or have a “more” link (to your website).;
, And now, start asking for their e-mail addresses. Be sure to add your potential future customers.

, Keep ‘em in your loop; they should be updated and reminded continually. If you don’t have their e-mail address, re-connect with them. Or send them a personal letter (or postcard) about your newsletter. Position yourself as an expert by sending prospects your newsletter.

, Notice whether they have an e-mail address on it. If not, ask: “Is there a good way to keep in contact by e-mail?”

, Offer your e-newsletter in all your communication collaterals. Your e-mails should have an easy (and encouraging) “Send-to-a-Friend” forward button (a.k.a. “viral marketing”). Passively invite and remind through your e-mail signature.

, Ask them to forward your e-mail to those who’d find your information relevant. Don’t have their e-mail addresses? Call them up to re-ignite the relationship, or send them a postcard about your newsletter.

, Also, don’t forget about your family’s doctors and other personal service providers. They won’t say no to their customer!

, Swapping lists may constitute spamming – you can ask your friend to write a brief foreword endorsing you (make it simple for them to opt-out).

, You can get much more out of chambers of commerce than just member directories, but it is a quick way to build your e-mail list. “Dear fellow member,” while ineffective, at least shows you’re not a blatant spammer. If you send an e-newsletter, be sure to add an un-subscribe or opt-out link. Coupled with a business relationship, adding their addresses to your list is a great way to cultivate business.

, Again, stealing addresses – or sending members unsolicited e-mails - is technically spam. But through networks like LinkedIn, Craigslist, Myspace, etc., you can privately ask if they’d like to receive your newsletter. You can also publicly notify special interest forums about your free newsletter. Again, the more informative your “e-Value Proposition” is, the better the response will be.

, This is controversial, but friend of a friend... should be your friend, on your list. When you get e-mails publicly displaying other people’s addresses, don’t simply add them to your newsletter list (this would still be spam). You should introduce yourself to them, and ask if they’d like to receive your newsletter. Make sure the introduction is personal, private, or at least BCC (blind carbon copy) the other e-mail addresses!

, Hopefully, e-mail solicitation isn’t the only reason you want to get to know your neighbors. But this ulterior motive can help you develop relationships with those you’re around everyday. Likewise, your e-newsletter can be the impetus to reacquaint yourself with old friends from school. And of course, add your family and friends to your list; go ahead and “spam ‘em!”

Give each customer a personal response.,
Be clear but sincere.,
Offer live customer support.,
Make sure your support reps have all the answers.",How to Give Great Customer Service Using E Mail," When a customer sits down to e-mail your company, it's because he needs help. He chooses e-mail because it's quick, but his request still warrants a satisfying and personal response! Companies eager to save time and money often take automation too far in their customer support. Each customer has a unique question, and deserves a unique answer. Even if you save time by copying and pasting stock replies, change the opening and closing to make the message sound less robotic.;
, When responding to customers' e-mail, be sincere and to the point. Before sending a message, try turning the tables. Ask yourself, ""Would this answer satisfy me if I were the customer?"" Take that extra moment to give your customer the help he deserves. It might mean the difference between a satisfied customer and a credit card chargeback!

, E-mail has become an acceptable form of communication. But, live customer support is still necessary. The plethora of information available online can be overwhelming to customers, especially those new to the Internet! Single your company out from the crowd by providing customers with a real person to talk to. Live phone support is an invaluable way to foster trust. When your customer has reached the end of his Internet rope, and just needs help, your toll free number is the answer he's looking for.

, The presence of phone support will do no good if your staff doesn't know your product! Customer support reps should be warm and friendly, and willing to help with any aspect of your product. What a good feeling it is to talk to someone who feels confident in his product. It's even better if he's knowledgeable enough to solve your problem without transferring you all around the company!

, Replying to a received email is a big motivator; send your friend something neat, or ask him/her a question via email, and you may receive a response.

, The easiest way to get an email is to ask for one - if receiving an email is important to you, and your friend cares about your feelings, he or she will probably send one.

, Be up front: Say, ""Why haven't you emailed me?"" and hear what he or she has to say. There may be a perfectly reasonable answer.

, Let her or him stew for a while.


If your friend rings you, say you don't want to talk because she or he is not emailing you.

, Only resort to this if you have some very important reason that the friend needs to email you, since it might disrupt your friendship irrevocably. Let him or her know it's very important to you, and why; tell them your friendship is conditional on the email (if for some reason it is). How you approach this will depend on the scenario at hand - the important part is explaining just why it's so important, so that they can take your feelings and needs into account.

Take this opportunity to delete any parts of the forwarded message that you don't want your recipients to see. Once the email has been sent, you can't take it back! Look for the following things:


Carats (the bulky <<<>>> chains that can build up in a much-forwarded e-mail)
Mechanical errors: unnecessary extra lines/spaces; grammatical and spelling errors.
Attachments that are copies of the e-mail that you are forwarding. This is a waste of bandwidth and a golden opportunity for spammers/virus spreaders.
Banners that companies place at the bottom of your e-mails. These might read something like, ""Free emoticons for your email!"" or ""make free pc to phone calls with ----""

, In a long email thread, there is information left over from the people who got the message before you: specifically, their names and email addresses. As the messages get forwarded along, the list of addresses grows and grows. All it takes is for some poor friend to get a virus, and his/her computer can send that virus to every email address that has come across his computer.

It's algorithms scans through 20 different datasets to accurately figure out a person's email address. It also has a feature called ""Domain Search"" that lists all the people, job titles and email addresses of anybody from that domain.;
, You may be able to find the email you're looking for by scouring the company website. This is especially effective if the person runs their own business. Check the ""About,"" ""Contact,"" and ""Staff"" pages to see if the email you need is listed anywhere.If the website is run by the person you are trying to find an email for, visit whois.net and enter in the website address. The person may have their email listed in the contact information.

, You can find a lot of information with the right Google search. If the person you are looking for has a fairly unique name, you might be able to find that name simply by doing a search for it on an Internet search engine.


Include a modifier like ""email,"" ""email address,"" ""contact,"" ""contact information,"" or ""contact me.""

, If you can find the person on Twitter, you may be able to find their email in their profile. At the very least, you'll have a way that you can attempt to get in touch with them.


You can perform a Google search for ""person's name + twitter"" to find their Twitter handle easier.

, LinkedIn is another good resource for finding someone's email address, depending on their privacy settings.


Search for ""person's name + linkedin"" to quickly find their LinkedIn profile, if they have one. Use the company name as well if their name is common.

, You're less likely to be able to contact the person directly using these sites, as you'll typically need to be friends with them before you can see their contact information. Still, it may be worth a shot to find the person on these sites and even reach out through them.


See Find People on Facebook for tips on finding a specific person on Facebook when you don't have much to go on.

, If you can find a few public email addresses for employees at the same company as the person you're trying to find an email for, you may be able to infer their work email address.


Look for sales rep email addresses, tech support addresses, and other email addresses for individuals at the company that may be public.
Check the LinkedIn page for the company itself and see if any of the employees there have publicly-available email addresses.
Look for press releases if possible. These often contain the email address of the PR representative.

, If you are looking for any type of “official” address, like a work or school e-mail address, the username is likely to consist of elements from that person's first, last, and possibly middle names. Many companies assign email addresses to their employees that follow a common convention. Look at the email addresses you've found and see if you can come up with the address you're looking for based on what's there.For example, if the emails you found were formatted FirstLast@company.com, try plugging the person's name into that format.

, This can help you determine if the address is legitimate before you test it out. You may find links to their social networks, in which case you'll know you have the right email address.

, You can try a few more common company email structures, which may be used if the person shares a name with someone at the company or they are allowed to choose their own usernames:


first_last@company.com

firstinitialLast@company.com (e.g. brubble@company.com for Barney Rubble)
last@company.com
FirstMiddleinitialLast@company.com

, There are several email address guesser services available online. One of the easiest to use and free options is http://www.guesser.email/.

, The guesser will generate addresses based on this information. If you don't know the domain, start with the person's company domain (@company.com), then try other popular domains like @gmail.com or @icloud.com.


You can enter multiple domains by putting a comma in between each one.

, This will open your email client with all of the generated addresses added to the BCC line. This will allow you to send the same email to each message without the person knowing that you sent it to every permutation of the address.

, Make sure that your message is friendly and clear, so that you aren't mistaken for a spammer. You are likely not supposed to have this email address, so you'll need to be polite so that you don't get ignored.

, The message you compose will be sent to every address generated by the website. Wait to see if you get a response from any of the messages. Most will bounce back with an ""undeliverable"" message, but one may get through.

Decide on POP3 or IMAP.Your ISP may offer both POP3 and IMAP as options.,
Enter the mail server address and port into your mail client.",How to Find Incoming Mail Server1," This is the website for the company who provides you with internet connectivity and email services. Note that this method works for people who use the email address assigned by your ISP and won’t be helpful for web-based email users (like Hotmail or Gmail).


For example, if you use an email address provided by Comcast Xfinity (for example, yourname@comcast.net), go to http://www.xfinity.com. Centurylink users would visit http://www.centurylink.com.
There’s a chance your ISP doesn’t provide email addresses to its users. Their website should tell you either way.;
, Most ISP websites have these links prominently displayed.

, In the search results, look for links that say something like “Setting up email software.

”

If there’s no general “email software” link, click on one that’s more specific, like “Setting up Outlook” or “Setting up Mac Mail.” Any help files that explain how to set up email will contain the incoming mail server.
Xfinity users can click the “Internet” link, then “Email and Web Browsing.” In the search results, click “Using Email Client Programs with Comcast Email.”

, If you check mail on multiple devices (like a smartphone and a computer), use IMAP. If you only check your mail on one computer or phone, use POP3.


While almost all ISPs offer POP3, many don’t support IMAP. Centurylink, for example, only supports POP3 for home users.
If your goal is to receive messages addressed to your ISP-provided email address in a web-based email app like Gmail or Outlook, use POP3. Most ISPs have limits on how large your mailbox can be at any given time and POP3 keeps your mailbox clear by deleting the copy on your ISP’s server.

, Most ISPs use the standard POP3 port (110) for incoming mail. If your ISP supports Secure POP, the port number is usually 995. For ISPs that support Secure IMAP, the port is usually 993.


For example, Comcast Xfinity’s POP3 server is mail.comcast.net, and the port is 110. If your mail software supports it, you can also use the Secure POP protocol by changing the port to 995.Comcast Xfinity also provides IMAP in both regular and secure forms. The server is imap.comcast.net and the port is 143 (or 993 f you want to use Secure IMAP).

, Wait a few moments after you send yourself the email and then check your messages.


If you are using Gmail to receive POP or IMAP mail from another service, the message will take longer to arrive because Gmail only checks external mail about once per hour. To speed up the process, open your Gmail settings and click on “Accounts and Import.” Scroll down to the POP3 or IMAP settings and click “Check mail now.”
If you receive an error when trying to send a message, there may be an issue with your outgoing mail server (SMTP) settings. Verify the SMTP address and port by returning to the location you found the incoming mail server address, and checking it against what you’ve entered in your email app.

Gmail’s SMTP address is smtp.gmail.com, port 587 (port 465 for a secure connection).
Hotmail/Outlook’s SMTP address is smtp.live.com, port 25. No separate secure port is provided.
Yahoo’s SMTP address is smtp.mail.yahoo.com, port 465 or 587 (both are secure).
iCloud’s SMTP address is smtp.mail.me.com, port 587. No separate secure port is provided.

Compose your email’s subject.,
Include the proper salutations.,
Write the body of your message.,
Include a closing remark.,
Add a signature.",How to Format an Email," The subject line of an email message serves as a short summary of what the message is all about. Your subject line should be straightforward and concise that it’s able to give the recipient an idea on what is the topic of your email in just a few simple words.


In example, if you’re writing to someone about some business, do not complicate the subject line with too many details like “I like the car you’re driving. I love its blue color and the wheels are gorgeous.”
Clearly state your motive directly on the subject line. In example: “Interested buyer of your blue sedan.”;
, Don’t instantly start off the email with what you need to say. Include common salutations like “Greetings” or “Good day.” You wouldn’t want a random person go up and immediately talk to you without even greeting you, would you? It’s the same for emails.


To make your greeting more personal, include your recipient’s last name in your salutation.

, Depending on the kind of message you’re writing and who you’re sending it to, you can write it however you want.


If you’re writing to someone close to you, you could make your email sound personal; but if you’re writing a business letter, you need to keep the email as professional as you could.
You also need to keep in mind the format of your message. Do not use hard-to-read font styles, sizes, and formats, and avoid using capital letters. Uppercase letters, in the digital world, resembles shouting.

, Don’t just end your email where your message ends. Write closing remarks like “Sincerely,” “Best regards,” or anything you think that will go best with the email you’re composing.


Closing remarks should definitely go well with your email. Why? Because if you’re writing a business message, you wouldn’t want to write “Lovingly yours” as the closing remarks for your letter; it would be inappropriate.

, Although your email address already includes your name on every email you send, it’s still recommended that you include a signature along with every message you compose. Signatures can be just plain text or, if you want to be creative, pictures (like logos, brand marks, etc.).


Use the Signature option of whatever webmail or email client application you have to create your own signature.

Try a different e-mail provider.,
Separate large ZIP files.,
Use a custom file extension.,
Make sure your ZIP file attachment has completely uploaded before sending.",How to Email Zip Files1," Some e-mail providers may not allow you to send ZIP files for reasons such as security concerns or incapability with ZIP files.


Your recipient may not be able to open or extract ZIP files from their e-mail provider. Ask if they have a different e-mail that you could contact them with.;
, If you are compressing a large number of files, the size of you ZIP file may become too large for your e-mail provider to send. Most e-mail providers will have limits to the sizes of your attachments. Consider creating two or more ZIP files and sending these files in separate e-mails.


If you are sending an already compressed ZIP file, you will need to extract the files. Then compress them separately.

, Some e-mail providers may not allow ZIP files to be attached or only permit a limited list of file types that exclude ZIP files. You can change the extension of your ZIP file to trick your e-mail provider into thinking the file is not a ZIP file. The file should work exactly like a ZIP file but will just have a different extension name.


ZIP programs such as Winzip allow you to create custom file extensions.For example, if you type zea (zipped email attachment), the zipped attachments will be named ""file.zea"" rather than ""file.zip"". This would enable you to send the ZIP file without error.
It's important to note that this method does not always work. As well, you may need to download third party programs to change the extension name of your ZIP file.

, Most e-mail providers will warn you if a file has not been completely uploaded if you attempt to send your e-mail. As well, some e-mail providers will display the upload progress for you to watch.

Follow up afterwards by asking if they've received your email.",How to Ensure Your Email Gets Read," If you're sending an email to someone you know, tell them to look out for your email. If they're expecting it, they may see it sooner.



 ;
, If you're trying to get someone's attention, make sure the email address appears businesslike. Using a silly username might make someone skip right past your email altogether.





, Although ""URGENT!! READ NOW!!"" catches your eye, a lot of spam is labeled the very same way. It would be more appropriate to title it something like: ""RE: Our Meeting Last Thurs. (3/19 Proposals)"" or ""First Last name's Resume for XYZ Position"". Avoid tacking on all-capitalized words. If it truly is urgent, it doesn't need to be in all capitals, but you can add that onto the end of it.





, Even if they open your email, there's no guarantee they'll read it. Skip the fancy colors and fonts, just make it simple and readable. Break things into paragraphs instead of sending a giant wall of hard-to-read text. Use punctuation to separate your sentences and clarify your ideas.

, First make sure you have their most current and relevant email address. If it's a business matter, use their business contact information. If it's personal, don't clog up their business inbox with your email, send it to their off-the-clock email instead. Doing this will ensure it gets to the right place for a better chance of success.

, The appropriate time span depends on what you're sending and to whom it is being sent. If it's a business matter that has to be dealt with by the end of the day, follow up with the recipient later in the day and ask if they've received your email. If it's a personal matter that might take some time to read and respond to, allow them a couple of days or bring it up when you see/speak to them next. If it's a case of cold-calling (such as sending out resumes and the like), the appropriate follow-up time is often about a week.

, It is important to have a signature that includes your basic contact information, such as your full name, phone number, fax number, work number, work address, work email, etc. What you do not want to put in a formal email are lyrics in neon colors, lots of smiley faces, or inside jokes; the things that one might put on their signature in a casual email.

Use italics to emphasize a word or phrase.,
Use bold to mark something important.,
Use underlining to point out something that should be remembered.,
Use parentheses to make small notes that are relevant but separate to the sentence.",How to Express Yourself Over the Internet1," This can be used especially when a word being emphasized may affect the general meaning of a sentence. For example, ""You like PCs?"" could read ""You like PCs?"" in reply to someone saying that they prefer PCs, or it could read ""You like PCs?"" in reply to someone that says they ""actually like"" them.;
, Something important would be headings, topic sentences, etc. Also, something that they need to remember could be in bold to catch their eye. For example, a webpage could read, ""Do not keep in reach of children."" (notice how ""not"" is italicized to emphasize it?). It would catch the attention of the reader and they would remember it better.

, This could be used similar to the way bold text is used to convey something is important, except it would be less of a warning sign and more of a ""take note"" indicator.

, Be careful to not overuse or the text will seem choppy. For example, if you were talking about sites similar to wikiHow, you could use the phrase ""websites like wikiHow..."". However, if you were talking about sites in general, including wikiHow, you could put ""websites (like wikiHow)..."" (alternatively, you could also use ""websites, such as wikiHow,..."").

"
"
Use caps (uppercase text) to indicate a more informal emphasis or yelling.,
Use dashes to represent stumbling with your words.,
Use interjections like ""um"" or ""er"" to express that you're unsure of what you're saying.,
Use three periods (...) to represent a pause.,
Use up to three exclamation points or question marks when you want to add more emphasis to a small phrase.,
Use a period instead of an exclamation point when sarcastically saying something that would usually use one.,
Replace some letters for numbers when trying to give off a very sarcastic tone.,
Run all your words together when trying to imply speaking the sentence very quickly, either because it's something that is rather blunt/rude or you can't contain your excitement.,
Repeat a letter in a word multiple times to represent stretching out the sound.,
Use reaction faces occasionally in message boards to add a fun new dimension to saying how something makes you feel.,
Be random.,
Show that you're doing an action by putting a verb (sometimes with descriptive words) in-between two dashes or asterisks (*).,
Be creative!",How to Express Yourself Over the Internet2," ""NO!"" is read differently than ""No."" Be careful not to use excessively, however, or people will get annoyed.


You can occasionally use all lowercase text when implying a monotone in a short word or phrase, but it's used far less often than caps.

, ""Y-yeah, that's g-great!"" seems more hesitant than ""Yeah, that's great!"". Use when expressing feeling passive, nervous, or awkward.

, ""Yeah, um, that's great!"" is different than ""Yeah, that's great!"".

, Depending on context, it could mean you're angry, unsure, upset, or anything else a pause could mean when speaking normally. ""Yeah... that's great..."" has a different meaning than ""Yeah, that's great!"".

, You can use ""What???"" instead of ""What?"", ""Yes!!!"" instead of ""Yes!"", etc. Don't overuse, since it can make you seem ""nooby"", or newer and inexperienced with the Internet's culture.


You can also use an exclamation point and question mark together to emphasize a question. Put the question mark in front of the exclamation point or it won't look right. ""What?!"" is distinct from ""What?"".

, ""I'm so thrilled for you."" seems opposite of ""I'm so thrilled for you!"".

, ""y34h wh4t 4 c00l 1d34!"" is much different than ""Yeah, what a cool idea!"". Don't use this too often (as to not just be seen as annoying) and don't do it when mimicking your friends or they could get insulted.


Using some bad grammar/spelling phonetically while being sarcastic also helps get your point across. ""yah like wat a kewl idea"" is very different than ""Yeah, what a cool idea!"".

, ""ohmygoshgoogleplusisout"" is very different than ""Oh my gosh, Google+ is out!"".

, ""Whaaaaat?!"" is different than ""What?!"".

, They're generally pictures or animated GIFs of drawings or television shows where a character is showing an extreme expression, often with words on them. When saying what a reaction face represents, people often use "">mfw ____"" (my face when ____) before inserting the image. For example, one could say "">mfw the storm knocks out the electricity"" and then show a picture of an anime character rampaging.


Sparingly use reaction faces in places like chatrooms where people have to click on a link to see the face. That gets annoying.

, Every once in a while, you can hit random keys on the keyboard to show frustration. The more keys hit, the more frustration it implies. ""Arrrgjkdfhldhbgfj my dog won't shut up!"" is different than ""My dog won't shut up!"". Oftentimes, like in the example, ""arrrg"" is added in front of the random characters.

, Generally, these should be included outside the punctuation of the sentence. ""No, I didn't. *growls*"" is more descriptive than ""No, I didn't."". It can also show more personality through what you write.

, Think about the tone of voice and everything else you would use to say what you're typing, and manifest it in what you're typing. People are always finding new ways to express themselves in text over the Internet!

Consider the specific reasons why you're looking to contact CBS Sports.,
Access the CBS Sports website and click the 'Contact Us' tab at the bottom of the home page.,
Choose the applicable department.,
Select the 'Enter a Question' or 'Feedback' tabs.,
Begin typing your email.,
Stick to proper letter form.,
Get to the point quickly.,
End your email with a thank-you.,
Await a response.",How to Email CBS Sports," Before you even set to contacting CBS Sports, it's important to have a very clear and legitimate reason why you want to get a hold of them. Emails with a well and clearly stated intention or motivation are far more likely to get responses.


Due to the fact that large corporations like CBS Sports are multi-divisional, having at least a broad idea of what you want to talk about is usually mandatory in order to select the proper communications channel.;
, CBS Sports is a sprawling site, with a wide number of options to choose from. Luckily, their contact information can be found fairly easily at the bottom of the page. Scroll to the bottom of whatever CBS Sports webpage you are on. In smaller grey writing, you should see several options. Click on 'Contact Us', which will bring you to the contact list you're looking for.

, On CBS Sports' main website, the 'contact us' page links to three separate sets of contact info: All Access, College Sports, and Fantasy League. For the majority of consumer feedback, the All Access tab will be your bet. Click on the field that applies to you. This will bring you to a FAQ and contact page specific to your chosen field.

, The next choice is meant to categorize user feedback as queries (emails with the expectation of a response) or simple feedback, which may or may not warrant a response depending on the content of the message. If you have a close idea what you want to say to CBS Sports, you should have no trouble in deciding whether it is better suited as a question or a statement of opinion. With that, you'll be ready to input your message.

, Now that you've gotten past the legwork, it's time to get down to business and write your email. While the content itself could be anything depending on what spurned your interest in writing them, a few basic rules should be followed. First of all, no matter what your grievances may be, you should make an effort to write in as pleasant and civil a tone as possible. , Adhere to the basic standards of letter writing. This includes keeping your spelling and punctuation in good form. Poor writing won't get you taken seriously by the recipient of the email. Although you don't need to be worrying at all about perfection, write your email as if you were writing a professional correspondence to a co-worker.


Don't forget to include your own contact info somewhere in the email, just to make sure they know who to write back to afterwards.

, A CBS representative on the receiving end of your missive is likely to be going through a number of requests on any given day, so it's important you get straight to the point of your inquiry. Do you have a question to ask? Get to the root of it on your first or second sentence. If you have an opinion or feedback regarding CBS Sports' programming, you can take a little longer to get to the meaning.


Introducing your email varies depending on whether you're writing for a question or merely as feedback. With a question, you should introduce yourself and your relation to their programming (as a viewer, a prospective advertiser etc.) and dive straight into your query. With feedback, you may want to add a line or two specifying why your feedback is significant; for instance, you might state that you have been a dedicated viewer of their programming for a given number of years.

, Don't forgive to demonstrate gratitude for the CBS Sports representative to have taken the time to consider your message. This is important even if your email was otherwise expressing concern or anger. Include a thank you alongside your name at the end in any case and show some warmth. They'll be that much more likely to respond favorably to your message if you're considerate.


Whatever you do or say, keep a level head. You won't get anywhere making enemies of someone trying to do his job.

, Once you have sent the email, it's time to play the waiting game. Depending on the traffic of the site, a response could take anywhere from a few hours to several days. CBS Sports is dedicated to responding to as many of their questions as possible, but be prepared to wait a wile for a proper answer. Again, it all depends on the site traffic, as well as the department you sent your message to.


If for whatever reason you don't get a response back in time, you might try rewriting it and sending again. Chances are it may have been overlooked or deemed unsuited to a response by one person. The second time you send a message, it may be read (and properly responded to) by someone else.

Move into a well-lit area to improve poor video quality.,
Switch to an external webcam.,
Upgrade to the latest version of Skype.",How to Troubleshoot a Skype Call4," If you have a lot of apps running on your computer or phone, try closing them before making a call. Having too many apps open can drain your resources, which can cause dropped calls, choppy audio, and poor video connections.

, The best way to hear someone clearly is to use headphones or a headset. Try plugging some headphones into your phone or computer and see if it helps you better hear your friend (and ask your friend to do the same for you).


If you are using speakerphone on a smartphone, try switching to handset mode instead. Tap the speaker icon to change to handset mode, and then hold the receiver to your ear as you would a normal phone call.

, If you’re making audio or video calls over a wireless network, try a wired connection instead. Run an Ethernet cable from your computer’s networking card to the LAN port on your router. If this is not possible, try disconnecting other devices sharing the wireless network, or moving closer to the wireless access point.

, Poor Skype call quality can be the result of a slow Internet connection.Check the speed of your Internet connection and compare it to what you should be receiving from your service provider. Have your friend do the same.


If you or your friend determine that your connection is slow, you may still be able to chat on Skype by turning off the video portion of the call. Tap the video icon in the call to switch to an audio call.

, If the audio portion of your call is fine but your friend reports poor video quality, try moving into a room with better lighting.Overhead lighting is great, but you can also improve quality by positioning a lamp behind your camera, with the light shining on you.

, If your computer’s built-in webcam still underperforms, consider an external USB device. Skype recommends any external Logitech or Microsoft LifeCam model, as well as the HP HD WebCam HD-2300.If you’re already using an external webcam but experiencing poor video quality, try plugging it into a different USB port. Some computers have multiple USB ports that have different speeds—make sure your camera is plugged into the fastest port, if applicable.

, To be sure you’re getting the best possible performance, be sure to use the most up-to-date version of Skype on your computer or mobile device.The person with whom you’re chatting should also update their version of Skype.

Be professional when emailing a formal correspondence.,
Remain professional if you want to use your business email efficiently.,
Learn the rules of email etiquette.,
Use email only when appropriate.,
Remember to include a reference in your subject line that will inform the recipient of the email's content.",How to Effectively use Email at Work," If you don't stay in control of checking your e-mail, you may end up wasting too much of your work day checking it. Try to respond to emails immediately.;
, Effective use of work email includes deleting emails you know you won't need as you read them and filing those that you will need in specified folders. If you organize your e-mails on a regular basis, you won't clutter up your inbox, thus causing anxiety every time you open it.

, This way you won't have to keep adding it manually, risking the possibility of misspellings or even forgetting the information altogether.

, Just like most website content, paragraphs should contain approximately 20 words for easier reading on the part of the recipient. Long emails can be daunting and exhausting to look at, never mind read.

, Refrain from using emoticons such as smiley faces and always re-read and spellcheck your message before sending it. Your credibility is behind every email you send.

, Communicating via email is not an excuse to abandon some old-school writing etiquette. Address the recipient as you would in a formal letter and always add an appropriate salutation, such as, ""sincerely,"" ""regards,"" and ""best.""

, For example, typing in all capitals is considered yelling in email language. Try to stick to one color, preferably black, a plain text, and an easy to read font. This will ensure that your recipient will be able to read your emails without problem.

, Even in this Internet age, there are times when email is just not appropriate and writing a formal letter the old fashioned way or even calling the person you wish to communicate with is more suitable. Confidential letters and documents should always be written in letter form, whereas emails should be reserved for shorter correspondences.

, By doing this, the recipient will know what your email is about and will be able to file it accordingly, and find is easily at a later date, if necessary.

Build your email list.The three most important groups to market to via email are your current customers, past customers, and prospective customers.,
Promise privacy.Many people will be reluctant to sign up for an email list unless you assure them you will keep their email addresses and personal information private.,
Create different email lists.",How to Do Email Marketing1," Use a spreadsheet to create a database of their names and email addresses. If you don’t already have the email addresses, you’ll need to start collecting them. To build your list, use your website, storefront, front desk, and every phone call to request your visitor's email address.Keep a clipboard at the front desk or storefront of your business for people to sign up for your email list.
Entice them into signing up by offering discount coupons and other advantages that will only be sent via email.
All you need is their name and email address to get started. Don’t ask for too much information at this point.;
, This should be promised upfront. Along with the initial promise, you should development a privacy statement that will be included at the bottom of every email you send out. This statement should be brief and to the point.


Privacy statements should state that your company will never give out email addresses to third parties and will only be used for the purposes of marketing your company’s products and services.
It should also be mentioned that the email content is confidential and intended only for the individual named.
Also state that if the email has been received in error, the recipient should notify the company so that their email can be deleted from the email list.Example: Your privacy is important to us. We will not disclose your personal information to any third party unless you have given us consent or we are required to do so by law. If you do not wish to receive communication from this company, you can opt out by replying to this email and notifying us., Keep email addresses organized in spreadsheets and make sure you separate them. At minimum, you should have the emails broken into lists of current customers, past customers and prospective customers. Creating separate email lists allows you to send different emails to the groups, each with their own targeted content. As you go along, you can get more specific with your lists for even better targeting.


Keeping separate lists also helps you to prevent spamming them with irrelevant content, which reflects poorly on your company.It’s important to build relationships with your recipients through email marketing.Targeted lists with relevant content will help you do that.

Demonstrate how emails can waste time.,
Devise an alternate plan.,
Create new information dissemination rules.,
Ease the company into the new method.",How to Eliminate Email in Your Workplace," The best way to forge adoption at work is to clearly demonstrate how an initiative will save time and/or money. If you can prove banning emails will increase efficiencies you’ll have a better shot at having your idea approved or accepted.


Conduct scientific research on how emails waste time and reduce efficiencies. Take a two-pronged approach by doing some independent Internet research involving studies surrounding emails and the workplace, but also implement a non scientific internal survey. Include both an employee questionnaire and observation to determine how much time workers spend not only checking and writing email but even removing focus from their work when they hear an income email hit their inbox. Stopping in the middle of work to answer emails can be a distraction. According to Daily Mail reporter, Peter Allen, it takes the average worker approximately 64 seconds to refocus on work after reading emails. If you are stopping to read a message every time you receive an email, you’ll never have a steady stream of focus.
Time how long it takes most workers to compose an email versus other communication methods. Recruit a random sample of workers and time how long it takes them to compose a regular email. Average the times to arrive at a mean number. Then compare email times to other methods (use the same method of tracking and measuring) of communications including text messaging and phone calls to see which method is most efficient.
Measure the amount of time workers spend trying to deal with technology issues surrounding email. If your network crashes or experiences interruptions, workers may spend a considerable amount of time trying to figure out how to get an email sent instead of returning focus back to their job. Create a survey and ask a random sampling of employees how much time they spend dealing with I/T issues surrounding emails and how often.;
, Simply putting a ban on emails won’t gain much acceptance unless you have an alternate, better idea. Before you even approach employees with your idea, be ready to present your alternative plan.


Mass emailing that does not involve every party. Begin with baby steps by first suggesting that all mass emails should be banned. If only a small percentage of emails pertain to individual worker’s jobs, consider adding a huge message board to your break room where notices can be posted instead of having mass emails be sent.
Increase voicemail usage. Expand voicemail capabilities. In some respect, people sent emails that could easily be communicated by phone because they don’t want to deal with a phone conversation. Provide employees with options for calls to go directly to voicemail (with a 10 to 20 second time limit) or another vocal messaging system.
Consider text messages. Unlike email a text needs to be brief and to the point. Do all employees have texting capabilities and to what extent? In some cases, workers may not even own a cell phone or have a phone with limited capabilities so determine if this is something that would work in your organization first.
Designing an Intranet. In the event that mass emails involving either the entire organization or individual department seems to be most disruptive consider creating a company Intranet. Your information technology officer can most likely create a system that allow for individual and group exchange, posting vital information and even interactive training.
Consider using Skype or another form to communicate off site. Email may be the backbone of offsite communication, especially if you have employees who work remotely or in the field. While you may not be able to completely banish email in this case, you can increase the amount of live communication usage such as Skype. In fact employees could even download app and use the software on their smartphone so it could be used no matter where workers travel.

, If you plan to slowly wean employees off of email or find that simply reducing the amount or size of the email is distracting, consider implementing a few rules to get employees in the habit of being brief but direct with communication.


Messages must be short and to the point (possibly include a character limit). Allow for only a few characters in order to force employees to be short and to the point with their messages.
Chatter and small talk should be reduced. Make a rule that asking personal questions or general small talk (such as asking about the weather or office gossip) should be discouraged. Emails should be to the point and direct.
Each message should have a call to action. Instead of explaining your position or thoughts in the email (which could take lines and lines) instead cue the reader into what you want in a few short words and then tell him/her what you want to do such as have a meeting or a phone call at a certain time and day.

, Don’t cut people off cold turkey--the community could revolt. Although email wasn’t around 25 years ago and companies functioned just fine, today’s corporate culture views emails as a fully integrated piece of the machinery.


Make an announcement and ask for feedback and ideas. Give employees a few weeks or even months to marinate in the notion that email may no longer be part of your corporate culture. Keep in mind that many employees rely on email to accomplish a variety of tasks so give them time to get used to the thought before taking any action.
Challenge employees to break the habit through a contest. Make the initiative a challenge and see who can break the email habit quickly. Create a game or a contest that allow employees to tap into their competitive side. They may end up being so focused on winning that over time they’ll develop a new behavior that does not include sending emails.
Stagger your plan over a few months or years. Allow plenty of time for employees to become comfortable with the idea. Perhaps start by just presenting your idea and then a few months later, suggest an abbreviated system for sending emails. As employees change their behavior over time, their dependency on email may wane and they may develop more efficient means to communicate messages.

Have clear and specific goals in mind.,
Write an effective subject line.Always remember the risk of being flagged as spam.,
Provide interesting content.,
Keep it simple and easy to read.People receive a lot of emails every day and you probably aren’t going to have their undivided attention.,
Create an action-oriented goal.Your email should entice and prompt the recipients to take some kind of action.",How to Do Email Marketing2," Remember the acronym ""AIDA"" as you compose the message – Attention, Interest, Desire, Action.Your subject line needs to get their “attention” so that they’ll open the email. Once they’ve opened it, spark their “interest” so they’ll want to continue reading it. Create “desire” by providing them with a motivating offer. Finally, they need to be moved to “action” – which can be clicking on a link, calling your business, buying something from your website, and so on.


For example, a dance class instructor who teaches couples could effectively market via email by offering a promotion for a free one hour introductory class. This offer would create desire, which could be further solidified by including a positive testimonial from a current student.
Since the primary targets are couples, a subject line like, “Do you want to take your relationship to the next level?” would be an effective way to get the attention of a prospect., A good subject line can diminish that possibility. It's best to write a subject line of less than 40 characters. 20 to 30 is probably optimal.


Tell your recipients what’s new in terms of products, services and relevant business information.
Using the words “how to” is a great way to get your email opened; connect your solution to the recipients' needs.
Make a compelling offer that will interest the recipient. Offers are usually discounts or special pricing.
For example, a good subject line that a POS software company could use when marketing to restaurant owners would be, ""Our new security feature will eliminate internal theft"" or ""How to eliminate internal theft.""

, Avoid obvious sales pitches. Instead of immediately pitching your product, make the email about your readers. Instead of long-winded descriptions of your products and all the amazing services you provide, write about problems that might be afflicting your readers, then introduce solutions that include your products and services.Just as the subject line should prompt them to open the email, your intro needs to do one thing – get them to read the rest of the email.
To capture interest, try telling a story, building mystery, and/or including a relevant and compelling image in the email body.
For example, instead of announcing a new feature by describing it in technological terms, you could instead talk about the benefits of the feature that will directly and positively affect a prospective customer. Focusing on a customer's needs will get their attention.
You could make key statements using bulletpoints, which would succinctly convey information while also emphasizing it.

, Make sure the email is easy for the recipient to scan through quickly. Break the content up into short paragraphs. Stay on point and be clear.Include relevant images to break up the text.


If you have an offer that requires a good deal of information, provide a “Read more” link. If they’re interested, they can click that link and be taken to a web page that provides additional information.
Start with the most important information at the top of the email.

, However, action does not necessarily mean getting them to buy something immediately. The goal could be getting them to reply to the email or even just getting them to click a link that brings them to your website. While people do manage to sell in their emails and drop people straight onto a credit card page, you will have more success getting people interested in reading more about your offer.


Make sure the action goal is something that you can track – like a click, reply or a phone call – through platforms like Google Analytics.
It’s important to monitor the effectiveness of your email marketing campaigns, and the only way you can do that is by providing a call-to-action that you can track.

"

Send a welcome email and provide an opt-in option.Before you start marketing to someone new, you should first send a welcome email.,
Send a test email first.Once you hit “send” on an email, there’s no going back.,
Track the effectiveness through analytics.",How to Do Email Marketing3," Introduce the company and let them know what to expect from future emails. Provide an opt-in form that allows them to confirm that they want to receive further emails from you. To give them incentive to opt-in, provide an attractive offer in the welcome email.For example, you could offer a free product or discount with their next purchase.
An opt-in option can help prevent you from spamming people and get your relationship with that person started on the right foot.
Every email you send should also have an obvious unsubscribe link in it. This allows the person to opt-out at any time.

, You can’t make corrections or change any of the content. Before you send an email out to your entire email list, send it to a few key people in your company. Have these people review the email content, confirm that all the links work, proofread the text, make sure the formatting looks right, etc.


You will feel a lot more comfortable and confident about sending the final email out to your list if you do a test send first.

, Most email service providers include free analytics when you use their programs. These analytics provide a great deal of information about the email’s effectiveness, but the three most important metrics are the open rate, click through rate (CTR), and unsubscribes. Knowing this information can help you tweak your content for more successful email marketing in the future.


The open rate tells you how effective your subject line was by showing you how many people opened the email and how many people didn’t.
CTR shows you how many people heeded the call-to-action, which essentially tells you how successful your content was.
Unsubscribe information lets you know when you’ve created ineffective content because it tracks how many people opted-out of receiving future emails from you after seeing the current one.

Select your short straw.,
Encrypt your document.,
Email the encrypted document to all participants.,
Send the password to your participant pool.",How to Draw Straws over Email1," The number of participants will directly correlate with the number of ""straws"" you need. For example, a pool of 6 participants mandates a total of 6 straws.;
, For the aforementioned example of 6 participants, you would use letters A, B, C, D, E, and F. These letters represent your straws.

, Create a new document in Microsoft Word, pick a letter from your list at random, and enter it into your document. This letter will be your short straw. You can also assign a number to each “straw” for the purpose of creating a random ordered list--for example, you might type in ""A3, B6, C2, D1, E4, F5"", wherein the participant who chooses “D” will be listed first, “C” will be listed second, and so on.
Similarly, you can randomly assign tasks to letters, such as “A - Powerpoint, B - Timekeeping, C - Coffee and Doughnuts...”. Thus, the participant who draws “A” will be in charge of the powerpoint, “B” will be in charge of timekeeping, and so on. This is a fair way to distribute undesirable tasks.
In both of these cases, you would type the full list into Word, rather than just one letter.

, This step ensures that other participants won’t be able to accuse you of skewing the results. For Word 2010 and up, you will need to click ""File"" in the upper left-hand corner, then select the ""Info"" tab. In the ensuing menu, click ""Protect Document"", select ""Encrypt with Password"", and enter a password of your choice. Click OK to confirm; some versions will ask you to re-enter your password before accepting it. Click ""Save As"" and save the file as a Rich Text File (.rtf) to complete the process. For earlier versions of Word, click the Microsoft Office Button in the upper left-hand corner, click ""Prepare"", and then click ""Encrypt Document"". Enter your password into the Password box that appears and click OK to confirm. Click ""Save As"" and save the file as a Rich Text File (.rtf) to complete the process. , Attach the file to an email in which you ask participants to respond with their choice of letter from the given range--for example, A through F.


Make sure participants know to select ""Reply All"" when answering.
Emphasize that letters may only be chosen once.
If you are in the participant pool, let your recipients know that you have to choose your letter last so you don't have an unfair advantage.

, Once everyone has chosen a ""straw"", send out the password so your participants can open the Word documents to see which one of them wins (or loses).

Email the screenshot to the participant pool.",How to Draw Straws over Email2," The number of participants will directly correlate with the number of ""straws"" you need. For example, a pool of 6 participants mandates a total of 6 straws.

, To create an unbiased and nondiscriminatory ranking, you need to find a random number generator. The program “draw straws!” by David Goodreach is, as its name suggests, a straw-drawing simulator, and thus perfect for your purposes. Research Randomizer is another excellent choice for creating unbiased feedback. , Assign one number value to represent the total population of participants. Some random number generators, such as “draw straws!”, have specific areas for straw input, whereas most require you to create a single “set” of numbers, with the amount of numbers in that set contingent on the number of participants in your group.

, If you’re using a generator without default input for names, you’ll have to create a reference chart of names, numbers, letters, or some other kind of designation. Make sure you create this chart before generating the numbers.

, The default number of short straws should always be 1, but you’re free to add as many as you like, especially if you’re creating a random ordered list.


If you’re using a generic random number generator, you can assign a single number in the set to stand as the short straw; for example, in a set with 20 participants, the number 8 might be your “short straw”.
Similarly, to create an ordered list in a random number generator, pick several numbers to stand as short straws. Once your results are set, simply place the individuals to whom the numbers pertain in numerical order.

, Once you’ve created your reference charts or entered in names, find the button to generate results and click it. Most sites will have their “generate numbers” button toward the bottom of the value fields.

, A full-page screenshot with the site’s URL and the results posted should prove your honesty to the participants in the drawing. Make sure you don’t alter the image in any way before sending it to the group--if you do, they might notice and doubt your credibility.


To take a screenshot on a PC, hold down ⊞ Win+⎙ PrtScr. The image should appear in a folder labeled “Screenshots” in your “Pictures” file.
To take a screenshot on a Mac, hold down ⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift, then tap “3”. The image will save to your desktop. , Attach the screenshot to an email with the results and send it to the participants. This should solve any disputes and allow you to proceed.

Build a data file.,
Save the data file.,
Write out your primary document.",How to Do a Mail Merge1," This can be a spreadsheet file, database file, or even a text document with the proper formatting. Spreadsheet files are most commonly used; this guide assumes you are using a spreadsheet.


Your data file should have all the information that will have to change from copy to copy. For example, if you're writing a form letter, your data file will hold the names and possibly the addresses of everyone you intend to send the letter to.

Put one item of information in each cell along a line, so that each type of information (first name, last name, honorific, and so on) is in its own column.


Make sensible column names. Mail merge reads data in columns. It will assume that the first entry in each column of information is the general name for that type of information, so use names that make sense for you.

For example, start a column of first names by typing “firstname,” then put all the first names below it. When you are asked which field to insert into your letter, you will see “firstname” as an option and remember what is contained in that column.


Microsoft Office users who also use Outlook for their e-mail can use their Outlook address book as a data file instead, if desired.;
, Save it somewhere you can find it easily, and name it something you will easily remember.

, This is the document you will be inserting information into. For example, if you're writing a form letter, the primary document is the letter. Any item that mail merge will fill in for you (such as names) should be left blank for now.

Skype will ask you what language you would like to use, and you must select one (from a rather substantial list of options).
There will be a box with the words ""Run Skype when the computer starts"" (this is located under the language preference menu). The box is automatically checked, meaning that Skype will open every time you start up. You may want to un-check the box now, so you can determine when Skype is running.

, The mail merge tool in Office has a few steps designed to make your life easier by merging your files more cleverly and accurately.


Start by telling it what kind of document you're writing. Click the best fit, and then click Next.
Tell it what “starting document” (primary document) you want to use. If you've followed these steps, you should be able to select “use this document.” Click Next.

, This is the data file you created previously. Select the appropriate radio button and click Next to search for the file and connect it to your primary document.


If you'd prefer to use your Outlook address book, click that option instead.

, Office allows you to select or deselect rows of information as you please. This allows you to choose which items of information in the data file you want to merge into the primary document, making the data file more useful over time as you use it for various different things. When you are satisfied, click Next.


The data can be sorted by clicking the headers of each column. This can be useful if you need to quickly search through a lot of information.

, On the next page of the task pane, you will be prompted to write your document if you haven't already done so, and presented with an array of options for inserting data from the file into the document.


Insert a data field by placing the cursor where the field will go, and then clicking the appropriate button on the task pane to insert it there.

You can delete misplaced or duplicate data fields by pushing the Delete key, the same as an ordinary letter or number.


The preset options change slightly based on what type of document you told Office you were writing. Office does its best to fill in the appropriate information from the data you give it. For example, if you're writing a form business letter, you might see an option to insert an address block, which includes each recipient's first and last name and full address, neatly organized on a few lines.

Some of the preset options will open up additional windows for you to fill in appropriate information. These are all more or less straightforward and easy to understand.
If you are using a preset and it doesn't seem to be able to find the right information, click the button marked “Match Fields” to teach the program which of your field names correspond to its standard names. For instance, you can show it that it should use the “Family Name” category in your data file to fill in “Last Name” data in an address block.


To use your own fields, click “more options.” You'll be able to see the names you gave each column and use them instead.

, Mail merge won't display the specific information in the fields you apply to your primary document until you print it out, but Office does offer a preview function that allows you to check and make sure that information is appearing correctly according to how you placed the fields in your document. Feel free to use it until you're satisfied that everything is in order.

, The final screen of the mail merge task pane informs you that everything in place, and it is ready to print your documents. One set of information will appear per document printed, and the program will print out as many copies as there are sets of information.


If you want to make individual edits to specific letters, you can also do that from this task pane screen by clicking “edit individual letters” first.

Create a database.,
Insert your fields.,
Finish the merge.",How to Do a Mail Merge3," In OpenOffice.org, a database file is always required for a mail merge; however, you can still create your data in a spreadsheet first.


From your primary document, open the File menu and choose to create a new database file.
In the window that appears, select the “connect to an existing database” option. From the drop-down menu, select “spreadsheet,” and then click Next.
On the next screen, direct OpenOffice.org to the spreadsheet file you wish to use. You can choose whether or not to password protect the database by checking the box underneath the file location. Click Next when you're ready.
On this screen, choose whether to register the database for easier access later, and decide whether or not you want to open the database file to edit it right now. (You probably won't have to if you just created the spreadsheet file.) Click Finish to save the database.

Be sure to give the database a name you can easily remember.



, Now that you've linked your information to a database that OpenOffice.org can understand, it's a simple matter to use that database for mail merging, as long as you know where to look.


From the Insert menu, select 'fields,” and then “other...” from the sub-menu. Alternatively, you can type control-F2.
On the window that appears, click the “database” tab.
Click the Browse button in the lower right part of the window and find the database file you just created.

Once you've selected your database, it will appear in the list titled “database selection” on the right side of the window.


From the “type” list on the left side of the window, select “mail merge fields.”
Click on the + next to your database and a spreadsheet file should appear underneath it. Click on the + next to that, and you will see the field names you chose when you created your spreadsheet.
Select whichever field you want to insert and click Insert to place the field in your primary document.

Remember to place the cursor where you want your field to be inserted before you Insert, or you will have to cut and paste to move it to the right position.
As in Office, text fields are treated like alphanumeric characters in your primary document. You can move them with the space bar and delete them with the delete key.



, Double check every field for proper placement. When you're ready, print your primary document. Mail merge will print one copy for each set of entries in the file you merged to the document.

Decide where you want to paste the text.,
Highlight the text you want to cut.",How to Cut and Paste in Email1," Identify the text/images that you want to cut or paste. If you plan to cut and paste text from elsewhere into an email, make sure to open up a draft into which you can paste the text. If you are cutting and pasting within a single email to rearrange the wording, make sure that you open that email.


When you cut text, you don't need to worry about pasting it immediately. Your computer automatically saves the most recent thing that you cut or copied to a temporary ""clipboard"". You will still be able to paste that swatch of text until you restart your computer or cut/copy something else.
If you have Microsoft Word open when you cut and copy, your clipboard can hold multiple swatches of text at once.;
, Before you cut or paste anything, examine both the words you want to cut and the space where you want to paste them. Read the email for flow, and ask yourself where this text will best fit. If you are pasting the text of another email into a text-heavy message, for instance, you probably don't want to drop it at the top of the email with no introduction, and you probably don't want to leave it in the middle of a sentence. Think about where this new text will be most effective, and consider which words/tenses you will need to edit in order to make the pasted words flow well within the existing document., To highlight text: left-click at the beginning of the section of text that you want to select, then hold and drag the cursor to the end of the section. Dragging the cursor should highlight the text with a blue background. Release the cursor when you have highlighted all of the text that you want to select.


If you want to copy the whole message, press Ctrl+A on a PC keyboard, or ⌘ Command+A on a Mac.

Use the preset keyboard shortcuts on your computer to cut text.,
Consider copying the text in lieu of cutting.,
Highlight, click, and drag the text to the desired location.,
Right-click the highlighted phrases, then select Cut.,
Click the /edit/ menu at the top of some email text-boxes.",How to Cut and Paste in Email2," On a PC, use the shortcut Ctrl+X to ""cut"" out highlighted text and save it temporarily to the computer's clipboard; if you are using a Mac, press ⌘ Command+X. To activate the shortcut, press the Control key (labeled Ctrl and the X key at the same time. The highlighted words will disappear.There are two Ctrl buttons on the bottom row of the keyboard – look for each button several spots to the right and left of the space bar. Similarly, there are two buttons directly flanking the space bar on an Apple keyboard.
If you are using a smartphone, hold your fingertip against the words you want to highlight. Once you've selected those words, you should be able to cut, copy, and paste them.

, If you want to leave a section of text where it is, but you still want to save it to the clipboard for pasting, use Ctrl+C to copy the text. Bear in mind that you can almost always copy text, but you can only cut text if you are working within a text editor: any box or application in which you can write and delete words. For instance, you cannot cut text from a read-only document or webpage. Keep the copy function in mind for when you cannot cut., Modern operating systems allow you to simply drag-and-drop text into and between text editors. If you're working within a text editor, this method will cut and paste the text; if you're dragging something from a read-only document or webpage into an email editor, then this method will only copy and paste the text. First, highlight the text that you want to move. Then left-click on the highlighted portion, hold the button down (in the same motion as the left-click), and drag the highlighted text across the page to where you want it. When you release the left mouse button, you will paste the selected words where the cursor is.

, Drag your cursor through the dropdown menu that appears – there should be options for Cut, Copy and Paste. Select either Cut—which, again, will erase the highlighted words from where they are—or Copy, which will save the text for pasting without removing it. You should not be able to select the Paste option yet unless you already have something saved to your clipboard.


You can only paste the most recent phrase that you have cut or copied. If you have more than one thing to do, either lump the text together and cut/paste it all at once, or cut and paste the text-patches one at a time.

, This is only useful if you are cutting and pasting text from one part of an email to another. After highlighting, depending on the email service you are using, there may be a menu choice on the top of the email edit box that says /edit/. Click /edit/. When the menu drops down, select the Copy or Cut choice. Move the cursor to the correct spot, then click the /edit/ menu again to paste.

Paste on a smartphone.",How to Cut and Paste in Email3," When you are working in a text editor—whether it's Word or your email editor—you will see a blinking vertical line amid the text on the page. When you type, the blinking line shows you where the text will appear. Pasting text works on the same principle: when you paste something into a text editor, the pasted content will appear where the vertical line is blinking.


This is especially important if you are using keyboard shortcuts. If you are right-clicking and selecting ""Paste"", however, you can simply right-click where you want the text. The action box to Paste will appear, and the blinking line will also move to the proper location.

, Move your cursor and click on the spot where you want the text. Then, press Ctrl+V to place the words. The text should appear where you want it.

, Once you move your cursor and click where you want to paste the words, right click again and select the Paste option. The cut/copied text will appear at the blinking line.

, Hold your finger against the screen to select where you want the text. After a moment, a small action menu should appear with an option for ""Paste"". Stop holding the screen, and tap ""Paste"" to insert the text that you cut or copied. Make sure that your phone is open to a text editor.

Add a numbered or bulleted list to your email.,
Indent lines or paragraphs within your email.,
Align text within an email.",How to Customize an Email," These icons are located in a formatting toolbar at the top of an email. With most email providers, you will use your cursor to highlight text you want customized, and click on the formatting icon of your choice.


To learn more about a particular customization or formatting icon, place your cursor on top of the icon in question, then wait for your email provider to display the description of the icon.;
, The bold feature will pronounce a word or phrase by adding thickness to its appearance, and is usually indicated by an uppercase letter ""B.""

, The italics command will add stress to certain words and phrases, giving the text a slanted appearance. The italics icon will appear in the form of an uppercase letter ""I"" slanted in an italicized format.

, The underline feature can be used to specify and add importance to certain words or phrases. The underline command will often appear in the form of an underlined, uppercase letter ""U.""

, Some font styles are easier to read than others, and will change the appearance of the text throughout your entire email. The font style icon is usually a drop-down menu that either resembles an uppercase letter ""T"" or ""F,"" depending on your email provider.

, The font size icon is normally a small drop-down menu labeled with a double letter ""T,"" ""F,"" or ""A,"" depending on the email provider you use. For example, use the font size icon to make sub-headings larger than the rest of your text.

, You can either change the color of the text itself, or change the color of the background to make certain text appear highlighted. The icons for these features usually resemble color palettes or paint brushes.

, An emoticon is an icon of a facial expression used to convey emotion; such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more. The emoticon feature will usually resemble a smiley face on your toolbar. For example, use emoticons when sending personal emails to your friends and family.

, This customization feature can be useful if you want to place links to websites in an email message. The link, or hyperlink feature is usually indicated by a chain ""link,"" or the picture of a globe with a chain link by its side.

, A numbered list will assign numbers to the beginning of every sentence in your message; whereas a bulleted list will add bullet points to the beginning of each sentence in a list. For example, when sending a ""to-do"" list, use the numbered list format.

, The indention formatting commands will usually resemble paragraphs with left- or right-pointing arrows, for ""indent less"" or ""indent more,"" respectively. For example, when emailing a fictional short story, use the indention feature.

, You can align certain words or blocks of text to the left, right, or center of an email. The alignment icons will usually resemble series of lines that are either aligned to the right, left, or center. For example, align sub-titles within an email to the center of the page.

Download a recording app.,
Install the app.,
Configure the app.,
Record the call.,
Inform the other person that you are recording.",How to Record Skype Calls," Skype supports the installation of third-party apps that can add a lot of useful functions. Since Skype does not come installed with support for recording calls, you will need to download an app to make it happen. You can access the app library by clicking the Tools menu, hovering over Apps, and selecting Get Apps.The Skype shop will open in a new web browser window.
Search for “recorder” in the Search field, or scroll down and select one of the Call Recording categories.
There are two general options for call recording software: audio only or audio and video. If you need to record video calls, be sure to grab a video recorder.
Many of the more fully-featured apps require a purchase, but you can find basic audio and video recorders for free. Be sure to read the reviews and features before making your selection.
Always check the Requirements tab before installing an App. Many apps do not work with older versions of Mac OS X or with Linux.
You can get Skype recording programs from sources other than the Skype shop. Search for ""Skype recording software"" and find a program that suits your needs. The installation instructions should be similar to those listed here.;
, Once you have found the app you want, click the “Get it now” button. You will be taken to the developer’s website, where you can download the app file. Once the download is finished, open the file to begin the installation.


Each app’s installation process is different, but you can generally just leave the settings at default. Be wary of apps that want to install toolbars for your web browser, as these can be a pain to remove.
Most apps will require you to register and enter in your Skype username. If you don’t enter the username correctly, then the app will not work.
Once the installation is finished, Skype will ask you to authorize access for the app. If you don’t allow access, the app will not be able to record anything.

, Depending on the app, you may be storing your recordings locally on your computer, or uploading them to a cloud storage service. You can also adjust the quality of the recorded files.


Most recording apps will allow you to set the location of your stored video and audio files. Create an easy to access folder on your computer if you plan on using the files regularly.
Audio and video quality can usually be adjusted in the app’s Settings menu. Higher quality files will take up more storage space than lower quality ones, so experiment with the settings until you find a good balance of size versus quality.

, Most apps require you to click a Record button to start the saving process. You can do this after a call has already been started, and you will begin recording from the moment you click the button. Click the Record button again to stop the recording.


Some apps will begin recording automatically when a call is initiated. Check with the specific app’s documentation for details.
Most free apps have a limitation on the length of the call that you can record.

, In many countries, recording a call without the consent of the other person is illegal. Always make sure that you notify the other person that you are recording. If they refuse, stop your recording or end the call."

Experiment with your Recording Level and Skype remote caller volume settings to get desired volume levels.,
Remote interview/conference parties will often introduce unwanted artifacts into your recorded session.,
So, now you have added significant, professional recording capabilities to your very approach to recording, to interviewing, and to podcasting, which can not only save a lost project after contamination ― you can now apply vast fine touches to both sides of a discussion which otherwise would be mixed as would preclude any reasonable approach to such touches at all.
,Enjoy!",How to Record Skype Into Garageband With SoundFlower and LineIn," Permanently save your SoundFlower disk image so that you can later run the SoundFlower un-installer for reliable removal of SoundFlower (which is not actually an application).
, In the following steps we will create a new project from the Podcast template, but the same objects are accomplished in any project with the two tracks you will dedicate to recording LOCAL and REMOTE Skype callers.,,,,, A visible red dot *when either track is selected* directs recording to the track. We will use SoundFlower and LineIn to direct input from our microphone to one track, and from Skype's remote calling parties to the other track. Simultaneous-recording-enabled tracks will be indicated by red dot glyphs, which must be visible (red) when either of the two tracks is selected. It matters not afterward which of the recordable track targets you select to perform a recording ― both will be recorded from the respective audio sources which we configure in the following steps.,,, This will become your ""SKYPE LOCAL"" instrument/track after we set the Input Source and Monitor values for the track.,, You may also set Recording Level to the desired Recording Level for future work, as the setting will be preserved in our saved template file (eliminating preparation in further usages of your template)., You have now prepared the local recording track., This will become your ""SKYPE REMOTE"" instrument/track after we set the Input Source and Monitor values for the track.,, You may also set Recording Level to the desired Recording Level for future work, as the setting will be preserved in our saved template file (again eliminating preparation in further usages of your template)., You have now prepared the remote recording track.,, Then select the Audio page of the Preferences dialog.,, The Ringing option can be whatever you choose. Close the Skype Preferences dialog.,,,,,,, Click OK.,,,,, You probably will want to keep an alias on your Dock for periodic re-confirmation of configuration values which are not accessible from System Sound Preferences. Here, we will set our recording volumes to 100 percent for our microphone and for both input and output of our SoundFlower channels. Failing to perform these steps therefore may preclude getting full desired volume in your recordings. Like a mixing desk or mixer, GarageBand's ""Recording Level"" value effectively sets a percentage of 100 percent volume, or of whatever lesser value may be set in your Audio MIDI Setup., (This may be counter-intuitive unless you read the previous instruction.),,,), and that Output is set to the same output device (headset?). You're now ready to rock and roll., (Repeat this after purging flaws.), Both tracks should record from the respective sources, and you should be able to monitor the remote audio as intended., Generally, if you set GarageBand volume for the remote callers to 100 percent, you can set the Skype remote caller volume just a bit high (in the Skype caller window) to make sure you have sufficient remote recording volume. This value may vary for different callers and their hardware configurations. Conversely, being as we have set our input volume to 100 percent in our Audio MIDI Setup utility, we can control our own local volume in our GarageBand Recording Level for the SKYPE LOCAL track. Remember then that you can use the remote Skype volume slider and the local GarageBand slider (SKYPE LOCAL track) as you would an actual (hardware) mixer or mixing desk., Now with a separate dedicated track, you can readily erase unwanted material from non-speaking sections, and/or you may load the track(s) into free applications like Audacity, which is worth learning because Audacity provides significant and very efficient tools for applying silence to sections, filtering, or otherwise ""repairing"" unwanted artifacts ― which important capabilities are wanting in GarageBand.,,"

IMAP is considered superior to POP in nearly every way. It allows Gmail and Outlook to stay in sync by marking read and unread messages across both. Any organization you perform on one side (putting a message into a folder in Outlook) will be reflected on the other side (that message will be labeled with that folder's name in Gmail).
IMAP is essential if you check your messages across multiple devices, such as on your computer and your cell phone.
POP has a tendency to lose messages or create duplicates. IMAP is much more stable.;
, You will need to enable IMAP in your Gmail settings before syncing with Outlook.


Make sure you are using the Standard View. If you see the message ""You are currently viewing Gmail in basic HTML"" at the top of the Gmail window, you'll need to switch to Standard View by clicking the link.

, This will open your Gmail Settings menu.

,, Click Save Changes.

, Select ""Account Settings"" → ""Account Settings..."".


If you are using Outlook 2003, click the Tools menu and select ""Accounts"" or ""Email Accounts"".

, This can be found in the Email tab.

, You will be prompted for your name, which will be your displayed name, your email address, and your password. Enter your Gmail address into the E-Mail Address field, and enter your Google account password into the Password fields.


If you are using Two-Factor authentication for your Google account, you will need to create an application specific password to use instead of your Google account password. Click here for detailed instructions on creating an application-specific password. You'll only need to enter it once.
If you are a Google Apps for Business user, use the email address with your domain. The rest of the process should be the same.

, As long as your email address and address are correct, Outlook should be able to connect automatically with your Gmail account.

, After your account is connected, you'll see your email address appear in the left navigation frame, with all of your labels underneath. Outlook will begin downloading the email messages from your account, which may take a little while., When you connect your Gmail account, your Google Contacts are not automatically added to Outlook. You'll need to export your contacts from Gmail and then import that file into Outlook.


Log into the Gmail website.
Click the ""Gmail"" menu and switch to ""Contacts"".
Click the ""More"" button and select ""Export..."".
Select which groups you want to export. By default, all contacts will be exported.
Select ""Outlook CSV"" as the format.
Save the file to your computer.

, Now that you've exported your contacts, you can import them into Outlook.

,,,,,, You can choose to replace duplicates with the Gmail contact information (best when Gmail is the more up-to-date source), create duplicates which you can then combine or delete later, or to not import duplicate items at all (best when Outlook is the more up-to-date source)., Now that the contacts are imported, you can use them just like any other Outlook contact. Be aware that Outlook contacts and Gmail contacts aren't linked, so any changes made on one will not be reflected in the other until you do another export/import.

, There are several things that could be causing this problem.


Ensure that you have access to the Gmail website, and that IMAP is enabled in your Gmail settings.
Double-check that your Gmail address and password have been entered correctly into the Outlook account settings.
Gmail does not allow email messages that have .exe files as attachments. There is also a 25 MB size limit for attachments.

, If you accidentally made changes to the port settings when adding your account, it may be causing problems when you try to send or receive messages.Click the File tab and select ""Account Settings"" → ""Account Settings..."".

Check the ""Incoming mail server"" and ""Outgoing mail server"" fields. Incoming should read imap.gmail.com while Outgoing should read smtp.gmail.com.

Use the proper materials.",How to Properly Package Vinyl Records and Compact Discs for Shipping1," When shipping records and CDs, using the correct packaging materials properly is of paramount importance in preventing damage to the discs or covers!! With rare or one of a kind items that are often irreplaceable, there is no margin of error for a mishap resulting from improper packaging!

"
"
Use proper mailers.,
Place at least one 12” x 12” cardboard insert into the bottom of the mailer box.

,
Remove the disc (keeping it in its inner sleeve) from the LP jacket and place it next to the jacket in the box.,
Place at least one cardboard insert on top of the LP jacket.

,
Close the box and test for snugness.,
Don't forget cushioning.,
Once a snug fit is achieved, close the box and tape the back and sides with packing tape.

",How to Properly Package Vinyl Records and Compact Discs for Shipping2," LPs and maxi-singles should always be shipped in a sturdy, cardboard mailer (with cardboard inserts) specifically designed for shipping 12-inch records. The length and width of the mailer should both be between 12 ½ to 13 inches (33.0 cm). The height or thickness will depend on the number of discs being shipped. When packing an LP, follow these steps:;
,, If you have a plastic LP outer cover, place the jacket in the cover, with the disc beside it. This step is very important as it will prevent potential seam splits to the album jacket that may occur from the disc sliding back and forth during transit. (With a sealed LP, you obviously will not remove the disc from the jacket, but you will want to ensure that enough cardboard inserts are placed around the album in order to prevent the disc from sliding back and forth inside its sealed jacket.)

,, If there is any sliding around of the box contents, insert additional cardboard inserts until all is snug and tight.

, For the record to arrive safe and sound, it is imperative that the box contents be securely cushioned with no movement ability!

,"
"
Use proper mailers.,
Place at least one cardboard insert.,
Don't forget cushioning.",How to Properly Package Vinyl Records and Compact Discs for Shipping3," With 78’s, the same care, if not more, should be given as in packing LP’s. 10-inch 78 rpm records are made of shellac, which is more brittle than vinyl. In addition, unlike LP’s, most 78’s were not issued with cardboard outer jackets, but only paper sleeves. Therefore, when packing a 78 rpm record, one should follow the steps above in packing an LP, with these exceptions:


The mailer box will be smaller. The length and width of the mailer should both be between 10 ¼ to 10 ½ inches.

, Each disc should be individually separated by a cardboard insert. In my opinion, further cushioning with bubble wrap can only help to prevent against damage.

, Again, a well cushioned and snug fit is of utmost importance!

"
"
Use proper mailers.,
Don't forget cushioning.",How to Properly Package Vinyl Records and Compact Discs for Shipping4," With 45s or 7-inch singles, the same protocol holds as in packing LPs. You’ll want to use a sturdy, cardboard mailer (with cardboard inserts) specifically designed for shipping 7-inch records. The length and width of the mailer should both be between 7 ½ to 7 ¾ inches. The height or thickness will depend on the number of discs being shipped. For 7-inch singles with picture sleeves, you’ll want to remove the disc from the picture sleeve and place it in a paper sleeve next to picture sleeve.


Doing this will help to ensure that the picture sleeve arrives to the customer free of seam splits. This step is important, as the original picture sleeves of many 45’s are worth more than the records!

, Again, the contents of the 45 record mailer should be well cushioned and snugly packed.

"
"
Do not pack your CDs in the following 'containers.,
Stick with the industry standard packing materials, and use them correctly!

",How to Properly Package Vinyl Records and Compact Discs for Shipping5," In the interest of your customers, and in the interest of the item arriving safely, PLEASE DO NOT pack vinyl or CDs into the following materials:


large paper envelopes
folded “homemade” cardboard boxes not designed for vinyl or CD’s
mailer boxes with inadequate or non-existent filler/cushioning inserts
self-adhesive, soft & bendable mailers that do not provide adequate cushioning
between sheets of metal, wood, or any other heavy & potentially damaging material.

Have the tracks you want to put on the CD ready to burn.,
Purchase the plainest and/or cheapest pack of CDs you can find.,
Obtain a set of poster paints, the kind that come as a set of 8 connected by bits of plastic.,
Chances are the paintbrush that came with those paints will be useless, so pick up a big box of cotton swabs (not necessarily Q-tips and in some cases not actually Q-tips, as they have quite a lot of cotton on their tips).,
Have a fan handy.,
Set up your workspace.,
Either keep a roll of paper towels handy or cut an old towel up into about 12x12 squares.,
Expect to have to give your CD a second or even third coat.,
Work slowly!,
If you want to write something on the CD, like 'Christmas 2005', paint a background for it and then use a good quality felt-tip permanent marker.,
Once the CD is completely dry, check the back for paint.,

Give to your recipient!

",How to Personalize a CD Without a CD Label Printer,";
, It's better if they're not colored; you can get more if you choose the kind that come in a plastic container rather than in their own slim jewel cases. Memorex and Sony are good brands. Burn the tracks to the CD.

, Also, obtain a set of regular glass stains (or glitter, it doesn't much matter), preferably with some of the same colors as the poster paints. Both of these can be found in the craft section of your local store.

, A box of 300 or so works.

, A little travel fan works best. Takes up very little room on the desk, has 2 speeds and is adjustable. Runs on just two D batteries, difficult to knock over, and has thick, soft foam blades that displace a lot of air.

, Clear off your desk, set up a work table, whatever - as long as the environment is clean, sturdy and comfortable it doesn't matter.

, When you're ready to start personalizing the CD, lay two paper towels (folded over to create a double layer the size of a single towel) or one towel square down flat on your work table and place the burned CD on it, with the side that goes up in the player face-up. Can't paint the bottom. Here is where anyone who knows anything about paint might get confused. The surface of a CD is almost perfectly smooth, and paint won't stick to a smooth surface. You could sand the CD, and ruin it, or you could keep reading.

, Keep the design simple, like a name or star. Work with one color at a time and dry between coats, using the fan. If you want to get creative and mix colors or paint and stain, then keep the fan off until you want to dry your work. If you want a solid color, work with the fan going. It dries the paint as you work, so you can start on a second coat directly after finishing the first.

, Patience is a virtue and your CDs look better if you take the time to make them that way. Use a reference picture if you want, but originality is always smiled upon.

, (Beware: Ballpoint pens are murder on CDs/DVDs. Use only as a last resort, with as little pressure as humanly possible and even then, if possible, limit ballpoint writing to the un-coated ring of clear plastic in the very center around the spindle hole). Seal it with a discreet coat of glass stain the same color as your background.

, It can usually be cleaned off with water.

, Or, if it's for someone else, find a suitable case for it. Paint the case if you want.

Is it a collection of home movies? A vacation video? Or maybe it’s a short film you made for school or fun.;

Instead of just titling it “Family Vacation” you can come up with a creative title to make your DVD cover look more appealing.
Say where you went on vacation, or use what you did as part of the title.
For example, if it is a class project for history, call it something like ""A Step Back In Time"" rather than ""History Class Project"".

, Look at any movie, and you’ll see that there’s a central image or theme on the cover, usually including some of the people in the movie.


You can always use a still image from some of the video you shot, or a picture you took.
Alternatively, you can find a photo online that you like and think will work well. But you should be careful if you’re distributing your DVD to others as you have to obey copyright law for photos.You can find free to use, Creative Commons photos by searching the Creative Commons website or through the Creative Commons section on Flicker., Keeping your text in one or two fonts will ensure that you have a clean cover and make it easy to read.


If you want your DVD cover to have a modern look you can use a font like Helvetica, Folio, or Standard CT.Maybe you went on a trip to Asia and want a font that embodies your trip. You can use something like Papyrus, or Bonzai. Or maybe you want a fun, funky font, try something like Distillery, or True North., Do you have a favorite movie or movie poster? Take a look at DVDs and take note of you do and don’t like.


Maybe you like a DVD cover with a collage of images or one with a funky font on it. Taking inspiration from what you like is a great way to envision what your own DVD cover will look like.

, You can make your own DVD cover using any number of programs from Microsoft Word to Photoshop.


You can use a template in Microsoft Word or manually set up your document. In OpenOffice.org Writer or Microsoft Word, click Format then Columns then choose 3. Set the width of column 1 to 129mm (5""), column 2 to 15mm (0.6"") and column 3 to 129mm (5""). Click in line between.
If you’re familiar with Photoshop you can also make your own DVD cover in that application., If you’ve set up your file so that you can print one page to be folded over, you can begin to insert your images into both the front and back of your DVD cover.


A standard DVD cover measures 184mm (7.25"") by 273mm (10.75""). Depending on your printer and paper size, it is possible to fit an entire DVD cover onto a single sheet of paper (A4, which is the standard size of paper, is more than large enough).You may need to reduce page margins to zero.
If your paper size does not accommodate printing on a single sheet, then the front and back panels should both be 7.25"" by 5.15"". The title strip, also known as the spine, should be 7.25"" by 0.5"". This will leave a little overlap for connecting the pieces.

, With your images in place, now it’s time to include the text you want into your document.


If you are using a word application, you can use the “Insert Text” function. Or, if you are in Photoshop, click the “T” button on your panel and then draw the text box over your photo.You should see a blinking cursor which indicates that you can begin typing.

, In addition to using photos, you can include some real, or even fake, comments such as: '""Amazing. The greatest film of the year."" - John Smith from Some Magazine'. Or if it’s more of a home movie, you can add a quote from your footage or your trip that sums up the content of your film.


This will add some extra meaning to your DVD. You can even add fake barcodes and age ratings (like the MPAA or BBFC ratings) for added realism., Before you do anything, it’s always a good idea to save your files so that if anything goes wrong, or when you print your cover you can easily go back and make changes if you don’t like how it looks.

, Before you print, you should do a print preview to make sure that everything looks good and is on your page.


If you are running Windows, then you can find the print preview button under the “Menu” tab.If you are running Mac OSX then you can find the print preview button under the “File” tab at the top.
Clicking the “Print” button in Photoshop will also bring up a printing preview for you.

, If you are printing multiple pages, then you should print a single test page first to ensure that your homemade DVD cover is to your liking. This way if there are any issues you won’t have wasted a lot of ink and paper.

, Before you insert your DVD cover, you should lay the paper flat for around 20 to 30 minutes to make sure the ink has dried so you don’t get any smudges when you insert it into your DVD case.


If you are using photo paper that’s glossy, you may have to let it dry for a bit longer.

, Once the paper is dry, open up your DVD cover and lay it flat. Simply slide the paper into your cover and adjust it so it’s even. And voila! You’ve made your own DVD cover!


If you have a DVD-disk with a white top and a DVD burner that allows you to burn images onto the disk, use it! It will really add realism to your DVD. If not, you can always place a label on it. You can find all sorts of press-on labels at office or computer supplies stores.

, Enjoy your film! Present the film as a real DVD. It will really wow your audience.

Open Windows Notepad.,
Create an Autorun.inf file, which is a text file that Windows automatically looks for when a CD-Rom is placed into your system.,
Replace both 'filenames' with the actual name of the program's .exe and .ico that you are trying to burn to the autorun CD.,
Burn the Autorun CD.,
Place the CD in your disc tray.",How to Make an Autorun CD," To begin making an autorun CD, click open the start menu followed by a folder named ""Accessories."" Open Windows Notepad, which will be located within that folder. Alternatively, you can also type ""Notepad"" into the search or run bars on your Start menu in order to launch it directly.;
, Type the following into Notepad:
open=Filename.exe
icon=Filename.ico

, After finishing that, save the file. However, instead of saving it as a .txt file, choose ""All Files"" from the ""Save As"" drop down menu. Name the file Autorun.inf and save it to your desktop. If the program you are trying to make an autorun CD out of doesn't have an .exe file, it may have a .msi file instead. If this is the case, replace the open=Filename.exe with open=Filename.msi.

, Start your CD burning program and follow the instructions for burning the type of disc you are trying to make. Now that you have the Autorun.inf saved to your desktop, find it and add it to your CD. Place it in the main directory of the CD itself, as this is where Windows will look for the file.


Check the burning software's options thoroughly. Some types of CD burning software have an option to make the disc autorun capable or bootable automatically. If you are using this tutorial in order to make an installable copy of a computer operating system, you need to find the option to make your CD bootable, as just making it an Autorun CD will not fulfill that on its own.

, Make sure to test your newly made Autorun CD before you delete any of the program materials. The CD will launch automatically if the steps were followed correctly and the burning process completed without errors.

Try any of the following techniques:

During business hours most post-office's have a fold-up cardboard case for a small cost (usually less than two dollars).",How to Mail a CD," Just walk in and find it among their various packing materials and start folding. Most single-sized CD cases fit in them since they are specifically designed for them. So some sort of protection for the CD prior to this packaging is advisable. Then take it to the counter and pay postage. It's on its way!



 


A cheaper route requires some creativity. Remember the packaging that AOL and various other companies would use to send you promotional CDs? Dump the contents of the metal or plastic packaging they used and fill it with yours. Tape some paper with the proper mailing info to all sides of packaging, attach a stamp and mail it. Remember before you seal the CD in the packaging, protect the information side of the CD if you've burned it yourself (even if you didn't burn it yourself, it is a good idea to protect the information side of the CD from shipping damage).






Another less reliable idea would be to get an envelope or tiny manila folder, insert CD, seal, pay postage, and mail.

Gather the files you need to distribute and place them in a folder on your PC.,
Go over your files and make sure that the file names make sense.,
Some files, such as PDF documents, or video clips, require viewer software to be installed to view them, such as Adobe Reader or a video codec.,
Consider creating a custom icon for your CD.,
Create an ""autorun"" for your CD.,
Burn the CD using your CD-RW drive.,
If you are burning the discs yourself, you should create a label.,
Package your disc.",How to Make a Professional Quality CD," If you are including a lot of files, group them into sub folders.;
, Don't have the file name be the first paragraph from the document! Very long file names should also be avoided.

, Depending on you audience, you may want to download the setup application for the viewer and include it on the CD. This way, you recipient can view your document even if they are not connected to the internet and cannot download a viewer themselves.

, Using the autorun technology, you CD can display a custom icon in My Computer. Use an icon editor to create an icon, or download one from the internet. Save the icon somewhere on your computer: you'll need to access it later.

, An autorun is a file that tells a computer what to do when a CD is inserted, such as open a document or show a menu. Virtually every commercial CD uses an autorun, and yours should too. There are several applications that create autoruns. Follow the instructions included with the application to create the autorun for your CD.

, If you are distributing a lot of CDs, consider using a professional CD duplication service: there are a lot and the prices can be cheaper than burning a lot of discs yourself. If you want to use a CD duplication service, first create a master disc yourself and test it thoroughly. You don't want 500 mistakes!

, Some CD-RW drives are able to burn a design on the disc itself using special blank media. Unfortunately, this results in poor image quality. It's better to use a colour label or print directly on the CD with a CD printer. Every office supply store sells CD labels and it is almost as easy as printing a photograph, and makes a BIG difference in the final product.

, If you will be mailing, use special disc mailers. These are shaped disc-sized envelopes that normally have padding to protect the disc. They also reduce shipping cost. If you are not mailing the disc, you should use some case. The best ones are either slim jewel cases or DVD cases. Other types of cases, including the traditional jewel case, are often fragile.

Learn the different formats.,
Determine if you want a Blu-Ray drive.,
Compare read and write speeds.,
Decide between internal and external.,
Choose a quality drive.,
Consider an OEM model.",How to Install a DVD Drive1," There are a variety of confusing formats for DVD drives, including DVD, DVD+R, DVD-R, DVD+/-R, DVD+/-RW. These all refer to the different read and write capabilities of the drive. Generally, all new drives these days will be DVD+/-RW or just DVD RW. This indicates that it can read DVDs as well as write to all the types of burnable DVD discs.


Most new drives can write, though you can purchase budget drives that just read DVD discs. These are labeled as DVD-ROM drives.;
, Blu-Ray is the newest form of disc storage on the market, and can store significantly more data than a standard DVD drive. Blu-Ray drives allow you to watch Blu-Ray HD movies and read Blu-Ray data discs, and all Blu-Ray drives also read DVDs.


Blu-Ray drives have come down in price significantly, and Blu-Ray burners are now much more affordable.
Even if the Blu-Ray drive does not write (BD-ROM), there's a good chance it will write DVDs.

, When looking at different models, it will be useful to compare the read and write speeds. These tell you how long it will take to read and write various forms of media on the drive.


Most new DVD drives will read at 16X, and write at up to 24X. These measurements indicate how much faster the drive is than a 1X drive, and is not a measurement of the actual read or write speed.

, If you are using a laptop computer, you will likely need to purchase an external drive. If you are using a desktop computer, you can generally choose either, but you will get better read and write performance from an internal drive.


If you decide to purchase an external drive, you can skip down to Part 3 for details on installing the drivers.

, Look for drives from trusted manufacturers. This will help ensure that your drive lasts a long time, and that you get a solid warranty. Below are a few of the most trusted optical drive manufacturers:


LG
Philips
Plextor
Lite-On
BenQ
Samsung

, If you have extra SATA cables to install the drive lying around, and you don't mind not having manuals and driver discs, you may want to consider an OEM model. These are typically cheaper than a consumer model, but lack any of the packaged extras.


If you buy an OEM model, you can still find the drivers and documentation for the drive on the manufacturer's website.

If you are installing an external drive, plug it into your computer via USB and skip down to the next section.

, Most newer cases have thumbscrews along the back that allow you to quickly remove the panels. If you don't have thumbscrews, you will need a Phillips-head screwdriver. Remove the panels from both sides so that you can access the drive bay on each side.

, Before working inside the computer, it is always wise to ground yourself. This will help prevent electrostatic discharge from damaging your delicate computer components. The ideal way to ground yourself is to connect an electrostatic wristband to your case. If you don't have a wristband, touch a metal faucet to discharge static buildup.

, If you are replacing an old drive, you will need to pull it out before installing the new one. Disconnect the cables from the back of the drive, then remove the screws on each side of the drive. Push the drive slightly from behind, and then pull the drive out from the front of the case.

, If you aren't replacing an old drive, you will need to locate an empty bay. These are usually found on the front of the case, towards the top. You may have a drive or two already in this area. Remove the front panel to expose the bay.

, Some cases use rails to secure the drive to the case. If this is the case, the rails will need to be attached to each side of the drive before inserting it in the case.

, Nearly all drives are inserted in from the front of the computer, though you may need to double-check your computer's documentation. Ensure that you are inserting the drive right-side up.

, If you are securing with screws, you should be suing two screws on each side. Make sure to secure the drive on both sides of the case. If you are using rails, make sure that the drive is inserted all the way and clips into place.

, Use the included SATA data cable, or use your own if the drive did not come packaged with any. Connect it to the next empty SATA port on your motherboard. Refer to your motherboard documentation if you cannot find the SATA ports on our motherboard.


The SATA data cable can only be inserted one way on both the drive and the motherboard. Do not fore the connection.
Be careful not to disconnect any other components, such as your hard drive, or your computer will not boot up.

, Find a power connector coming from your computer's power supply. This is usually located at the bottom of the case. Connect the power cable to the power slot on the back of the drive. Like the data cable, the power cable can only be inserted one way, so don't force it.


If you don't have an available power connector, you can buy an adapter that can provide additional connectors.

, Close up the case, return it to its position, and reattach the cables. Power on your computer."

, If your drive did not install itself, you may need to install the drivers that came with it or that you downloaded from the manufacturer. Follow the prompts to install the drivers. You may be asked to restart your computer after installation.

, Many drives come with packaged software that allows you to burn media to blank DVDs, or watch HD video. None of these are necessary, as there are free equivalents available online, but you can install these if you wish.

The disc will act similarly to a USB drive and files will be burned to the disc as soon as they are added.
Note: Live File System discs created in this manner are only compatible with Windows.
Mastered is appropriate if you'd like the disc to function more like a closed system. All of the files are burned at once after you're finished adding them and no more files can be added without a full erase when using this format.
Note: Mastered tends to be better for burning lots of files. In addition, Mastered discs will be compatible with other operating systems.

, Once you've selected your formatting method, the drive will prepare the disc. This may take a few moments. After it's finished, you'll be able to start adding files to the disc.

, Open the disc in an Explorer window and start dragging and dropping the files you want to burn.

Try to create a uniform surface.",How to Fix a Scratched DVD1," Decide whether your DVD can be fixed, or whether it has irreparable damage.


As mentioned above, disks with scratches that go deep will not be able to be mended. To assess the damage, hold the disk up in the sunlight. If sunlight shines through the scratch, the DVD is unlikely to be mended.
Scratches that are circular, around the laser track, are more likely to result in a permanently damaged disk. Small scratches that run across the radius are easier to fix.;
, Use a soft cloth and some very clean water. You may also use alcohol, but most other solvents may damage the discs.








, A cloth specialized for eyeglasses would also do., Then, gently wipe the disk from the center to the edges, across the radius, using the jewelry cloth. Continue wiping around the disk, from inside to outside, until the entire disk has been cleaned.








, Try to play it, to evaluate if cleaning the disk solved the problem. If it is not repaired, more extreme measures are required.








, There are several methods for doing this:









Buy rubbing polish from an automotive store. Apply a small amount of the compound. Rub it across the radius until it covers the entire surface. Allow it to sit for a few minutes. Then, rinse and rub with a soft cloth. Use this product in a well-ventilated area, and be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after polishing.Buy a mechanical scratch remover. This also removes the first layer of disk material and polishes the disk. Insert the DVD and turn the hand crank according to package directions. Buff with your jewelry cleaning cloth.
Buy a professional DVD scratch polish, such as SkipDr. Apply the product across the radius. Allow it to sit according to package directions, so that the outer layer of disk will be removed. Rinse and/or buff the disk with the jewelry cloth.
Try basic toothpaste. Get a plain enamel-cleaning paste at your local drugstore. The grit inside toothpaste helps to clean and buff the surface of the disk. Apply toothpaste across the radius until the entire disk is covered. Let the toothpaste dry. Then, rinse it clean and buff with your jewelry cleaning cloth across the radius.

All done!",How to Frame a CD," If possible you can get the frames in the markets/shops, but you can also use an old frame (e.g. the frames of those photographs, which you're no longer using). Then, wipe down the frame with some cleaner and water.;
, Place the CD on the cardboard and trace around it. Put it wherever you want on the board, visualizing the end result. Cut out the rectangle you just drew. Cut on the inside of the line, you want this to be a tight fit.

, Now we have a plain piece of cardboard, and a dingy frame, let's do something about that. Go to a well ventilated area (in this case, an the alley out back) and paint the stuff. Light coats on the cardboard please? It's porous, so you don't want to soak it. Normal spray paint sets in about 15 minutes, so take your time.

, Now that your stuff is dry, it's time to set it up. If you have any little items you want in the frame aside from the CD, place it where you want it. You can glue it if you want to, but keep in mind, this makes it a tad more permanent. Since we used corrugated cardboard, the finished product has a little puff to it. Most items will stay where you put them, it's more of a personal preference.

, Now that the whole thing is set up, simply put it together. The hole we cut earlier holds the jewel case all on it's own. If you look at the case, it has a lip on the edges. Simply pop it in the hole. It holds itself in place! Just like a regular picture frame, fasten it back together, bending the tabs/staples back down. Use the pliers to make sure it's fastened tight.

, All that's left to do is just hang it up like a normal picture. The CD can change the balance on the frame, but just adjust it accordingly.

In all versions of Outlook, the users can find the messages in the mailbox folder faster by changing the way they are classified in the email folder. For example you can sort out your emails by date, sender and file size or importance level.;
, The mental energy required to shift focus between ever-changing topics drains you, not the volume. You tend to read in sequential order either chronologically or by ""most important person."" This is a brain burnout. Use this rule instead; it applies to email from direct reports and works better than conversation chains.


Identify the top 2-5 projects you are most concerned with; create subject headings to reflect these.
Let the team know you will pay initial attention to all those emails with these standard subject headings. These subjects are your top priority projects at the moment––your email will be sorted by subject line and top priority are read/responded to first.
Make it clear that inappropriately titled emails will blacklist the offending sender for 1-x days.

You need to show these hidden folders first so you will be able to see them. From any open folder on your desktop, go to Folder Options.
Under the Folder Options, select the View tab. Under the Hidden files and folders in the Advanced settings section, tick “Show hidden files, folders, and drives.”;
, On the same Advanced settings section, remove the tick for “Hide extensions for known file types.” The Outlook data files you’re looking for have file extensions of .pst. The file extensions need to be visible for you to easily identify them.

, Once the hidden folders are visible and the file extensions are shown, you can now start looking for the Outlook data files. These data files contain your email, calendar, and contacts from Outlook.


If you created some personal folder, mailbox, or archive within Outlook, you may have more than one .pst file. The directory where the Outlook data files are located is under “%USERNAME%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook” or something with a similar structure; open this folder.

, Before you copy anything, you have to close Microsoft Outlook first. This will ensure the data you’re getting is the most updated one.


If Outlook is still open when you do your copy, the files may not have the most recent data on them.

, From the Outlook data folder, filter the files and select only the ones with .pst file extension. You only need the ones with your data on them. This means that the files will have quite a large size.


If you see .pst files with 265 KB only, you may leave them as they’re empty.

, Once you’ve selected the needed .pst files, copy them to an external storage device, such as a USB drive.

, If you haven’t installed Microsoft Outlook on your new computer yet, do it now.

, On the new computer, you need to put your Outlook data files inside the default Outlook directory for your user files. Same as from the old computer, this directory is hidden. You need to show these hidden folders first before you put anything in them.


From any open folder on your desktop, go to Folder Options. Under the Folder Options, select the View tab. Under the hidden files and folders in the Advanced settings section, tick “Show hidden files, folders, and drives”.

, Same as from the old computer, the data files used by Outlook is stored under your user’s documents. The directory where the Outlook data files are located is under “Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook” or something with a similar structure.


Open this folder. You can also put your Outlook .pst files in another folder, just make sure you remember where it is and configure Outlook to look for it later on.

, Before you copy anything, you have to close Microsoft Outlook first. This will ensure the data you’re putting in won’t conflict with an active and open one. If Outlook is open when you do your copy, you may face some errors.

, Insert the external storage device where you put your .pst files from the old computer. Copy the .pst files and paste it on the Outlook directory you’ve set in Step 3. Your .pst files are now on your new computer.

, Navigate through your Start menu or shortcuts and click on Outlook. Microsoft Outlook will launch.

, Go to the File menu and look for Account Settings. Click on it to bring out the Account Settings dialog window.

, Under the Account Settings window are several tabs; click on “Data Files.” This tab is where you configure the data files being used by Outlook. The data files pertained to here are the .pst files.


If Outlook hasn’t automatically identified your PST files, this is where you set it.

, From the Data Files tab’s header menu, click on “Add” to add your PST files not yet in identified by Outlook.


Navigate through your local directories until you reach the folder where your Outlook data files or .pst files are located. This is the folder where you put the copied .pst files from your old computer. Select the appropriate .pst file.

, Repeat Step 4 for all the .pst files you have.

, From the data files you have on Outlook, you have to set one as the primary or default one. This is where your new emails will come in.


Click on the one you need to make the default and click the “Set as Default” button from the header menu. The selected data file will be identified with a check mark.

, Click the “Close” button found at the bottom of the dialog window to save your settings and close the window. You can now return to your Outlook inbox and view all your data files listed."

, Another instance might be some contacts from a club, church or work that take up space in your address book and you seldom use them. Here is how to group them in separate folders.

, When done click OK and notice your new folder listed in the left panel.

, If you had a name that you would like in both folders hold down the Ctrl key while you drag and drop to copy it to the new folder.

Have fun using Discord!

",How to Get Started with Discord," Discord can either be used in a web browser on a computer, or by using the Discord application on a phone or computer. The browser-based version is a good choice if you just want to try out Discord, but the app notifies you when there's a new message in a channel or chat that you're in.


The browser version of Discord can't be accessed on a mobile device. You'll have to download the app to use Discord on your phone.;
, When you start using Discord, you'll often start out by just creating a username. However, if you create an account, you'll be able to use the Discord app (and not just the browser version). If you connect an email address to your Discord username, you'll be able to use Discord regularly with the mobile app or computer program.

, If you've never used Discord before, or aren't very familiar with instant-messenger apps in general, you may be a bit confused on how to use it. However, a lot of it is really just learning how to use the layout. The basics are easy enough to learn, too!


The far left side of the screen is where Direct Messages will show up and where any servers you've joined will show up.
The left side of the screen will be either your Friends List or a list of channels in a server, depending on whether you're on the Direct Message screen or a Discord server, respectively.

Underneath these lists will be your username and profile image, your ""online"" status, whether your microphone is muted, whether your headphones are ""deafened"", and your settings.


The center of the screen is the chat messages. If you're on the Direct Message screen without a chat open, it will just be your Friends list.
The right side of the screen, if you're on a server, will be the list of members on the server and their roles. If you're on Direct Messages, this won't appear.

, To customize your account settings, click on the cog near your username. You can use the settings to:


Change your username, email, avatar, and password. (Access the Account setting.)
Connect accounts (such as Twitch, Skype, and Steam) to your Discord account, as well as authorize apps to use your Discord account. (Access the Connections setting.)
Change who can add you as a friend. (Access the Friends setting.)
Change how images, links, and emoticons show up in the chat. (Access the Text & Images setting.)
Edit your Voice Chat settings and whether you press a button for your microphone to activate in voice chats. (Access the Voice setting.)
Edit notification settings. (Access the Notifications setting.)
Add or delete keybinds. (Access the Keybinds setting.)
Alter the appearance of the Discord window or turn on Developer Mode. (Access the Appearance setting.)
Show when you're playing a game on your device. (Access the Games setting.)
Choose the language. (Access the Locale setting.)
Enable ""Streamer Mode"", which is useful if you play video games for a site such as YouTube. (Access the Streamer Mode setting.)
Enable two-step authentication for account security. (Access the Security setting.)

, At some point, you'll probably want to not get so many notifications on Discord, but still leave the app open. While there's no way to mute the Direct Message system yet, there are ways of muting single users as well as channels and servers.


Setting your account to Do Not Disturb will mute all incoming notifications unless you're tagged in a message or messaged directly. Click on your avatar and click on Do Not Disturb.
To mute a single user on a server, right-click on the person's username and check the Mute button. If you want to unmute them later, just uncheck the button using the same steps.
To mute a channel in a server, right-click on the channel that you want to mute and check the Mute button. You can also click the alarm bell at the top of the screen. Follow the same steps to unmute the channel.
To mute a server, right-click on the server icon and check the Server Mute button.

, At some point, you'll make a typo or send a message you didn't mean to send, but thankfully on Discord, there are ways to take it fix that.


To edit a message you've sent, right-click the message and click Edit. (If you hit the down arrow on your keyboard, you will automatically open the edit window of your latest message.)
To delete a message you've sent, right-click the message and click Delete message. If you hold down ⇧ Shift while doing so, it will delete the message without prompting whether you want to delete it.

, In order to join a server on Discord, you'll need to have an invite to it.


Friends can invite you to a server directly through Discord.
If you have a link to a Discord server, click on the link and you'll join the server.

, If you don't read channel guidelines or rules, you may end up getting muted, kicked, or banned from the server. Use common sense while chatting, too.

, It's annoying to many on Discord. Many channels may ban you if you do this.

, When you add someone to your Friends list on Discord, you become able to voice call with them privately, and they get added to a contact list for your direct messages (also called private messages, DMs, or PMs), making it easier to reach them. To add someone as a friend:


Right-click on a Discord user's name, or use the search function to search for a list of users in channels that you've joined.
Click on Add Friend.
Wait for the person to accept or deny your friend request. If they accept it, they'll appear in your friends list.

, Discord, being primarily for gamers, gives you the ability to voice-chat with people. If you want to, just make sure that your microphone and headphones are active (meaning that they don't have a red slash through them), and start up a call:


To voice-chat with a single person via Direct Message, you'll need to be on their Friends list. Click on the button that looks like a phone, or right-click their name and click Call.
To voice-chat with users on a server, click on the voice channel that you want to join and you'll connect to the server.

, If a user is driving you up the wall, you can block them from messaging you. Just right-click their username and select Block from the dropdown menu.

, Make sure the DVD has no data previously written on it, as this may affect the copying process.

, This can be done by using the same program you used earlier to rip the copyrighted DVD. While burning your new unencrypted DVD, try not to use any other programs, as this could adversely affect your DVD.

, Formatting the drive erases all of its data in a process designed to prepare the drive for use with a certain operating system and file system. The process is simple.


On a computer running Windows, right-click on the drive's icon and select ""Format"" from the context menu. Adjust the settings as desired, and then click ""Start"" and then ""OK."" When the drive is done being formatted, click ""OK.""
On a Mac, open the Disk Utility application by clicking on its icon in the Applications folder. Select your external hard drive in the left panel and then click the ""Erase"" button in the right panel (under the ""Erase"" tab). Click ""OK"" to format the drive.
Note that reformatting the external hard drive will not provide absolute protection for your sensitive files. Someone with advanced computer knowledge may be able to recover your data even after you reformat the drive. If security is a concern, make sure to take further steps to clean the drive.

, If you want a more secure way to erase your data than reformatting, you can run a disk cleaning utility. These programs work by writing meaningless data to the hard drive, effectively overwriting your old data to make room for the new. 2 popular disk cleaning utilities are Drive Cleanser by Acronis and Darik's Boot and Nuke.


To wipe your external drive using these applications, install the software and open it. Select the external hard drive in the programs interface and erase its contents (note that this process usually takes a long time). Be very careful not to erase the data on your computer's built-in hard drive.

, If complete security is a concern and you don't plan on ever using the hard drive again, you can take it apart and break the internal components. Most external hard drives have a housing that can be removed with a screwdriver. The interior components are delicate and can be effectively broken by covering them with a towel and striking them with a hammer. Before employing this method, however, consider donating your hard drive or recycling it at an electronics recycling center.

Find out when it’s going to fail before it fails.,
Listen for strange noises: Sometimes hearing strange grinding and thrashing noises means your drive is beyond repair—for instance, if you’ve had a head crash, it very often is.,
Watch for disappearing data and disk errors: Your computer won’t let you save a document?,
Your computer stops recognizing your drive: This may seem obvious, but if your computer no longer recognizes your drive chances are there’s a problem with it, not the computer.,
Computer Crashes: Does your computer regularly blue-screen or suddenly reboot?,
Really Slow Access Times: It shouldn’t take half an hour to open a folder in Windows Explorer, or two hours to empty the trash.,
Sound is a great indicator.,
If your computer crashes or can't find a file that was there not long ago it can mean that your hard-drive is on its way out, but it could also be that there is a simple file-system error in the disks' formatting.,
chkdsk will check and repair the file-system structure on disk C: (Plus check and repair any data-file errors if the /r parameter is used.).",How to Tell if a Hard Drive Is Bad," That’s not always possible, and sometimes a hard drive will just die—but it’s still important to keep an eye on the symptoms of an imminent hard drive so you have the chance to back-up your data and get professional help. Hard drives are incredibly sensitive bits of hardware, so don’t try to crack it open and have a look inside unless you know what you’re doing. And most definitely ensure that if you do crack it open, the platters don’t get exposed to the open air—hard drives can only be opened in Class 100 clean rooms or they’re pretty much instantly destroyed by dust. It’s a lot easier (and cheaper) to back-up than to get your data recovered. Once you detect any of the signs of failure you need to ensure that you have a back-up and if not, make one. Then when the drive dies, you can claim your warranty if you still have it, or buy a new drive, and be on your way. Recovery can cost thousands and thousands of dollars, with no guarantee the data will all be recovered; it sure is a ridiculous amount to pay, but there’s not much you can do but shop around and find the best price. The cost of transferring a back-up onto a brand new drive is much cheaper than having a recovery specialist do the same for you.;
, Or it could just be that the motor has failed or your hard drive is grinding away because of noisy bearings. If you’re hearing strange noises then act very quickly—you probably don’t have much time.

, Or you’re sure that you had a file on your desktop yesterday that’s nowhere to be seen today? Programs that always worked suddenly stop working, asking where a file it depends on is stored? These are all potential signs that your hard drive is on its way out. Of course, it could be that your kids moved your files for fun or a virus is eating through them, but disappearing data is never a good sign for your drive if you can rule out those alternative causes.

, Test it in a friend’s computer and see if your hard drive is recognized by it. Often, this will be a logical failure—unless you can hear strange noises that indicate a severe mechanical or head problem.

, Does it crash often, especially when booting your operating system? If your computer is crashing, especially at times when the computers is accessing files (such as during the boot sequence), it may indicate a problem with your drive.

, People have come across this problem plenty of times over the years, and it’s always followed by a failing hard drive within a month or two.

, As soon as the sound changes from the norm, or you get plenty of clicking and grinding from your hard drive, you need to power it down immediately. Get to know the sound of your hard drive while it’s young and in working order, because you’ll need to be able to hear the slightest differences when it gets older.

, These types of error can usually (but not always) be fixed by using the chkdsk function that comes as standard in nearly all Windows installations. To correct a file-system error on drive C:, open a command-prompt while running your computer as an administrator if necessary - if using Windows Vista or later - and type ""chkdsk C: /f"". (If you want chkdsk to check for data file errors too you can add another parameter: ""chkdsk C: /f /r"".)

, If you have more than one hard-drive it is advisable to run chkdsk on those too, by substituting the C: for the drive-letter of that particular extra hard-drive. (Such as E: - The command will then look like ""chkdsk E: /f /r"".) This will clear up a file-system error in most cases, and the drive will work normally again. However if the error recurs, either on reboot or within 12 hours of operation on the same drive as the original error; then your drive is failing and you should try to back up as much data from that drive as you can as quickly as you can before removing and replacing that drive. (It is irreparable and will only deteriorate further if you continue using it.) Time the startup of the system

Plug in your flash drive to a USB port.,
Double-click the icon that appeared on your desktop.,
Open or delete files from the flash drive.",How to Use a Flash Drive As a Hard Drive2," If you have not yet plugged in this type of flash drive, you may have to wait a few moments for its drivers to be installed. After it is finished, a USB icon will appear on your home screen.


You may also have to format the drive to work with your computer. If you see a message that says your USB flash drive needs to be formatted, understand that this will erase any files you’ve stored on the drive.
If you’re using a Mac desktop computer, it’s better to plug the flash drive into a USB port on the back of the computer rather than the keyboard., Click and drag files to the window that opens to copy them to the flash drive. You can also save new files from programs using their save dialog, by clicking the USB icon and then clicking “Save.”

, As long as the flash drive is plugged into your computer, you can open, save, delete, and organize files as you would your hard drive.


As long as the flash drive is plugged into your computer, you’ll be able to save files to it as you would your hard drive. When saving files within an application, select your flash drive from the left side of the screen."

Boot into the BIOS.You’ll need to act quickly because you only have a few seconds to enter the BIOS once your computer boots.,
Set the BIOS to boot from a USB drive.,
Set the boot priority first to CD, then Removable Device.,
Disconnect your hard drive before installing the operating system (OS) on your flash drive.,
Put the Ubuntu CD in the CD-ROM drive.,
Follow the prompts from the installer to install Ubuntu.,
Reboot the computer and re-enter the BIOS.,
Reconnect the hard drive.,
Turn on the computer.",How to Use a Flash Drive As a Hard Drive3," Turn on (or restart) your computer and watch for a message that says something like “Press F2 to enter setup” or “Setup=F1.” The exact message and key to press are different across different sorts of computers. Press the key as instructed to enter the BIOS.

, BIOS menus vary, but look for the option that mentions “Boot” and select it with keyboard commands.

, This will allow you to boot to install your operating system from a CD, and load it onto the flash drive.

, Disconnecting the hard drive leaves the operating system unaffected and prevents boot errors from grub (Ubuntu's operating system loader) if the USB drive is not present.

, Make sure the flash drive is plugged in, then reboot the computer.

, Select the USB flash drive as the location where you want to install the new OS.

, Depending on the computer, it may reboot automatically. Re-enter the BIOS and set the boot order to this order: 1) Removable Device, 2) CD, and 3) Hard Drive (HDD). If you see an option to enable “boot from USB,” as will be present on most Intel-enabled PCs, change it to “on” or “yes.”

, Remove the power cord and reattach hard-drive cable(s).

, To boot into Ubuntu, make sure the USB drive is plugged in. If you want to use the OS on your hard drive (in other words, not the version of Ubuntu you just installed on the USB drive), remove the USB drive before rebooting. When the USB drive is disconnected, it will first try to boot from CD. If there is no bootable CD in the CD-ROM drive, it will then boot from the hard drive as normal.

Download a disc copying program.,
Create an image from the disc.,
Burn the image.",How to Copy a Copyprotected CD2," While you can use the above method to rip the contents of an audio CD to your computer to be burned to a new CD, the process is a little different if you want to copy a data CD or make a 1:1 copy of your audio CD. To do this, you will need a disc copying program.


The most popular and powerful disc copying program is CloneCD. CloneCD is available for free for 21 days, which should allow you to copy any CD you need to without having to pay. You can always uninstall it and reinstall it if you want to restart the trial period.

, When you first start CloneCD, you will see four options. Select the first one to start the image creation process. This will copy the entire contents of the CD as a single file, which will then be able to be burned to a new disc.


In the next window, select the drive that contains the disc that you want to copy.
Choose the disc type. Once the disc has been analyzed, you will be given several options to choose from. Choose the type of content that is on the disc: CD Audio, Data, Multimedia Audio, Game or Protected Game.
Set a location for the image. Choose a location on your hard drive to store the image file. The image file will be as big as the CD is, which means it could be up to 800 MB large.
Wait for the image to be created. Once you set the location of the image file and continue, the image creation process will begin. This could take a significant amount of time. Avoid doing anything else on the computer during this process, as opening other programs could end up causing errors.

, Once the image has been created, you can burn it to a new blank CD. CloneCD has a burning function built-in, but you can use any image burning program, such as ImgBurn or Nero. See this guide for more details on burning image files to a disc.

They can, however, be fixed. It isn't incredibly difficult, but you still want to make sure the other two methods didn't work first. They are simpler and less invasive. That said, using a PST repair program is not very difficult, and is generally safe. Even better, Microsoft bundles a repair program right with Outlook called Inbox Repair., For Windows Users, you may have a program called ""Scanpst.exe"" that will do this for you. For Mac users, you may not have the option to use Scanpst. In this case, you must go search online to download an ""Outlook PST Repair"" program.

Repair will automatically create a backup of the PST file, so don't worry about losing old data., Once you've repaired your old file, simply drop it next to the old one. Remove the broken file, putting it in a new, separate folder for safe keeping in case something went wrong. If you're having trouble syncing up the new file, simply return to the ""Data Files"" screen in Account Settings. From there, you'll find the button ""Add File"" on the left-hand side.

, Never touch the shiny side of the disc.

, Wipe from the center to the edge with a damp paper towel with soap, then wash a second time to get the soap off. Window cleaners are often helpful also.

Add additional information.",How to Sign Up for Yahoo," When you're ready to begin, click ""Sign in"". This will take you to the login screen, where you'll be able to register a new account.;
, Clicking on the ""Sign in"" link should take you to a screen where you'll have the option to log into an existing account or create a new one. Click ""Create New Account"" to proceed.


You'll also see the option to login with a Facebook or Google account on this page. These are slightly misleading — you must have an existing Yahoo account associated with your social media profile to log in this way, so, if you're creating an account for the first time, you'll want to ignore these.

, You'll be asked to provide some basic personal information, including your name, sex, phone number, and birthday. Pick a Yahoo username (which, followed by ""@yahoo.com,"" will serve as your email address) and a password. Your password must be between 8 and 32 characters, contain upper and lowercase letters, and have at least one number.


You also have the option of providing a recovery phone number, though this isn't required. Providing a number allows you to use your phone to recover your login credentials (password, etc.) with your phone if you forget them. Other methods for recovering your login information are also available.

, When you're sure that all of the information you've entered is correct, complete the account creation process by clicking the purple button at the bottom of the form. You will be taken to your account home page, from where you can access your email account, update your public profile, and browse a personalized collection of headlines and information from the web.


Note that, by creating an account, you consent to Yahoo's terms of service and privacy policy. To read either of these in detail, click the small corresponding links above the ""Create Account"" button.

, Click the ""Mail"" link next to the picture of an envelope in the top right corner of the main Yahoo.com page.

,, Click the ""Inbox"" button on the left side of the screen to browse a list of the emails you have been sent. Note that, by default, your Yahoo email account displays your inbox as soon as you log in.

, Click on an email you've been sent in your inbox. Pick a reply option with the buttons at the top left of the email. You can reply normally (curving arrow pointing left), reply to all (multiple curving arrows; used when you are one of multiple recipients), or forward the message (straight arrow pointing right).

, In your email inbox, click the icon that looks like an address book in the top left. This will bring you to a list of your online contacts. To add a new contact to the list (which will be blank if you've just created an account), click ""New Contact"" in the top left. You can also choose to import contacts from a social media profile by clicking one of the buttons in the center of the screen and following the prompts.


Having someone in your list of contacts gives you several benefits. For instance, you don't have to remember this person's email address — you can just start typing his or her name in the ""To:"" field of your email and it will display automatically. This is especially useful when you need to send a single email to many recipients.

, One of the handy features of creating a Yahoo account is that it allows you to access your own personalized homepage via its My Yahoo feature. On the Yahoo.com page, click the ""My Yahoo"" link in the top right. You'll be taken to a page containing a variety of information custom-tailored to you, including top national and local headlines, local weather, movie showtimes, and more.

, Do so by using the ""Add Content"", ""Choose Themes"", and ""Edit Layout"" options in the top right of the window.


You can also access your My Yahoo page when you're not logged in, but the content displayed on it will be more general and less specifically tailored to you. For instance, the My Yahoo page won't have content you specifically selected and won't have the layout you chose if you don't log in.

, Another feature of having a Yahoo account is the Yahoo profile. Similar to the type of profile you might have on a social media site like Facebook, your Yahoo profile allows you to identify yourself to others as you use your Yahoo account. It also gives you an easy way to choose which information about yourself you want publicly available (as well as which information you don't). To access your profile, click the ""Hi, (your name)"" link in the top right of the window. You'll be taken to a profile activation screen — if you'd like to begin creating your profile, click ""Next: your public profile..."" Otherwise, click ""No, thanks.""

, Here, you can add a profile picture by clicking on the silhouette icon at the top of the screen, change the background by clicking ""Change Cover Image"", change your profile title by clicking on your name, and change your location by clicking ""Add a location"".

, You can also update your personal information by clicking the icon that looks like a person being drawn with a pencil in the top right. Here, you can add a personal bio, list your hobbies and interests, and more.

Back up your data.,
Turn off your computer and unplug it from everything.,
Open the computer case.,
Locate the hard drive inside the computer case.,
Determine how the hard drive is connected to the computer.,
Take the hard drive from where it rested in the tower.,
Remove the IDE ribbon cable.,
Remove the power connector.,
Take the hard drive out of the case and put it into an anti-static bag.",How to Remove a Hard Drive," We're going to do our best not to lose any data, but as Murphy's Law will tell you, things happen. It's better to be ready with a little precautions than to risk losing all your data.


Copy your information onto an external hard drive or use another form of backup like online backup prior to removing your current hard drive. If your hard drive has failed and your data has been lost, skip this step.;
, You're going to need to get inside the computer, and it'll be a lot easier if it doesn't hang up on wires or suddenly turn on and electrocute you. Unplug the power source, monitor and any other devices.

, Each computer model is manufactured differently. Opening your specific case may involve removing a side panel with a screwdriver or pushing a button to open the case in a clamshell fashion. The owner's manual that came with your computer should detail the manner in which the case is opened.


If your owner's manual is missing or you did not receive one, don't despair. Look carefully at your computer case and you'll probably be able to figure out how to remove it. Most older computers are secured with Phillips-head screws on the back.

, Within the computer, the hard drive could be placed in a cage that's either fixed to the tower or removable, or it could be placed on a set of rails. The hard drive is a rectangular metal box the size and width of a small book.


By convention, most computers locate the hard drive near the front of the case, near other drives (like your optical drive). If you look closely, your hard drive will be clearly labeled as such - don't go pulling random stuff out of your computer if you're not sure what it is!

, Now that you've located the hard drive, you need to figure out how to remove it.


You will need a screwdriver to open the cage and handle the drive if the hard drive is in a fixed or removable cage.
Newer, more modern cases will often be ""tool-less"", meaning that you just have to push a simple lever or switch to be able to remove the hard drive.

, Hard drives will often sit on a set of rails towards the front of the computer case. Using both hands, carefully slide it outward.


Pull carefully - if you encounter any resistance, stop! Nothing in a computer case should require any substantial amount of force - if you're pulling or pushing hard, you're probably doing it wrong.
The hard drive will have two or more cables connected to it. If those are impeding on your ability to take out the hard drive, remove these cables first.

, This is a broad, thin, usually gray ribbon running from your motherboard (or hard disk controller if present) to your hard drive.


The cable may be connected to the hard drive with glue, but you should be able to work it out of place without much hassle. Carefully remove as much glue as you can and work the plug back and forth gently to break the glue.

, This will be a plastic, rectangular connector with one or two latches (depending on the level of power your computer's motherboard provides to the hard drive).


This connector will usually be a lot more snug than the IDE ribbon cable. Make sure you're disengaging the latches on the plug and pull firmly on the connector. Take care not to bend any of the thin metal pins inside the plug.

, ""Naked"" hard drives removed from a computer are very sensitive to damage from moisture, dust and electrical shock. Anti-static bags are a cheap method of protecting your hard drive.


Anti-static bags can be cheaply purchased at most office supply or computer stores. If you're throwing out or recycling your hard drive, you can skip this step.

Get a hard drive disk enclosure.,
Borrow a working computer that is compatible with your old one.,
Mac users can insert a Windows hard drive into their computer and be able to read (not write) the contents of their hard drive if they did not install a separate driver, for example NTFS-3G or Paragon NTFS.,
Remove the hard drive from the dead laptop.,
Remove the disk enclosure’s connector plate and insert it into the hard drive interface.,
Insert the hard drive into the enclosure.,
Connect the external hard drive to the working computer with a USB cable.,
Explore and salvage your old files.,
When you’re done, close the window to your hard drive.,
Right-click the USB icon and select Eject.",How to Recover Data from the Hard Drive of a Dead Laptop1," This is an external system into which you can place a computer’s hard drive in order to run it on another computer via a USB port; essentially, the enclosure will turn your laptop’s hard drive into an external hard drive. Different computers use different hard drive models, so be sure to check your dead laptop’s specifications before making this purchase. Ex. If your laptop has a 2.5 SATA drive, you will need a 2.5 SATA USB enclosure.


Unless you have a SATA drive, be sure to buy a laptop-sized disk enclosure; only SATA-ready enclosures can accommodate both desktop and laptop hard drives.
Note that disk enclosures aren’t commonly found in big-box stores and are usually purchased online.;
, If you had a Windows, use another Windows; if you had a Mac, use another Mac; etc. Make sure it has enough space to accommodate the files you want to recover from the dead laptop; alternatively, you can hook a second external hard drive up to the working computer and simply use the computer as a transfer system for the files.


A Linux computer will be able to read files off of a Windows computer (but not the other way around); unless you understand both systems, however, it is best to use a Windows computer to recover a Windows hard drive.

, Take caution, though, and only use Disk Utility during the process to ""mount"" the hard drive. Any other action you make on Disk Utility may remove contents.

, Turn off the laptop, unplug it, and remove the battery. Turn it over and you’ll see that various sections of the laptop base can be unscrewed and removed separately. Either look up your laptop model online to see exactly where the hard drive sits or simply look for the most likely candidate: though it differs between laptops, a laptop hard drive is often similar in size and shape to a 3.5-inch floppy disk. Unscrew the hard drive cover and remove the hard drive. Some models will pop upwards, some will slide outwards, etc.

, Look for connector pins at one end of the drive to see where to make this connection.


If you have an IDE hard drive, note that there is a detachable adapter sitting over the interface. Simply pull this adapter off so that the drive will properly connect with the enclosure’s connector plate.

, Screw it shut if necessary; read the enclosure manual for additional details.

, Make sure the computer is turned on. Once the drive is connected, an icon should appear on your desktop (Mac) or a notification should pop up (Windows). The computer might also open the drive for you automatically.


If Windows doesn’t automatically prompt you about the new external storage unit, simply open it manually by going to My Computer and looking for the new drive.
If the hard drive isn’t recognized at first, try ejecting it and plugging it back in.
If the hard drive is not readable, it’s likely that the hard drive itself (and not your computer’s software) failed. If this is the case, you will need professional assistance if you wish to continue the salvage. Be warned that this can be very expensive.

, Transfer them to either the working computer or to a second external hard drive by copying and pasting, clicking and dragging, etc. If you have a lot of large files (ex. songs, movies), note that the transfer could take many hours.

, The good news is that the dead computer is still physically intact and will probably work fine if you reinstall your operating system.

, You can now detach the old hard drive.

If your laptop has an IDE hard drive, note that there is a detachable adapter sitting over the hard drive interface. Simply pull this adapter off so that the interface is accessible later.

, You will use the adapter kit to plug the old hard drive directly into the motherboard.

, How you do this will depend on your drive and adapter types, so use the instructions that came with the kit.


If you have an IDE drive, configure it to “slave” mode before connecting it to the IDE ribbon. The configuration should be noted on the hard drive itself and will involve moving a plastic cap over a particular pin or set of pins (aka “jumpers”) on the hard drive interface. Configuring it to slave mode will keep your laptop hard drive from competing with the desktop’s “master” hard drive during boot-up.

, Plug your desktop back in, power it on, and open BIOS. Go to Standard CMOS Settings or IDE Config, where you will find four settings involving master and slave settings. Change all four fields to auto-detection.

, Your desktop should now automatically detect the new hardware.

, If you’re using Windows, go to My Computer and look for the new hard drive. With Linux, the new drive will appear in the dev directory.

Most cases have thumbscrews, but older cases may require the use of a screwdriver to open. Many cases will require you to remove both panels in order to secure the hard drive, though some have removable housings.;
, Before you begin working on the interior of your computer, make sure you discharge any electrostatic charge you may have. If your computer is still plugged into the wall (with the switch off), you can touch any of the exposed metal of the case to discharge. You can also touch a water tap to discharge your electrostatic charge.


The safest way to work inside of a computer is to wear an antistatic wrist strap while working on the computer.

, The location will vary depending on the case, but it can typically be found beneath the optical drive bay. If you are upgrading or replacing a hard drive, you should see one already installed.

, Locate the HDD you wish to replace and disconnect each of the two cables coming out from the rear of the drive. If you are adding storage to your existing configuration, you should leave the original hard drive installed where it is and skip down to Step 5.


Notice that the cable on the left is insulated and has a wider connector than the other. This is the Serial ATA power cable which connects the HDD to the computer's power supply. The flat, red cable on the right has a smaller connector. This is the SATA Data Connector which connects the hard drive to the motherboard. Disconnect each from the drive by pulling gently on the connectors.

, The method for securing the HDD into the drive bay will vary somewhat from system to system, but it typically requires two small screws on each side of the drive that hold it in the bay.


Remove the screws and slide the old HDD out from the drive bay. The old drive has now been removed.

, If your case permits, try to maintain some space between the new drive and any existing drives to help promote airflow and cooling. Be sure that the metal side faces up and the black, plastic side faces down. Also verify that the two SATA connection ports in back of the drive are accessible.

, Secure the drive into the drive bay by inserting two screws into each side of the hard drive through the corresponding holes in the drive bay. Make sure to only use short screws designed for hard drives; if the screws are too long they could seriously damage the hard drive when it is running.

, Connect the insulated power cable with the wider tip into the larger connection port situated on the left-rear of the HDD. If the power cable does not fit easily, check to make sure that it is not upside down. Connect the data cable to the smaller SATA port on the hard drive.


If the power supply is older, it may not have any SATA power connectors. If this is the case, you will need a Molex-to-SATA adapter. Molex plugs have four pins, and may be white or black.

, If you are adding a new drive, you will need to connect the data cable to a SATA port on the motherboard (if you are replacing and old drive, the data cable should already be connected).


SATA ports are usually grouped together and labeled. If you can’t see the labels, refer to your motherboard’s documentation.
Your primary (boot) drive should be connected to the lowest SATA port on your motherboard, unless otherwise specified in your motherboard documentation. This is usually SATA0 or SATA1.
If you don’t have any SATA ports on your motherboard, your motherboard does not support the SATA interface. You will need to Install-a-Motherboardinstall a motherboard]] that supports the SATA format.

, Once the hard drive is secured and connected, close up your computer and power it back on. Before you can use your new drive, you will need to format it. If you are replacing the primary drive or building a new computer, you will need to install your operating system. Follow one of the guides below for more detailed instructions:

Finish the installation.",How to Install a SATA Drive2," Turn of the power switch on the back of the power supply, but leave the cable plugged in if possible. This will help keep you grounded. If you have to unplug everything, be sure to follow Step 2 closely. Open the case using the thumbscrews (or a screwdriver if necessary). You will need to remove both side panels on many older cases and some newer ones in order to properly secure the drive.

, Before you begin working on the interior of your computer, make sure you discharge any electrostatic charge you may have. If your computer is still plugged into the wall (with the switch off), you can touch any of the exposed metal of the case to discharge. You can also touch a water tap to discharge your electrostatic charge.


The safest way to work inside of a computer is to wear an antistatic wrist strap while working on the computer.

, Most optical drives are inserted from the front of the case. You may need to remove a drive bay cover from your case’s front bezel before you can insert the drive. Refer to your case’s documentation for specific instructions for your case.


Secure the drive using two screws on each side, or by using rails if your case has them.

, Use the SATA power connector to plug into the larger SATA slot on your optical drive. The cable can only be inserted in one direction, so don’t force it. If your power supply is older, it may only have Molex (4-pin) connectors. If this is the case, you will need to use a Molex-to-SATA adapter.

, Use the smaller SATA data cable to connect the optical drive to the motherboard. Use the SATA port on the motherboard directly after your last hard drive. For example, if your hard drive is in SATA1 on the motherboard, install the optical drive into SATA2.


If your hard drive does not have any SATA ports, your motherboard does not support the SATA connection. You will need to install a new motherboard if you want to use your SATA drive.

, Once the optical drive is secured and connected, you can close up your computer and power it back on. Your new drive should be automatically detected, and any necessary drivers will be installed automatically. If they are not, you may need to use the driver disc that came with the drive, or download the drivers from the manufacturer’s website."

, Turn it over and remove the battery. Make sure that the power cable is not plugged it. Ground yourself, either by wearing an antistatic wrist strap, or by touching grounded metal.

, The location varies from laptop to laptop, but generally it will be located behind a panel on the underside of the laptop. You may need to remove stickers to access all of the screws.

, Usually, you can pull a piece of ribbon to pop the hard drive out of the connectors. The method will vary depending on your laptop model. The hard drive should be easy to remove from the laptop once it has been disconnected.


Some hard drives will have cages attached to them. You will need to unscrew the cage and then attach it to the new hard drive before inserting it.

, Place the hard drive in the bay and press it firmly into the connectors. Make sure that the hard drive is lined up correctly before applying pressure. The hard drive should plug snugly into the connectors without a significant amount of force.


Secure the hard drive with any screws or clips that you removed to get the old one out.

, Once your hard drive is secured and the panels have been replaced, you can power up your laptop. Your new hard drive should be recognized automatically, but will not boot since there is no operating system present.

Pay someone to shred or melt it.,
Destroy Hard Drives with Derik's Boot and Nuke.,
Use a drive duplicator.",How to Properly Dispose of Hard Disk Drives," There are companies, such as Iron Mountain and Shred-it, whose job it is to dispose of sensitive materials. A pro of this method is that their services are certified. In a business environment, this is crucial for liability reasons. A con, however, is that the storage medium is no longer usable. They're also very expensive, so if money is an option, take it into your own hands. Get a hammer, beat the hard drive to pieces. Drill holes into it. Create a heroic, electromagnetic shock if you're feeling frisky. The creativity of this method is up to the destroyer's imagination. But heed this warning: There is no going back once the hammer falls.;
, The DoD (Department of Defense) requires that any information be overwritten no less than 7 times to ensure its disposal. Good software to use for this method is Darik's Boot and Nuke (DBAN). The program is designed to securely erase a hard disk until data is permanently removed and no longer recoverable, which is achieved by overwriting the data with random numbers generated by Mersenne twister or ISAAC. The Gutmann method, Quick Erase, DoD Short (3 passes), and DoD 5220.22m (7 passes) are also included as options. A pro of this method is that DBAN is free, and of course the HDD is still usable. Major con: TIME. It can take quite awhile depending on contributing factors such as number of passes and HDD size.

, Some drive duplicators such as The Ninja offer an option to erase data in retrospect to copying it. It does this sector to sector ensuring a thorough job. That's the major pro: it does it right. The con: Price. Well into the thousands of dollars.

Enter your Operating System and holding your drive in your hand as near as you can to your ear, closely listen to the sound it makes while it works.,
Think through all the noises the HDD made, and try to establish if it was a normal working noise or a faulty one.",How to Listen for Hard Drive Problems," Turn on your computer and put the HDD against your ear so that u can ear clearly the sound it produces when booting.;
,, The best way to do this is to copy some data from another drive to the drive you want to test.

, If the drive makes a loop of clicks when powered on, it's a dead or soon to be dead drive. If while working under your OS the drive sometime loops through a set of power on noises ( as if you just powered it on ) it's a dead or soon to be dead drive. If you can't hear nothing at all, replace the drive since it is already dead.

It depends on your preference whether to take the backup on a weekly or monthly basis. Search for the settings which allow you to regularly backup your data.
, One of the best ways to store your important files is to back them up on an external hard drive. You can purchase the external hard disks and drives according to the size of data. Whenever you need the data, you can easily retrieve it from the drive and commence your work. Once you upload the data on the hard drive, keep it in the safe place., You can also store your important files on the internet because an offsite backup solution is important in the event of a disaster. There are a variety of online backup solutions that are available at very reasonable prices. These companies manage your data securely and have built in backup solutions of their own in case their systems crash. If you lose your data on your personal device, simply log into your account online and restore your data at a click of a button., Save files often and save multiple copies of the same files so you do not lose important work. It is also common for users to overwrite existing files with files they do not intend to so be careful when saving your files!, It is a good idea to schedule routine system tests to ensure all hardware is operating efficiently and correctly.

Determine if your chat logs still exist.,
Locate the folder containing chat logs.,
Open a chat file with your preferred web browser.",How to Locate Your Instant Message History in MSN Messenger1," Since chat logs were saved locally in MSN/Windows Live Messenger, you will need to have the same hard drive where the programs were installed or the chat logs were saved. Furthermore, you will need to have enabled chat logging in the MSN/Windows Live Messenger client. If you had not done so previously, then there will be no chat logs to recover.;
, When enabling chat logging, users could select the destination folder for where the logs were saved. If you had set that manually, then that is the folder you will need to navigate to. Otherwise the default location is:



C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Received Files\<username>\History for Windows Vista, 7, or 8.

You can search Windows for the chat files, contained in .xml files, but the process may be a bit tedious.


XML (Extensible Markup Language) files are a format for text data. Like HTML, they can be read with a web browser, but the format is more flexible with how the data can be applied between applications. They can also be opened in a text editor, but the data will likely read more smoothly from a web browser.

, Go to Start > Search and enter the search term XML and begin the search.

, You get many results for XML files, but you can make things a little easier by the looking at the filepath for each listed result. Look for a filepath that seems like where you might have saved the chat logs. With a little luck and some persistence, you can find the chat logs you’re looking for!
