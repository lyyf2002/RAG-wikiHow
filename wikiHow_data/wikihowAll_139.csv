In order to burn a dual-layer video DVD, you will need your video file on your computer formatted into the VIDEO_TS folder format. This occurs when you rip a DVD, or copy an unprotected DVD from the disc to your hard drive.

, Click the Mode menu, and then select Build. Click the small “Browse for a Folder” button to open the file browser. Navigate to your VIDEO_TS folder and click OK.

DVD+R means the disc is rewritable and you can (with appropriate software) delete files off the disc and replace with new ones. The file will just hide under the new ones and take up some disc space.

DVD-R means the disc is not erasable and cannot be reused although files can be copied to another drive and burned on a new disc.

ROM means it's Read Only Media that can not be erased and is permanently burned onto the disc.

RW states the old file is erased completely taking no disc space at all after being rewritten or re-burned.;

Purchase only DVD-R disc formats for this purpose. Many players don't play discs with DVD+R format correctly, and the menus on the DVD may not function right when burned on that format. You can tweak the settings of the authoring program to fix this problem but it's best left to more advanced users.

, If you want to burn a video file to a DVD so that it can be played in any DVD player, you'll need a special kind of burning program, referred to as ""DVD authoring"" programs. These programs will convert the video file(s) to the format that is recognized by standalone DVD players. These programs typically don't come installed on your computer, though you may have a trial or basic version that came with your DVD burner. Below are a few of the most popular free options for the major operating systems:WinX DVD Author - winxdvd.com/dvd-author/ (Windows)
Burn - burn-osx.sourceforge.net (Mac)
DeVeDe - rastersoft.com/programas/devede.html (Linux; Windows no longer free)
DVD Styler - dvdstyler.org/en/

DVD Flick- dvdflick.net/ (out of date but is operational and with practice you can create your own custom backgrounds and buttons; for Windows)

, The process varies a little bit depending on the program you are using, but generally you'll be presented with a menu when you start your program, allowing you to pick the type of DVD you are creating. Choose the ""Video"" option or tab.

, After starting your new project, you can add your first video file. Most DVD authoring programs support all the major video formats, so you typically don't need to worry about converting the files first. Click and drag the video into the authoring window, or browse for the video file on your computer.


You can usually fit one full-length movie onto your DVD, or several hour-long TV episodes.

, Oftentimes the video files that you add are not in the proper MPEG-2 format required to make a playable video DVD. The extension name for this is ,MPEG OR .MPG. Most DVD authoring programs will convert your video file either as you add it to the project, or after you're finished adding files. Converting the video may take a while to complete.


If prompted during the video conversion, select the correct region for your DVD player. The US and Japan use NTSC, while most of Europe uses PAL.
If you are using DeVeDe, the conversion happens at the end of the authoring process.
If you are receiving errors when attempting to convert the file, you may need to use a dedicated conversion program like Handbrake. Click here for instructions on using Handbrake to convert your files to a DVD compatible format.
Flash-Integro (or VSDC Movie Editor free version) also converts movies into needed formats and offers many editing options like cutting and splitting as well. Go to the Flash-Integro site and not the other fake ones.
You can also record a video in a media player like VLC or PotPlayer in MPEG format to convert a file as well. It takes as long as the movie duration.

, Many DVD authoring programs have basic menu creation tools. These allow you to create a custom menu for your video. You don't need a menu for the video to be playable, as you can have it just automatically start playing when the disc is inserted.


In Burn for Mac, click the Gear button and select ""Use DVD theme"" to enable a basic menu for your DVD.When creating the menu, avoid placing buttons along the very edge of the frame. The edge is often cut off by older TVs and DVD players.

, Once the video is converted and the menu has been created, you can start the burning process. Insert a blank DVD-R into your computer's DVD burner. This is the best disc format for creating video DVDs, as DVD-R is compatible with the widest range of DVD players. Some older DVD players will not be able to play any burned DVDs, regardless of format.


If your computer opens the AutoPlay window when you insert the blank disc, just close it.

, Again, the process will vary depending on the program you are using. There are a few settings that you'll want to check before you actually burn the project to the disc:


Set the ""Write Speed"" low. While it may be tempting to set the speed to MAX or another high value, this can lead to errors on the disc which will prevent it from playing. The best way to ensure that your disc will work is to burn at 2X or 4X only.
If you haven't been prompted to select your region yet, check the Burn menu for the NTSC for PAL option and select the appropriate one.

, After reviewing your settings, start the burn process by clicking Start or Burn. If your videos weren't converted yet, they'll be converted before being burned. The entire process may take a while, especially if you've lowered the burn speed. Try to avoid using your computer while it is converting and burning, as this could slow the process down or cause errors.


If you're using DeVeDe, the program will only create an ISO (disc image) file. You'll need to then burn the ISO file yourself. See this section for more information.

, Once the burning and converting process is complete, you should be able to play your new disc in most DVD players. Remember, not all DVD players support burned DVDs, especially older models.

, Most modern operating systems allow you to burn data DVDs directly from your file explorer without any additional software. Opening the blank disc will allow you to add files and folders.


In Windows 7 and later, you'll be prompted to select whether you want to use the disc like a USB drive, or like a traditional finished DVD. Selecting ""Like a USB flash drive"" will allow you to rewrite the disc, even if it isn't a rewriteable disc, but it will only work in Windows.

, Once you're finished adding files, you can finalize your disc and eject it so that you can use it on other computers. The process is a little different depending on your operating system and settings.


If you selected ""Like a USB flash drive"" in Windows, just eject your disc after you're finished adding files and the disc will be made ready to use on other Windows computers. This may take a minute or so.
If you selected ""With a CD/DVD player"" in Windows, click the ""Finish burning"" button to finalize the disc. This may take a few minutes.

If you are using Windows Vista or XP, or you are trying to burn an image file other than ISO, you'll need to install an image burning program. One of the most popular programs for Windows is ImgBurn (imgburn.com).

, Burning an image file to your disc will finalize it, and it won't be able to be rewritten. For best results, use a DVD-R format disc.

, The process varies depending on your operating system and installed software:


Windows 7, 8, and 10 - Right-click on the ISO file and select ""Burn to disc"". This will open the Windows Disc Image Burner utility.
OS X - Launch the Disk Utility program, which you can find in the Utilities folder. Drag your ISO file into the left frame of the Disk Utility window.Windows Vista and XP, or non-ISO files - Launch your image burning program and load the image file.

, Click the ""Burn"" button to begin burning your ISO or other disc image file to your blank DVD. This process will take several minutes, depending on the speed of your burner and the size of your image file.

This is your CD-burning device (It might be a CD or it might be a DVD, which can burn both). If you don't see this, your computer doesn't have the capability of burning a CD directly. However, an external CD or DVD burner can easily be hooked up through the USB slot.


;
, There are two types of CDs that you can use.

A CD-R (Compact Disc-Recordable) can be burned once, and can not be erased. This type disc is usually used for permanent storage. For example; a music CD, a picture CD, or any other type of data that you want to keep permanently.
A CD-RW (Compact Disc Re-Writable) is a rewritable optical disc format. This type of disc can be burned, erased, and then burned again. This type disc is usually used for temporary data storage.

, There are many different types of CDs that can be burned and how you proceed depends on which type you are going to burn:

Music. This is the type of CD that is normally burned for use in a home or automobile CD player.
Data. This type of CD is most often used to store files that can be used by a computer, and is similar to a standard hard disk. Use it to store writing docs, spreadsheets, databases, and any other file type. Note that while you can store music files on a data CD, you cannot use it in a standard home or automobile CD player.
MP3. This is a data CD containing only .mp3 compressed music files. Because it is actually a standard data CD, only CD players that specifically support .mp3 playback will be able to play the music on this CD. The advantage is that you can fit about five times as many .mp3s on a data CD as you can on a music CD.
Disk image. A disk image file is a file that contains an exact copy of a disk. The most common type of disk image is an .ISO image (International Standards Organisation) , which simply means an exact copy of the original disc, stored on your hard drive. One can then burn a CD from the .ISO image and create a usable CD.

, There are many different programs that are designed to burn CDs. Some are built into the computer's operating system, while others are individual programs. These programs range from very simple to very complex. Some of these are free, while others have to be purchased. As this varies by manufacturer, it's best to check the documentation that came with your computer to get the details from the user's guide., Once you've figured out that you can burn a disc, and that you've got the software to do it, it's time to get down to the actual burning. The actual steps will vary depending on what software you use, but the general process goes like this:





Open your CD drive drawer. Press on the small rectangular button on the lower right of the drive, on the front of your computer.









Place the CD-R into the tray, face up.
Press the drawer to close it.
Launch your CD-burning software.
Follow the on-screen instructions to add content to the CD-burning software.
Click the ""burn"" button, and wait while the computer does its CD-burning thing.

Open ""Computer"" from the Start menu, then right-click on the icon for Local Disk (C:). Select ""Properties"" to pull up a pop-up menu. Under the ""General"" tab, you will see figures and a pie chart representing the used and free space on your (C:) drive. Click the ""Disk Cleanup"" button to calculate how much space you'll be able to free up.;
, The ""System and Security"" screen contains an option to ""Free up disk space,"" which will activate the built-in Disk Cleanup program. This menu also includes actions and information that help you, among other things: view and change system and security status, back up and store file and system settings, update your computer, view RAM and processor speed, and check your firewall.

, Find the link in small text beneath the ""Administrative Tools"" heading, near the bottom of the page. You will be prompted to select which drive you want to clean up.

, You should have the option to clear out Local Disk (C:) or Local Disk (D:). Choose the (C:) drive unless you've intentionally saved personal files to the (D:) drive. Generally, (C:) stores all of your documents, records, and program files, while (D:) contains sensitive system-restoration files that were pre-installed by the computer manufacturer. Once you've selected the drive, click ""OK"" to proceed.


Avoid tampering with the system files stored in the (D:) drive. If you don't know what something is, assume that it is essential to the function or backup of your computer. If a file is malicious or isn't supposed to be there, run a web search to identify it – or contact the support team of your computer manufacturer., This process can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. In general, the more cluttered your disk, the longer it will take to scan. You should see a pop-up box: ""Disk Cleanup is calculating how much space you will be able to free on Local Disc (C:). This may take a few minutes.""

, Highlight each option to see which files this category includes, and what exactly you will be deleting. Look at how much memory each file type takes up – if you only have a few kilobytes (KB) of temporary Internet files, deleting them will scarcely change your user experience. Decide whether or not deleting these files will impact your work. Feel free to select everything on the list if you're in dire need of space.

, This folder includes ActiveX controls and Java applets that download automatically when you view certain pages. They are saved to the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard drive. If you clear these files, they will download again as needed when you visit the pages in question.

, These copies of websites are stored on your hard drive for quick viewing. Feel free to clear out this folder without much further thought: you will not lose your personalized settings and login information for webpages, so your online experience won't suffer.

, You should not have much memory bound up in these files unless you play a lot of games on your computer. Feel free to delete them for the sake of clearing space. Understand the function of each file type:


Game News Files facilitate delivery of the RSS feeds to your Game Library. If you don't play many games on your computer, or you don't care much for keeping them rigorously updated, you should no issue deleting this.
Game Statistics Files are created to aid maintenance of various game statistics. As with the Game News Files, it should not detract from your user experience if you clear these files.

, The Recycle Bin includes any files that you've deleted. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the folder. This folder may be very full or nearly empty, depending on how many files you've recently deleted and how often you empty the Bin.

, Clearing this category often frees up the most space. Your operating system automatically creates these temporary files to protect things you're working on. These files may be linked to Word documents, edited images, or unfinished and cancelled downloads (from browsers and applications that download updates, plugins, etc.) Delete any temporary files that you haven't changed in at least a week.


Your system usually deletes temporary files when you shut down your computer. If your computer crashes, dies, or shuts down suddenly, these files won't receive the deletion instruction, and they will linger indefinitely. If you don't shut down your computer often enough—say, you put it into ""sleep"" mode but don't ever turn it fully off—you may also notice a build-up of temporary files.

, Windows retains a cached copy of all photo, video, and document thumbnails. This way, the system can display the files faster when you open a folder. These files can build up, however, as you create new folders and gradually neglect older folders. If you delete these thumbnail files, your system will automatically recreate them as needed.

, There is a button on the Disk Cleanup menu labeled ""Clean up system files"". Select it, if you want to clear extra space, and wait for the program to calculate how much memory is safe to delete. Within a minute or two, the same Disk cleanup menu should appear with additional file categories to delete. Consider what each of these file types means, and decide whether it's safe to delete them:


Service Pack Backup Files: Windows keeps old versions of files updated by service packs. Be aware that if you clear these files, you'll be unable to uninstall the service pack.
Temporary Windows installation files: These are the installation files used by Windows setup. These files are left over from the installation process, and you no longer need them. Feel free to delete these files.
Windows Update Cleanup: Windows retains a copy of each newly-installed Windows Update, even once you've gotten a more recent update. Windows Update cleanup deletes older versions of updates that you no longer need, and that are cluttering your hard drive. Be prepared to restart your computer.

, Make sure that you've checked the boxes for each of the file categories that you want to clear out.

, The program will prompt you: ""Are you sure you want to permanently delete these files?"" Think back to all of the files that you selected. If you're sure, click ""Delete"" to finish the job and clear up disk space. If you aren't completely certain, navigate back to the file-selection box and make sure you've chosen the right categories.

, Once you click ""Delete"", a pop-up should appear with the message: ""The Disk Cleanup utility is cleaning up unnecessary files on your machine."" Watch the green progress bar to gauge how far along the removal process has gone. Depending on how much memory you're deleting (from a smattering of kilobytes up to multiple gigabytes) the utility may run for anywhere from one minute to 20 minutes.If you have second thoughts for any reason, click the ""Cancel"" button to the right of the green progress bar. The files that have been deleted already will be gone, but you'll prevent the program from removing any further files.
Look beneath the progress bar to see which files are currently being cleared. This may help you gauge the progress and decide whether you need to cancel anything.

, Open the Programs and Features menu by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Programs, and then clicking Programs and Features. Wait for the list to populate with all of the programs currently installed on your computer. Look for programs that take up a lot of space, and that you don't use often. Select a program, and then click Uninstall.


Some programs include the option to change or repair the program in addition to uninstalling it, but many simply offer the option to uninstall. To change a program, click Change or Repair.
1 kilobyte (KB) is 1000 bytes. 1 megabyte (MB) is 1000 KB. 1 gigabyte (GB) is 1000 MB, and 1 terabyte (TB) is 1000 GB. The sizes of your programs are probably in the MB-GB range.
If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation. If you can't confirm, you may not be the administrator of this computer, and you may not be able to delete this program., When you download an application from the internet, you probably downloaded an exe/msi file with a name like setup. Once you've run this file and installed the program, it can be safely deleted.

Rip your disc to your computer.,
Compress the files (this is also known as transcoding).,
Burn the compressed file to a blank DVD.,
Test your DVD.",How to Back Up DVD Movies," The first step is transferring the data from the DVD to your computer so that you can work with it. In order to do this you will need DVD ripping software. There are several available on the Internet, with a few free utilities and several commercial products. A free utility will be sufficient. While it may not have as many features and is not as intuitive, it will get the job done. If you are a power-user, though, and need to back up a library of hundreds of DVDs, seriously consider buying a commercial product.;
, Many movies are 9 or more gigabytes in size. The DVDs that you can buy in the stores are generally 4.7 gigabytes in size. This unfortunately means that you have 2 options if you want to burn your DVD: you can compress it or you can split it into 2 parts and burn each part individually. Because splitting the DVD is more complicated and winds up with a movie that you have to watch in 2 parts, compression is recommended. Once again, you need specific software for this. If you have the software for it, the steps are pretty intuitive to follow.


When choosing to compress your video file, several different codec options will appear (the codec determines what type of file you will have, like an .mpg, .avi, or any other type). The codecs provide varying levels of quality, with the higher quality being larger. When backing up DVDs, you don't want to compress the file too much, because if you do you'll wind up with a very grainy video. It's better to use a higher quality codec and use more space if you're going to be watching the video on a large screen. They should be listed in order of quality, with the highest quality being the top option and the lowest quality being the bottom option.

, Once you've ripped the disc image and compressed it to the point that it will fit on a DVD, open up your DVD burning software, put a blank recordable DVD into the drive, and begin the burning process.


Make sure you buy the right type of DVD at the store. Check your DVD burner on your computer to see which type it can use (you can usually find it just on the front cover of the drive). Check to see which of the DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-R or DVD-RW it will burn to. Some drives allow all of them to be used. Once you have the right one you can put it into the drive, open up your burning software, select which file you would like to burn and then begin the process.

, Once you've burned your DVD, make sure to test it on your computer and your DVD player, as they read different types of files. If it plays on your computer, it does not mean that it will play in your DVD player. You should double-check this, and if it doesn't work, play with the compression/transcoding settings. Also be sure to check your DVD player on your TV to see which types of DVDs it will play.

Determine your best option.,
Connect the external drive.,
Access the drive.",How to Have More Than Two Hard Drives in a PC1," External drives come in many shapes and sizes to fit any user’s needs. Make sure your computer has a spare port to plug into.


Just want to plug and play? Look for a model without an external power supply.
Frequently backing up your data? Some models come with automatic backup software.
Pay attention to USB speeds! Newer versions of USB will transfer data faster, but your computer must have a corresponding port. Luckily both port and cables are backwards compatible!;
, External hard drives are usually connected via USB port, although some models may use external SATA. Once connected, the driver should install automatically and you can start using it to store data!

, Open the file explorer to verify that your drive is listed with your other storage devices. You should be able to start storing data immediately!

, Any files you haven't used in a long period of time and don't need, delete them. This includes old songs that you don’t listen to anymore and files such as old homework.


Note the date that you last used that file. If it was a long time ago (a few months, for example), there’s probably no point in keeping it. . You can use Windows Explorer by displaying details on the files. The last detail is, by default, the time it was last used.
Move old pictures to an external hard drive or USB stick to get them off of your computer without losing them forever!

, All of the favourites from Internet Explorer are in here. Delete all of these except for the ones you marked yourself.

, If you have two Microsoft word documents that are similar, combine them by transferring all of the information from one to the other and them deleting the old file. Believe it or not, this saves space on your hard drive!

, Right-click on the recycle bin and click ""empty recycle bin."" This takes those deleted files right off of your computer. Be warned though, there’s no way to get these files back after they’re gone.

Don't go for a data recovery software, it will be of no use.,
Be aware that the clicking noise occurs when the System Area cannot be read by the head of the hard drive.,
Repair your hard drive first:


For heads and preamplificator: You need to change the head in both case.,
If the SA is scratched you might have a chance to get your data back using a ""live pcb (printed circuit board) swap"".,
For firmware issue on your pcb, a pcb swap is the operation you should do.",How to Get Your Data Back on a Clicking Dead Hard Drive," You will need to fix the problem first before you can move on to a soft solution. You might need some expensive hardware and tools, but it is also possible to do it sometimes with simple tricks; it depends on what happened.;
, There are four different reasons why the SA cannot be read:


The head has a problem thus cannot read anything.
The System Area is scratched so it can't be read by the head (some info about SA is available online, check deadhardrive blogger in google)
The firmware on the pcb has some damage
The preamplificator is dead (small component on the head who amplifies the signal)

,
Head swapping should be done in a white room, but if you are skilled enough you can try it in a clean environment if you don't plan to spend money anyway on your data. If you plan to spend a bit then you can try with a commercial company (Deadhardrive or any other using PC3000 tools)

, It will basically bypass the SA reading.

, This is doable by most individuals.

A standard 3.5” internal desktop hard drive is a good way to add lots of space for cheap.


Both hard drives and optical drives can utilize either an IDE or SATA interface cable(two alternates to USB). Most hard drives will come bundled with the cables they need, but you may need to purchase them separately as well.

, Most optical drives utilize a 5.25” expansion bay, which is too large for a 3.5” hard drive. You may need mounting brackets or a 5.25” to 3.5” bay adapter. Consult your manufacturer’s specifications to verify the size of your optical drive first.


The expansion bay is the space that holds the drive. Both mounting brackets and bay adapters will allow you to fit your smaller hard drive into the larger space.

, You want to make sure the computer is completely powered off and unplugged before touching any of the electronic components.

, You will likely need a screwdriver to open the computer wall. The type of screwdriver will vary depending on manufacturer.

, Most optical drives are connected via two cables: power and data.


The power cable typically has a white tip attached with black, yellow, and red wires.
The data cable has a wide tip attached to a ribbon cable.

, Once the screws are removed, the drive should either slide out or release with a latch.

, Secure the necessary adapter with screws.

, Slide the drive into the bay and reattach the screws.

, Reattach the power and data cables.

, You will need to plug the computer back in to setup the drive.

, BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is the software used by the processor to identify its hardware like your newly installed hard drive.

Don't chat your crush the second he or she signs online.,
Have a fun and casual opening.,
Avoid always being the one who says ""hi"" first.",How to Chat With Your Crush on MSN1," Your heart may race the second your crush signs on, but that doesn't mean you have to race to start your conversation. It's better to play it cool and look like you're not just hanging around waiting for the second he or she signs on.


Unless your crush is the kind of person who only signs on for a minute at a time, let some time pass--at least 10 or 15 minutes. Then your crush will see that while you want to continue your conversation, you have other things to do on MSN. This will make you look less needy or clingy.
Don't wait too long or your crush won't think you're interested.;
, When you do greet your crush, it's important to start the conversation on the right foot so your crush wants to spend more time talking to you. The key here is to play it cool---but not too cool.


Saying, ""How are you?"" or ""What's up?"" is perfectly acceptable. Don't try too hard to wow your crush with your opener.
You can start with an interesting story about something that happened to you, something you were previously talking about, or something cool you just heard on the news. Again, keep it short and don't try too hard.

, It's important to strike a balance in your relationship. You don't want to be the one who always sends the first message, because there might be a chance that your crush may not be all that eager to talk to you after all.


It may be the case that your crush is just shy and likes it when you make all the moves. But if this is the case, then it could be a sign that if you take your relationship to the next level, your crush will still expect you to do all the work. That could get annoying really fast.

, Look for the ""Storage and iCloud Usage"" tab.


For Android, find the ""Storage"" tab and select it., Under ""Storage"" (which covers your phone's internal hard drive) and ""iCloud"" (which covers your online-based cloud storage), you can see how much memory you are currently using and how much is remaining.


If you have an Android with an SD card, you'll have a drive option for your phone's internal storage as well as the card. These different drives are under ""Internal Storage"" and ""SD Card"", respectively.

, This will tell you your hard drive's total capacity for file storage


Note that a portion of the hard drive is dedicated to the operating system and other non-retrievable system files, so your actual total space won't quite match the number associated with your phone model (e.g. 32GB, 64GB)
You can also view your phone's effective storage capacity and currently available space under the ""About"" tab in the ""General"" menu.

, This feature shows you how memory is being used by apps, images, or other information.


Use this feature to clear up space. For example, if you see that several gigabytes of your used space come from saved conversations, you can free up that space by deleting those conversations.

Tease your crush.,
Be witty.",How to Chat With Your Crush on MSN2," Once you get to know each other a little better, teasing will be a great way to flirt with your crush. This will show that you appreciate your crush's quirks and that you don't take life too seriously. Here are some great ways to tease your crush:


If he's really obsessed with a particular hobby, band, or activity, you can poke fun at him about that. If he's obsessed with his guitar, for example, you can say, ""How much time did you spend with your girlfriend today?""
If you like sports teams who are rivals, you can tease him about how his team is going to lose that day without being too annoying about it.
Don't take your teasing too far. There's a difference between poking fun at someone and insulting him or her, and it can be hard to tell the difference on the Internet.
Show that you can be teased, too. He'll be impressed that you're confident enough for him to make fun of your foibles too.

, Your crush will be impressed by your quick wit and sense of humor. It can be tricky to show your scintillating sense of humor online, but if you can pull it off, your crush will be impressed. Here are some ways to wow your crush with your wit:


Be quick. If your crush says something clever, say something back as quickly as you can to show that you can play ball.
Be clever. Make a joke about a subject he knows a lot about to show that you're well-read and understand what's going on in the world.
Be sarcastic. A little bit of sarcasm can go a long way. If you're having a hard time in biology class, you can pretend to gush about how much you love dissecting frogs. Your crush will be charmed by you if you set the right tone.

"
"
Bring up interesting topics.,
Find a common bond.,
Show that you have a life outside of MSN.",How to Chat With Your Crush on MSN3," To keep your crush engaged, you'll have to find topics that are worth talking about. Make sure you find something that is not only interesting to you. Here are some ideas:


If something particularly exciting is happening in the news, you could bring it up, especially if it just happened. You could say, ""Did you hear about...?"" Make sure you don't pick anything too controversial, such as gun control, because you don't want to start an argument before you really know your crush.
If something out of the ordinary happened to you that day, tell your crush. If you ran into a celebrity, saw something crazy happen on the street, or got some big news, it could be worth talking about.
Nothing will bore your crush faster than telling him or her about everything that happened to you that day. Unless you're a secret agent or a superhero, chances are that most of your day is pretty mundane, and you don't want to look like a narcissist by talking about what you had for breakfast like it's the most fascinating topic in the world.

, If you're looking to take your relationship beyond flirting, remember that common interests can be just as important as chemistry in a strong relationship. Your love is guaranteed to last longer if you share passions other than your passions for each other. Here are some things you may have in common:



Music can be a great bond between two people, so try to strike up a conversation about music. If your crush has his or her 'What I'm Listening To' message working, look at the song he or she is listening to and say something like, ""Oh, I love that band!"" If the band is having a concert, you and your crush may even end up going together.
Your love for the outdoors. If both of you love hiking, biking, or camping, that can be a great bond. The outdoors are not for everyone, and your crush will respect you if you share that love--and may even ask you to tag along on a hiking adventure.
Your love for literature. If you both love good books, this will give you a lot to talk about. You can even impress him by recommending a great read, or reading a book he mentions. If the conversation is going well, you can even say, ""Hey, I loved that book your recommended. Want to talk about it over coffee some time?""
Your love for good movies. If you're both into the movies, you will have plenty to talk about. You can casually mention a new film you're excited to see and can wait for your crush to ask you to come along.

, Make your crush see that you have a life outside of your computer. Mention your friends, your family, and definitely your interests, to show that your chat-life is just one small part of your fascinating personality. Here is how to show that your world is bigger than your chat screen:


Without being boring, tell talk about your favorite hobby. If you love to go biking, tell your crush about it. Mention when you have to go because you're going to pursue your hobby.
Mention your favorite friends, and say when you have to go because you and your friends are going out to dinner, to a concert, or wherever. This will make you seem like a fun person, and he may even want to join.
If you're passionate about your studies or a certain subject in school, don't be afraid to say so. Without looking like a nerd, you can show him that you really care about something--poetry or physics, for example. Remember that interesting people have interests, while boring people are bored by everything.

"
"
Subtly compliment your crush.,
Take your crush's advice.,
Show an interest in your crush's life.,
Ask your crush to hang out.",How to Chat With Your Crush on MSN4," Find ways to tell your crush what you really appreciate about him or her. This will show that you're paying attention to what makes your crush special and that you're a thoughtful person. Here are some ways to do it:


Be casual. Say, ""You're so smart--I didn't know that,"" or ""How interesting, I never would have thought of it that way!"" This shows that you appreciate your crush's insight without fawning all over him or her.
Find what makes your crush special. If your crush loves running marathons, say, ""It's so impressive that you could do that.""
Praise your crush's achievements. Say something simple like, ""I can't believe you published a poem. That must have taken a lot of work!""

, Show your crush that you're actually listening to the things he or she says. This will demonstrate that you value your crush's opinion and that you're thinking about him or her even when you step away from the computer. Here's how to do it:


If your crush recommends an album, listen to it. This will give you something to talk about too.
If your crush recommends you buy a certain type of phone, pair of shoes, or whatever, if you think his or her advice is sound, take it. Then you can thank your crush for the tip.
However, don't rush off to do whatever your crush says. If he recommends a movie, don't watch it instantly and report back the next day. Take a week or two to say, ""Hey, I watched that movie you recommended, and it was amazing.""

, You should show that not only are you an interesting person, but that you care about your crush as a person. Try to strike a balance between talking about yourself, your common interests, and your crush. Here are some ways to do this:


Ask your crush how his or her week is going. This will get your crush to reveal some information what's going on in his or her life.
If your crush told you he or she went to a concert, tennis match, or restaurant, ask how it was.
Ask your crush his or her opinion on a certain topic. This will show that you value what he or she has to say.
Don't pry. You can casually ask about his or her interests, friends, or even family, but don't ask so many questions that you're getting too personal or sound like you're leading an interview.

, If things are going well and you feel that the timing is right, don't be afraid to invite your crush to take your relationship beyond MSN. If you've gotten to know your crush, you can do this casually and not make a big deal about it. Here's how:


Ask your crush what he or she has going on that weekend. If your crush says he's pretty free, suggest a casual hang out. Say, ""Cool, me too--want to grab lunch?""
If your crush's favorite band or comedian is coming to town, ask if he wants to go to a show together.
If you're throwing a party or going out with a big group of friends, invite your crush. This will be a very low-pressure hang out, and will give you a feel for each other before you go on a real date.

Don't be too eager to talk to your crush.,
Don't underestimate the secret screen name.,
Don't be too enthusiastic during your conversation.",How to Chat With Your Crush on MSN5," To play it cool, you have to show that while you enjoy talking to your crush, your life does not revolve around him or her. Here are some ways to make this clear;


Don't talk to your crush every single time you sign online. Talk to him or her every second or third time you sign on. This will show that you're not only going online to continue your conversation.
Don't respond to everything he or she says too quickly. If you respond the second he or she asks you a question, this will make it look like you're obsessed with your conversation. If you don't answer right away, your crush will see that you're talking to other people, or doing other things too.

, Get a secret screen name that no one knows about to see what your crush is doing when he thinks you're not online. This can help you have a better sense of what your crush really thinks about you, and can help you cool it during your interactions.


If you see that your crush isn't online much when he doesn't think you're online, this can suggest that he's online for the same reason you are--to continue flirting!
If you see that your crush is just always online, it may mean that he'll talk to whoever--whenever. This may also suggest that he doesn't have a life.
Log on to your secret screen name after you say goodbye to your crush. Does your crush sign off right away? This may show that he's only sticking around to talk to you.

, It's great to show that you think your crush is an engaging, exciting, and fun person, but if you overdo it, you may end up looking too obsessive. Here are some things to avoid:


Minimize your use of ""LOL"" or ""hahaha""--this will make it look like you're trying too hard to be funny.
Avoid too many emoticons. This can get annoying and will make you look immature.
If your crush doesn't respond right away, don't immediately follow up with a series of question marks or say, ""Where did you go???"" This will make it look like your world revolves around your crush's answers.

Removing or upgrading the hard drive on a Mac without professional help is not recommended.

, If you aren't careful while handling your hard drive, you can damage your files. Backing up your computer ensures that your files will be safe even if you accidentally harm your hard drive.

, For a desktop, you should also unplug your Central Processing Unit (CPU).

, If you don't, you can get shocked. Most laptops have a quick-release button on the casing's underside that removes the battery, although some models require you to unscrew the casing.
Mac batteries are extremely difficult to remove, which is another reason PCs are better-suited to this method.

, If you have a laptop, this will be on the underside of the computer. For a desktop, you need to open the side of the CPU.


You may need a screwdriver to open your casing.
If you aren't comfortable opening your computer's casing, take your computer to a tech department (e.g., Best Buy) and have them open the casing for you.

, Depending on your computer make and model, you may have to unscrew a bracket around your hard drive before removing it.

, Hard drives come in two main sizes--""3.5 inch"", and ""2.5 inch""--which are technical classifications that refer to the width of a hard drive's platter (the disk that stores your computer's memory), but not the full dimensions of the hard drive unit itself. Your hard drive's actual dimensions will determine its classification.


3.5 inch drives are 146 mm long, 101.6 mm wide, and either 19 or 25.4 mm tall.
2.5 inch drives are 100 mm long, 69.85 mm wide, and either 5, 7, 9.5 (the most common), 12.5, 15, or 19 mm tall., If you ever need to install a new hard drive, this information will help you accurately pick one.

Sign off while things are still interesting.,

Show that you had a great time talking to your crush.",How to Chat With Your Crush on MSN6," It's important to sign off at the right time so you leave your special someone wanting more. You shouldn't leave too soon, but should say goodbye while things are still interesting. Here's how to do it:


Wait for an interesting conversation to start wrapping up, and say you have to go. That way you can say one or two more things about the topic and then say goodbye. This will leave your crush wanting to talk to you more, and will help you avoid that long awkward pause that may happen after an hour of chatting when both of you are running out of things to say.

, If you want to play it cool, you shouldn't be too obvious about why you're leaving and make your crush think you are interesting and mysterious. Here's how to do it:


Casually say, ""I'm going out now,"" so your crush wonders where you're going and who you're going with. Leave it ambiguous. This will also make it sound like you have lots of friends and an active social life.
Even if you have no reason to go, don't say so. Don't say, ""Well, I guess I better stop chatting so much,"" or ""Gotta go water my plants."" This will make it sound like you have nothing exciting going on in your life.

, You don't have to be obvious about it, but you can let your crush know that you had fun chatting and that you're looking forward to talking again. Here's what you should say:


""It's been fun talking to you"" or ""thanks for the advice about..."" Let him know that the conversation was meaningful without overdoing it.
""I'll talk to you soon."" This will show that you are excited to talk to him again, but that you won't spend hours waiting around to see his screen name pop up again.
Don't be creepy. Avoid saying things like, ""That was the best conversation I've had in my entire life"" or ""What time will you be on MSN again so we can chat more???""

, POP (Post office Protocol) is the original standard protocol for how email programs receive mail from the mail server. POP mail downloads your mail to you computer and deletes the message from the server automatically after a period of time, anywhere from immediately to 30 days later depending on your selection.


You would choose POP if you were only going to access email from a single computer.

, In order to configure the email program you will need your email address, your password and the addresses of the incoming and outgoing mail servers for your email provider. If addresses are provided for both POP and IMAP servers, write both down as you will select which service you will use within the set-up.

, On the browser of your choice, login to your email. If you do not have an email account you will need to create one.

, Locate the help screen either from the menu, or in gmail by clicking on the settings icon and selecting help.

, Enter ""mail server"" into the help search field or select from the help menu (if your mail provider offers this as a menu option).

, Write down the incoming (POP and IMAP) server information and the outgoing (SMTP) server information from this screen. For example, gmail’s incoming server is imap.gmail.com, requires SSL and uses port 993; gmail’s outgoing server is smtp.gmail.com, requires authentication, and uses either port 465 or 587 for SSL.

, Now that you have your account information and understand why you would select either POP or IMAP it is time to enter this account information and set-up your email program.


If you are on a Mac, click on the program icon, or navigate to the program from Finder>Applications.

, Account settings contains all the connectivity settings and preferences for your email account. Depending upon the version of Outlook you are using, this will be found either in File>Information>Account Settings or Tools>Account Settings.

, Select the option to add a new email account and begin inputting the information you recorded for server names, along with your email address and password. This will set the configuration for your Outlook email account..


Follow the prompts or form to enter your Name (this is what will be displayed to someone receiving an email), email address, password and the appropriate server information.

, Before saving the information, re-read the information you have typed into the form for accuracy comparing it to what you previously wrote down and correct any inaccuracies.

, Follow the prompt to save the account information, the program will verify the connectivity and communications and start downloading emails or prompt you to resolve an issue.

POP is the older method of transferring email messages, and works by downloading new messages to your client and then deleting them from the server. IMAP was designed to allow you to check email from multiple devices, as messages and organization are synced between all of the clients you use.

There is really no practical reason to use POP if IMAP is available. IMAP is more stable, more secure, and allows you to check your email from your computer, phone, and laptop without losing any messages.
Most email services allow you to use IMAP, though some may charge for it. Gmail, Yahoo!, Outlook.com (Hotmail), AOL, and most service providers allow for IMAP.;
, Most email services allow you to access the IMAP functions without making any changes. The major exception to this is Gmail, where you will need to manually enable IMAP.

Log into the Gmail website and click the Gear button. Select ""Settings' and then click the ""Forwarding and POP/IMAP"" tab. Select ""Enable IMAP"" and click ""Save Changes"".

, When you add an IMAP email service, you'll be able to check, organize, and manage your email in Outlook and on all of your other devices. Any changes you make in Outlook will be reflected in your other email clients.

, In the ""Info"" section, click the ""+ Add Account"" button.

, This will allow you to enter any email account.


Note: If you're using Gmail or Hotmail (Outlook.com), you can enter your email address and password in the ""E-Mail Account"" section of the Add New Account window and skip the rest of this section. Outlook will take care of the rest of the configuration for you. You can also manually set them up if you prefer by reading on., This will enable you to enter a web-based email account.

, Enter your name as well as your email address in the top section. Leave the Server Information blank for now (see next step). In the Logon Information section, enter your account User Name (usually the same as your email address) as well as the password you use to access the account.

, In the Server Information section, enter in the information for your mail service. Select ""IMAP"" from the Account Type drop-down menu. Below is information for some of the more popular mail services:

, Outlook will begin testing your settings to ensure that it can connect to the server to send and receive messages.

, once you've connected your email account, your messages and folders will begin syncing with Outlook. Depending on how many messages you have, this may take a few moments. You can monitor the process from the status bar at the bottom of the window.


Outlook will only have to do a major sync the first time you connect your account. After this, it will just sync any changes made from any of your email clients.

, On the left side of the window, you'll see your email account with its associated folders listed underneath. You can browse through these folders to see all of your messages. Any organizational changes you make in Outlook will be reflected in the web version of your email account, and vice versa.

, If you can receive messages just fine, but Outlook gives you an error when sending, you'll want to double-check your Outgoing Server settings.


Click the File tab and select ""Info"". Click ""Account Settings"" → ""Account Settings"", and then double-click the account you want to make adjustments to.
Double-check that your Outgoing Mail Server is set correctly. In the ""More Settings"" window, look up alternate ports to try for the Outgoing Server. Also ensure that ""My outgoing server requires authentication"" is checked in the Outgoing Server tab.

, If you can send email messages, but you're having difficulty retrieving new ones, you'll want to double-check your Incoming Server settings.


Click the File tab and select ""Info"". Click ""Account Settings"" → ""Account Settings"", and then double-click the account you want to make adjustments to.
Ensure that you have the correct IMAP address for your Incoming Mail Server. In the ""More Settings"" window, make sure your Incoming Server port is set to 993/SSL, unless otherwise specified by the email service.

, If you are receiving authentication errors and can't send or receive messages, you're likely dealing with a bad password.


Click the File tab and select ""Info"". Click ""Account Settings"" → ""Account Settings"", and then double-click the account you want to make adjustments to.
Retype your password into the Password field. Check to see if your mail service requires logon using Secure Password Authentication (most web mail services don't require this).
If you're using two-factor authentication, you'll need to crate and use an app-specific password for Outlook. Click here for instructions for Google's two-factor authentication.

, Outlook cannot sync both ways with calendar services, except Outlook.com (Hotmail). Instead, you can set Outlook to subscribe to your calendar, and it will automatically update when you make changes to your web calendar. Changes made to your Outlook calendar, however, will not be synced back to your web calendar.


To sync an Outlook.com account, including the calendar, click the File tab and then click the ""Add Account"" button. Enter your Outlook.com account information and follow the prompts to sync your accounts.

, The ICAL address is a link to your web calendar that allows Outlook to stay updated. The process for finding the ICAL address depends on the calendar service:


Google Calendar - Log in to your Google Calendar. Hover over the calendar you want to share with Outlook and click the Menu button that appears. Select ""Calendar Settings"" and then click the ICAL button next to ""Private Address"". Copy the address that is displayed.
Yahoo! Calendar - Log into your Yahoo! Calendar. Hover over the calendar you want to share with Outlook and click the Menu button that appears. Select ""Share..."" and then check the ""Generate links"" box. Copy the address in the ""To import into a Calendar app (ICS)"" box.
Facebook - Log into your Facebook account. Click the ""Events"" option in the left menu. Right-click the ""Upcoming Events"" link and select ""Copy"". This link is in the small box underneath the ""Events Happening This Week"" box, found on the right side of the page.
iCloud - In order to add your iCloud Calendar to Outlook, you'll need to install the iCloud Control Panel.

,


Outlook 2013 - You can select Calendar from the row of buttons along the bottom of the window.
Outlook 2010, 2007, and 2003 - You can select Calendar from the list of buttons in the lower-left corner of the window.

,, Click Yes when prompted to add the internet calendar.


You can click Advanced... to add a description or rename the calendar.

, Your new calendar will open, allowing you to see you internet calendar's events. Any changes made in Outlook will not be synced back to your internet calendar.

, This is a fairly common problem when connected to an Exchange server, and requires a special tool to fix on your computer. It happens when files get corrupted during the sync process.

Download the CalCheck program from Microsoft here.
Unzip the program and drag CalCheck.exe to a convenient location on your computer.
Hold the ⇧ Shift key and right-click in the folder that contains CalCheck.exe. Select ""Open command window here"".
Type calcheck.exe -f and press ↵ Enter to run the program and attempt to fix any corrupted files.

, Outlook cannot sync back and forth between your online contacts list and the Outlook contacts list. When you import a contacts file, any changes made in Outlook stay in Outlook. If you want to push the changes you've made in Outlook back to your online calendar list, you'll need to export your Outlook contacts.


The exception to this is an Outlook.com account, which can sync with Outlook completely. To sync an Outlook.com account, including the contacts, click the File tab and then click the ""Add Account"" button. Enter your Outlook.com account information and follow the prompts to sync your accounts.

, You'll need to download or save your contacts list as a file that Outlook can read and import. The process varies depending on your contacts service.


Google Contacts - Log into the Gmail website. Click the ""Gmail"" menu and switch to ""Contacts"". Click the ""More"" button and select ""Export..."". Select which groups you want to export. By default, all contacts will be exported. Select ""Outlook CSV"" as the format. Save the file to your computer.
Yahoo! Contacts - Log into the Yahoo! Mail website. Click the Contacts button above your mail folders list. Click the ""... Actions"" button above your list of contacts. Click ""Export"" and ensure that Microsoft Outlook is selected. Click ""Export Now"" to download the file to your computer.
iCloud Contacts - Log into the iCloud website and select ""Contacts"". Select all of the contacts you want to export. You can hold down ⇧ Shift to select multiple contacts once. Click the Gear icon and select ""Export vCard.."" to download the contacts file to your computer.,


Outlook 2013 - You can select People from the row of buttons along the bottom of the window.
Outlook 2010, 2007, and 2003 - You can select People from the list of buttons in the lower-left corner of the window.

,,


If you are importing iCloud contacts, select ""Import a VCARD file"".

, Browse for the file that you downloaded from your online contacts list.

, If you already have contacts in Outlook, you may have duplicates when you import your contacts list. You can choose to replace duplicates with the internet contact information (best it is the more up-to-date source), create duplicates which you can then combine or delete later, or to not import duplicate items at all (best when Outlook is the more up-to-date source).

, Your contacts will now be listed in the People section of Outlook. You can quickly email your contacts or add them to groups. Any changes made in Outlook will not be reflected in your online contacts list.

, Outlook may have difficulties with large CSV files containing hundreds of Google Contacts. You can quickly sync your contacts using Outlook.com (provided you have Outlook linked with your Outlook.com account).

Visit people.live.com and log in with your Outlook.com account.
Click the ""Google contacts"" button.
Click ""Connect"" and then log in with your Google account.
Select ""Allow Access"" and your contacts will be imported into your Outlook.com account, which if linked with Outlook will add them to your Outlook contacts.

Search for the particular torrent in which you are interested.,

Open the .torrent file into your bittorrent client.,
Check how many users you are retrieving the file from.,
Delete the .torrent file from your hard disk.",How to Seed a Torrent," This is a piece of software that handles the torrent sharing process for you. There are many clients available for free download on the Internet; search for and read reviews for some of them to determine which one is right for you. Some of the most popular bittorrent clients are Tixati, uTorrent, Vuze, Ares, and Transmission.;
, This can be done easily using a bittorrent search engine. There are several of these on the Internet, and they are specially designed to find users with the torrent file you are looking for. Popular torrent search engines include The Pirate Bay and Isohunt. You may also have some luck searching for a torrent on a regular search engine.

, A file with the "".torrent"" extension is simply a text file that acts as a pointer to the real file in which you are interested. Once the file is where you want it to be on your hard disk, don't move it again (otherwise, the torrent client will have trouble finding it).

, This is usually achieved by double-clicking on the file. The bittorrent client will automatically search the Internet for users who have that exact torrent. It will then connect you to those users and begin downloading and piecing together the file.

, Your bittorrent client will label users as either ""leechers / peers"" or ""seeders."" Leechers are users who only have part of the file, and seeders are users who have the whole file. The more users you are connected to, the faster your download will be.


Once you have finished downloading the file, leave the bittorrent client running. This is how you seed torrents, and this step is crucial to the health of the file sharing community. By leaving the software open, you are allowing other users to download pieces of the file from you (""seeding"").
It is important that you upload at least the file's size worth of data; for example, if you download a 300 MB file, you need to seed until other users have downloaded 300 MB worth of that file from you.
The ratio of downloading to uploading that you do is carefully tracked by the Bit Torrent software, and that ratio determines how fast you are allowed to download. If you only download files and then immediately close your software, your download speeds will suffer because you are not doing your part for the file sharing community.

, This step is optional. You can continue to seed the file as long as you want (and this will establish a very good ratio), but once your upload to download ratio for that file is about 3 to 1, you can safely delete the .torrent file to reduce clutter.

Windows comes with Windows Defender, which is perfectly sufficient for catching most viruses. You can enable Windows Defender from the Control Panel as long as you don't have any other antivirus program installed. If you'd prefer, you can install a third-party antivirus instead, such as BitDefender or Kaspersky. Regardless of what you choose, you should only have one antivirus program installed at a time.


See How to Install an Antivirus for instructions on picking and installing an antivirus program.;
, Lots of seeders generally means that the torrent is free from viruses. This is because others have checked and found no viruses, and then start sharing it. While this certainly is not a guarantee, it can help you whittle down the list. A lot of seeders will also result in a faster transfer.

, This isn't a bullet-proof solution, but the comments section of the torrent can help you determine if it contains any viruses. If there are a lot of comments but nothing about a potential virus, then chances are better that it doesn't have one. If lots of comments talk about viruses, you probably want to avoid that torrent.

, Try not to download torrents for programs, as executable files (EXE, BAT) are the most common way of transmitting viruses. Cracked programs are the most dangerous files you can download through torrents.

, If you can get an invite to a private torrent community, you're much less likely to get a torrent with a virus. This is because the torrents are all created and shared by members of that community, so they should be much more trustworthy. It can be difficult to get into a private community, as you usually need to know someone who can give you an invite. The best way to do this is to be active in various online communities and befriend someone that has access to a torrent community.

, When you download a torrent file, your IP address is public to anyone else sharing that torrent. This is essential in order for the torrent client to connect to other users, but makes you vulnerable to organizations that track torrent traffic. These include your internet service provider (ISP) and copyright enforcement agencies. There are several steps you can take to minimize your risk or prevent your ISP from throttling your speed., PeerBlock is a program that blocks the IP addresses of known torrent trackers. It prevents your computer from being able to connect to these IP addresses, essentially blocking them from taking part in your torrent traffic. This isn't a surefire way to avoid getting caught, and your ISP will still be able to tell that you're transferring torrents. Still, it is a quick and easy way to minimize a lot of the risk of getting a threatening letter from the RIAA or MPAA.


You can download PeerBlock for free from peerblock.com. Follow the prompts to install PeerBlock and launch it. It will automatically work in the background and prevent connections to known bad IP addresses. Use the ""P2P"" list from Bluetack for basic torrent protection when prompted during initial setup.

, To truly anonymize your torrent traffic, you'll want to sign up for a VPN (Virtual Private Network). This will set you back a few dollars a month, but will hide your traffic from any prying eyes. Your ISP will not be able to tell that you're transferring torrent data, and will not throttle your connection. Organizations that track IP addresses will not be able to see your real IP, and will not be able to send you cease and desist letters.There are a few drawbacks to VPN services. Obviously, they aren't free, so you'll need to balance the cost versus the benefits. Your speed will decrease, as traffic will be sent to the VPN server first and then to you. Since you'll likely be connecting to a VPN in another country, you could see significant decreases in speed. Finally, VPN services may still keep records that they can give to enforcement agencies, but you can find services that don't keep logs.

, There are a variety of different VPN services out there, all with different pricing structures and privacy policies. Make sure to read the fine print of the VPNs that you're interested. You'll want to look out for VPN services that keep detailed logs. Also, not all VPN services allow torrent traffic. Some of the more popular VPN services are listed below, but there are countless more that can be found with a quick Google search. Avoid free VPNs and proxies, as they may be unsafe. Many paid VPNs operate out of the US due to the lax data retention laws.PrivateInternetAccess
TorGuard
IPVanish
IVPN

, When you sign up for a VPN service, you'll be given information you need in order to connect. This includes the VPN server address, as well as your username and password. You may need to log into the VPN website in order to find this information.

, Once you've signed up for a VPN service, you'll need to configure your torrent client to connect to it.

, You'll usually find this in the Tools or Options menu at the top of the torrent client.

, This will allow you to adjust your connection settings, including adding your VPN connection information.

, Most VPNs will use SOCKS5. Double-check your VPN connection information if you aren't sure.

, You'll find this connection information when you log into your VPN's website. Many VPNs offer different servers that you can connect to, which can increase your connection speed.


Make sure ""Use proxy for peer connections"" is checked.

, Once your VPN service is configured, you'll be able to start downloading torrents more anonymously. No VPN is 100% anonymous, but you'll significantly decrease the risks you face by using one."

Download and install a BitTorrent client.,
Download a torrent file.,
Open the torrent file in your BitTorrent client.,
Download the file associated with the torrent file.,
Seed the file after you've completed downloading it.",How to Open a Torrent," A BitTorrent client is a piece of software needed to manage torrent files. A "".torrent"" file can be readily downloaded from the Internet, but you'll notice the file is tiny and cannot be opened. This is because the torrent file is just a plain text file that helps the BitTorrent client find the pieces of the real file and download them from other users. Many BitTorrent clients are available free of charge. Some of the most popular ones are Deluge, uTorrent, and Vuze.;
, To begin working with torrents, you'll need to download a torrent file - one with a "".torrent"" extension. This can be done by searching for the file using a regular search engine, or by using specialized torrent search engines such as Isohunt and Pirate Bay. Once you find the file, download it onto your hard drive.


As with many file sharing systems, there are many torrents which are empty or corrupted. If you use a specialized torrent search engine, make sure to check the user ratings of the file to ensure its integrity before downloading.

, Once the torrent file is on your hard drive, load it into your BitTorrent client. You can do this by either double-clicking on it or by opening your BitTorrent client and choosing to open the file through the ""File"" menu. Depending on your BitTorrent client and your preference settings, you may be prompted to either start downloading the torrent immediately or place it in a queue.

, With the torrent file loaded into your BitTorrent software, the software will automatically search for users that have the file you want. It will begin downloading pieces of the file from those users, reassembling the complete file when finished. Download speeds will depend on how many users are uploading the file.

, Once you've finished downloading the file, do not delete the torrent file immediately. Leave it (and the completed download) in your BitTorrent software to ""seed,"" meaning to upload to other users. This will increase your upload-to-download ratio, which determines the speed at which you're allowed to download in the future.

Alternatively, you can visit the downloads page at www.bittorrent.com/downloads to select a specific version of BitTorrent., By clicking the Download button on the homepage, the website will automatically detect the operating system you're using and provide you the latest update. Should you visit the downloads page instead, it will automatically direct you to the operating system you're using. BitTorrent is a multi-platform client, so it's available on multiple operating systems that include Windows, Mac or Android.

, Begin by double-clicking the BitTorrent file from the location in which your downloads generally arrive. Windows users will see a window appear asking ""Do you want to run this file?"" Simply click Run and follow the prompts. Upon installation, Windows users should find BitTorrent located in the Programs directory, in Start > Programs > BitTorrent.


Mac users will see a window with BitTorrent logo appear upon clicking on the downloaded file. Double-click the logo icon, and a prompt will ask you whether wish to open the file. Click Open.
Mac users will then be prompted to continue and subsequently accept the Terms of Use. Click Continue and then Accept accordingly. BitTorrent will then automatically install itself. When it's finished, click Done, and BitTorrent will automatically open.

, You can simply click on BitTorrent wherever you've chosen to store it (initially in Programs for Windows users and under Applications for Mac users). Alternatively, BitTorrent will open automatically whenever you attempt to download a torrent file.

, Upon opening BitTorrent for the first time, you'll see a small message near the top of your window asking if you'd ""like to make BitTorrent your default torrent application."" Either select ""Set as Default"" or—if you'd prefer another default client—""Don't Ask Again."" If you'd like to decide at another time, simply close the message.

, You'll immediately be directed to the General section of preferences.

, Under the Program Startup section of the General tab, you can uncheck the box next to the option allowing BitTorrent to start up when your system starts. This can help facilitate faster system startup and avoid potential security risks.

, Under the General tab's Privacy section, you can uncheck the box next to ""Automatically check for updates"" if you wish to update BitTorrent manually instead.

, Under the Preferences' Bandwidth tab, you can determine the rate at which files are downloaded or uploaded. For most users, it makes sense to simply leave the default ""Automatically manage bandwidth"" box checked.

, You probably won't need to change the Incoming TCP port number, but it's generally best to make sure it's a number no smaller than 10,000. You should also uncheck the box saying, ""Automatically map port (using NAT-PMP or UPnP) in order to minimize your security risks and vulnerabilities.

Popular torrent clients include qBittorrent, Transmission, Deluge, and Tixati. The process for installing and using these clients is very similar to uTorrent. Most of these clients are ad-free, which may be more appealing than paying for an ad-free version of uTorrent.;
, Click ""Get uTorrent"" and then click the link for the free version. The download will begin after a moment.

, You'll likely be prompted by your operating system to confirm that you want to install the program.

, Make sure that ""Add an exception for uTorrent in Windows Firewall"" is checked. You'll also want to associate uTorrent with the .torrent file type.

, You'll be prompted several times to install additional software along with uTorrent. You do not want to install any of these, as they will hijack your browser and redirect your searches.


If you want to use a torrent client that doesn't include any adware with the installer, try qBittorent or Transmission.

, Once you've declined the offers for additional software, the installer will proceed with the uTorrent installation. After installation is complete, uTorrent will open. You'll also see a uTorrent icon on your desktop.

, Before you start downloading torrents, there are a few settings you'll likely want to adjust. Click the ""Options"" menu and select ""Preferences.""

, You'll be setting some connection speed options here which will help optimize your experience.

, If you leave your upload rate at ""0"" it will not be capped. If your upload speed is maxed out, it can make loading web pages very slow. Setting a limit here will prevent uTorrent from maxing out your upload bandwidth.


Set the upload limit to 50% of your upload speed or lower. This will ensure that you can easily load websites and do other things online while uploading torrent data.
You can see your maximum upload speed by using a site like speedtest.net. Run the test and see what your maximum upload rate is, then set uTorrent's to half that value.

, This section has BitTorrent options, including encryption.

, This will help disguise your torrent traffic so that your internet service provider cannot tell that you're transferring torrents. It will not make you anonymous, but will help protect you from your ISP finding out what you're using bandwidth on.

, There are countless websites that you can find torrent links on. A torrent file is a small file that points to the actual file you are trying to get. For example, a torrent file for a movie will allow you to connect to other people with the same torrent and download the movie from them. The torrent file itself does not contain any part of the file(s) you are downloading.


There are a variety of torrent trackers you can find that host tons of different torrent files. You can use the search fields on these tracker sites to look for specific content. Search ""torrent tracker"" on your favorite search engine to find a few to try.
If you're looking for an episode of a TV show, it's helpful to know the common numbering system used for shows. Shows are typically labeled with the season number and episode number. For example, the third episode of the eleventh season of a show would be labeled ""s11e03.""

, The torrent tracker will display the number of ""seeders"" (S) that the torrent has. These are clients that have the entire torrent downloaded and are sharing it with others. The more seeders there are, the easier it will be to max out your transfer speed. If there are no seeders, or only a few, you may not be able to download the files.

, Depending on the tracker, you may have to search a bit to find the correct download link. Many trackers have ads that are designed to look like Download buttons to try to trick you. When you click the correct download button, the torrent file will download to your computer. This should only take a moment, as torrent files are very small.

, If you associated .torrent files with uTorrent during installation, uTorrent should open automatically when you open the torrent file. If you didn't, you'll need to select uTorrent when asked what program you want to use.

, When you open the torrent file, uTorrent will attempt to connect to other clients sharing the same torrent. The more clients you connect to, the faster your download will be (generally). It may take a while for uTorrent to connect with other clients, and the download speed may take a while to ramp up.


Older torrents with a low number of seeders may fluctuate speed instead of maintaining a fast connection, or may not connect at all. Try to find torrents with lots of seeders.

, Torrents live through the community, and it is considered good torrent etiquette to share at least as much as you download. This is especially true with private torrent trackers, where members are regularly checked for their download-to-upload ratio.

, Use your file explorer to find the folder you set for completed downloads in uTorrent. You should see all of your finished downloads here.

, Many videos that you download through torrents will not be compatible with Windows Media Player or QuickTime. For the best playback results, download and install an open-source video player like VLC or MPC-HC. These video players can play just about any video file, and don't come with any adware.

, It is common to package large numbers of files or large files into archives, with RAR being one of the most common. You can't open RAR archives without an extractor. One of the most popular free extractors is 7-Zip. You can download it from 7-zip.org.


7-Zip is also used for its own archive format, .7z.

, Allowing an EXE file to run from an unknown source puts your computer's security in jeopardy. It is highly recommended that you avoid running EXE files downloaded through torrents unless you absolutely trust the source.

, To be safe, make sure you have an antivirus active whenever you're downloading torrent files. You can take the extra precaution of scanning each file you download, but most antivirus programs will detect viruses automatically.

"
Research the movie that you want to buy.,
Look carefully at the cover.,
Examine the actual DVD if you have already bought it.,
Put the DVD into your DVD drive.,
If the spine of the DVD is very thin, and the case is opaque, it is probably fake.

,
If random messages show up about how bootlegs are illegal, or the colors are distorted, these are messages that the average camera can pick up.

,
Look for copy protection.,
Go back to the manufacturer or store that sold you the DVD.,
Complain to the seller.",How to Spot Fake DVDs," Find out how many versions have been officially released, the special features of the movie and which regions the movie is encoded for. This will allow you to spot a fake easily when you are shopping, and it will also give you a better sense of which deals are too good to be true.


For example, genuine Disney DVD’s are rarely “Region 0”, “playable in all regions” or “region 1 compatible”. If you spot a Disney DVD advertising any of these things, you will know that the DVD is possibly fake.;
, The cover design should be the same as those for the same movie being sold through a reliable outlet (such as a large retail store), but be sure to compare it with a DVD from the same region; for example, a genuine imported version of Disney’s Lion King DVD will probably be single-disc; however, the US or UK version will probably be two-disc, being single-disc does not automatically make it a copy (look for a Disney hologram). Variations in the cover design should make you suspicious because a different cover was possibly printed for pirated copies. If you see any words spelled incorrectly, it is a dead giveaway. Another thing to look for is image quality. Gritty images, matte paper and dull colors indicate that the cover was probably photocopied. The UPC on the back of the DVD case should only be black. If additional ink colors can be seen overlaid over the black in the UPC, or if the lines in the UPC are indistinct because of the bar code’s image being re-processed with a halftone screen over it, then it is most likely that the DVD case has been copied.


If you are thinking about ordering a DVD that does not come with a cover (most often advertised as being a former rental), do not think about it.






The absence of security seals and plastic wraps should also warrant suspicion.






The advertisement of DVD-9 is often thought to be associated with fake DVD’s because many official studio releases never advertise this distinction; it is counterfeit distributors who specify it in relation to quality to differentiate their products from lower-quality DVD-5 counterfeits. In general, any advertisement of “quality” is a red flag, as original releases rarely mention it. The exception here is some genuine Thai DVDs that do mention DVD-9 if they are also released as DVD-5 (DVD-9 is dual layer and as such often has more extra features).







, Chances are that you have played it and the quality is questionable enough for you to be reading this article to make sure. Some additional questions to ask are:

Can you see through the DVD? If you can see through it very well, it is most likely not authentic, though this is not always the case.






Is it colorful (blue, gold, purple, etc.; instead of silver)? If it is any of the colors listed above, it is most likely not a mass-produced DVD.






Hold the DVD up to the light and tilt it to one side. You may be able to see a well-known manufacturer’s name, such as Maxell. If the disc has such a name, then the DVD was a burnable disc, and the disc’s contents are counterfeit.






Check the cover. Real movies have high-quality manufacturer photos, and often fake ones have blurry, lack of color, and less detail type covers. This will tell you that the cover probably was taken with a camera.
If the movie is without security labels, the movie may be a counterfeit.

, In Windows, click on My Computer, then click your player’s drive. It will give you the size of the disc. There should be close to 5 GB used on a single layer or more on a double layer (but this varies depending on running time). Then go through Windows Explorer and right click on various files stored on the DVD to check properties. Look for the creation date. If the DVD is out of print, for example, and the date is recent, something is not right. However, this will probably not work with Disney imported DVD’s with copy protection and results may be misleading.

,,, All DVDs are ""copy protected"" due to copyright laws. Thus, checking the DVD for copy protection method might work, as bootlegs usually don't have copy protection. If you have a recent DVD try making a copy and if it in fact gets copied, then it's a bootleg. If it does not work due to copy protection, it might be a good sign.

Insert DVD movie.
Open a program used to copying CD/DVD.
Try to make a copy. Then you will be able to determine if it's a copy.

, Tell them you have a counterfeit., If it is a store or a business, contact them for a refund. If they refuse, file a report with the Better Business Bureau or your country’s equivalent. If it is a street vendor, report them to your local authorities. And if it is an online seller, such as at an auction site, report them to the coordinating party and leave negative feedback. You can also report a seller of counterfeits to the studio’s anti-piracy department.

Install PeerBlock.",How to Download Torrents Using uTorrent," uTorrent is available for free from the uTorrent website (utorrent.com). It can be downloaded for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android.


Only download uTorrent from the uTorrent website. Downloading from another website runs the risk of installing additional software that you don't want.
If you're using Android, download the app from the Google Play Store.;
, After the installer has finished downloading, run it to begin installing uTorrent. Make sure to pay attention to each screen of the installer, and opt out of any packaged software. uTorrent comes bundled with extra software that installs automatically unless you opt-out during the installation process. This software can be difficult to remove after it is installed.

, Once you start uTorrent for the first time, you will need to configure where your downloads will be stored. Click Options and select Preferences. Select the ""Directories"" section of the Preferences menu.


Set the location that you want new downloads to go to. You can also set a location that you want finished downloads to be moved to.

, In the Preferences menu, select the ""Bandwidth"" section. You can set a limit on your upload rate and a limit on your download rate. This can be useful if you need to do other things on the internet while downloading or uploading, as uTorrent will otherwise take all of your available bandwidth.

, This will help hide your torrent traffic from your service provider, limiting the amount of throttling that they may impose. Click the ""BitTorrent"" section, and then set the drop-down menu in the ""Protocol Encryption"" to ""Enabled"".


Make sure that the ""Allow incoming legacy connections"" box is checked.

, Opening a port for uTorrent will allow you to connect to many more seeders. Generally, this will mean you will be able to reach your maximum download speed much easier, or have an easier time connecting to an unhealthy torrent.


Select the ""Connection"" section and note the port listed in the field at the top of the section.
Open your router's settings page. See this guide for more details on accessing your router.
Open the Port Forwarding section. Open a new port that matches the port indicated in uTorrent. See this guide for more details on opening a port.

, You can find links to torrent files on countless sites online. One of the most popular ways to find a torrent is to enter the content you want in a search engine and add the word ""torrent"" at the end.


Torrents are hosted on sites called ""trackers"". These are torrent file listings. Trackers do not actually host any content, just the small torrent files that allow you to connect to other users.
Downloading content that you do not have legal rights to is illegal.

, When selecting a torrent, there are several things you want to take into account. Most important is the number of ""seeders"" versus the number of ""leechers"". Seeders are users that are hosting the file for others to download. Leechers are users that are downloading the file but not contributing to the sharing.


If there are more leechers than seeders, downloading the file will take longer.
If there are only a few seeders, you will have difficulty connecting and downloading the file.

, Torrents are a popular way to transmit viruses. Check the comments on the torrent, and also the ratio of seeders to leechers. Illegal content is much more likely to contain viruses.


If lots of comments warn that the file contains a virus, try to find another torrent.

, Click the download button to download the torrent file. Be careful when clicking the download button, as many tracker sites have fake download buttons that actually lead to ads. The torrent file should only take a few seconds to download.


Alternatively, click the magnet link. This will open uTorrent directly without any files downloading.

, If uTorrent is the only torrent client on your computer, torrent files should open automatically in uTorrent. When you open the torrent, it will be added to your download list. If you have room in your queue, the download will begin immediately.


If torrents don't automatically open in uTorrent, you can reassign the file associations so that they do. Open the Preferences menu, click the General section, and then click the ""Associate with torrent files"" button.

, If you want to test your settings before downloading the files you want, you can do so by downloading files that are guaranteed to max out your connection speed.


Slackware or Open Office are both hosted on dedicated servers, and will max out your internet connection speed in a few minutes. These are great files to use for testing your uTorrent connection settings. Give the test download up to 15-20 minutes to take full advantage of the speed., Your current download speed will be shown next to your torrent in the uTorrent main window. This is the combined speed from all the different seeders you are connected to, and cannot exceed the limits imposed by your service provider. For example, if you have a 30 Mbps (Megabits per second) internet connection, you can expect a maximum speed of 3.75 MBps (Megabytes per second).

, You can see how many seeders you are connected to by clicking the Peers tab. You can see the seeder's IP address and transfer speed.

, Once your download has completed, you can open your content like you would anything else in that format. For example, if you've downloaded a movie, you can run it from uTorrent, or open your download directory and open the file from there.

, Seeding is the act of uploading a completed file to other people downloading the torrent. A torrent cannot survive without seeders. It is a common courtesy to seed at least as much as you download, and many communities expect you to seed twice what you download.

, This program will block known IPs that track torrents for the RIAA and MPAA. You may lose a few connections, but you may be less likely to receive notices fro your ISP that you are downloading illegal content.

Choose a basic toothpaste.,
Apply toothpaste to the CD surface.,
Polish the CD.,
Clean and dry the CD.",How to Fix a Scratched CD1," There's no need for the sparkles, swirls, and exotic flavors of some oral care products. Instead, opt for a basic white paste to polish your CD. All types of toothpaste contain enough abrasive minerals to get the job done!

Basic toothpastes are cheaper than their flashier alternatives. This can be especially helpful if you have several CD's to polish.;
, Squeeze a small dab of toothpaste onto the scratched surface of your CD and spread it evenly over the surface of the CD with your finger.

, Using a radial motion, slowly work the toothpaste around the CD. Start at the center and move in a straight line outward.

, Run the CD under some warm water and rinse thoroughly. Then, using a soft, clean cloth, dry the CD and double check to make sure you've removed all traces of toothpaste or moisture.

After you've cleaned and dried the CD, use a soft cloth to buff the surface of the CD.

Compare different products, read any disclosures carefully and look for non-biased consumer reviews so that you can pick the best product.
Choose a product that has a free trial period so that you can try it out before you commit.;
, If you have multiple drives, select the drive that contains the DVD that you want to rip on your computer screen.

,


Open the Start menu, click on Computer, right-click the disk and select Explore.
Find the file folder that says VIDEO_TS. Drag the folder to whatever location you want to copy your DVD. This is the end of a basic rip to watch on your computer. You don't need transcoding unless you want to shrink the file or view the DVD on a mobile device.

, You can find many free options online when you do a Google search, but Handbrake is the best option. Check to see that the program has presets for a variety of platforms including iOS and gaming consoles.

, The software will scan for chapter titles and markers. If the program doesn't pick up the titles, then you can manually click on the transcoder's Chapters tab and type in chapter titles as you go.

, Many programs have a Destination tab. Click Browse on the tab and choose the location where you want to save your file.


To save the file as a shared file on a media server or network attached storage box, map the share as a network drive.
Navigate to the appropriate folder, right-click and choose Map Network Drive from the menu.

, For instance, you can preserve the movie's original Dolby Digital (AC3) soundtrack and create a backup soundtrack for devices that aren't AC3-equipped.


Click the Audio & Subtitles tab on your transcoding software.
Choose the soundtrack that you want. Under the Audio Codec menu, choose AAC.
In the mixdown column, choose Dolby Digital II. Leave any bitrate, sample rate and DRC settings at their default values.
Move down to the second audio track. Pick the same soundtrack from the source heading.
Select AC3 from the list of audio codecs.
Look for a box that says Forced Subtitles Only. If you choose a language that's different from the language that the actors are speaking, checking this box will help you to avoid forced subtitles.

Decide which compound you will use.,
Apply the polishing compound to a cloth.,
Polish the CD.,
Remove the polishing product from the disc.,
Test the disc.",How to Fix a Scratched CD2," A number of common household products can be used to polish the CD, but 3M rubbing compound and Brasso are probably the most tried and true. You can also use fine-grit polishing compounds designed for cars or hard finishes.If you're using Brasso, make sure to do so in a well-ventilated area, and avoid breathing in the fumes. Always read the safety instructions and warnings on any chemical product as many (such as rubbing alcohol) are flammable and/or can cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation., Put a small amount of 3M compound or Brasso on a soft, clean, lint-free cloth. An old shirt or an eyeglass-cleaning cloth will both work well., Use a gentle, radial motion, to rub the compound into the scratch. Start at the center and rub out to the edge, like spokes on a wheel. Do this 10 or 12 times all around the CD. Try to focus your efforts solely on the scratch or scratches that you have identified.


When polishing the disc, make sure to lay the disc on a flat, firm surface that's non abrasive. Data is stored on the foil or dye layers on the top of the disc (label side) and the protective top layer can easily be scratched or perforated. Pressing a disc on too soft a surface may crack it or cause it to de-laminate.
Rubbing in a circular motion (as opposed to a radial motion) can cause small scratches that throw off the laser tracking system in the player.

, Rinse the disc thoroughly with warm water and let it dry. Make sure to remove all of the compound and let the disc dry completely before trying to play it. With Brasso, wipe off excess product and let the rest dry. Then, using a clean cloth, gently wipe the disc again.

, If the problem persists, polish again for up to 15 minutes, or until the scratch is almost completely buffed out. The surface around the scratch should begin to look shiny with many tiny scratches. If you still do not notice any difference after polishing for a few minutes, the scratch may be extremely deep, or you may be polishing the wrong scratch.


If the disc is still not operational, take the disc to a trained professional at a gaming store or CD repair shop.

"
"
Determine whether or not wax is an option.,
Wax the scratches.,
Wipe away the excess wax.,
Test the disc again.",How to Fix a Scratched CD3," Sometimes you’ll need to physically remove plastic from the disc by polishing. However, removing a lot of plastic can affect the refractive property of the lens making the data unreadable. Waxing scratches is useful because even though the defects are visible to your eye, the laser sees around/through them., Apply a very thin coat of Vaseline, chap-stick, liquid car wax, neutral shoe polish, or furniture wax to the CD’s playing surface. Let the wax sit in the scratches for a few minutes—remember, the idea is for the wax to fill in the scratch so it can be read again., Using a clean, soft, lint-free cloth, wipe in a radial (inside-to-outside) motion. If using wax, follow the manufacturer’s instructions (some need to dry before you wipe them off, while others should be wiped off while still wet).

, If the wax or Vaseline does the trick, burn a new disc immediately. The waxing method is only a temporary solution meant to get the CD working long enough to transfer the data to a computer or new disc.

Before doing anything to your drive, read the Warnings section below.,
Determine if the drive is inaccessible because of a mechanical failure or a software problem.

,
If the drive is making strange rattling or clicking noises, turn off the computer immediately.,
If the drive seems to be working normally but appears as unformatted in your computer's BIOS or Windows, you may be able to fix it yourself.,
If you need to attach a laptop drive to a desktop machine or vice versa, you may have to purchase an external drive enclosure that converts your drive interface from PATA, SATA, or SCSI to USB or FireWire.,
Once you have the problem drive mounted in a computer with a working Windows drive, ensure that you never write data or format the broken drive, as this can cause permanent data loss.

,
If you have only damaged or erased essential operating system files from your Windows drive, the disk can still be read from your repair PC and you can easily recover data from My Documents, etc.,
Move the drive back to its native computer and reinstall Windows on it.,
Once you have a fresh, clean, and fully functional copy of Windows, you can put your files back in their rightful places and get on with the lengthy task of reinstalling all of your programs.

,
If the drive in question is a data drive or a Windows drive that appears as unformatted, you will have to use data recovery software, the best example of which is TestDisk, a free utility that will analyze your drive and recover your data.,
Follow the instructions in the program or go to http://www.cgsecurity.org for more help.

,
Once TestDisk has made your drive accessible again, move it back to your own computer (if you had to move it in the first place) and enjoy your recovered files!

",How to Diagnose a Computer Hard Disk Drive1,";
,, You can remove the drive by taking the cover off of the side of your computer (or the drive bay of your laptop) and using a screwdriver to disconnect the drive from its mounting bracket. Disconnect the cables from the back of the drive and store it in a cardboard box or an antistatic bag. You can fix this mechanical problem yourself if you are brave. Otherwise, do a Google search for computer repair or data recovery specialists in your area. This process is expensive, but can be worth it if your files are very important.

, If your computer boots into Windows, the C drive is just fine and will make repairing your secondary drive or partition much easier. If your Windows drive appears as an unformatted drive in your computer's BIOS, remove it (following the removal instructions in Step 3) and mount it in a working Windows PC. This could be a friend's computer or an old 2000 or XP machine that you have kept after an upgrade.

, You may need to do this anyway, depending on the age of the computer you are using to fix the drive. Older computers may not support drives from newer computers. Check your drives or the computer's user's manual to be sure.

,, Just browse to the files in Windows Explorer and burn them to a DVD or CD for later replacement.

, This will reformat the drive and any information still on it will be erased.

,, Get it at http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download and unzip and run the program.

First, open a video file from the original disk on the second computer (the one with the operating system). The video playback should be smooth and without errors.
Copy the same video onto the freshly-formatted disk that you installed from the first computer. Playback this video and check for any distortion. If the video is corrupted or distorted, then your drive is a ""zombie"" drive, and will always corrupt data when it is used.

, If your disk is in fact a zombie drive, then you'll need to replace it. Once you've obtained a new disk of equal or greater size than the original, you can use Norton or Arcronis to copy your disk image back onto the disk. You can then install the disk back into your computer and use it as you normally would.

Back up your data.,
Wipe the drive.,
Open the computer case.,
Open the hard drive.,
Remove the magnets.,
Remove the platter.",How to Destroy a Hard Drive1," It’s easy to forget about all of those MP3s you ripped in the 90s and beloved family pictures when all you can focus on is destroying the cause of your shame and avoiding federal prison. You will, however, want to make sure to back up all of your important and legal data, however, since the whole point of the resulting exercise is that those things will be... you know... gone.;
, Always wipe your hard drive before beginning destruction. While the more exciting methods of destruction will do a pretty good job of rendering data irretrievable, they can’t be 100 percent guaranteed (especially if you have reason to believe the government is willing to spend several months and millions of dollars to find your dirty, dirty secrets). Wiping your data and blowing up your drive, however? Yeah, nobody’s getting that back.


Let’s be realistic for a minute here, though: a serious wipe of your computer will probably do the trick. Only someone with very serious equipment would have any chance at recovering your data and even then, there isn’t very much evidence that it’s really possible.

, Open your computer case and find the hard disk drive. They are located in different spots in each type of case, sometimes located within a metal box. You may have to look up your particular model if you’re having trouble locating the hard disk drive.

, Open the hard drive casing. This will largely amount to loosening a bunch of screws in different configurations depending on the make and model of your hard drive. Possibly cutting some tape. Be warned that there are often screws hidden underneath labels, so you might have to go poking around.

, You will need to remove the arm and magnet structure in order to reach the platter underneath (your real goal). There are screws involved. It’s pretty straightforward. Remove the magnets carefully because they are seriously very strong and you can really hurt yourself with them.


Seriously, you will struggle to get them off a fridge. You can break fingers with these things. And for the love of whatever you pray to, don’t eat them and don’t let your pets eat them (pets, in this case, includes kids).







, This is the thing that looks like it would make a nice mirror. You’ll probably need to unscrew the circular piece at the center which holds in down. This is the thing that stores (the majority at least) of your data. This is the thing you need to destroy. Sometimes there is more than one platter, so pay attention to that.

Use a hammer.,
Carefully dispose of the remains.",How to Destroy a Hard Drive2," The fastest, most direct method of destroying the platter is with a hammer. Put it on a surface that can take a beating and is easy to clean up, strap on some goggles and safety gloves, and take out your aggression that’s been pent up ever since George Lucas blasphemed all over what was a perfectly good franchise.


Make sure you’re the only person in the room when you do this; partially so that you don’t hurt anyone by accident with flying bits of glass and metal, and partially so that they don’t become concerned about your sanity levels and have you committed.
Some platters are made out of metal, some are made out of glass and ceramic. The latter will shatter readily. The former will certainly deform, which will make it pretty unusable, but you can also use some of the more exciting methods below if you aren’t convinced.

, Once it’s in pieces, carefully collect them and dispose of them. The parts may be taken anywhere that recycles electronics. Check your local computer/game retailers, department stores, and thrift shops.

"
Hold a trial by fire.",How to Destroy a Hard Drive3," While heat alone probably won’t completely destroy data, turning your platters into liquid piles of molten goo is pretty effective. This will be particularly fun if you’re the sort of person that the local fire department knows by name. Whatever method you choose, make sure you’re doing it in an area with some pretty serious ventilation, because a melting hard drive will give off fumes that can possibly kill you.


Use a standard fire. Be it in a fireplace or hobo barrel (preferably the latter), you may be able to get a normal fire hot enough to liquify your hard drive. Toss it on and leave it because it’s probably going to take a while. Fun level: 3
Use a blow torch. Put on some protective gear, hold the platters at a distance with some kind of heat resistant tool, and watch it melt. Make sure the floor below can take a beating. Fun level: 5
Use thermite. For the more adventurous hard drive destroyer, you can seriously overkill the task by filling a large container with sand, placing the platters on the sand, and then lighting a container of thermite over the platters. This is science at it’s best and creates a chemical reaction which produces a lot of heat and a small explosion, so be really careful. Do not use this method indoors. Or near a forest. Or near small children. Or near yourself, really. Fun level: 11
Use sugar and saltpeter. Mix sugar and saltpeter in a soda can and place it over a hard disk in a bucket of sand. This is basically a small bomb, so be really, really careful about where you set it off and where you’re standing when it goes off. Fun level: 11

"
Hold a trial by firing squad.",How to Destroy a Hard Drive4," Take your hard drive platter to a local firing range or prop it up in another safe location. Makes excellent target practice. Fun level: 7

"
Hold a trial by giant magnet.,
Buy some serious, big rare earth magnets.",How to Destroy a Hard Drive5," That thing where running a magnet over a computer to erase it is basically a myth. If you want to destroy your data by magnet, you’re going to need to pull out the big guns.

, These should work well enough to scramble any remaining data after wiping your drive. And, really, who doesn’t want to own a giant, super-powerful magnet? You will find other uses for it. Surely. Fun level (wiping the drive): 4; fun level (finding other uses for the magnets later): 9


Alternatively, take your hard drive to a local junk or scrap yard...any place you can find with one of those big magnetic cranes for lifting cars and other large scrap. Watch as your drive performs a Cirque du Soleil level of flying-through-the-air as the data is made thoroughly unrecoverable. Fun level: 5. Unreliable though, drives are well shielded against magnetic fields. Physical destruction is best.

This one is easy - find a 5 to 10 ton press and crush the life out of the drive by squishing midway between the spindles (drive and heads).",How to Destroy a Hard Drive6," This only takes a few seconds, but the results are great."
"
Hold a trial by acid.,
Hold a trial by microwave.",How to Destroy a Hard Drive7," Pretend you’re holding a little witch hunt for your hard drive platter as you dunk it into a container of battery acid or similarly strong acid. You should be able to watch it dissolve. Dispose of the acid in an appropriate way (dumping it in your yard is not an appropriate way, just so you know). Fun level: 6

, Microwaves in and of themselves are not strong enough to destroy data, so don’t think a one second zap will do the trick. Getting the platter hot enough to melt or shatter, however, will render your data unrecoverable.


Buy or salvage an old microwave, preferably one with a push-button method of opening the door. Hook it up outside with an extension cord and set it for 10 minutes. Get very far away (glass platters can shatter under these conditions and are very dangerous). Open the microwave from a distance, with a broom handle or pull string, and use a very long stick to shatter the disk if it didn’t melt or shatter of it’s own accord. Fun level: 6

"
"
Hold a trial by sandblaster.,
Hold a trial by saw.,
Hold a trial by drill bit.",How to Destroy a Hard Drive8," Rent a sandblaster from your local big-box hardware store, take your platter out to your driveway, and blast away that mirror finish. This will remove the layer of material which stores the data on the platter. You get to look super cool holding that blaster, plus you can use any extra time with the sandblaster to clean more than just your old hard drive. Fun level: 5

, Well, okay, don’t use a saw (it won’t work very well). Instead, use an angle cutter, which is similar but sounds less cool. These are easily rented from your local big-box hardware store. Use cheap “C” clamps to hold the platter of your hard drive down to an appropriate surface and cut it straight down the middle. Okay, realistically you’re going to cut it more than once because sparks are going to go flying everywhere and it is going to look like the 4th of July in your garage. Whatever makes you happy. Fun level: 7


Just make sure you’re doing all of your cutting safely and with proper eye gear. Look up pictures of angler cutter injuries. You’ll wish you could unsee all that.

, This is a common utilitarian-but-no-less-amusing way to destroy your hard drive. Take a drill (you’re going to need a pretty strong bit) and put holes in the hard disk platter. You’ll want to drill several holes in a wide variety of spots in order to guarantee that the data cannot be recovered. Beyond that, have fun with it. Make art. These things do make great Christmas tree decorations. Fun level: 4

PATA hard drives may be labeled ATA). These designs are not interchangeable.


SATA hard drives are identifiable by the two flat connectors while PATA hard drives use two rows of pins as connectors.;
, Laptop computers usually have hard drives that are 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) in diameter while desktops usually have hard drives that are 3.5 inches (8.89 cm). This can easily be checked with a ruler or tape measure.


The height of a 2.5-inch drives varies. Most are 9.5 mm, but some are 12.5 mm, so take note when choosing an enclosure.

, The two most commonly available types of enclosures are made out of aluminum or plastic. There are many properties to consider here including the style of hard drive (SATA or PATA), the enclosure's ability to cool the drive, material used in constructing the enclosure, connection type, and cost.

, Turn off the computer then open the case and remove the hard drive.

, The enclosure is most likely secured with Philips head screws at each corner. Removing them is easily done with a Philips head screw driver.

, The hard drive should slide onto the circuit board.

, Male connectors protrude outwards and should align with female connectors that they slide into.

, They should slide together with minimal effort. Be careful not to force the connection as the connectors can be fragile.


If you are experience issues pushing the connectors together, check to make sure the connectors are aligned correctly.

, Once the hard drive and circuit board are connected, place the unit back into the enclosure.

, Replace and re-tighten the screws that hold the enclosure together.

Delete old files.,
Delete any applications that you don’t need.,
Delete everything in your trash, as the files in trash still take up space on your computer.,
Restart your computer so the hard drive will refresh and cleanse itself to your saved actions.

",How to Clear the Memory on Your Computer's Hard Drive1," Old files that you no longer use or need will take up space that can really slow your computer down and clog up the memory in your hard drive.


First locate your Downloads and Documents folders. This is where a lot of your computer’s memory is dedicated. Locate files in each folder that you no longer need and move them into your trash.
An easy way to go about this is to click the “Date modified” column and sort your files based on the last date a file was opened starting from earliest to most recent. Delete the files you haven’t used in a long time, or transfer them to an external hard drive if you need to save them.;
, Like with your downloads and documents, we tend to install a fair amount of applications that we don’t end up using very often, if ever. These applications don’t just take up memory from being installed, but they also take up data that can affect your computer’s speed and memory.


If you are on a Mac, you can find your Applications folder from your Finder. Click Go > Applications. Then, just like you did with your documents and downloads, sort them by Date Modified and locate the ones you haven’t used in a while first. Delete all the applications you can live without.If you are on a PC, click your Start button > Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features. Select a program you don’t need and click “Uninstall”.,


On a Mac, just emptying your trash doesn’t completely delete all the information of your files, it just removes them from your file directory. To completely delete your files from your computer, click Finder > Secure Empty Trash.On Windows in order to truly delete files you have to use a third party program to rid your hard drive of any leftover files after you’ve emptied your recycle bin. Popular programs are Eraser, CCleaner, or SDelete, which is a tool from Microsoft which allows you to empty files through a command line prompt.Make absolutely sure you have appropriately deleted what you don't need or want (but be sure you don't delete something you do need, or your computer will not work). If you didn’t create the file, or are unsure of what it is, don’t delete it.

Once open, click Defragment disk to begin. This might take some time.
A Mac doesn’t doesn’t work the same way as a Windows and defragging the hard drive doesn’t do the same thing it does on a Windows; and if you’re on an SSD hard drive it can be dangerous. Instead Repair Disk Permissions with Disk Utility. Launch Disk Utilities from Applications > Utilities > Disk Utilities. Select your hard drive, click “Erase” and then “Erase Free Space”. You can pick which option you want, but the “Zero out deleted files” should be sufficient for most people., Viruses can slow down your computer and take up precious space on your hard drive. Another way to clear memory on your hard drive is to remove viruses.


On windows you can use the Microsoft Security Essentials program to scan and clean your computer, or download a virus scanner application like McAfee.While Macs are a little better at preventing viruses, they can still get them. The best way to prevent them is to ensure that you don’t download or open any program that could contain malware. To make sure that you’re always up to date on security, open your System Preferences > App Store Preference pane > and check the “Automatically check for updates” and “Install system data files and security” boxes., Using a cloud drive is another viable option to clear memory on your computer hard drive. If you don’t have a lot of memory on your hard drive, but want to keep quick access to certain files, you can use online cloud drives like Google Docs, Dropbox, Box, and iCloud Drive.

Free up inactive memory to create more RAM.,
Use an external Hard Drive.,
Remove unused disk images.,
Clear up browser history and cache.No matter what browser you use, it will typically store browser history and pull a cache.",How to Clear the Memory on Your Computer's Hard Drive3," Random Access Memory, or RAM, is how your computer stores information. If it is too full, it can clog up your computer.


The first step in freeing up RAM is to close any applications that you aren’t using. Another way to free up RAM is to limit the amount of programs your computer automatically opens upon startup.
In Windows right-click on an application and open “Preferences”. In the “Misc.” Section there is a box that you can check to ensure that it doesn’t open on startup.
You can stop applications from opening on a Mac by going to System Preferences > Accounts > Login Items, and unchecking the boxes next to apps you don’t want opening at startup.

, Clear memory on your computer and free up RAM by storing files you don’t need everyday on an external hard drive.


RAM is sort of like short term memory while your Hard Drive is like long term memory. By using an external hard drive you can free up both on your computer and reduce how hard your computer is using.

, You can clear memory by ejecting disk images from applications or other files you have downloaded.


This is more for Macs than it is Windows. When you have a removable disk in your computer, even if you aren’t using it, it takes up RAM and can slow your computer down.
This also goes for any external hard drives you have plugged in. When you’re not using them, eject them properly.

, By deleting your browser history and cache, you can free up RAM and help your computer to work faster.


Having several browser tabs open at once also makes your RAM work harder, so it’s best to close out any tabs that you don’t need as soon as you’re done with them.

You will need to obtain and install Ghost on your system.,
But here is an important caveat!,
Clone your boot-drive?,
There is no question that earlier versions of Ghost could effortlessly clone Windows XP boot-drives.,
Shut down the system and either temporarily or permanently connect the new hard drive.,
If you installed ghost on the system where you're cloning the drive, boot to windows on your old drive and go into ghost.,
If you made a ghost boot disk boot the system from the disk and ghost will load directly.,
IMPORTANT: ONCE THE OPERATION IS DONE DO NOT BOOT WINDOWS RIGHT AWAY!!,
Connect the new (and old if keeping it in the system) drive permanently and close up your PC.

",How to Clone a Hard Drive in Windows XP," If you can't or don't want to install it on the system with the drive to clone you can install it on another system and make a Ghost boot Disk. (see Ghost documentation for how to make the disk);
, Symantec has de-powered Ghost to such an extent that cloning your boot drive seems no longer possible. In typical Symantec fashion, they are cute and then evasive on the subject. Try going to symantec.com and entering the query ""clone boot drive"". The Symantec website greets that question with an answer to the effect that ""they have never heard that question before"".

, Huh? Why do you want to do that? We know that when we sold you Ghost that we promised that you could safely infer that you could clone your boot-drive: but in the interim we have forgotten exactly how to do that. Symantec's evasions typically have a criminal purpose: to sell expensive software which simply does not work.

, So why the change - why do recent versions of Ghost put the user through hours of work creating images that when restored simply will not boot. Do you suppose that Uncle Billy might have had something to do with that?

, They both need to be in the system to clone. Most likely this will be a temporary arrangement if you want to remove the old drive or rearrange the connections later.

, Select clone under ghost advanced and follow through the screens. Select old drive as source and new as the destination. See ghost documentation or help if you're not familiar with all the steps. The system will reboot and run the clone operation

, Use your mouse or keyboard to select clone from the menus and then run the operation.

, If your old drive is still connected booting to windows on the new drive will cause problems. You need to remove the old drive from your system or delete the partitions BEFORE you boot windows on the new drive. If your in doubt if the ghost operation worked.. just physically disconnect the old drive. Once you confirm the new drive is working reconnect the old drive. Use a windows setup boot disk to delete windows off the old drive. Simply start setup from the boot disk and get to the partition screen to delete the partition (make sure you do this on the OLD DRIVE!) then exit setup without going any further (you don't actually want to install windows).

You can use the same email service you've been using, or you can take this opportunity to switch to a service that better meets your needs.;
, There are a variety of free email services available. Some of the most popular services include Gmail, Outlook (Hotmail), Yahoo!, and Zoho. Each service has different benefits and potential drawbacks, but all offer free email accounts.


Gmail accounts give you access to Google Drive and provide 15 GB of free Drive storage for emails and other files. Your Gmail account can also be used for a variety of other Google services, such as YouTube.
Outlook gives you access to OneDrive, which comes with 5 GB of free storage.
Yahoo! Mail has 1 TB of free mail storage.
Zoho is an ad-free service that provides 5 GB of storage, as well as cloud document services like Google Drive and OneDrive.

, The process is a little different for each service, but basically you'll just need to go to the service's home page and click the ""Sign Up"" or ""Create Account"" button. From there, you'll be prompted to create an account name and enter in some basic information. Below are some links to wikiHow guides on creating accounts for the more popular services:


Make a Google Account
Set up a Yahoo! Mail Account

Create a Hotmail Account (Outlook.com)

, If you're creating a new account because your old one has a name that feels too outdated, try to create a new account that you'll always be able to use. Try sticking to just your name, and avoid using a name based on a fad or your current interest, as those are likely to change over the years.

, Your email password is usually one of your most important passwords. If someone has access to your email account, they'll likely be able to gain access to any accounts you've created with it. This means you'll want a secure password that no one will be able to guess, and that you don't use anywhere else. Try to include upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols.


See Create a Secure Password for a detailed guide on making a strong password.

, Two-factor authentication is an extra layer of security that will help prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to your account. When you try log in from a new computer or device, a code will be sent to your mobile device that you'll need to enter in order to log in. This prevents intruders from logging in if they don't have physical access to your phone. Most major email providers have a form of two-factor authentication that you can enable from the Security section of your account settings.


See Set up 2 Step Verification in Gmail for instructions on setting up two-factor authentication in Gmail.

, Once you create your account, you'll be taken to your new inbox. Take a few minutes to get used to how the interface is laid out. Most email services are very similar, with your folders or labels listed along the left side of the window.

, If you use an email client like Outlook, you'll need to log in with your new email account. See Set up Microsoft Outlook for instructions on adding your new email address to Outlook.

, Send out an email from your new email address informing your important contacts of your new address. You can keep the message brief, such as ""Hi everyone, this is my new email address. Please add it to your contacts!"" Sending it from your new address makes it easy for recipients to update their address books.You may want to send different messages to different groups of people. Many email services allow you to group contacts. Create a few different groups, such as ""Work,"" ""Family,"" and ""Friends,"" and then send the messages to the groups instead of individual contacts.

, Chances are you've used your email address to set up a variety of accounts online over the years. In order to ensure that you'll still have access to these accounts once you transition email addresses, you'll need to update your account information for each one. If you use a password manager like LastPass or your web browser's password manager, you can use the list of stored passwords to determine which accounts you need to update.


Start with the most important accounts first, including your online banking, utilities, social media, and online store accounts. Then make sure all of your other accounts are changed as well, including forum accounts and other less-important accounts.

, Many email services allow you to import your old email accounts, which will automatically transfer your contacts and messages. This can save you a lot of effort, and you won't have to worry about messages or contacts being forgotten.


In Gmail, click the Gear button and select ""Settings."" Click the ""Accounts and Import"" tab, and then click ""Import mail and contacts."" Follow the prompts to load your old account. Once you've added your old account, you can even send mail from the old address using Gmail.
In Yahoo Mail, click the Gear button and select ""Settings."" Click the ""Accounts"" tab on the left side of the window. Click ""Add another mailbox"" and then follow the prompts to add your old account. Yahoo Mail supports Gmail, Outlook, AOL, and other Yahoo accounts. Once you've added an account, you can send mail using your new or old address.
In Outlook.com, Click the Gear button and select ""Connected accounts."" Click the ""Gmail"" button to add a Gmail account, or the ""Other email"" button to add any other account. If you add an email account, you'll be able to send mail from either your Outlook.com address or your old address.

, In order to access your contacts from your new email account, you may need to export them from your old account first. When you export your contacts, you'll be given a file that contains all of your contacts' information. You'll then be able to import this file in your new account.


See Export Gmail Contacts for instructions on exporting your Gmail contacts.
See Export Contacts from Outlook for instructions on exporting your Outlook mail client contacts.

, Once you've exported your contacts from your old service, you can import them into your new service. The process for this will vary depending on the email service you are using now. Some email services, such as Gmail and Yahoo, allow you to import contacts directly from another web-mail service without having to export them first.

, In order to ensure that you receive all of your messages, you'll want to set up mail forwarding on your old email service. This will make sure that any messages sent to your old address are still delivered to you in case you forgot to update an address for an account or a contact didn't get your message about your new address.The process for forwarding email will vary depending on your service. Generally, you'll find the forwarding settings in the Settings menu of your email service. You may have multiple options, such as keeping copies of forwarded messages on the original account, or deleting them as they're forwarded to your new account.
See Forward Mail from Gmail for instructions on forwarding mail from Gmail.
See Forward Yahoo Mail for instructions on forwarding mail in Yahoo.

, Once you've got your new address set up and forwarding configured for your old address, you can add your new address to your mobile devices. This will allow you to send and receive your mail on the go. The process is different for Android and iOS:


See Set Up a New Gmail Account on Android for a guide on adding a new Gmail account to your Android device.
See Set Up Email Account on an Android Device for instructions on adding any other email account to your Android device.
See Set Up Gmail on an iPhone for tips on getting your Gmail account added to your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch.
See Send Email on the iPhone for instructions on adding any email account to your iOS device.

, You may not need to delete your old email address. In fact, leaving it online with proper forwarding will help ensure that you don't miss any important emails in the months following your switch.


There may be no harm in keeping an old address, especially if it's free. You can always use your old address to sign up for mailing lists and other less important accounts, which can help minimize spam on your new account.
Keeping your old email account can be very useful if you need to log into an online account you set up with it that you forgot to transition to your new email. If you delete your old account before making the change, you may be locked out without the ability to manage it.

, You'll want to make sure that you don't miss any important messages, so leave your old account online for at least six months. Web-based email accounts will not deactivate in this time, so you'll receive all of your forwarded messages without having to log into the old address.

, Many email services allow you to set up an ""out of office"" or ""vacation"" message. Use this to automatically inform senders that you have a new email address. You may not want to do this if you get a lot of spam on your old account, as the spam senders will automatically see your new address.


See Use Email Autoresponders for information on setting up an auto-reply.

, If you want to permanently delete your old email account, you can do so once you're sure everything is being sent to your new address. Remember, it may be better to leave the old account active in case you need to access another account set up with it. Deleting email accounts is permanent, and you won't be able to reactivate it once it's gone.

Leave your torrent client running in the background.",How to Download Torrents," There are a variety of websites that list torrents. Some are more reliable than others. There are two main types of torrent trackers: public trackers and private trackers.


Public trackers are available to anyone. These are the sites you will find when doing a web search for torrent trackers. Because of their public nature, many torrents are tracked by copyright holders, and downloading them can result in action from your internet service provider.






Private trackers require invites. These sites are not accessible until you have been invited by another member. They often have requirements, such as sharing an equal amount of what you download. Private trackers are much less likely to result in cease and desist letters from copyright holders.





;
, Most public trackers have every new show, movie, album, and game available, as well as popular old files.


Use popular shorthand for finding the file you want. For example: if you need the second episode from the third season of a show, search for <show name> s03e02.







, The speed at which you can download a torrent file is determined by the number of seeders available. A seeder is a torrent user that has the entire file available for downloading.


Most torrent sites allow you to sort search results by the number of seeders. Look for files with a large number of seeders. Not only will you download it faster, but it is less likely that the file is fake or infected with a virus.






The number of leechers will affect your download speed as well. A leecher is a user that is downloading, but is not currently seeding. A leecher becomes a seeder when the full file has been downloaded. If there are significantly more leechers than seeders, the amount of bandwidth you receive will be lower, resulting in slower downloads.







, This is especially important for video files. Because compression can affect quality, smaller files will often look and sound significantly poorer than the same video with a larger size.


On the flipside, downloading a larger file can take significantly longer depending on your connection.






Read as many comments as possible to determine if other users feel that the quality of the file is good and worth your time. Some trackers have a rating system which allows users to vote on if the file is good or not.







, These files are slightly different than a standard torrent file. They match content based on a unique identifier that can then be accessed without the use of central trackers. A magnet link is a simple text line, and you don’t need to download a torrent file., Torrents can be used to transfer any file type. Because of this, the file you download may be one that you are not familiar with. Read the file description and ensure that you have the necessary programs to run the file after you’ve downloaded it.



VLC Player is a free, open-source media player that can play virtually any media file that you download.






ISO files are disc images, and either need to be burned or mounted in a virtual drive in order to run them.







, Because torrents often exist in a legal gray area, there is no oversight as to the kinds of files that are made available. This means that hackers will embed viruses in torrents that they hope to spread to other users. These are often included in popular searches in order to get the most victims possible.

Scan every file that you download for viruses.






Try to download files that have been released by trusted sources in the community.






Always check comments and ratings to see if anyone else experienced virus attacks with the torrent.







, The BitTorrent protocol lets you exchange or distribute data over the Internet. There's no central server involved; data is downloaded from other users (seeders). You need a client application that will connect to the host and manage the download. There are multiple clients available for free online. Some of the more popular ones are:

µTorrent







Vuze







, The torrent file that you download from the tracker site is very small, usually only a few KB in size. This file does not contain the content that you are downloading. The file acts as a guide for downloading pieces of the file from other clients. Use the BitTorrent client you installed in the previous step to open the file.


Your torrent client should be configured to automatically open torrent files. If yours is not, you can drag the torrent file into the client window to add it to the download queue.







, Depending on how your torrent client is configured, you may be asked where you want to download the content to when you open the torrent file. Select a location that you can remember.

, You can check the progress of your download in the torrent client. Most clients will allow you to see how many seeders you are connected to as well. Torrent clients will automatically try to download at the fastest speed allowed by your connection.


Downloading multiple files at once will slow the overall speed of each file.






If you don’t want to use all of your bandwidth on a download, right-click on it in the client and select Bandwidth Allocation (the wording will vary depending on your client). From here you can limit the download speed and upload speed. This is useful if you want to stream a movie while the file is downloading.







, If you are having difficulty connecting to enough seeders to download the file, you can try adding more trackers to the torrent. Do not attempt this if you are using a private tracker, as you may get banned.

Find a list of active trackers online. There are several websites that list active trackers. Copy the list of trackers to your clipboard.






Right-click on the torrent in the client. Select Properties from the menu.






Select the General tab. You should see a list of trackers in a box (there may be just one). Paste the list that you copied into the box. You need a blank line in between each tracker that you enter. Press OK and the torrent will automatically try connecting to the new trackers.







, Once the download is complete, you can use the files that you downloaded as you normally would. If you move or delete the files, you will lose the ability to seed.


You cannot start using the file before it is finished downloading. For example, you can’t start watching a video file before it is complete. This is because the file is downloaded in separate parts and the parts aren’t downloaded in order.







, Once you finish downloading the content of a torrent file, you become a seeder. This means that you are uploading data to other clients connected to the tracker.


Seeding is what keeps a torrent community alive. Without seeders, no one can download the files. While it's not required, it is considered a courtesy to seed for some time after the download finishes.







, If you are using a private community, you will most likely be expected to maintain a positive ratio with the community. This means that you will need to upload at least as much as you download.

, Most internet service plans have slower upload speeds than download speeds. This means that uploading to maintain your ratio can take significantly longer than downloading the equivalent amount. Leave your torrent program running in the background while you go about your daily tasks, and you'll see your upload totals skyrocket.


Running a torrent client in the background should not have a large effect on web browsing or word processing. More intensive applications such as streaming video and playing games may benefit from exiting the torrent application first.

You then download small chunks of the file from each computer you connect to. Your torrent program then pieces these chunks together and gives you the completed file. Because you are connecting to multiple computers simultaneously, torrents are one of the fastest ways to download large files, and they don't require a central server like a website or FTP would.The torrent files themselves, which have the .torrent extension, do not contain the files you are downloading. They simply act as pointers towards the files on other users' computers.;
, In order to download torrent files, you'll need what is called a torrent ""client"". This is the program that handles the connections to other torrent users and manages the file download process. There are a variety of torrent clients out there, but a few of the most popular options are listed below:qBittorent (Windows, Mac, Linux) - qbittorrent.org

Deluge (Windows, Mac, Linux) - deluge-torrent.org

Transmission (Mac, Linux) - transmissionbt.com

Flud (Android)

, Before you start downloading torrent files, you may want to check a few settings in your torrent client. The process varies depending on the client you are using, but generally the options are very similar. You can find the Options or Preferences menu in the menu bar.


Check the ""Connection"" section and ensure that the ""UPnP"" box is checked. This will allow you to connect to the most possible torrent users.
Check the ""Bandwidth"" or ""Speed"" section and set an Upload rate limit. generally, you'll want to set this to about 80% of your actual maximum upload. This will prevent the torrent client from clogging up the connection while uploading files.
Open the ""Downloads"" section and select a location to save finished files.


, The most common place to find torrent files is on a torrent tracker site. These are essentially torrent listings that will display information about the file being shared through that torrent, as well as how many users are sharing it. You can find torrent trackers by performing a web search for the file you want plus ""torrent"". Torrent trackers often have comments and ratings which can help you find the best version of the file.


Check the number of Seeders (S) versus the number of Leechers (L). Seeders are users who have completed the file transfer and are now sharing the file with others. Leechers are users who are still downloading the file and are not yet sharing the whole thing. If there are a lot of Leechers and very few Seeders, it may take a while to download the file. Conversely, if there are a lot of Seeders and not as many Leechers, the file should download at your connection's maximum speed.
Check the comments section for the torrent file before downloading it. This can help you determine if the file is good quality (important for video), and whether or not it is infected with viruses (important for programs).
Many legitimate files are shared through torrents, as it allows anyone to share a file without having to set up a server. It is illegal in most areas to download files that you do not have permission to.

, Most clients are configured to automatically open .torrent files once they've been downloaded. If not, you can open the file in your torrent client or just drag and drop it into the client's window. If your queue is clear, you will automatically begin attempting to connect to other users. The download will begin, and you can monitor the progress in the main window of the torrent client.

, The speed at which your file downloads is dependent on a lot of different factors, including your connection speed, client settings, and torrent health. You can't start using the downloaded files until they've completely finished.

, Torrents only survive when users seed the file for others. Most private torrent communities expect you to maintain a minimum upload-to-download ratio. This usually doesn't apply to public torrent trackers, but it's still considered good torrent etiquette to upload at least as much as you download.

, You'll be able to find your finished downloads in the folder you set earlier. If you didn't change the destination folder, you'll usually find the finished files in your Downloads folder.


You can right-click a finished file in your torrent list and select ""Open containing folder"" to open a window directly to the file.


, File compression is common with torrents, as it allows the creator to include a large number of files in a single file. Compression is also used to shrink files to make transferring large files easier. The most common compression formats are ZIP, RAR, 7Z, and TAR.


ZIP files can be opened natively in any operating system by simply double-clicking the file. Once you've opened the ZIP file, drag all of the contents into another folder on your computer to extract them.
To open RAR, 7z, or TAR files, you'll need a third-party archive extractor. 7-Zip is one of the most popular free extractors, and can open nearly any type of compressed file. You can download and install 7-Zip from 7-zip.org. Once you've installed 7-Zip, right-click on the file, find the ""7-Zip"" menu, and select ""Extract files.""
Some torrents will be split into multiple archives, such as r1, r2, r3, etc. Start the extraction process by extracting the first in the sequence. The file should be combined automatically.

, The most common format for videos through torrent is MKV, which cannot be played in Windows Media Player or iTunes. You'll have the best experience playing the majority of your downloaded videos if you use a third-party video player such as VLC or MPC-HC. Both of these video players are free and open-source, and can play virtually any video format.


You can download VLC from videolan.org. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and comes preinstalled on some Linux distributions.
You can download MPC-HC from mpc-hc.org. It is only available for Windows.
After installing the new video player, right-click any video file and select ""Open with"". Choose your new video player from the list of available options.

, ISO files are disc image files, which means they are the exact copy of the original disc. These files can be mounted on your computer as a virtual disc, or they can be burned to a blank disc and then inserted in any computer. ISO files are common for copies of DVD movies or software installation discs.


In Windows 8 and newer, you can right-click an ISO file and select ""Mount"" to insert the ISO file into a virtual drive. It will act as if you inserted a physical copy of the disc into a new drive on your computer. OS X supports mounting ISO files natively as well. In Windows 7 and older, you'll need to install a virtual drive program in order to mount the file. Click here for more details.In Windows 7 and newer, you can burn the ISO file to a blank DVD by right-clicking the ISO file and selecting ""Burn to disc"". You can use the Disk Utility program in OS X to burn ISO files to DVD. In Windows Vista and older, you'll need to install a burning program that supports ISO files. Click here for more details.
There are several other disc image formats as well, including BIN, CDR, NRG, and more. You'll need a dedicated image burning utility to burn these to a disc, regardless of your operating system.

, Running EXE files that have been downloaded through torrents is very risky, and generally not recommended unless you absolutely trust the source. Even then, you should scan the EXE file with your antivirus program just to be sure. If you want to be extra safe, run the EXE file in a virtual machine first so that it can't affect the rest of your system.

, If you downloaded a file from a torrent and you can't figure out how to open it, perform a search for the extension using your favorite online search engine. You should be able to find out how to open the file, and if it will even work on your computer. For example, EXE files won't work on a Mac, and DMG files won't work in Windows.

, If you aren't downloading the torrent file very quickly, try finding a different file with more seeders. Keep in mind that you'll never be able to download faster than your internet connection's maximum speed., Occasionally, torrents can clog up your network and suddenly stop working. The quickest way to fix this problem is to unplug the power to your modem and router, and then plug them back in after about a minute. This will restart your home network and hopefully fix the connection issue.


Make sure that the UPnP option is checked in the router's Options or Preferences menu.
If Windows prompts you to allow firewall access for your torrent client, make sure to accept.

, Oftentimes when you install these programs, you'll need to use a key generator program to bypass the program's copyright protection. These key generators can be very dangerous and install malicious software on your machine. The programs themselves may be modified in a negative way as well.

If you want to become a “seeder” so other users (known as leechers), can download the file from you using the BitTorrent protocol, leave the file as ”Seeding” in your BitTorrent client.

For example, if you're searching for a book, you'd type in its title.

, When downloading a torrent, there are a few things for which you should look:



Seeders - The number in the ""SEED"" column on the right side of the page should ideally be higher (or roughly equal to) the number in the ""LEECH"" column.

File details - Make sure the file name, category, and any other information in the title matches exactly what you're looking for.

Quality (video only) - Look for at least ""720p"" in the title (""1080p"" is ideal). Anything lower will have poor quality.

, You'll still need to look at a couple of things before actually downloading:



Comments - The user feedback here will give you an idea of how safe the torrent is.

Rating - You'll notice a yellow thumbs-up and a red thumbs-down in the top-right area of the torrent's page. If you see a large number below the thumbs-down icon, the torrent may be broken or unsafe.

, It's below the title of the torrent near the top of the page. Doing so will prompt it to begin downloading.


The torrent's download should only take a few seconds.

, Doing so should open it in BitTorrent. After a moment, the torrent will prompt the actual file to begin downloading.

, Once you open the torrent file in your client, it will begin connecting to seeders and downloading. Torrent downloads typically take a little while to ""warm up"", but once you connect to a few good seeders you should see your download speed reach the max limit.


Once the torrent is finished downloading, you'll be able to find it in the default ""Downloads"" folder, such as your desktop.
If you want to search for your downloaded file, type its name into Spotlight (Mac) or Start (Windows) and then click the pertinent file.

Install a good torrent client program.,
Search for sites that track torrents.,
Look for torrents with a high seed : leach ratio for fastest downloads.,
Check the format of the torrent.,
Download a torrent.,

Keep seeding.,
Regarding extracting the files from torrent, as suggested before, the extension of file can determine its method of extraction.",How to Download and Open Torrent Files," Utorrent (or µTorrent - it's the same program, but is called by different names) will work well for anybody who uses a Windows or Mac operating system. Google or use your favorite search engine to search ""bit torrent client"" for a list of additional program choices. Install as per instructions included with the client.;
, You can see many of them via a web search for ""torrent tracker."" Search for the websites that list many of the most popular torrent trackers for movies, eBooks and music.

, The more seeds per leech, the better. Torrents with few seeds - regardless the of seeds : leech ratio - will take longer to download. It may take longer if you have a slow internet connection, if this is the case, you might want to consider upgrading to your ISP's higher speed option since torrent transfers generate a lot of network traffic.


Torrent files work in a ""peer to peer"" (P2P) fashion rather then a server to client (S2C) fashion. This means you will not download the desired file(s) from a server, but rather from a number of other people who are ""hosting"" parts of the file needed. These hosts are called seeds. If a torrent has ""0"" seeds, it means no one has the file or program and you shouldn't bother attempting to download it.

, Look for torrents with file types that you are more familiar with. If you are not familiar with any of them, spend a few minutes reviewing file types such as MKV, RAR, SHN, ZIP etc. in order to figure out how to open and extract them. Download video formats compatible with your display ie: 480 or SD types will display on standard definition TVs and those that are 720, 1080 or HD will require an HD display or computer monitor.

, Once the client of choice is installed and properly configured, simply double clicking a torrent file listed on a website should download the torrent file, which will then start the client program automatically. Once the client program has started, it should begin to download the program or file desired after it connects to the hosts that have the parts of the file needed (may take up to a minute or so).

, Your upload speed can reduce your download speed. If set too high, you might want to experiment with different upload rates to find the speed that does not adversely affect download speed. Similarly, setting your upload speed to ""0"" will cause download speeds to slow to a crawl and eventually stop completely. Choose a speed that does not reduce download speed.

, After the download is finished, moving the file will cause the upload to other people to fail so if you wish to seed (which is strongly encouraged but not mandatory), you shouldn't move the file. You can, however, open or use it. Remember, you can only download the file because of other people seeding. So give back to the community!

, Some files - will be playable / watchable directly, while others will need to be unpacked / unzipped etc. Some file types found and their ways of extraction are:


ZIP, RAR: you can extract with the help of WinRAR
ISO: these files are extracted using daemon tool which can be downloaded easily by searching through Google.
These are the main type of files.

Download µtorrent at www.utorrent.com/.,
Open µtorrent by double clicking on the icon.,
Visit the Torrent site you trust and search for the torrent you want.,
Look at the list of Torrents available.,
Download the Torrent.,
Wait for the Torrent to download completely.,
Click on the ""Completed"" tab to find your file once it has downloaded.",How to Download a Torrent on Mac with uTorrent," There are versions of µtorrent for several different platforms, so make sure you download the version for Mac. Decide where you want to download the file (like to your desktop or your downloads folder).


Once the download is complete, double click the uTorrent.dmg file to unzip the program.
Drag µtorrent into your ""Applications"" folder.;
, This will launch the program, but you will have to look online for the Torrent you want.


During the Installation uTorrent tries to install several unnecessary programs, including a toolbar. If you don't want to have that, make sure to read the small text during the installation and only check the boxes that are necessary for the installation.

, Type in the search bar the name of whatever you are trying to download. Make sure you are specific otherwise you might get some random results.


For example if you search ""WWE"" you're going to get a ton of results, probably not the one you're looking for, so try searching something more specific, for example, ""WWE Wrestlemania 29 New York/New Jersey Full Event"" you're going to find what you're looking for.
If you don't know any Torrent sites, look up the movie/game/music/book you want to download on a search engine and add the word ""torrent."" You might also want to add ""mac.""

, Have a look at the first few in the list. Decide which one you would like based on the file size (bigger files take longer to download but are better quality), and file type you need (avi, mkv, mp4, etc).


If you are unsure about which to pick, go with the one with the most seeds.
Click on the file and have a look at the comments section. Check that people have commented saying that it works, is good quality, is the correct file, etc. If there are none or few comments, do not risk downloading it.

, You can do this by clicking the little magnet, or the link that says ""Get this Torrent."" Make sure not to press ""download direct,"" ""download,"" or ""magnet download"" or you will get unwanted pop-ups and redirections.


As you download the Torrent, you will begin to seed the parts of the file you have already downloaded.
Even if your download has finished, uTorrent will continue to upload the file, to other Users in the uTorrent network. Only if you either remove the file from uTorrent or quit uTorrent, the Uploading will be stopped.

, µtorrent will automatically open the link/file (or you will be asked to open it with a program; set µtorrent as default). µtorrent will also open a second window, in which you have to click the button in the right bottom corner, saying ""OK"".


The download length will depend on both the size of the file and the number of ""seeders"" or people sharing the file.
The more seeders, the faster a file will download as the torrent will take pieces of the file

, You can open the file by right-clicking and selecting show in finder or press the magnifying glass.


If you downloaded a move, right-click on the file and choose ""Open With"" and choose your preferred media player.

Find a download manager that supports the BitTorrent protocol.,
Consider the other features supported by the download manager.,
Avoid installing bundled adware/malware.,
Download and open your download manager.

,
Enable the BitTorrent protocol in the settings.,
Search the internet for torrents.,
Check the torrent for seeders.,
Click the torrent download link.,
Open the torrent file directly from the manager.",How to Download a Torrent Directly With a Download Manager," Without it, the download manager will not be able to properly utilize torrent files. A few examples of download managers that support the BT protocol include: FlashGet, Free Download Manager, uGet, KGet, GetRight, or Shareaza.;
, Most download managers will support features like batch downloads and pause/resume downloads. Other features to consider include additional support from the software manufacturer, file organization, file preview, or speed/queue controls.


Batch downloads allow you to download multiple files from a single page at once, usually with a single action, rather than manually hitting each download link.
File preview allows you to view sections of partially downloaded files. This feature typically has mixed functionality based on which parts of the file are downloaded first.
Speed and queueing features give you more control over the bandwidth allotted to your downloads. You can specify which downloads get priority and pick what order files get downloaded in.

, Make sure you read everything carefully during the installation process and deselect any options beyond the core software. Some installers may try to prompt you to install extraneous pieces of adware or malware along with the main product.


Look for prompts to install things like “toolbar” or anything else that seems like it might be a separate product.Download managers can change also drastically from version to version. Be wary of prompts to upgrade and update. You never know what can be included in a new version.If you are suspicious of your download manager, it may be best to abandon it altogether and look for a different one.

,, Though the protocol is often enabled by default if it is supported, you can check by opening the settings and looking for “BitTorrent”. This options will typically be listed in a “Downloads” section.

, Navigate to a torrent site using your web browser. It is preferable to use an established torrent site to search rather than using a search engine, because the results will be somewhat moderated by community members and site staff to help flag or eliminate broken or malicious files.


Some torrent sites require an account to use, but often need an invitation to sign up. These sites (known as private trackers) are among the most reliable and best moderated for finding good torrents. You will need to know someone with an account or wait for an open sign up period to use these.

, Seeders are peers that you can connect to who already have the files in the torrent. You can download the torrent file for later use, but with no seeders the actual content cannot be downloaded.


Torrent websites will always list the number of seeders on a torrent on its download page. This information is usually refreshed every few hours, so you can check back later to see how many any active seeders there are at a given time.
More seeders typically means a faster download.

, You will be prompted to save the file using your download manager. The torrent file will appear in the download list of your download manager.


You can also use a “magnet link” when acquiring torrents. These are usually indicated on the page by a magnet icon and will launch the torrent download directly without downloading the torrent file first.

, With the BitTorrent protocol enabled you will be able to open the torrent file using the download manager and start downloading the torrent’s contents.


The time it takes to download the files in a torrent vary greatly depending on the size of the files, the number of seeders, and the upload speed of those seeders.
One of the benefits of using a download manager and the BitTorrent protocol is that you can close the download manager or shut off your computer and later resume the download where you left off.

Investigate your torrent client.,
Select the option to make a new torrent file.,
Select the files you wish to be in the torrent.,
Enter a tracker.,
Add any additional information.,
Now that you have your torrent file open it ready for seeding.,
Share your torrent.",How to Create a Torrent," Most up-to-date clients can make torrents (only a minority may not be able to). For a free client that can create torrents try µTorrent for Windows and Mac, Transmission for Mac, Deluge for Linux or JSTorrent for Chrome OS. (Note: JSTorrent cannot make torrents. It is just a torrent client for Chromebooks.);
, This is usually located under the File menu and named ""Create New Torrent"" or words to that effect. If it is not in this location try looking under other menus or the toolbars. If you are still uncertain, check the official website of your client for more details. Sometimes dragging the file/folder into the client also works.

, If you will have several files consider arranging them all first in a folder, so you can simply select that folder to use as the torrent contents. The name of your torrent file will usually be the name of the file or folder in it. You can easily rename the file afterwards.

, A tracker controls the transfer of data for your torrent. A tracker looks similar to an ordinary URL. If you want to index your torrent on a torrent downloads website then you should use the tracker owned by that website, as not all indexing sites will allow external trackers. If you are using a private tracker (you probably aren't), then be sure to tick the box to mark it as private. Do not tick this box otherwise.

, You can add a comment for the torrent if you wish. The piece size should be left at the automatic setting unless you know what you're doing. Once you have filled in all the required areas create your torrent. You may be asked where to save and what to call the .torrent file, or you may have been asked beforehand.

, Some clients have a seed mode specifically for this. If you do not seed your torrent it will be useless because nobody can download your files.

, If you are making the torrent so you can send a friend a file, just send them the .torrent file. If you want it open to the public to download you are best listing it on a torrent download website. Once on such a site find the link to add or upload a new torrent and fill in the required information. You will probably be required to register if you have not already. Once people start downloading the torrent from this site it will gather more and more seeders. If you wish, you can stop seeding once the torrent is ""stable"", or continue to seed.

, Others may have already confirmed it's status.

, The more sites, the more chance the torrent is real.

, This may not work for movies and large file.

, Is the file only 5 MB, when all the others are 5 GB? Does the file size seem too small? If so, it might be fake.

, If there aren't a lot of seeders, there is a chance it could be fake.

A torrent file ""points"" to a file that is being shared by other users with the same torrent file. When you load a torrent file into your torrent client, it will connect to others that are sharing the file. You can connect to many computers at once, grabbing small chunks of the final file from each. This makes torrent one of the most efficient ways to share files, as there is no need to host the file on any central server. Each user simply connects to other users and downloads the file directly from other computers.The torrent file itself does not contain any part of the actual file you will be downloading. It simply acts as a pointer.
If you've already used a torrent client to download the torrent file, click here for instructions on how to open the converted files.;
, Torrent files are opened in a torrent client, and don't actually contain the file you want. Instead, it points you to other users who are sharing that file. The torrent client manages connections and downloads the file for you. Popular torrent clients include:qBittorrent (Windows, Mac, and Linux) - qbittorrent.org

Deluge (Windows, Mac, Linux) - deluge-torrent.org

Transmission (Mac and Linux) - tansmissionbt.com

uTorrent (Windows and Mac) - utorrent.com


, The installation process will vary depending on your system. Typically you just need to double-click the setup file and follow the prompts to install. Be aware that if you're installing uTorrent, it will try to install extra software during installation. Read each screen carefully and decline any extra offers.


qBittorrent, Deluge, and Transmission do not come bundled with additional adware.
Ubuntu and Fedora may come with Transmission already installed.
Your new torrent client will associate itself with the .torrent file type. Torrent files will open automatically when you double-click them now.

, Before you start downloading torrents, there are a few tweaks that you'll likely want to make in your new client's Settings menu. Start your torrent client and open the Options or Preferences menu. You can usually find this in the ""Tools"" menu.


Click the ""Downloads"" option and set the folder where you want finished files to be saved. Once the file is done downloading, it will be moved to this folder.
Click the ""Speed"" or ""Bandwidth"" option and set your rate limits. Most people will want to leave the Download limit set to ""0"", which means Unlimited. The torrent client will use as much bandwidth available to download the file. If you share your internet, or want to be able to stream video while downloading, you might want to put a limit. Set your Upload limit to 80% or less of your maximum upload speed. When your upload bandwidth is maxed out, the rest of your internet usage will suffer.
Click the ""Connection"" option and confirm that the ""Use UPnP"" box is checked. This will give you the most possible connections and the highest speed.

, Torrent trackers are listing services for torrent files. They will tell you how many people are sharing the torrent file. They also provide the torrent file to load into your client. Because of their dubious legality, torrent sites change on a regular basis. Oftentimes, the site will keep the same name but change domains. It is highly recommended that you use an ad-blocking extension when visiting torrent trackers. Some of the more popular public torrent trackers include:


Pirate Bay
Kickass Torrents
RARBG
IsoHunt
EZTV (TV only)
YTS/YIFY (Movies only)

, Most torrent trackers offer many different types of files. You can find programs, games, movies, television shows, music, and more. It is illegal in most areas to download content that you do not own.

, Seeders are users who have the complete file and are sharing it with others. Leechers are users who do not yet have the complete file and are still downloading it. If there are more leechers than seeders, it may take longer to download the file. This is because there isn't enough bandwidth to go around. Most trackers will display both numbers in the search results list. Their columns may be abbreviated ""S"" and ""L"".If a torrent has 0 seeders, you may not be able to download the entire file.

, Check the comments to make sure that the file worked for other users. This is a good way to make sure that you aren't downloading a virus, and that the file is good quality. Some trackers will have a rating system as well that you can use to see if the torrent is worth your time and bandwidth.


Checking the comments and details is especially important for videos. This will help you see if the encoding is good, as well as what kind of language options there are. Higher-quality videos are typically larger size than regular or low-quality videos.

, Click the Download button to download the torrent file you want to your computer. Torrent files are very small (basically a text file). It will download in just a few moments.

, Click the downloaded torrent file in your browser, or open your Downloads folder and double-click it. This will launch your torrent client. You may be prompted to select where you want to save the finished file. It will begin downloading the files automatically unless you have other torrents queued.

, Your torrent client will display the progress, speed, and estimated remaining time for the download. Download times vary wildly depending on the size of the file, the speed of your connection, the number of seeders and leechers, and your client settings., Torrent files survive thanks to the strength of the community. It is considered good torrent etiquette to seed the file after you finish downloading it. This allows other users to download the file and start seeding it themselves. You won't get in trouble with public torrent trackers for not seeding. Many private trackers expect users to maintain a minimum seeding ratio of at least 1:1.

, Your finished file(s) can be found in the folder you set when setting up your torrent client. For most clients, the default is your Downloads folder. Many torrents will create their own folder after downloading. Some will download as single files.

, Torrents allow you to download any type of file. Different files will require different programs. The extension or file type can help you determine what program to use.

, EXE files are Windows executable files. Double-click an EXE file to run it. Take extreme caution when running EXE files downloaded through torrents. This is the main way that viruses are transferred.

, MKV is one of the most popular video formats. It can easily include multiple audio tracks and subtitles in one file. To play MKV, MP4, or virtually any other video format, install the free VLC Media Player (www.videolan.org) or MPC-HC (mpc-hc.org). If you're using Linux, there's a good chance that VLC is already installed.

, Archive files are a way to compress and transfer multiple files as a single archive. ZIP can be opened in Windows, Mac, and Linux by double-clicking the file. RAR and 7Z require a special program, such as WinRAR (rarlab.com) or 7-Zip (7-zip.org).

, They need to be either burned to a blank disc or mounted using a virtual disc drive. In OS X and newer versions of Windows, you can right-click an ISO file and burn it directly to a disc. This creates an exact copy of the original. You can also use a program like Daemon Tools to create a ""virtual"" disc drive on your computer. This allows you to ""insert"" the image file as if it was an actual disc.

, If you've downloaded a file type that isn't listed above and you don't know how to open it, perform a quick web search for the file extension to see what programs you can use. Many files can be opened using free programs if you don't have the correct program installed.

, Use the correct program to run or open the downloaded file. Use a search engine to determine the best way to open unknown files. Files made for one operating system will typically not work on other operating systems. You can't open a torrent file until the content has been completely downloaded.

, Most virus scanners run automatically, and will attempt to detect viruses in new files. Still, you should run a virus scan on your downloaded files, especially EXE or BAT files. These are the most common formats for sending viruses.



Click here for a guide on installing an antivirus program.

, Nearly all torrent trackers have a rating system that allows users to apply a rating to the torrent file. Use these ratings to your advantage; if 1000 people have rated a torrent highly and only a few have rated it poorly, it is likely virus-free.


Be sure to check the comments section for the torrent as well. Oftentimes, users will report problems with the torrent in this section. This is another good way to check for potential viruses.

, If you're dealing with a lot of potentially hazardous torrent files, you may want to setup a virtual machine environment first. This will enable you to test the files in isolation before opening them on your working computer. You can use VirtualBox and a Linux distribution to setup a virtual machine for free. Click here for detailed instructions.


This is a fairly advanced method, and isn't really necessary if you're just downloading the occasional movie. If you are frequently dealing with programs and other potential virus-prone files, a virtual machine can save you a lot of time and stress down the road.

Download DBAN.,
Back up anything you want saved.,
Burn the DBAN program.,
Reboot your computer.,
Set your computer to boot from the CD/DVD or USB drive.,
Save and exit.,
Start DBAN.,
Choose the hard disk you want to erase.,
Begin wiping the drive(s).,
Restart your computer.",How to Clean a Hard Drive1," DBAN is an open-source program that runs when your computer boots, and will securely delete all of the data on any connected drive that you specify. When files are erased normally, the contents of the file remain on the drive and are marked to be overwritten. This means that with the right tools, some of your data may be recoverable, even after you format the drive. DBAN will overwrite your drive with 1s and 0s three times, making recovery of your data virtually impossible.DBAN can be downloaded for free from the developer’s website at dban.org.



 


DBAN comes in ISO format, which will be burnt to a CD or DVD





;
, DBAN will erase everything on the disk, including Windows or any other operating system. If you are planning on using the hard disk again as the primary disk, be prepared to reinstall Windows. Save any files you want to keep to an external hard drive, or burn them to a DVD.

, Once you have downloaded DBAN, you will need to burn it to a disc so that you can boot from it. If you’d like, you can create a bootable USB drive instead.

, Make sure that the CD/DVD or the USB drive is still inserted. As your computer boots, press the Setup key to enter your BIOS. The Setup key varies from system to system, but is typically F2, F10, or Del.


You have to press the Setup key quickly or else your computer will continue to boot normally. If you miss the window, you will have to reboot and retry.
The Setup key for your system is displayed on the same screen as the manufacturer’s logo.







, Once you are in your BIOS menu, navigate to the Boot menu. You need to set the drive that contains DBAN to boot before your hard drive.


Most systems use the “+” and “-” keys to move the entries.
If you are using a flash drive, the menu may refer to it as a Removable Drive.







, Once you’ve changed your boot order, save and exit the BIOS to reboot your computer. DBAN should load automatically. If it does not, enter the BIOS again and check that your drive order is correct.

, When DBAN begins, you will be taken to the boot: menu, where you can start the DBAN program. Press Enter to open DBAN and configure the wipe process. You can also enter some quick commands from this menu.


If you intend to wipe every hard disk that is connected to your computer, type autonuke. This will start a standard wipe on all of your drives, using the three-pass method.







, If you only want to erase a specific drive, or you want to change the settings, press Enter at the boot: menu to enter Interactive Mode. Use the Space bar to select the drives that you want to erase.You can change the wipe method (M), the random number generator (P), the number of rounds (R), and the verification (V) by pressing the appropriate key. Each section has a detailed explanation about each of the options.






Most of the default settings for DBAN should be sufficient for home and small business users.

, Once you have selected the drives and options, press F10 to begin the wipe process. The time until the process completes will be displayed in the Statistics box. Depending on the method chosen and the size of the drive, the wipe process could take days to complete.

, After the wiping process is complete, you will receive a message from DBAN instructing you to remove the DBAN disc and shut down your computer. Your drives are now securely erased, and you can safely sell or reuse them.


Drives will have to be reformatted for use with your operating system.






If you wiped the disk with your operating system, you will need to reinstall Windows.

Look into the size of the hard drive.,
Consider the type of hard drive it is.,
Find out what the RPM of the hard drive is.,
Investigate the manufacturers.,
Consider the price.","How to Choose Between Hitachi, Seagate, Western Digital Internal Hard Disks"," First and foremost, choose a size of HDD that matters to you. Whether it be for working on, storing videos and/or music or simply for drawing terrible pictures using MS Paint™, a HDD is only as good as the amount it can store. And all manufacturers sell a wide range of them. 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 & 2048GB. So choose the space that suits your motivations and computer usage.;
, You have your original disk drive with several actual DISKs inside that spin all the time, reading and writing via a tiny needle point (sort of like a gramophone), and the most recent creation, which is Solid State, a system of chips and boards that reduces the movement and vibration of the drive itself, making for better performance. Your choices are very critical because SSD have not advanced into the 500GB overcharge yet, so you'd have to give them some time before they can catch up with the 2 Terabyte levels that HDD have got. If you prefer quality over quantity, I'd recommend the Solid State Drives. However, if you need vast spaces to store numerous files without worry for how long it takes, the Hard Disk Drives are a fine choice.

, The speed of devices is a downright chance these days. You can put as much power into a HDD or SSD as you like and in the end, the performance of these devices falls squarely upon the performance of your PC. Over-clock your PC and the drives will work like wonders, but if your PC is under specification, the drives will not be so brilliant. Naturally though, if your PC is just right, your focus should be, for HDD, the RPM that it can run at. This, along with the L2 and L3 caches, will determine how fast the disk can be written and wiped at. The lower the RPM, naturally, the longer it'll take to update the disk. SSD don't use spinning as they are just chips, so their measurement is based purely on the performance of your machine, so the faster your machine, the better the data access.

, There are a lot of manufacturers out there that supply internal and external hard drives. Each of these manufacturers also have their own solid state service as well, so you're spoiled for choice in what you want to choose from. In the end, the reviews people give genuinely let you know which one to root for more than the others. And although all these models can come with primarily SATA connections, they still do the old 4-pin connections too. So it's kind of hard to decide. In the end, the reviews of the items you wish to buy determine the best you can get from the market.

, When it comes to buying certain types of HDD, you're more inclined to spend less, and get more. This isn't always the case and sometimes it gets harder to get what you're looking for. But in the end, your ultimate choice should be a combination of what you want from your hard drive and you can estimate its worth from there. Most hard drives can be calculated between £60 and £120 for a decent size, speed and make.

, Reboot the computer and hold down the Command + R keys while the computer boots. This will load the Recovery utility. Select the Recovery HD and press Continue.

, This program will allow you to manipulate your installed hard drives.

, In the left menu, you will see a list of your computer’s installed hard disks. Select the hard disk that you want to securely wipe. If you wipe your primary disk, you will need to reinstall OS X.

, Here you can select the format the you want the disk to be. For OS X, the format should be Mac OS X Extended (Journaled). You can name the disk as well if you’d like.

, By default, the drive will be reformatted with a one-pass method that writes zeros over the entire disk. This is moderately secure, but if you want more security, you can pick from several options.


7-Pass Erase – This will perform seven passes instead of one, making it a highly secure wipe. All data will be virtually unrecoverable. This takes 7 times longer than a standard wipe.






35-Pass Erase – This will perform 35 passes instead of one, and uses the Gutmann algorithm, which is incredibly secure. This method is recommended for classified and top-secret material. The 35-pass erase takes 35 times longer than the standard wipe.







, Your drive will now begin the wipe process. Depending on the Security Options you chose, this can take a significant amount of time. Once the process is complete, the drive will be wiped and formatted for your system.

, If you’ve wiped the primary disk on your computer, you will need to reinstall OS X in order to use it again. Click the Reinstall OS X option in the Recovery HD.You will need an internet connection in order to download the installation files. You may need to enter your Apple ID in to verify your account.

We'll need a partitioning tool to change the active partition.,
Download Parted Magic.

,
Now you'll have to create a bootable media from which we can start Parted Magic.,
You can burn the ISO file to a CD with any CD burning software which is capable of burning image files.,
We'll use a special tool to copy Parted Magic to a USB pen drive, because your pen drive needs to be made bootable.,
For Parted Magic to be able to detect your hard drive, it's important to change your hard drive's controller mode to IDE mode before proceeding.,
Now we've created our bootable media.,
You should see the Parted Magic boot menu.,
Now you should see the Parted Magic desktop, similar to a Windows desktop.,
In the bottom pane, you should see a list of your hard drive's partitions.,
Right-Click the partition you want to set as the active / bootable partition and select ""manage flags"".,
If your system fails to boot and you want to go back, just return to step 7 and this time, set your old active partition to bootable again with Parted Magic.

",How to Change the Active Partition of Your Hard Disk with Parted Magic," ""Parted Magic"" is a small Linux distribution which does exactly what we want. The download is about 140 MB in size. You can also use the ""Ultimate Boot CD"", this boot CD contains Parted Magic as well, but it's bigger in download size because it contains many other programs.;
,, You have two choices: Create a bootable CD, or create a bootable USB pen drive. To create a bootable CD, see step 4. To create a bootable USB pen drive, see step 5.

, Do a Google search for ""ImageBurn"" and proceed to download and install the program . Start ImageBurn, select ""write image file to disc"", select the downloaded .iso file as source file and start burning. When you're finished, continue reading with step 6.

, It's called ""Universal USB installer"". Go to http://www.pendrivelinux.com and proceed to download the Universal USB installer from the web site. Plug in your USB pen drive and backup any data stored on it, as it will be completely erased in the process. Start the program and proceed to agree the license agreement. From the first drop-down box, select ""Parted Magic"". In the text box below, select the .iso file you just downloaded. Then, select the correct drive letter for your USB pen drive and proceed.

, If you have an IDE hard disk, you don't need to configure anything. Proceed with step 7. If you have a SATA hard disk, you'll need to disable the controller's AHCI mode in BIOS and set it to IDE mode. If you are unsure if your controller is running in AHCI mode, just give it a try to proceed with step 7. The worst thing to happen would be Parted Magic being unable to detect any hard drives. In that case, you'll need to switch your controller to IDE mode, which is not covered in this guide. Do a Google search for ""how to switch SATA controller to IDE mode"".

, Insert your CD or plug-in your USB pen drive, and restart your computer. You need to change your boot device in the system's BIOS so the computer will boot from it. The easiest way is to bring up the boot menu by pressing F12 (or the escape key on some systems) when your computer starts, then select your bootable media from the list. Another way is to change the boot order in the BIOS, however this process is not covered in this tutorial. Do a Google search for ""how to change the boot order in bios"".

, Select option 1 (the default) and press Enter. If you have a system with a small amount of installed memory (RAM), consider using the option ""Live with low RAM settings"".

, Double click the icon named ""Partition Editor"" on the desktop to open the partition editor.

, If no partitions are listed and no hard drive is detected, you most probably have forgot to switch your SATA controller to IDE mode (see step 6).

, From the following menu, tick the ""boot"" check box and close the program. Reboot your computer to complete the process. Important note: If you have set the boot partition to a partition which does not contain the system files needed by the boot loader, your system will fail to boot. Do not set a partition as the active partition when no operating system files are installed on it. To do this for Windows XP, read step 5 in the following article: Change the Active Partition in Windows XP

, Make sure you have the right type of hard drive for your computer. Generally speaking, you want to replace your original drive with a similar drive to make the process easier and simpler. Although the hard drive's capacity might be much higher on a newer replacement drive, you typically want to choose the same data/power connector type and same physical form factor as your original drive. However, sometimes you may not want to keep the same hard drive type, so careful planning can help avoid problems later.

, SATA usually comes in 3 different versions (SATA, SATA II and SATA III) You will need to check what your motherboard supports to make sure you have the correct replacement drives. Also, hard drives now come with different physical sizes. Hard drives may either come in a 2.5 inch (6.4 cm) or a 3.5 inch (8.9 cm) form factor now. 2.5 inch (6.4 cm) drives were mainly used in laptops while the 3.5 inch (8.9 cm) drives were used in desktops. However, the popularity of 2.5 inch (6.4 cm) SSDs (Solid State Drives) devices have made 2.5 inch (6.4 cm) hard drives popular options for desktops now as well. Some computer case manufacturers are including 2.5 inch (6.4 cm) hard drive cages in some of their newer designs. If you are planning to replace a 3.5 inch (8.9 cm) drive with a 2.5 drive, make sure your computer case has support for it, or you may need to purchase an adapter kit.

, Improper handling of electronic components can cause damage to computer parts during handling. To avoid this, you must ensure you are grounded when operating inside your computer. One solution is to use an anti-static wrist strap which you should wear during the exchange. Make sure you terminate the strap by plugging it into an outlet with a ground. If you don't have one then constantly touch the back of the computer case. Please make sure to make contact on a surface that is metal. The static electricity will discharge into the computer case.

, Open both sides of computer case by removing screws at the back of the tower and sliding the panels off. Some computer cases do not use screws. If your case is a screw-less case, you will need to find the latch or button that releases the doors or panels. Remove the doors or panels as necessary.

, Most computers will have the hard drive screwed within a cage inside the computer case. Identify the data and the power connectors and disconnect them.

, Most likely, the drive will be held in place by screws on both sides of the hard drive. Remove the screws. Please use your hand to support the hard drive if the case or cage does not support the drive. Once the screws are removed, you can slide the hard drive out of the cage or case.

, Move the jumpers on the replacement drive to match the settings of the original. Your choices will be Master, Slave or Cable Select. SATA drives do not need to set jumpers. Once you have removed the original hard drive, look at the position of the jumpers on the drive itself. If you cannot see them, most drives will have a diagram on the hard drive's label illustrating the location of the jumpers. The jumper setting will either set the drive as Master, Slave or Cable Select. You should match the settings of the replacement drive to that of the original.

, This will be the same position as the original drive. Carefully screw the drive in and reconnect the data and power cables.

, Installing an operating system like Windows, Mac OS or Linux may be needed if you do not a recovery image or disk. If you are replacing a secondary drive, you might need to reload any software that was installed on the drive or copy back data files from a back up source.

Close the machine, power it up and configure your new drive using the Windows 7 Disk Management Tool (or, in the case of other machines and systems, find out the configuration tool).",How to Add an Extra Hard Drive to Your Computer," Before we start the process of adding a drive, we need to do a small amount of research inside your machine. The goal of the research is to find out if it will be easy or not to add the new hard drive. We also need to find out what kind of drive you need to buy. You may be able to do this research by reading through your computer's manuals, but it is far easier to simply open the case and look inside.


The first question to answer is: How many hard disk drives have already been installed inside the case? In the majority of machines, the answer to this question is ""one."" Having only one hard disk drive installed makes it easy to install another one. After you open up your computer's case and look inside, you will probably find one optical drive (a CD or DVD drive), a single hard disk drive and perhaps a floppy disk drive. The optical and floppy drives will be easy to find because you can see them on the outside of the case. The hard drive may take a little searching. If you have no idea what a hard drive looks like, look at the photo above.
If there are already two drives installed inside your case, then adding a new one is more difficult.;
, Is there space available to add another hard-disk drive? Your current hard disk is probably mounted in a small metal cage or rack inside the machine. Make sure there is space available in the cage for another drive. If not, adding an external drive is an option.


An external drive connects to your computer through either a USB 2.0 connection or a FireWire connection, so your computer needs to have USB 2.0 or FireWire connectors. Once you buy the drive, all you have to do is connect it and fire up your computer. The drive will come with configuration instructions, but on Windows XP and other modern systems, it will likely be plug-and-play. You can start saving files on your new drive immediately.
There is one big advantage to an external drive: you can plug it into multiple machines and move files around. You can take it with you anywhere you go. The only real disadvantage is that it will be slower than an internal drive. If it takes a minute to copy a gigabyte of data on an internal drive, it might take two minutes on an external drive. That may or may not be important depending on what you want to do. For most applications, the slower speed is irrelevant.

, There are two systems in common use: IDE drives (also known as PATA, or Parallel ATA), and SATA (Serial ATA) drives. PATA drives have wide, flat cables or thick cables as wide as your finger, while SATA drives have thin cables about the diameter of a pencil. You will need to know whether to buy an IDE or SATA drive, and you should be able to tell by looking at the cables. Also note that some cables only offer a connector from ONE hard drive to the motherboard, while others have connectors for two or more.


Now that you have confirmed that there is space to install a new drive in your machine and you know what type of drive you need (PATA or SATA), you can buy a new drive.

, You can buy a new hard drive from many different places: a retail store, a large computer store, a local computer parts store or by mail order. Wherever you go to buy it buy it, keep three things in mind:


Buy a ""normal"" 3.5-inch wide hard drive. They're sold everywhere, but you want to avoid the smaller hard disk drives made for laptops.
Make sure the new drive has the correct cable system (SATA or PATA) to match your machine.

, Buy the biggest drive you can afford, because it will probably fill up before you know it.

,,


Before we start working with the drive, we need to talk about static electricity. Your computer is highly sensitive to static shocks. This means that if you build up static electricity on your body and a shock passes from your body to something like a hard drive, that hardware will probably fail and you will have to buy another one.

, The way to eliminate static electricity is by grounding yourself. There are lots of ways to do this, but probably the easiest way is to wear a grounding bracelet on your wrist. Then you connect the bracelet to something grounded (like a copper pipe or the center screw on a wall outlet's face plate). By connecting yourself to ground, you eliminate the possibility of static shock. You can get a bracelet for a few dollars. An alternative is to touch the power supply whenever you make a ""big"" motion, like taking off a jacket or getting up and sitting down again. A bracelet is superior in any case.

, Let's talk about this in more detail, because most people have IDE drives.


In the IDE system, most motherboards allow you to have two IDE cables. Each cable can connect to two drives. Usually you use one cable to connect one or two optical drives to your machine. The other cable is used to connect one or two hard drives to your machine.
You want both hard drives to be on the same cable. The two drives on the cable are called ""master"" and ""slave."" You want your existing hard drive (which contains the operating system and all of your current data) to be the ""master"" and the new hard drive to be the ""slave."" The drive should have instructions on them that tell you how to set the jumpers for master and slave. So read the instructions and set the jumpers. If you are using SATA drives, you do not need to set jumpers for master and slave because each drive gets its own cable. Check out How IDE Controllers Work to learn more about the master and slave configuration. Avoid using a large tool to remove the jumpers, as this can knock the pins out of alignment.

,, If it fits, then it's a match. Connect the IDE or SATA cable to the drive.

, To do this, click the Start button, open the Control Panel, Switch to Classic View, click on Administrative Tools, click on Computer Management, click on Disk Management.


Look at the graphical area in the bottom right of this display. Disk 0 is your original hard drive. Disk 1 is the new hard drive. Chances are that the new drive will not be initialized, or formatted. Click the small button to initialize the drive, and then format it as an NTFS volume (right click on the new drive, then click “Format...”). Formatting may take an hour or more, so be patient.
When the formatting is done, you are ready to use your new drive.

Do not run the Clonemaxx file yet.,
Prepare the PC.,
Open up the PC case so that the new drive can be added.,
Don't bother mounting the new drive into the case, but just lay it flat on the desk, or inside the PC.,
Start up the PC again.,
When the PC has opened normally, then run the downloaded Clonemaxx.exe file.,
Restart the PC with the newly-made floppy disk in place OR with CD in CD drive, which you have burnt in last step (Note: Setup your bios to boot from cd on priority), and follow the instructions given by the program.,
Test the new drive.,
Tidy up.",How to Back up Any Hard Drive Using PC Inspector Clonemaxx," Get your spare hard drive ready, and set its cross-connects so that it is the slave for the copying process.;
, Wait until both the old drive and the new drive are both in the PC.

, Make sure that the PC is how you want it, with all of the installation of software done, virus-checked and defragged, ready to go, then Shut down the PC, and for safety, disconnect the power cord too.

, If you have spare data and power cables then use them to connect the new hard drive to the PCs motherboard. Do this in the same way that the old drive is connected. If you don't have spare cables or if there are no free connections on the motherboard for your new drive, then just temporarily take the cables from the back of the CD/DVD drive and connect them to your new hard drive. If using the CD/DVD cables, there is no need to remove the third, thinnest cable as this is for the sound card; it is just the power and data cables that are needed. Do not ever take cables from the floppy drive since you will need this for the data transfer.
These images show the typical cables that connect to the new hard drive. Note that there are often extra power leads floating free within the case. (See Tips below on other cables).

, Ideally, use the packing that came with the drive to protect and insulate it. Otherwise, make sure that there is a soft insulating item, e.g., a magazine or plastic sheet under the drive to keep it clear of the circuitry and the metal of the case. Close the case.

, At this stage it will become clear if any obvious cabling errors have occurred; if this is the case there will be errors shown, or a failure to start properly. Do not expect both drives to show up in Explorer or in other file lists at this stage. If there are obvious errors or strange messages, recheck the cabling task until the PC can open normally. Remember to work in the case with the power off.

, The 'exe' file will make a new boot floppy disk that will do all of the data transfer work.(If you have downloaded ISO file then burn it on a CD).

, After an appropriate time the program will advise that the copying between the discs is complete.

, Remove the cables from the back of the old drive and use them for the new drive, remembering to switch off first. Change the cross-connects to make the new drive the master. Close the case again, make sure the floppy is not still in the slot, and start the PC. The PC will open, using the new drive.

, Make permanent any parts undone for testing. If the sizes of the drives differ, it might be found best to keep the smaller of the two drives as the backup, since it will transfer more quickly when it is needed.

Decide about RAID level.,
Think about a RAID controller.,
Think about the rest of the PC.,
Think about a case.,
Build!,
Install an OS and software.",How to Build a Fileserver," Do you have to server hundreds of movies to multiple independent PCs throughout a house, or do you just need a convenient place to put your music to play on your HTPC? The use of a home fileserver will strongly guide the next steps.;
, How much do you need? This is also tied closely to the last question. If all you have is a couple HD movies (or many DVD-quality movies) and a bit of music, you could probably get away with a single 500 GB drive. For many HD movies, a large music collection, and lots of family photos, a larger hard drive or an array of many hard drives may be better suited.

, If you decided you need a lot of space in the previous step, a RAID array might be what is needed.

, RAID 1 mirrors the content in all disks, offering the most reliability with capacity of the single disk only. For less paranoid, RAID 6 tolerates as much as two disk failures without data loss. RAID 5 gives the most capacity (just one disk less than total number of disks). RAID 10 provides the most performance, offering half of the capacity. Finally, RAID 0 is fastest but loses data in all disks after any single disk fails, so is generally not a good choice if you have no other backup source. Not all levels are possible with any number of disks - usually the more disks, the more choices you have. There are also more levels - read up on the standard RAID levels on a web.

, Hardware controllers are fast, reliable, easy to install and offer wider choice of possible RAID configurations. However they are not cheap and if your motherboard has enough hard drive ports you can also try software RAID without controller. It will outperform the cheapest hardware RAID cards. However you need to search the web for setup instructions and likely use Linux. You may also save money by using software RAID with non-RAID controller that usually will be bundled with all required software.

, A fileserver tends to require little power, so a budget CPU + motherboard is usually sufficient. Ensure it has a slot (usually PCI-Express) for the RAID card if applicable. 1-2GB of RAM is often enough, unless the server will also be running applications. Gigabit Ethernet allows for future expansion and high speeds when loading content from the server. A power supply needs to provide enough power for all your hard drives. The 3.5' drives vary in power consumption from 7W till as many as 25W so search the web for the precise model you have.

, Will this server be in a rack, or just in a desktop case? The rack enclosure is optimized to stack many servers on a shared rack (it is low, flat and wide). Such rack can be bought but for a single server may not make sense. However if you plan to place your server to some server centre, the ""desktop shape"" server will be at least way more expensive to house, if accepted at all.

, Airflow is especially important in servers, as hot spots can easily develop when many hard drives are running continuously. Ensure there are enough fans, that they blow the air in a straight path from front to back, and that they all work. A dead fan can cause a lot of headaches later! Don't skimp here.

, Linux is usually a solid choice. Any Linux server distro should work fine and get you up and running quickly. Alternatively, Windows Server OSes are very configurable, but require significantly more power and resources. Finally, Windows Home Server is a new kid on the block, but it has many powerful features. With WHS, you don't need a RAID card or any sort of controller to create a large array, but be aware if the OS dies, so does all your data with it.

, Sometimes other stores will have a storage unit with the same amount of storage space but at a cheaper price. So consider looking through other stores will help you determine which is more cheaper.

, Sometimes the store will have special deals during those type of times.

, When an external hard drive with a new large capacity comes out, don't immediately buy it. Wait for a year or so if you can because the longer you wait, there is gonna be a price slash for it and you could get the HD capacity that you desired for a cheaper price.

Print the tickets.,
Store the tickets carefully after printing.",How to Print Tickets," Before purchasing and printing tickets, you'll need to decide what event to attend or what type of travel to book. After making your decision, note all the relevant details of the engagement, including the date, time, location, and price.
, Most major event venues, from concert halls to sporting arenas, handle their ticket sales through a third-party vendor. In addition, vendors exist that allow ticket holders to sell and swap tickets online. Search for your chosen event on major ticketing sites such as Ticketmaster and StubHub.

On websites such as StubHub that allow current ticket holders to sell their tickets, you may or may not be able to print tickets at home after purchasing them. This will depend on whether the seller holds hard copies of the tickets or a download link.
Travel tickets can often be booked through the transit authorities or airlines themselves, but they can also be booked through travel websites like Orbitz and Expedia. Either way, you will generally be able to print your tickets directly.

, When you are ready to purchase your tickets, you will generally be given several options for how you want to receive your tickets.

Common options for receiving your tickets include will call, postal delivery, and direct downloading. Depending on the website from which you are purchasing, some of these options may not be available.
To be able to print tickets at homes, you must choose the option to download your tickets directly. They will usually be presented in either PDF or HTML format.

, Usually, you will be given an option to receive digital copies of your tickets shortly after your payment is processed.

In the case of PDF tickets, you will be presented with a download request shortly after purchase. Choose the location on your computer in which to save the file, and then confirm the download.
More often, however, you will be given a link to a web page containing an image of your tickets. After following the link, make sure to bookmark or otherwise save the web page for your reference.

, You will need to print the file containing your ticket images so that you can bring them to the event for entry.

Begin by opening the web page or PDF containing the image of your tickets. Click on ""File"" in your application's tool bar and then click on ""Print."" You will be prompted to print the page.
It is best to choose the option for no resizing, as this will prevent the barcode on the tickets from become shrunk and difficult to scan.

, Once you have printed the tickets, keep them carefully stored until the day of the event or travel.

When folding the paper on which the tickets are printed, be careful not to fold over the barcode, as this may make it difficult to scan.
You will not need to cut the paper down to size. Most event venues employ handheld scanners, so as long as the barcode is clear and intact, the ticket can be used regardless of paper size.

",How to Print Pictures in Black and White," While you can open any picture and quickly print it in black and white, you may want to use image editing software to convert it first. This will result in much better detail and shading, and will lead to more artistic photos. It may take a while to convert your first image, but once you get used to the process it will go much quicker.


If you don't want to convert the image and just want to print it in black and white, click here.;
, In order to do this, you'll need an advanced image editing program. The most popular option is Photoshop, which costs an arm and a leg. You can also use GIMP, which is a free, open-source image editing program. It offers many of the same features as Photoshop, but is known for being a little less user-friendly.


You can download GIMP from gimp.org/downloads/


, You can use your image editing program to open image files in almost any format.

, This tool allows you to adjust the color levels of your image.Photoshop - Click ""Layer"" → ""New Adjustment Layer"" → ""Channel Mixer"". This will create a new channel mixer layer and open the Channel Mixer tool.
GIMP - Click ""Colors"" → ""Components"" → ""Channel Mixer"". This will open the Channel Mixer tool.

, Both Photoshop and GIMP include a preset for converting the image to black and white.Photoshop - Click the ""Presets"" menu in the Channel Mixer and select ""Black & White"".
GIMP - Check the ""Monochrome"" box in the Channel Mixer.

, Once you've applied the black and white preset, you can use the sliders to make fine adjustments to the shading. There are three sliders: Red, Blue, and Green. Adjusting these sliders changes the strength of the original colors. For example, putting the Red slider at 100 and the other two at 0 will make the red parts of the image much lighter and the blue and green parts much darker.


Keep the total value of all three sliders at exactly 100 to preserve the exposure of the original image. Values above this will result in a much brighter image, and values below will be darker.

, Once you are satisfied with the changes, save your new image. Make sure that you give it a new name so that you don't overwrite the original image.

, You can open the image in any image editor or preview program.

, You can usually find this in the file menu or toolbar, or you can press ⌘ Cmd/Ctrl+P.

, For most programs, you'll need to open the Printer Properties or Preferences window in order to select black and white or grayscale. The options you get when printing vary from printer to printer and in different programs. For example, in the Windows Photo Viewer program, you'll need to click the ""Options"" link in the Print window, and then the ""Printer properties"" link.


This is not necessary if you've already converted your image into black and white using the method outlined above.

, Some printers support photo paper that can make your printed picture look like an actual developed photo. The method for inserting this paper varies depending on your printer, so refer to your printer's documentation and indicators on the printer itself.


The method for selecting the proper paper size depends on what program you are using to print. In the Windows Photo Viewer, for example, you can use the ""Paper size"" drop-down menu to select the size of the paper you inserted in your printer.

, If your photo is color, make sure you've selected the black and white or grayscale option. If you've already converted your image, you can just print it. Photos take a lot longer to print than text, but black and white photos are a little faster.

Each mail folder appears twice - once with extension .msf and once without an extension. Select the item without an extension.

, All the archived mail you import will go straight into your Inbox. Once it does, you will want to select it and archive it as necessary, which will be much simpler to do without having to sort through other messages in the Inbox at the same time. (Alternatively, you can tag all current emails with a tag so they can be easily located in the archives and returned to the Inbox later.)

, There are two options for mBox files. If you try with the More Strict option and GML finds 0 messages in your file, change to the Less Strict mBox option on and try again.

, Messages imported from your Sent Items folder can be sent to the Sent Items folder in GMail. However, they will also appear in your Inbox, where you will then want to delete them. (All other messages will be sent to the Inbox, and from there you can select them and archive them.)

,, The program defaults with a Google SMTP server, but it may not work for everyone. If it doesn’t work for you, see instructions on the Google Gmail Loader site.

,,, As your messages are being imported, they can be archived from the Inbox (or deleted from the Inbox if they are already present in Sent Items).

, Click Archive. This will archive all the selected messages. Repeat until all desired messages have been archived.

Identify the difference between spam and legitimate advertising emails.,
Block an address that is repeatedly spamming your inbox.,
Unsubscribe from legitimate marketing email messages.,
Mark messages in your inbox as spam.,
Report spam messages to anti-spam services.,
Create filters for common spam terms.,
Never click any spam links.,
Never download attachments from unknown emails.,
Never post your email address in a public place.,
Use a disposable email address.,
Make your email address unscannable if you want to post it.,
Avoid Yahoo!,
Only register for accounts on trusted sites.",How to Block Spam on Yahoo! Mail," Not all email advertisements are spam. If you've signed up for a newsletter, or left a box checked when creating an account that signs you up for special offer emails, these messages are legitimate advertisements and can be dealt with quite easily.Most legitimate advertising emails will clearly state the company that is sending it, as well as provide methods for unsubscribing at the bottom of the email. These messages should not be reported as spam.
Spam messages rarely state the company that is sending them, and are often littered with outlandish claims and bad spelling. Many spam messages claim to offer ""free trials"", ""samples"", or a prize to a contest you didn't enter.;
, If you are repeatedly receiving messages from an address that is bypassing Yahoo!'s spam filter, you can permanently block it. Note that in order to block addresses, you'll need to log into the Yahoo! Mail web interface on a computer; you can't block addresses from your mobile device's Mail app, for example.


Hover over the Gear button in the upper-right corner.
Select ""Settings"" and select the ""Blocked Addresses"" tab.
Type the address in and click ""Block"".
Repeat for any other addresses you want to block.

, Most of the marketing and junk email that fills up your inbox are actually perfectly safe marketing messages. You can unsubscribe from these messages by following the ""Unsubscribe"" or ""Email preferences"" link at the bottom of the message.


Unsubscribing from a mailing list may take a week or two to take effect.
Don't follow ""Unsubscribe"" links on messages that are clearly spam and not legitimate marketing messages. This will tell the spambot that it's found a legitimate email address, and you'll receive even more spam.

, Yahoo! does a pretty good job of automatically sorting unsolicited spam messages into the Spam folder, where messages will be automatically deleted after one week. If you do find a spam message in your inbox, you can quickly move it to the Spam by checking the box next to the message and then clicking the ""Spam"" button at the top of the inbox.


This will register the sender as a spam sender, and future messages will be sent directly to the Spam folder.
Make sure to report only unsolicited bulk email messages. Reporting legitimate business messages can prevent you from receiving important messages from them.

, If you want to be more proactive in the fight against spam, you can report spam messages that you receive to anti-spam services. These services work to shut down the connections that spammers have to the internet.


SpamCop (spamcop.net is one of the most prolific anti-spam organizations, and you can join and report your unsolicited, bulk spam messages.
If you are in the US, you can report spam messages to the FTC by forwarding them to spam@uce.gov.

, If you are finding a lot of random spam coming into your inbox, you can use filters to try to automatically send it to your spam folder. You can only create filters from the Yahoo! Mail web interface.


Look for common terms in your spam messages that don't appear in your regular emails, such as ""enhancement"", ""supplement"", ""clinical trial"", etc.
Hover over the Gear button and select ""Settings"".
Click the ""Filters"" tab.
Click the ""Add"" button to create a new filter.
Use the rules to create a filter that catches your common terms.
Select ""Spam"" from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the window and save the filter. For more details on creating Yahoo! Mail filters, click here.

, The entire point of a spam message is to try to get you to click the link that it contains. These links are nearly always malicious in some way, so avoid clicking them at all costs, even if the offer sounds perfect.

, This goes for more than just spam, but spam is definitely one of the main offenders. Email attachments are one of the most insecure things on the internet, and should only be downloaded when you completely trust the sender.

, While it's usually OK to use your email address to register for a site or account, you'll want to avoid posting it in forums or putting it in plain text on your website. Spambots scour pages looking for email addresses to add to their mailing lists, and when you post your email address you're making it much easier to be on the receiving end.Make sure all of your various accounts online are set to hide your email address from the public.

, Yahoo! Mail allows you to create disposable email addresses that you can use to sign up for services that you don't want to share your regular address with.


Hover over the Gear button in the upper-right corner.
Select ""Settings"" and select the ""Security"" tab.
Click the ""Create base name"" button and enter in the first part of your disposable email. Don't include any personal information.
Click the ""Add"" button and create the email address. You will need to enter the keyword that determines the specific address, and you can choose where you want the mail to be delivered to. You can now use the new email address to register for services. If you start receiving too much spam from it, you can simply delete the email address.

, If you want people to be able to contact you at your Yahoo! email address, obfuscating your address can help prevent it from being picked up by spambots.


For example, if your email address is ""example@yahoo.com"", you could write it out as ""exampleyahoocom""

, chat. Yahoo! chat is an easy way for spammers to figure out email addresses, since they just have to take all the usernames in a chatroom and add ""@yahoo.com"" to the end of each one. Try to use alternate chat services if you must chat online and want to protect your Yahoo! account.

, Always review the privacy policy when creating an account to ensure that your address will not be sold to advertisers. Avoid signing up for anything that sounds too good to be true.

Understand the basics of torrents.,
Download a BitTorrent client.,
Install the client.,
Find a tracker site.,
Search for the file you want.,
Determine which file you should download.,
Ensure that you can run the content.,
Be careful when choosing a file.,
Download the torrent.,
Open the torrent file.,
Wait for the download to begin.,
Keep sharing after your file has finished.,
Set an upload limit.,
Seed for private trackers.,
Open your torrent client.,
Create the torrent file.,
Add your files.,
Add trackers.,
Start seeding.",How to Use Torrents," Torrent files allow you to download virtually any type of file from everyone else that is sharing it. Torrents allow files to be split into many small chunks. These chunks are then downloaded from other users who already have that chunk on their computer. Once all of the pieces are downloaded, the file is reconstructed and is ready to use on your computer.When you are downloading torrent content you are a ""leecher"". When you are sharing content, you are a ""seeder"". This terminology will be used more later.
Read up on copyright law. A lot of what is shared using Torrents is done so illegally. Do not be one of these people. Only share and download material that you have the legal right to share.;
, A BitTorrent client manages your torrent downloads and seeding. It is required in order to download a torrent. Make sure you download your torrent client from a reliable source. There are dozens of clients available, but some popular choices are BitTorrent, uTorrent, and Vuze.

, Be very careful during the installation of your torrent client. Many clients come bundled with adware and browser hijackers that need to be manually deselected during the installation process.

, Torrent trackers are listings of torrent files. The trackers don't actually host any content on their servers, but simply act as a repository for torrent files. Trackers exist in two varieties: public and private.


Public trackers are open to anyone, and can be easily found with a quick Google search. They do not require registration, and have no sharing requirements. Public trackers are often littered with advertisements. Because of their public nature, many torrents are tracked by copyright holders, and downloading them can result in action from your internet service provider.
Private trackers are usually invite-only, and cannot typically be found through Google searches. You will be required to sign up for an account, and your file sharing ratio is often monitored to make sure you are seeding at least as much as you are leeching.

, Use the search function on the torrent tracker to find the file that you want to download. The tracker will return a list of results based on your search. There will likely be several results to choose from, especially if the file is a popular one.


Use popular shorthand for finding the file you want. For example: if you need the fifth episode from the fourth season of a show, search for ""<show name> s04e05"".
Many public trackers will list advertisements at the top of your search results designed to look like legitimate search results.

, When there are multiple results for the file you want, you'll need to determine which one to choose. There are a couple factors to consider when choosing a result.


Quality - If you are downloading a video, the encoding process will result in differing quality between files. In general, larger files will be higher quality than smaller ones. Check the Comments on the torrent to ensure that the quality of the file is good. Many torrents allow users to rate them, which can help with your decision.
Number of seeders - The more seeders a file has, the quicker you will be able to download it. This is because there will be more people to connect to when you are downloading the chunks of the file. If there are significantly more leechers than seeders, you may be waiting a while for the file to finish. Most trackers list the number of seeders and the number of leechers next to each search result. Most trackers will allow you to sort by the number of seeders.

, This is especially important for video files, as they are often encoded with file formats that are not supported by Windows Media Player or QuickTime. To ensure that you can watch any video you download, install a specialized video player such as VLC Player or Media Player Classic.


Oftentimes torrent files come in ISO format. These are rips of discs, and need to be burned or mounted in a virtual drive in order to run them.

, Torrents are a popular way to transmit viruses and other infected files. If a file has a lot of seeders, the file is much more likely to be safe. Likewise, the Comments section will often clue you in to bad torrents.

, Once you've found the torrent file you want, click the download link on the tracker to download the torrent to your computer. The actual torrent file is very small, and should only take a second to download. Remember, the torrent file itself doesn't contain any content, it only serves as a way to connect to other people sharing the file.

, Most torrent files will configure Windows to automatically start your torrent client when a torrent file is opened. If not, open your torrent client and then use the client to open the file.


If you didn't configure a download location when you installed your client, you will be asked where you want to save the file when the torrent is loaded.
If you don't have enough free space for the file you want to download, you will not be able to start the download process.

, After a few moments, your torrent client will begin connecting to seeders. You will see your download speed increase in the status bar for your download, and the progress bar will start creeping towards 100%.You can download multiple torrents at the same time, though your overall maximum download speed will be split between all active transfers.

, Torrents rely on the community sharing files. Torrent files will die if there are no seeders that have the entire file. Every torrent user should do their part and share files after they have finished downloading.


Most internet service plans have slower upload speeds than download speeds. This means that in order to maintain a 1:1 ratio of leech to seed, you may need to keep your Torrent tracker open longer than just the time needed to download. A good way to do this is to leave your Torrent client running in the background.
Note: If you move or delete the files, you will lose the ability to seed.

, Many torrent clients allow you to set a limit that the torrent will seed to. This option is typically found in the Preferences menu of your client, under the Queueing section.


Set a minimum ratio. This will be the minimum that your torrents will seed to after the download has been finished. Try to set it to at least 100%. This means that if you downloaded a 300MB file, you would seed until you reached 300MB sent.
If you want seeding to stop after the ratio has been met, set the speed limit to 0.

, Private trackers often have strict seeding requirements. Oftentimes they require that you seed at least 100% of what you share, usually more. If you don't maintain this ratio, your account will be banned and you will lose access to the tracker., Besides downloading torrent files, your torrent client can also create torrent files. Torrents are a great way to share files with friends, family, or your enthusiast community. Be very careful when sharing copyright material, as the creator of the torrent is much more likely to be prosecuted than the people that download it.

, While the process varies slightly depending on the client, you can generally click File and select ""Create New Torrent"" or something similar. This will open the torrent creation tool.

, Torrents can contain one or many files. Use the ""Add File"" and ""Add Directory"" buttons to browse your computer for files that you want to add to the torrent. You can share virtually any type of file with a torrent.

, In the Torrent Properties section, you can find the ""Trackers"" field. Enter in tracker addresses to share your torrent on multiple trackers. Most torrent clients will automatically include the most popular trackers, but if you are using a private tracker you will need to add it manually.

, Click the Create button and your torrent will begin seeding. Make sure that you keep seeding until a good number of other seeders have grabbed the file. If you stop seeding before anyone is able to finish downloading, your torrent will die.

If you need an installer for a different operating system, click the ""Other Platforms + Betas"" link underneath the ""Get BitTorrent"" button.;
, You will be asked to choose between the free version or BitTorrent Plus. Most users will not need the plus version, as you can download and open as many torrents as you want with the free version.


Only download the BitTorrent client from the BitTorrent website. There are other torrent clients available, but the one called BitTorrent should only be downloaded from the developers.

, If you want BitTorrent to be the default program when you open a torrent, ensure that BitTorrent is associated with .torrent (.tor) files as well as Magnet URIs. You can make sure these boxes are checked during the installation process. Failing to set this option will result in the web browser downloading the small torrent file only. If the BitTorrent program is associated with .tor files, it will automatically detect the browser downloading the .tor file. The BitTorrent program will open it, locate the actual file, program, video, etc. that you're trying to get and download it seamlessly.


BitTorrent will attempt to give you free music along with some adware during the installation process. Make sure that these are disabled before continuing with the installation (unless you want them).

, When you run BitTorrent for the first time, you will most likely be asked if you want to allow the program access. If you intend to download any torrents, BitTorrent needs to be able to bypass the firewall. If you don't see a message to allow it automatically, see this guide for instructions on doing it manually.

, Once BitTorrent is installed, open it up so you can set a few preferences before you get started. In the main window, click Options → Preferences. There are several options you should check before downloading torrents:


Click the Directories option. This page will allow you to set where new downloads will be placed. You can also have downloads move to a different folder after the download is finished.
Click the Bandwidth option. You will be able to set the maximum limits for uploading and downloading, which is useful if you have a data cap. Setting these to ""0"" will make transfers happen at the maximum speed your connection allows.
Click the Queuing option. You can set how many different torrent files can upload and download at once. This setting can help you focus on one download at a time, or download many files at once. You can also set your seeding goals, which dictates how long the file is shared for.

, There are a variety of websites that list torrents. Some are more reliable than others. There are two main types of torrent trackers: public trackers and private trackers.


Public trackers are available to anyone. These are the sites you will find when doing a web search for torrent trackers. Because of their public nature, many torrents are tracked by copyright holders, and downloading copyright protected files, commercial software, etc. can result in action from your internet service provider.
Private trackers require invites. These sites are not accessible until you have been invited by another member. They often have requirements such as payment for access, maintaining a ratio of downloaded to uploaded data / titles, etc.. Private trackers are much less likely to result in cease and desist letters from copyright holders.

, Most public trackers have every new show, movie, album, and game available, as well as popular old files.


Use popular shorthand for finding the file you want. For example: if you want the third episode from the fifth season of ""Law and Order"" in an HD format, search for: ""Law and Order s05e03 720p"" or ""Law and Order s05e03 1080p"".

, The speed at which you can download a torrent file is determined by several variables. A torrent with a largest number of seeders is one such desirable variable and having a low number of leechers is the other. The two interact together to affect how quickly a torrent can be downloaded. The other variables are not controlled by you really - as they consist of the connection speed that you have and the connection speed the seeders have.


Most torrent sites allow you to sort search results by the number of seeders. Look for files with a large number of seeders. Not only will you download it faster, but it is less likely that the file is fake or infected with a virus.
The number of leechers will affect your download speed as well. A leecher is a user that is downloading, but is not currently seeding. A leecher becomes a seeder when the full file has been downloaded. If there are significantly more leechers than seeders, the amount of bandwidth you receive will be lower, resulting in slower downloads.

, This is especially important when downloading video. Oftentimes, releases are available in a variety of file sizes. The difference in size is caused by the way the video and audio has been encoded. In general, the larger the file the better the quality. Look for qualified torrent providers. Some sites provide additional tags / icons next to the name of the person providing the torrent. Click them to learn the definitions.


On the flipside, downloading a larger file can take significantly longer depending on your connection.
Read as many comments as possible to determine if other users feel that the quality of the file is good and worth your time. Some trackers have a rating system which allows users to vote on if the file is good or not.

, Magnet links are not an actual file and are instead a small snippet of text. This unique snippet will allow the torrent to match the content and download the correct files. Magnet files take one step out of the torrent process and reduce the risk of downloading a corrupted torrent file., If you set BitTorrent to be associated with .torrent files, it should start automatically when you open the file. Your download will begin as soon as you are connected to your first seeder.


It can take some time to connect to seeders, especially if you have a poor connection or are downloading a weak torrent.
You can monitor your downloads in the main window of BitTorrent. Each file will have a progress bar next to it.

, Torrents can be used to transfer any file type, and many of the most popular movie formats are not supported by Windows Media Player or QuickTime. You will need a video player that supports a wide variety of codecs and formats.



VLC Player is a free, open-source media player that can play virtually any media file that you download. It is highly recommended if you are downloading lots of different video files.
ISO files are disc images, and either need to be burned or mounted in a virtual drive in order to run them. These can be direct copies of discs or packages of folders.
If you want to play the media file on another device, you may need to convert it into a format that will work on that device.

, Because torrents are rarely legal, there is no oversight as to the kinds of files that are made available. This means that hackers will embed viruses in torrents that they hope to spread to other users. These are often included in popular searches in order to get as many victims as possible.


Scan every file that you download for viruses.
Try to download files that have been released by trusted sources in the community.
Always check comments and ratings to see if anyone else experienced virus attacks with the torrent.

, Once you finish downloading the content of a torrent file, you become a seeder. This means that you are uploading data to other clients connected to the tracker.


Seeding is what keeps a torrent community alive. Without seeders, no one can download the files.

, If you are using a private community, you will most likely be expected to maintain a positive ratio with the community. This means that you will need to upload at least as much as you download.

, Most internet service plans have slower upload speeds than download speeds. This means that uploading to maintain your ratio can take significantly longer than downloading the equivalent amount. Leave your torrent program running in the background while you go about your daily tasks, and you'll see your upload totals skyrocket.


Running a torrent client in the background should not have a large effect on web browsing or word processing. More intensive applications such as streaming video and playing games may benefit from exiting the torrent application first.

, BitTorrent allows you to share a torrent until you reach a predetermined ratio. In the Queuing section of the Preferences menu, you can set what you'd like your ratio limit to be. If you are using a private tracker, this should be set to at least 200%. This means that a torrent which is 300 MB large will be shared until you've uploaded 600 MB.

, In short, they require another program that will allow this. Applications and other non-media types are often compressed to a .zip, .rar, .001, .002, etc. file type and many movies are in ""containers"" such as .mkz, .qt, etc. that may require a particular codec to be installed if your installed media player refuses to play them. Fortunately, the most popular codec packs are often bundled together and installed easily - as is the case for K-Lite (www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm). WinRAR can handle both .zip, .rar, .001, .002, .etc.

, You can minimize damage from malicious downloaded software to your installed software if you create this directory on a different partition or hard drive that does not contain important information or data. Run any program needed to open the file to reveal / extract the contents. Carefully check the files extracted for those that appear suspicious (movie files, MP3s, and similar do not need .exe or .com files and these may contain a virus).

, Do not skip this step! Evaluate the results to determine if you should proceed or not.

, Once you have extracted the contents of a file to reveal individual files of a program, video, etc. that are in an expected, recognizable format (.avi, .mp3, .mkz, .exe, .com etc.) you can open with a media player or run / install the application.

Power down the computer.,
Remove the case panels.,
Ensure that you do not have any static electricity.,
Make sure you are grounded.,
Remove the old drive (if applicable).,
Insert your new drive.,
Secure the hard drive.,
Connect a SATA hard drive to the motherboard.,
Connect a PATA (IDE) hard drive to the motherboard.,
Connect the power supply to the hard drive.,
Close up your computer.,
Finish the installation.",How to Install a Hard Drive1," Shut off the power supply in the back. Even if you can access the inside where it stands, you need to unplug the computer. Otherwise, unplug the computer and place it somewhere that allows you to get inside.;
, You may need a Phillips head screwdriver, but most newer computers have thumbscrews. You will need to remove both sides so that you can screw the hard drive in on both sides.








, Touch a metal object (other than your computer), such as a doorknob, to discharge any existing static electricity that you may have.

, If your computer is still plugged in (but the power supply is switched off), you can ground yourself by touching any metal part of the case. Otherwise, make sure that you are grounded before starting to work on the inside of the computer. This will prevent electrostatic shock from damaging the components of your computer.








, If you are removing an old hard drive, make sure all of the cables are disconnected from both the motherboard and the power supply. Unscrew all the screws on both sides of the hard drive, and then slide it out of the housing.









You may need to remove more cables or cards in order to access the hard drives in a tight case.

, Remove it from the antistatic packaging and slide it into an open space in the hard drive housing. The drive should slide directly in, and the holes on the side of the drive should line up to the screw guides on the housing.









If you can, use a slot that has some space around it. This will improve airflow and lead to a cooler system, but is not a critical concern.

, Once the hard drive has been inserted, use the screws that came with it to secure the hard drive in the housing. Ideally you should use two screws on each side of the hard drive. If the hard drive is loose, it can rattle and cause more noise and lead to physical damage.









Tighten the screws to a firm tightness, but don’t overtighten as that may cause damage as well.

, Newer hard drives will use SATA cables, which are thin and resemble USB cables. Use a SATA cable to connect the hard drive to the motherboard. SATA cables can be connected in either direction.


If you are connecting your primary hard drive, the SATA cable should be plugged into the first SATA channel. This may be labeled SATA0 or SATA1. Refer to your motherboard documentation for detailed information for your motherboard.
Secondary drives should be connected to the next available SATA channel.

, IDE drives are older model hard drives that can be identified by the long rows of pins on the back. IDE Drives are connected via an IDE cable, which is wide and flat. The cable is usually gray in color.









The blue end of the cable plugs into the motherboard. The black connector plugs into your primary (Master) drive, while the black connector plugs into the secondary (Slave) drive if applicable.
Set the jumper for your primary drive to Master. The jumper diagram should be printed onto the hard drive. If you are installing a secondary drive but it is the only drive connected to the cable, it should be set to Master as well.

, Most newer power supplies have SATA power connectors, though older power supplies typically only have Molex (4 pin) connectors. If this is the case, and you are installing a SATA drive, you will need a Molex-to-SATA adapter. IDE drives will use the Molex connector.









Make sure that all of your connections are secure. Ensure that none of the cables can come undone by wiggling them a little bit.

, Replace the case sides and reconnect your cables if you had to move the case to work on the inside. Turn the power supply back on and then turn your computer on.







, Once you’ve got everything connected and the computer turned back on, you’ll need to finish the installation of the hard drive from your computer. If you are replacing your primary drive, you’ll have to reinstall your operating system. If you are adding a new drive, you'll need to format the drive before you can use it.


To reinstall Windows, follow the guide that matches your operating system:

Windows XP
Windows Vista
Windows 7
Windows 8


To reinstall OS X, follow the guide that matches your operating system:

Leopard
Snow Leopard
Mountain Lion


To format your hard drive, follow this guide for all systems.

Read this entire article (including all Tips and Warnings) before beginning.,
Decide from which drive the PC will boot.

,
Determine IDE controller interface type.,
Locate or create the hard drive “set up” or “installation” diskette or CD (see the Tips section below for clickable links).,
Insert the setup disk into the corresponding drive in the PC that will have the new hard drive.

,
Locate or download documentation for the PC's hard drives.,
Log out and shut power off.

,
Determine and change (if needed) the existing boot order (disconnection and removal of existing drives from the case might be required to view and change jumpers) with one of the methods below:
Parallel IDE drives (called PATA, IDE or PIDE) are set by jumpers on the drive and position of connection on IDE cables.,
Connect both the data cable (PATA or SATA) and the power cable to each drive.,
Reinstall the drives with only enough screws to support the drives, as they might have to be removed again to change settings, etc.,
Access the PC’s BIOS.,
Confirm and change (if needed) the boot order to allow the PC to boot from the drive that contains the media in the previous step.

,
Save and exit the BIOS set up page.,
Follow the process to install or verify the installation.,
Locate the “drive-to-drive copy” option.,
Checkout and return BIOS settings to original.,
Secure all drives in the PC case.",How to Copy Contents of One Hard Drive to a New Hard Drive,";
,, Several types are made (SCSI, IDE, etc.). This article will discuss two of the most common types: parallel (PATA) and serial (SATA) IDE types.

, Download the latest version of this software from the hard drive manufacturer’s website if the software was not included with the drive. Create media for use on a drive supported by the PC if downloaded from a website. A diskette image will not work if there is no diskette drive installed in the PC.

,, If a CD-ROM disk (or CD image download) version of the manufacturer’s hard drive setup program has been loaded in the PC drive, the information is likely included on the disk. Diskette versions will not likely have this information due to space limitations. Print the drive information along with this wiki for referral later, when the PC is off. This information may be needed to correctly set jumpers if not printed on the hard drive label. Indicate the make and model of the existing and new drive on the print out.

,, Choose from the types described below:






Master / Slave (M/S): Set the jumper on the drive to MASTER if it is to be the boot drive and set the jumper on the drive to SLAVE for the non-boot drive. Be sure to check BOTH drives’ documentation for correct jumper positions. All IDE drives offer M/S selection. One drive must be set to master and the other drive must be set to slave when connected with a single IDE cable to the motherboard (or IDE controller board), or:






Cable Select (CS): Set the jumper on BOTH drives to Cable Select (CS) and plug the connector at the end of the cable into the boot drive and the connector in the middle of the cable to the non-boot drive. Not every IDE drive offers a CS choice. If two drives are on an IDE cable, both must be set using the same method (M/S or CS). Do not connect a drive identified with an M/S jumper with another drive identified with a jumper set to CS on the same IDE cable. Regardless of Master/Slave or Cable Select identification method, the remaining end of the cable must be connected to the lowest numbered IDE connection on the motherboard (or IDE controller board). Consult the motherboard (or IDE controller board) manual if the designation is not printed on the board itself. Typically, the ports are labeled IDE0 and IDE1. IDE0 is the lowest port number and should be used.







SATA drives do not have jumpers to indicate master or slave. Drive identification is done by connecting the boot drive to the lowest numbered SATA connection on the motherboard (or SATA controller board). Since the SATA interface cable has only one connector on each end, drive identification jumpers are not needed, but determined by the number assigned to the SATA port to which it is connected. One end of the SATA cable connects to the drive and the other to the motherboard (or SATA controller board). The boot drive should be connected to the connection point labeled SATA0 (or the lowest numbered SATA port on your motherboard), and the non-boot drive connected to the next higher available SATA number point.







, A drive without both connections will not be identified or available for use.

, The drive installation will be finalized later, when the process is complete.

, Verify that the PC has successfully recognized all drives. Take corrective action should the PC have issues recognizing any drive. The drive documentation will assist solving these problems. It is very important to note the sizes of the drives, as later, in the installation and copy process, the drives will not have the familiar names like C or D. Knowing the drive that has data and the drive that is empty will be crucial to copy data correctly.

,, The PC will begin the boot process from the new “set up” or “install” media.

, The screen should show the information about all the drives connected. Compare the data on the screen to what was written on the print out earlier. Make sure the information matches. This is when knowing how to identify the source (the drive with data to be copied from) and destination (the drive to receive the data) will be required. If unsure about source and destination drives, STOP. If the wrong choices are made, the wrong data will overwrite the “good data”, rendering the information lost. If satisfied with the identification of the drives, continue the setup of the new drive.

, Copy the source drive to the destination drive. The time needed to complete the copy process depends on the amount of data stored on the source drive. The destination drive must be larger than the source drive.

, Upon completion, remove the media from the drive (if not already done), and reboot as normal. Interrupt the boot process to access the BIOS setting page as before. Return settings (boot device order in particular) to original settings, then save and exit. The PC should boot (from the new drive if set as the first boot device). Check the contents of both drives after booting into Windows (or other OS). Once satisfied, the original disk may be erased, formatted or even removed (after shutting down the PC). If removing, the drive can be saved with contents intact for disaster recovery or erased and installed in a portable case for use as an external drive.

, Route cables so that they will disrupt air flow the least, and replace covers on the PC case.

Check if you need the IDE (parallel ATA) or Serial ATA.,
Make sure you have room for an extra hard drive, here's one way to do this:


Restart your computer and go into the BIOS menu.,
Find the area where all the flat ribbon cables (or SATA cables, which are smaller and usually red) connect to the main board.,
Get the actual hard drive.,
Shut down your computer.

,
Unplug all of the cords from the back of your computer and pull the computer out from the desk.

,
Remove the case screws.,
Find the area where all the flat ribbon cables (or SATA cables, which are smaller and usually red) connect to the main board.(fig.,
Set the jumpers so the drive knows whether to act as a master or slave (IDE only).,
Find the empty bay in your computer case.,
Connect the cable that you found in step 6 to the hard drive.,
Connect a Molex power cable, (a smaller connector with red, yellow, and black wires.)(fig.,
Put the side panel back on the computer and put the screws back in.

,
Plug all of the cables back into the rear of the computer, and connect them to their power sources if you unplugged them.

,
Boot up the computer.",How to Add an Extra Hard Drive," While older computers support IDE (Parallel ATA), new ones may only support Serial ATA. If you are not sure, open the computer case and try to determine the type of the used drives from the view. It is safer to use the same type that is already installed, even if the sockets for another type also appear to be present.


IDE drives use a wide, flat ribbon cable and may have jumpers that need to be set.
SATA drives have a thinner cable and no jumpers to worry about.;
,
Go to the ""Standard CMOS Settings Or IDE Config.""
In this menu, you will find four settings labeled as follows: PRIMARY MASTER:, AUTO/PRIMARY SLAVE:, SECONDARY MASTER:, SECONDARY SLAVE:. Change all fields to auto detection.
Reboot your computer

, (fig. 3) Find the cable that corresponds to the free drive that was detected in step 1-6, either primary or secondary., Go to your local computer store or buy online from Newegg or another retailer. Make sure that the type (SATA or IDE (PATA)) matches. If you plan on replacing your existing hard drive (see warning on replacing drives), be sure to get one with enough space to compensate for what you're losing.

,,, If you have a Dell, you only need to push down on the release latch(es) on the back or sides. If you're having difficulty, it's a good idea to consult your manual on how your particular case is removed. Put the screws in a safe place so you don't lose them. Remove the side panel and place it out of the way.

, 3) Find the cable that corresponds to the free drive that was detected in step 1-6, either primary or secondary.

, The jumpers are the set of pins on the back of the hard drive. They'll have a couple of rubber or plastic blocks covering some pins. Find the diagram or instructions for your new drive on to set the jumper for the master/slave. Note that if both the master and the slave are available on the slot you are using (primary or secondary), set the hard drive to master. (fig. 4)
Note that if you are using a SATA drive, the jumpers do not need to be changed, because each SATA device uses its own cable, and multiple IDE devices can share a cable.

, Using the screws that came with the drive or computer case, mount the drive. (fig. 5)

, If it won't go in, make sure that the safety bump is aligned with the hole.(fig. 6)

, 7) A SATA drive will have a different type of power cable on the power supply.

,,, Go into your BIOS at startup (most likely by pressing F10 or DEL as the computer starts). Check the BIOS auto detect to ensure the second drive is detected. On the screen that shows that primary master/slave, secondary master/slave, you should see the name of your new hard drive.

Look for clues that indicate that you have corrupted files.,
Run any rescue and recovery software that came with your hard drive.,
Use other programs to try to rescue files if the original rescue and recovery program that came with your hard drive does not work.

,
Access the Microsoft Rescue and Recovery utility if you are using a computer with the Windows operating system.,
Listen carefully for any noises coming from your hard drive especially when you try to access it.,
Do a detection test by reinstalling your hard drive and then restarting your computer to see if the hard drive is detected.,
Freeze your hard drive in a zip-lock bag if all other methods have failed.",How to Access a Damaged Hard Drive," For example, your computer may detect your broken hard drive but not let you access the data that was saved on it. At times, you may even see file names and icons appear but the files will not open. All of these hints suggest that you have a software malfunction.;
, Many hard drives come with built-in software that allows you to store files more efficiently. However, a virus or other glitch in the software of the hard drive can make saved data inaccessible even though your hard drive has not suffered from any physical damage. The rescue and recovery program will try to fix the built-in software.

,, You can find the Rescue and Recovery utility wizard by going to ""Start"" and then clicking on ""Search"" to search for the utility.

, If you hear a repetitive clunking when you try to access saved data it means that the head is having difficulty in reading stored information. In terms of physical damage, it means that either the arm or disk inside your hard drive is broken. At this point you may want to consider hiring a data recovery professional because the intricacies of opening a hard drive are very complex. Find a local HDD repair or data recovery company. Ask them which tools they use. If it's PC-3000, there is high chance your drive can be saved.

, If your hard drive is not even being detected there may be a problem with the board or access ports. If the problem is with an external hard drive, you can try to replace the access ports by shifting the hard drive into a new enclosure. If the problem is with your hard drive board you will have to replace the board. Use the methods suggested for your specific hard drive model to locate and replace the board. Make sure the new board is compatible with your hard drive.

, This may enable you to access a damaged hard drive for a very short amount of time, so connect the hard drive to your computer as quickly as you can after it has been frozen to transfer files to a safe location. Be aware that freezing a hard drive can cause further data deletion.

Purchase a printer capable of printing high resolution photos and graphics.,
Consider purchasing a photo printer.",How to Print High Quality Photos Using an Inkjet Printer1," Not all devices are made equally in terms of print quality, and a printer's performance is most often reflected in its price. Review the device specifications prior to purchasing an inkjet printer.


Choose a printer model that provides 48-bit color support and an optical scan resolution of at least 2,400 dots-per-inch (dpi) for the best results.
Read and compare the product reviews for several different devices to help determine which inkjet printer will produce the best quality images and photos.;
, Photo printers are designed specifically for printing photographs, and usually produce the highest quality results. A dedicated photo printer typically will produce better quality images than a multipurpose printer.

Purchase the proper type of toner powder that is compatible with your printer and its cartridge.,
Toner is messy: prepare your workspace!,
Locate the holding tank on your toner cartridge.,
Screw the funnel cap on to the bottle of toner powder.,
Reseal the fill hole.,
Shake the cartridge lightly from side to side, holding horizontally, to ensure even distribution of the toner powder.,
Replace the smart chip if your cartridge requires this extra step.",How to Refill a Laser Printer or Copier Toner Cartridge," Toner powders vary by grain size, chemical construction, and weight. That is precisely why only the compatible type of toner powder will work with your cartridge.


There are several types of toner, but not separate ones for every single printer model: most differ on features, not basic technology. In a pinch, a toner from a very similar model of printer will probably also work, but research or ask first. And if the seller hasn't promised compatibility, don't blame them in the unlikely but possible event it doesn't work properly or even damages the printer. (The risk may well be worthwhile for an obsolescent printer otherwise needing replacement or an expensive original equipment manufacturer cartridge.);
, Place paper towels or newspapers on a flat surface to protect your workspace in case you spill toner powder. Put on rubber gloves if you want to make sure you do not get powder on your hands.


If you're going to need to use a ""burn tool"" (a soldering-iron like device for melting holes in plastic), work over a heavy, hard to burn surface such as a plate to not scorch your table directly or through a few sheets of paper.
Wash and dry your hands (or the gloves) often when working with toner to keep other things clean. It's not dangerous, but it can stain.

, This is a relatively featureless wide compartment where you will need to refill toner powder. Check to see if the holding tank has an existing fill hole or not. Some cartridges already have a fill hole stopped up with a plastic plug that you can easily remove.


Other cartridges require that you make your own fill hole, and corresponding toner refill kits typically come with a burn tool and heavy-duty aluminum ""flue tape"" to close up the hole after you finish refilling a toner cartridge. Follow the instructions provided with the toner refill kit if you are required to use a burn tool. The instructions will show you where and how to burn the hole.

In a pinch an ordinary small electric soldering iron can suffice as a burn tool. But things will get messy as you will have to melt and burn away all the unwanted plastic, rather than melt only the edges of a hole through it with the special tool.
If the ""burn tool"" has a tip screwed on, make sure it's screwed on tight for efficient heating, before you heat it up (or after you let it cool).
Just make a hole into the holding tank big enough to admit the toner bottle nozzle. Do not stab so far in as to damage other parts from behind.
If you raise a lip of melted plastic around the hole, trim or melt it off (you may need to periodically and carefully wipe the tool tip) to ensure tape will fit well around the hole to seal it and not be vulnerable to bumps, and to ensure that the cartridge will still fit well into the printer. This is especially important for cheap color laser printers' cartridges, whose entire bodies are rotated inside the printer to each line up in turn with the printer's imaging system for each page--a process which can dislodge stray tape.



, Point the end of the funnel cap into the refill hole at a slight angle, and gently tap the side of the bottle to dispense the powder into the holding tank. Continue the gentle tapping until the bottle is empty.

, If you have a pre-made hole, you can reinsert the plastic plug back into the hole. If you had to burn a hole, reseal the hole with the provided aluminum tape by following the directions that accompany the refill kit.

, Reinstall the cartridge in your printer or other device.

, Some printers will not work after a toner powder refill unless a new smart chip fuse is installed. Most toner refill kits come with a smart chip if it is needed for your cartridge.

Adhere to the recommended maintenance on an inkjet printer, as directed by the manufacturer. Blocked nozzles and clogged printer heads are a common source of issues with inkjet printers and can compromise print quality.
Turn off the device when not in use. Leaving the device turned on exposes the printer heads to dust particles and debris, which can degrade the quality of images printed from an inkjet printer.
Confirm that the latest device drivers and firmware updates are installed on the printer. These updates usually can be downloaded free of charge from the printer manufacturer's website.

Understand the advantages of owning a laser printer rather than an inkjet printer.,
Be aware that the consumables (toner) for the laser printer last a long, long time.,
Be price savvy.,
Expect reliability.,
Expect minor repairs.",How to Understand the Advantages of Laser Printers," Here are some of the advantages:


A laser printer requires no ink. Laser printers use toner, which is plastic and iron particles which melt to the paper with special heated rollers called a fuser unit. No ink means nothing to ""dry up"". With a laser printer, you can take that vacation knowing that you will have a working printer when you get back. You won't need a new set of cartridges when you come back because they dried up during your absence.
Laser printers are far cheaper to operate. It is a well known fact that vendors give inkjet printers away knowing that they will make lots of money on the ink. Laser printers may cost more up front, but the cost per page is a little as a tenth of what it is for inkjet printers.
Laser printers offer waterproof printing. Ever had the ink smear when it got wet? Doesn't happen with a laser printer - plastic is melted to the sheet and is completely water-proof.
Print quality is better. You can ""feel"" and see the difference. Laser printers are the standard for professionally printed letters. Ever notice how nice that letter is that you got from your doctor or lawyer's office? It was printed on a laser printer. You can really feel the difference.;
, It is common to be able to print several thousand sheets on a single toner cartridge. The bigger the model of printer, the more you can print per cartridge and lower cost per page. Average laser printers cost around 3 cents per page.

, Laser printers can offer outstanding color at reasonable prices. Color laser printers are widely available to the masses for as little as USD$200. Expect to have a larger printer than the inkjet, but the benefits are well worth it.

, Laser printers tend to be far more reliable. Many laser printers are rated for 30,000 pages a month or more! Laser printers are legendary for their service life. Some people have had experience of Laserjets that are still working fine after 15 years of daily use.

, Most repairs are just a matter of changing parts available in a standard ""maintenance kit"".

Take everything out of the box.,
There are two sides to the screen: a finished side and an unfinished side.,
Fill a spray bottle with water (no bleach or chemicals) and spray the screen until it is wet but not dripping.

,
The black envelope that comes in the box has two emulsion sheets in it.,
Put the newly emulsioned screen in the drying rack and press the fan button.,
Print your design on the translucent paper (you can buy designs too).

,
Now take your screen out and peel off the plastic on the emulsion.,
Tape your design to the glass and place the screen emulsion side down over the design on the pegs.,
Use the up, down buttons to set the timer for 8 minutes.,
When the machine beeps, take out the screen.,
When you've sprayed the screen enough so that the design is clear and the emulsion is green, put the screen in the drying rack and press the drying button.,
Now take the screen out and use masking tape around the edges and wherever there are holes that you don't want to appear in your design.

,
Attach the t-shirt to the t-shirt platen (just place it on top, do not put the platen in the middle of the shirt).

,
Now put the screen on the emulsion side down on the pegs, put a bead of ink just above the design, and squeegee down while applying pressure to the screen.

,
Take off the platen with the shirt still on it and allow to air dry for 15 minutes.,
If you are still having trouble after reading this, watch the video tutorial that comes with the Yudu.

",How to Use a Yudu Screen Printing Machine," Read the diagram explaining what all the parts are.;
, Turn the screen over so that the unfinished side is facing up.

,, Get one out and place the side that is DULL on the wet screen.

, Make sure you time it as the machine does not beep! It usually takes about 20 minutes or longer.

,, If the plastic isn't coming off, put your screen back in the drying rack for another 10 minutes or so. A little bit of emulsion is usually going to come off in the corner. When it does just be careful around that area so the rest of the emulsion doesn't come off with it.

, If there are holes in the emulsion, make sure they are not over the design, this will result in holes in your design also. Put the t-shirt platen on the pegs too. Put the cover over the platen and weight down the platen with a 5 lbs weight.

, Now press the expose button, it looks like a sun.

, It works best if you dry the screen in the drying rack until it beeps, then take it out and let it air dry for about 2 hours. If you don't have enough time, just dry it once in the drying rack (until it beeps).

,,,, Take the shirt off the platen and hang int to dry for 1-2 hours. When the ink is dry, either iron the design with a cloth over it or tumble dry on a medium heat setting.

Choose the maintenance tab and find the option to check nozzles. If the lines that print are blurred or broken, select the print head cleaner icon to clean away dried ink, dirt, and dust. Test and clean print head often to avoid build-up.

, Each printer calls for a specific ink or toner cartridge type, so please follow the directions provided in your printer manual to properly replace your particular cartridge.

Color saturation: Basically, the color calibration of a laser printer is based on common paper (80-100 gsm) before delivery.,
Printing speed: Slower printing speed can allow more time for toner transfer, avoiding paper jams and increasing color saturation.,
Paper polarity: Thanks to the toner, almost all laser printers have negative polarity.,
Moisture: Moisture tends to make pulp fibers expand, raising paper thickness and accentuating uneven roughness.,
Thermal stress: Many people recommend inkjet glossy photo paper or premium paper for laser photographic printing.,
Resolution: Due to the fact that toner is a dry powder in its natural state, the paper has no connection with resolution.",How to Understand Photographic Laser Printing," If we increase the paper thickness to that of conventional paper (over 180 gsm), the color saturation will be reduced. Paper thickness and color saturation must be increased at the same time.;
, In the market, there are different default speeds, such as 4-5 ppm (pages per minute), 16 ppm, and 20 ppm or more. Fortunately, it is possible to control printing speed by selecting the paper material icon. The recommended speed is 106-160 gsm.

, By using paper with positive polarity, it is possible to conduct more toner and increase color saturation.

, Coatings can isolate the paper from the moisture in the air. Using synthetic paper instead of pulp paper is a good way to resist moisture completely.

, Be careful! The heating temperature of the fuser can rise up to 200 °C (392 °F) during printing. The potential risk of thermal stress means that you may melt or crack the coating material on the surface of the paper. This is particularly true if the printer is operating at a low speed. Again, this has to do with thickness. The thickness of those products is over 80-100 gsm.

, The image resolution is determined by the printer engine, toner dimensions, and printing language. 600 x 600 dpi can offer remarkable image quality. 1200 x 1200 and 2400 x 2400 dpi offer more shades of gray and improve cubic effects (for special applications such as medical or military).

Wireless Card Installation for a Desktop Computer;
,
Shut down your computer, and unplug it completely.,
Open the cover of your desktop.,
Locate the correct slot on your computer for the wireless card.,
Insert the wireless card.,
Close your case, and run any software that came with your wireless card.

,
Remove your battery from your laptop.,
Remove the communications cover for a PC laptop, usually marked C. For a Mac laptop, remove the entire back cover.

,
Install the wireless card in the mini-PCI slot for a PC laptop and in the Airport slot for a Mac.,
Run any software that came with your wireless card, and configure your network.

",How to Install a Wireless Card,", If you are installing a full card and not just a USB adapter, this is a job that needs to be done with the machine off and unplugged.

,


For some older PCs, this requires unscrewing connector pins on the back of the case. For most Macs and PCs, it will only require pulling on a switch that will allow you to either pull down the side or fully remove part of the case.

,


Find an empty PCI slot on a PC computer. Make sure to remove the faceplate for that port before trying to install the card. This will expose the new card from the back of your PC when you close the case.
For a Mac, locate the Airport card slot. On most G5 Power Macs, it is generally part of the metal wall that separates the logic board. On the iMac G4, the card slot is in the rounded base. And in the iMac G5, it's right in the middle when you've unscrewed the whole back plate.

,


On a PC, insert the card until it is firmly seated in the port. Attach any screws associated with the card using a Phillips-head screwdriver. Attach the antenna to the outside of the card, and close your case.
On a Mac, connect the antenna cable to the back of the card and plug the card into the board. It will only connect one way, so if it doesn't work the first time just turn it around. Generally you'll turn the label face down so you can see the serial number and other written details on the card.

,, This is not necessary, but it's a good practice to make sure that your laptop is safe.

,, Make sure to connect the antenna to the wireless card. Then close your laptop.

First make sure to wash your hands to remove any grease or foreign substances which may interfere with the installation of circuitry of your graphics card or any components which you may touch inside your computer.,
Also make sure to ""ground"" yourself, (no this doesn't mean you need to send yourself to your room) What this means, is that you will have to get rid of any static electricity which all humans conduct, so in order to do so simply grab hold of a metal object which is touching the ground to discharge any static electricity you may have conducted.

,
Now if you currently have a graphics card installed you may have to unscrew the mounts holding it, which usually include the back screws and possibly one inside the motherboard.,
Once you have located the stock graphics card and removed the screw or mounts holding it, then you must disconnect the IDE cables which is the very long, thin and wide, ribbon-like cable that will be crossing over the top of your stock graphics card.

,
Next, remove power supply cables which will run from the square box unit either at the top or bottom of your computer tower.,
In most computer motherboard's, the stock graphics card will be tightly secured in by plastic clips, which will be located on both side left and right horizontally of the graphics card.,
Once you have pushed down on the securing brackets on the motherboard securing the graphics card you can now attempt to slowly and firmly remove the stock graphics card.,
Now you should be able to take the new graphics card and line it up to the connectors on the motherboard in the PCI Express 2.0 16X slot.,
Make sure to line up the gold foil connectors as you see the connectors in the PCI Express 2.0 slot.,
Next, reconnect your IDE cable back into the motherboard and make sure to apply firm force and to distribute it evenly so that the connectors are in place.

,
Now plug in the two 6 pin power connectors into the front of the graphics card and screw in the remaining screws and mounts.

,
The installation is all complete now and all that should be left is to run the display and video drives which should come with the graphics card and now your ready to enjoy some premium graphics.

",How to Install a PCI Express 2.0 16X Graphics Card,";
,, These will typically be star or flat head screws. To locate the graphics card it will generally be in the fourth slot from the very bottom of the motherboard or directly underneath the CPU chip.

,, Generally speaking with this type of graphics card you will have to have at least a 450 watt power supply and there will be two 6 bit connectors that are usually black.

, Slowly and firmly remove these two plastic brackets by pushing downwards on them.

, Be sure not to grab any of the components or circuitry so you do not damage it, grab onto pieces of the aluminum or plastic frame and not the actual board of the graphics card.

, This will be the exact same one you just removed the previous graphics card from, if you have an integrated graphics card and didn't have to remove it, then the slot will look like it has about a 0.5 inch (1.3 cm) height and approx a 6 inch (15.2 cm) length, with a small divide in between the entire 6 inches (15.2 cm) vertically with a break of 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the remaining 5 inches (12.7 cm).

, You may need to use a bit of force to get it to fit in but do not use excessive force as the circuitry is very sensitive. It should fit firmly and snug into the slot and line up with the video input ports facing the back of the computer tower.

Plug the printer into your computer via USB.,
Manually start the driver installation process.,
Download printer-specific drivers.,
Download the drivers on another computer.",How to Install a Printer Without the Installation Disk," Nearly all modern printers can be connected to a computer without needing a disk. Simply plug the printer into the computer via USB and wait for the drivers to be installed automatically.


You will need to be connected to the internet in order to install the drivers from the operating system.






Make sure that the printer is turned on. Many printers need to be plugged into a power outlet as well in order to turn on.
If the printer does not connect via USB, you will need to download the drivers from the manufacturer. Older printers do not install automatically. See Step 3 for details.;
, If you plug the printer in and the drivers don't start installing automatically, you can manually search for the printer and start the installation.

In Windows, open the Control Panel and click ""Devices and Printers"". Click the ""Add a printer"" button and Windows will begin searching for the printer. Select your printer from the list to begin the installation process.






In Mac OS X, click the Apple menu and select ""System Preferences"". Click ""Print & Fax"" and then click the ""+"" button at the bottom of the printer list. Select your new printer on the list to begin the installation process.






If you are not able to manually install the printer using this step, you will need to download and install the printer-specific drivers from the manufacturer.

, While the operating system drivers will generally provide you with your printer's basic functionality, advanced functionality such as scanning may only be possible with the printer-specific drivers. Every manufacturer makes these drivers available on their website.


Note the printer make and model. The printer model is typically visible on the front of the printer. This will help you find the correct driver.
Visit the Support section of the manufacturer's website. Search for your printer model.
Make sure to download the correct drivers for your operating system. There will often be additional software, such as scanning software, that you can download and install as well.

, If the computer you are installing the printer on does not have internet, you will need to download the drivers on another computer and copy them onto a USB flash drive. Most drivers are less than 200 MB, meaning most flash drives will work.

If you're not sure what flavor of Windows your PC is running,


click on the Start button, and right-click on the ""Computer"" menu.,
On the pop-up menu (the Start Menu), click on Devices and Printers.,
You're going to get a dialog that looks like the picture at right.,
A menu pops up, asking whether you want to add a Local Printer, or to add a Network Printer.,
Next, a box opens to ask whether you want to use an existing port, or create a new one.,
On the next screen, you select how you're going to install the printer software, called the Printer Driver.",How to Install a Printer on a Windows PC,"  An information window is displayed that should look a little like the picture above.  If you're running Windows 7, it will say so right in this box.  (Even if it isn't, try the steps below.)
Windows 7 --and all recent versions of Windows-- make it very easy to add a printer.  Again, click on the Start button usually at the bottom left of your screen.  (You can press the Windows button on your keyboard.);
,  This brings up a dialog box, shown in the next step.  If you have a newer operating system than Windows 7, this procedure might still work, even if the menus look a little different.  (The illustrations shown here might not look exactly the same in your computer, because mine is personalized to look like older versions of Windows!

,  (I've blurred out some of the stuff that I have; it's not important.)  Click on Add a Printer.

,  I'm assuming you want to add a printer directly to your computer.  (If you want to add a network printer, you should look up the instructions for that in another article.)  So select ""Add a Local Printer.""

,  Most printers manufactured in the last few years use either a USB port, or use a wireless connection.  This article will focus on using a USB port, which is an excellent all-purpose connection method for most sorts of peripherals (printers, cameras, MP3 players, Tablet PCs, E-readers, etc.) 


Let's assume you have a free USB connection slot available.  Most PCs have two or more.  If you've already used up all the USB slots, it is easy to buy a USB hub, which is like an adapter that lets you plug in a couple of gadgets into the same USB slot.
Select Use an Existing Port, and select USB001 (Virtual printer for USB), or something similar from the drop-down list.  Click Next.

,  This is where the instructions branch.  There are four possibilities.


If you have a well-known type of printer that has been built into the Windows 7 system, you can first select the manufacturer (such as Toshiba, or Hewlet-Packard, or Pumpkin Printers).  Once you do this, you get a list of all the models from that company that Window 7 has heard about.  This will unfortunately be just about half the available printers.  If you happen to want to install one of them, just select it, and the rest is automatic.  If not, read on...
If you have a driver disk that came with the printer, this is where you tell the computer that you have a disk.  Every printer disk installation is a little different, but Windows basically talks you through the process.
If you do not have a disk, all is not lost.  You have to set the printer aside for the moment, and search the web (via Google, for instance, or Yahoo) for the exact printer driver you need.  Suppose it is a little-known printer from Panasonic, called a Panasonic Bluebird 6E (this is an entirely imaginary printer; I would be surprised if there really was one called by this name), you would look on the Panasonic website for drivers for the Bluebird 6E.  You have to download the driver onto your desktop, unzip it if you have to, and once the setup file appears, simply double-click on it.  The installation (setup) file will talk you through the whole operation.  At the end of it, your printer should be fully functional.
If you do not have the disk, and the drivers are not available on the Web, you need advanced help, and only the store that sold you the printer can help you at this point.  There is a slight chance that a friend could set you up with a driver for a well-known printer that is very similar to the one you want to install; many drivers for one printer will drive a related printer fairly well.  The problem will be with graphics, which will not work properly.

",How to Install RAM in an iMac,"


Turn off your iMac and remove the power cord and all other cables from the computer. This will prevent you from being electrically shocked as you install the RAM.
Allow the iMac to sit for at least 10 minutes after you turn off the computer. This will allow the hot, or warm internal parts of your iMac to cool down completely before you install the RAM.
Spread a soft, clean towel across your flat work surface, then gently lay your iMac face down on the towel. This will prevent your screen from becoming scratched during the RAM installation process.;
,


Use a Phillips-head screwdriver to remove the RAM compartment door from the bottom of your iMac. The RAM compartment door is shaped like a long, thin rectangle and is located directly below your iMac's raised stand.
Set aside the RAM compartment door, then examine the compartment to locate tabs or ejector clips. If you are using an iMac model from the year 2007 and later, there will be tabs to secure the RAM into the compartment. If you are using an iMac model from 2006, there will be ejector clips on either side of the memory compartment.
""Untuck"" the 2 memory compartment tabs by gently pulling them down. If an existing RAM SO-DIMM card is already in place, you will see 1 tab below the SO-DIMM card that can be pulled to remove the existing RAM. If there are ejector clips, open them by placing your thumbs on the inside section of the clips, then pull them out and away from the inside of the memory compartment door.


,


Insert the RAM into the memory compartment with the ""key-way,"" or ""memory modules"" on the RAM facing up. You will hear a small click from the memory compartment after the RAM has been inserted properly.

Replace the tabs you untucked earlier by pulling them back into place over the new RAM you inserted. If there are ejector clips, close them by pushing the clips inside toward the new RAM.

Use the Phillips-head screwdriver to replace the door of the memory compartment.
Place your iMac in its normal upright position, reattach all the cables and power cords, then power the computer back on.

, After you have inserted the new RAM into your iMac, you can verify that it has been properly installed and can be recognized by your computer.


Wait for the desktop to load and display after you have powered the iMac back on.

Run Memtest.",How to Install RAM1," RAM comes in a variety of models and speeds. The type of RAM you can get is dependent on your computer’s motherboard. Check your motherboard or computer’s documentation, or check the manufacturer’s website for the RAM specifications that are compatible with your hardware.


RAM is available as DDR (double data rate), DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4. Most newer computers use DDR3 or 4. You must get the type that matches what your motherboard supports
RAM is identified by two different speed numbers: the PC/PC2/PC3 number and the MHz speed. Make sure that both match your motherboard’s specifications.

The PC number (ex. PC3 12800) refers to the maximum bandwidth (ex. 12800 = 12.8 GB maximum bandwidth).
The speed of the RAM is signified by the number after the DDR specification (ex. DDR3 1600 = 1600 MHz).

;
, Your motherboard has a limit to the number of RAM sticks you can install. Some motherboards support only two, while others support four, six, or even more.


Most motherboards have a limit to the amount of memory that they support, regardless of the number of slots.
iMacs use notebook memory, so refer to the next section for instructions on how to install it.

, You can find RAM from a variety of different manufacturers, and for a wide variety of prices. Manufacturers vary in quality, and a large percentage of RAM ships dead on arrival. Some of the most reliable companies include:


Corsair
Kingston
Crucial
G. Skill
OCZ
Patriot
Mushkin
A-Data

, Once you’ve decided on a manufacturer, you can pick your RAM. When buying desktop RAM, be sure to buy SDRAM. RAM is best installed in matching pairs, so you may need to buy two or four sticks to get the amount of RAM that you want.


For example, to get 8 GB or RAM you might install two 4 GB sticks or four 2 GB sticks. Make sure that what you get can fit in your motherboard. Try to install RAM in pairs such a if you want 4 GB, then install 2 GB and 2GB. Never install them in different pairs such as one is 2 GB and the other one is 1 GB etc., it might decrease your RAM performance.
All of the RAM you have installed should have matching speed and bandwidth. If they don’t match, your system will be clocked down to the slowest stick, reducing performance.
Double check what your motherboard supports before committing to the purchase.

, Unplug the computer and any peripherals connected to the computer, such monitors, keyboards, and mice.

, Lay your computer tower on its side, so that you can access the motherboard when the side panel is removed. You may need a Phillips-head screwdriver to remove the panel, or you may be able to unscrew it by hand.

, Ensure that you do not have static build-up on your body. Static can damage computer parts, and can be imperceptible to a human. Ground yourself before starting, or use an antistatic wrist strap.


You can ground yourself by touching a metal part on your computer case while it is unplugged from the wall. Simply being turned off does not remove any standby voltages, so make sure it's unplugged.
Don’t stand on carpet while working on the interior of the computer.

, Most motherboards have 2 or 4 RAM slots. RAM sockets are typically located near the CPU, though their location may vary depending on the manufacturer or model. Refer to your motherboard’s layout diagram in your documentation if you are having difficulty locating the sockets.

, If you are replacing old RAM, remove it by releasing the clamps on each side of the socket. The RAM will be released from the socket, and you’ll be able to lift it straight out of the motherboard with little to no effort.

, Carefully remove the Ram from the shielded packaging. Grip it from the sides to avoid touching the contacts on the bottom or the circuitry on the board.

, Line up the notch in the stick of RAM to the break in the slot. Set the stick into the slot and then apply equal pressure onto the stick until the clamps on the side click and lock the RAM in. You may have to apply a fair amount of pressure, but never force it in.


Make sure matching pairs are inserted into their matching sockets. Most are labeled on the board or by color, though you may need to refer to your motherboard layout diagram. Make sure that they are facing the same way.
Repeat the process for each stick of RAM you want to install.

, While you have the computer open, this can be a quick fix for general overheating and performance issues. Compressed air cans are available at any office supply store. Do not blow air too closely at the computer.

, Once you’ve finished inserting your RAM sticks, you can put the panel back on and screw it back in. Avoid running your computer while the panel is off, as this will actually reduce the cooling power of your fans. Plug your peripherals and monitor back in.

, Your computer should start normally. If your computer displays the self-test during the startup, then you can verify that the RAM has been installed correctly. If not, you can verify that the RAM was installed once Windows starts.

, Press The Windows key + Pause/Break to open the System Properties. You can also click the Start menu, right click on Computer/My Computer and click Properties. Your RAM will be listed in the System section or at the bottom of the window.


Operating systems calculate memory differently and some computers dedicate a certain amount of RAM to specific functions (e.g., video), decreasing the amount available. For example, you may have purchased 1 gigabyte of RAM. The operating system may only display 0.99 gigabytes.

, If you still aren’t sure that your memory was installed correctly, or that it may not be functioning properly, you can run the free Memtest program to check the memory sticks. The test may take a while to run, but will discover any errors and display how much is installed."

, Before opening any panels on your laptop, make sure you are properly grounded to prevent damaging your components. You can ground yourself by touching a metal part on your computer case while it is unplugged from the wall. Simply being turned off does not remove any standby voltages.

, Remove the battery from the back of the laptop and then press the Power button to discharge any remaining power in the capacitors.

, Your notebook’s RAM can be accessed by removing the panel on the bottom of the computer. There are usually a few different panels, so look for the one with the memory icon, or check you manual. You will need a very small Phillips-head screwdriver in order to remove the panel.


Most notebooks only have two sockets, while some only have one. Higher-end notebooks may have more slots.

, Most laptop RAM, or SODIMM, does not require matching pairs when being installed. When it is required, it is because the pairs are on the same memory bank, which should be clearly labeled either on the laptop or in your documentation.

, If you are replacing old RAM, remove it by releasing any clamps on the side of the socket. You can release the clamps by pressing down on them. The RAM will pop up at a little bit of an angle. Lift the SODIMM to a 45° angle and then pull it out of the socket.

, Make sure to only grip the stick from the sides to avoid touching the contacts or the circuitry on the stick itself.

, The side with the chips does not matter when installing the SODIMM sticks, all that matters is that the notches line up. Slide the SODIMM into the slot at a 45° angle.


If you have multiple free slots, install RAM in the lowest number first.

, Once the stick is installed at a 45° angle, you can press it down into the base of the laptop until the clamps lock into place. The RAM is now installed., Flip the laptop around, plug it in and turn it on. Your computer should boot up normally. You may need to enter the BIOS in order for your RAM to be detected, or it may be detected automatically when you enter your operating system.


You can run Memtest if you feel like the RAM isn’t performing properly or may be defective.

, Once you’ve confirmed that your new RAM has been properly installed, you can close up the laptop. Reinstall the panel on the bottom that protects the SODIMM sticks.

You must use a type that is supported by your motherboard, or you may experience significant performance problems. Check your computer's documentation or look it up online to see what types of RAM are compatible.


Consumer desktop RAM comes as DDR (Double Data Rate), DDR2, and DDR3. DDR is extremely uncommon in modern computers; most modern computers use DDR2 or DDR3. You must use the type that your motherboard supports.
RAM is measured by two different numbers: the PC/PC2/PC3 number and the MHz speed. The PC number (ex. PC3 10600) refers to the maximum ""bandwidth"", or maximum amount of data that can be transferred at once (e.g. 10600 = 10.6 GB maximum bandwidth). The clock speed of the RAM, which is a measure of how quickly the RAM can perform functions, is signified by the number after the DDR specification (e.g. DDR3 1333 = 1333 MHz).;
, This will allow you to visually inspect your RAM slots and currently installed modules, which can make choosing your new RAM easier.



Click here for detailed information about opening your computer.

, The number of available sockets will impact the amount of RAM you can add. If you are trying to upgrade and all of your sockets are filled, you will need to remove some to add new modules.

, Beyond the number of physical modules your motherboard can fit, there is typically a limit to the amount of memory your motherboard will support in gigabytes (GB) .


Your operating system may also put a limit on how much RAM can be used. If you are using a 32-bit version of Windows, you can only use 4 GB of RAM. A 64-bit operating system has no real practical limit.

, If you're planning on expanding the amount you have installed while keeping your old modules, you'll need to ensure that the speeds match for all of the newly-installed modules.


If you're planning on replacing your old RAM, ensure that all of your new RAM has matching specifications, and that they are compatible with your motherboard.

, Most motherboards require that RAM be installed in matching pairs, or the performance will be drastically reduced.


For example, if you wanted to install 16 GB, you would need to purchase either four 4 GB modules or two 8 GB modules.

, Before you start removing old modules and installing new ones, make sure you are properly grounded. This will help prevent damage from electrostatic discharge. You can ground yourself by using an electrostatic wriststrap attached to your case or by touching a metal water tap.

, If you're removing the old modules to make room for bigger ones or taking them out to upgrade to a faster speed, you can quickly remove them by releasing the latches on each side of the module. Once the latches are release, the RAM will pop out a little, and you can pull it straight out.

, Make sure that you only touch the RAM along the side edges so that you don't get oils on the contacts or circuitry.

, RAM can only be inserted in one direction, so make sure that the slot and module line up.

, Apply even pressure to the module, but do not force it in. The latches on either side will snap into place when it is correctly installed.

, Make sure that the matching pair are installed in the correct pair of slots. Most matching pairs of slots are designated by different colors or labeled with printing on the motherboard. Your motherboard's documentation should also have a diagram.

, Install the rest of the modules, ensuring that pairs match, and then close your computer's case. Plug your devices and peripherals back in.

, If your computer boots normally, chances are everything went fine. You can check that your operating system is recognizing your RAM by opening the system properties window:


Windows - Press ⊞ Win+Pause

Speed up your computer without installing new RAM.",How to Increase the RAM on a PC2," Laptops are typically much more restrictive than desktops when it comes to upgrading RAM. There are usually stricter limitations on the amount you can install, and most laptops only have one or two slots for memory. You can usually find the types of memory supported in the documentation or on the manufacturer's support site.


Laptops use SODIMM modules, which are smaller than standard desktop memory.
RAM is measured by two different numbers: the PC/PC2/PC3 number and the MHz speed. The PC number (ex. PC3 10600) refers to the maximum ""bandwidth"", or maximum amount of data that can be transferred at once (e.g. 10600 = 10.6 GB maximum bandwidth). The clock speed of the RAM, which is a measure of how quickly the RAM can perform functions, is signified by the number after the DDR specification (e.g. DDR3 1333 = 1333 MHz).

, This includes the power adapter, USB devices, and any other devices.

, This may be marked by a small image depicting RAM modules, or you may need to refer to your laptop's documentation.


Not all laptops allow you to access and upgrade the RAM.

, Chances are that with the limited space you'll be replacing your original RAM modules. Release the latch on the side of the socket and the module will pop up at a slight angle. Raise the module to about a 45° angle and the pull it directly out of the socket.

, Make sure that you only touch the RAM along the side edges so that you don't get oils on the contacts or circuitry.

, Line the new module up with the notch in the RAM socket. Press it in firmly and then press the RAM down into the bay so that it is flat. The latch will snap into place.


Unlike desktop RAM, most SODIMMs do not need to be installed as matching pairs. They will need to have matching speeds, however.

, If your laptop boots normally, chances are everything went fine. You can check that your operating system is recognizing your RAM by opening the system properties window:

Force close background programs.",How to Free Up RAM1," Programs store temporary data in the computer’s RAM while the program is running. The more programs that you have running, the more RAM is required. The simplest way to free up RAM is to close programs that you aren’t using.;
, If you have multiple programs on your screen, close the ones you aren’t using. If you have a chat program running, but aren’t currently chatting, close the program.


Web browsers with multiple tabs open can take up a significant amount of memory; close tabs that you aren’t using to help get clear out some RAM.

, Some programs will continue running even after you’ve closed the window. You can see most of these programs in the System Tray, which is located in the bottom-right corner of the desktop, next to the clock. Hover your mouse over the icons to see which programs are still active.


Right-click on the icon to bring up the program’s menu. Most programs can be fully exited from this menu. Some programs, such as antivirus programs, may not allow you to close from the right-click menu.

, If you have too many programs opening when Windows starts, it can have a serious impact on your computer’s performance and startup speed. There are a couple ways to keep programs from starting when Windows does:


Change the program’s settings. Most programs that launch with Windows have options to disable launching at startup. Open the program’s Options or Preferences; turning off startup is usually located in the General section. For example, right-clicking the Google Drive icon opens a menu. If you click Preferences… a new window open up. In the Misc. section, there is a checkbox for “Start Google Drive automatically when you start your computer”.
Disable the startup services. Open the Run command by pressing the Windows key + R. Enter “msconfig” into the box and press enter. This will open the System Configuration window. Click the Startup tab to see a list of all the programs that start with your computer. Uncheck the boxes next to the programs that you want to disable.

, There are some programs that run in the background that do not have icons in the system tray and do not show up in the System Configuration. To kill background programs that are normally inaccessible, open the Task Manager. To do this, press Ctrl+Alt+Del and select Start Task Manager from the options.


Find the programs that you want to stop. Open the Processes tab. This will show every process that is currently running on your computer. At the bottom of the window, you can see the percentage of your total RAM being used. Click the Memory category to sort the programs by the amount of RAM they are using.
Select the program you want to close and click End Process. A window will open asking if you want to close it, and warning you that closing programs can cause negative effects. Only close programs that you are sure you want to close. Closing certain programs can cause your system to become unstable until you restart. Programs with the User Name “SYSTEM” are generally required for your system to operate correctly.

Disabling these unused ports will improve your memory. Go to start>My Computer, do a right click on icon which will bring up a menu, go to properties>Hardware tab>Device Manager. As you can see your hardware is divided into several different sections. Click on the plus sign beside each section to see what devices are running. Right click on the hardware that you would like to disable and a menu comes up. Click on Disable. Once you have clicked disable, an X will go across the icon that represents the device.;
, Microsoft as well as other programs that you install on your computer have programs running in the back ground that also take up a certain amount of memory. Some of these programs that are running are most likely not being used.


For example, let's say that you are not using a wireless connection, there is a background software called Wireless Zero Configuration that is being used for that and you can disable it. To locate the background software go to start>My Computer, Right-click and a menu will come up, click on Manage, look to your right and click on Services and Applications, Click on Services. You should now see all the software that is running in the background. If you look toward the bottom of the window, there are two tabs extended and standard. Extended gives a brief explanation of what every service does for you and standard just shows the services.
Take some time and Google each service to get a broader understanding of what each of them do. Once your comfortable about the knowledge you've received, you can now stop or disable the services you feel you are not using. To stop or disable software, right click on the chosen service, a menu will come up, to stop the service click on stop, to disable the service click on properties, look for start up type,click the arrow button for the drop down menu, click disable then click ok.

, You may notice when windows begins to boot up at the bottom right icons begin to pop up. If you have a messenger like yahoo or a wireless connection these things are programmed to run at start up. What you may not know is these icons take up memory so the more of them you have running the more memory you are using. While most of these icons can disappear by just going into their program options (accessible most times by right clicking icon) and telling it not to run at start up, others won't go way with out some extra encouragement. To manually stop these programs at start up, Go to start>Run, type msconfig (windows XP command), Go to the startup tab. You can now see the programs that are running at startup. By just clicking on the check box you can stop the program from starting up on your computer. Go to Google and look up the files you are about to uncheck. Its important to make sure you are not stopping any important programs for running.

, This one is simple. If you have a program that you know you haven't used in ages, its best to bite the bullet and get rid of it. Chances are its taking up some kind of memory as well as space. Go to start>Control Panel>Add or Remove Programs. Its good to check this every once in a while as you may have an unwanted program like spyware or malware.

Check your Mac model.,
Determine how much your Linux system supports.,
Identify your motherboard.,
Check the motherboard's documentation.,
Use a system scanning tool.,
Upgrade your RAM.",How to Find Out the Maximum RAM Capacity for Your Computer," The Windows operating system has a maximum amount of RAM that it will recognize. If you have more RAM installed than is allowed, the extra RAM will not be used. This limit is determined by whether Windows is 32-bit or 64-bit.


See this guide for details on checking your copy of Windows. Generally you can see whether Windows is 32- or 64-bit from the System Properties window (⊞ Win+Pause)
32-bit can support up to 4 GB (for all versions) of RAM
64-bit can support up to 128 GB (Windows 10 Home) to 2 TB (Windows 10 Education, Enterprise, Pro) of RAM;
, The amount of RAM your Mac can support depends on the model you are using. Many Macs have differing amounts of supported memory. Check your Mac's documentation for exact numbers. Some of the more popular models include:iMac (27-inch, Late 2013) - 32 GB

iMac (2009-Late 2012) - 16 GB

iMac (2006-2009) - 4 GB


, A 32-bit Linux installation may only support up to 4 GB, but if it has the PAE kernel enabled (most newer distributions do), then a 32-bit system can support up to 64 GB of RAM. A 64-bit Linux system can theoretically support up to 17 billion GB of RAM, though most cap out at 1 TB (Intel) or 256 TB (AMD64).To determine the exact amount your system can support, open the Terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T. Type sudo dmidecode -t 16. You will be asked for the administrator password. Look for the Maximum Capacity: entry.

, Even if your operating system supports a ton of RAM, you are still limited by what your motherboard can support. If you don't have access to your motherboard documentation, you will need to identify the motherboard and look up the specifications online.


You will most likely need to open your computer case and note the motherboard's model number.

, Near the beginning of your motherboard's documentation, you should be able to find a specifications chart or page. Look for the maximum amount of RAM or System Memory that can be installed. You will also see the number of available slots on your motherboard.


RAM needs to be installed in pairs. If your motherboard supports 16 GB of RAM and has four slots, you can install four 4 GB sticks or two 8 GB sticks to reach your maximum.

, If you are uncomfortable opening your computer or reading through your motherboard documentation, there are several tools available online that can scan your system and report how much memory you can have, as well as the type and speeds supported.


You can find these scanners on major memory manufacturers' and retailer's websites, such as Crucial or MrMemory.

, After you determine how much RAM your system can support, you can install your new RAM. Make sure that if you are adding new RAM to existing RAM that the clock speed matches the original RAM. See this guide for detailed instructions for installing new RAM.

Understand how the internet works.,
With low data (3gb or less) try not to download much or anything at all.,
Limit your emails and make email short as the more words and files in an email the bigger size in memory it's going to have.,
Once you're on a page and providing you don't refresh it, it shouldn't take any data.,
Disconnect from the internet whenever you're not using it.,
Try to use free wifi where possible.",How to Use a Dongle for Longer," In short the internet works by downloading pages from servers allowing you to view them. Depending on that page depends on how big it is in memory. This applies for emailing and downloading.;
, If you do need to download something then make sure it's a small file, otherwise expect your internet data to run out quickly.

, Also don't attach a file unless you really have to (e.g. for a deadline of some sort).

, For example if you're on Facebook, providing you don't keep clicking on links to your profile then to a friend's photo album you should be able to talk to friends for ages before your data gets low (although Facebook chat may take a small amount of memory up).

, Even if you're just going to be 5 minutes away from the PC it's best to disconnect and save the most of the internet until you're using it.

, Say if you're on holiday and there is free wifi at the local pub, then use that when you can and only use the dongle if you're in your hotel or lodge. Although some hotels may offer free wifi, most of the time they block websites such as Facebook and Youtube.

, Once you are in the Boot menu, you will see a list of devices. This is the order of devices that the computer will attempt to find an OS on. Typically, the first device listed is the computer’s hard drive, usually followed by the CD/DVD drive.


Select the first boot device and change it to your flash drive. The menu will either say “Removable Device” or will display your flash drive’s model name. This will make the computer check your flash drive first after turning on, instead of the hard drive.

, Navigate to the Exit menu in the BIOS. Select “Exit and Save Changes.” Alternatively, many BIOS have a shortcut key displayed at the bottom that will save and exit with one keystroke.


Saving and exiting reboots your computer.

Decide if your files are unimportant enough to risk a DIY attempt at data recovery.,

Get the tools.,

Using the flathead screwdriver, carefully remove the flash drive's outer casing.
,

Use the magnifying glass to inspect the circuit board (PCB) and solder pads.,
Set the flash drive on a hard surface with the connector end facing toward you and the solder pads facing up.

,

Use the wire cutters to cut one end off of the USB cable.,

Use the wire strippers to expose about 0.25 inch (0.6 cm) of each of the four wires inside the cable.,

Solder each of the four wires to the four solder pads.,

Plug the other end of the USB cable into a computer and cross your fingers.",How to Repair a USB Flash Drive1," If your decide your files are too important to risk, you will want to find a flash drive data recovery company.

These companies have special hardware and tools designed to repair circuit boards. The more advanced companies have the tools to remove the NAND memory chip from the circuit board in order to extract and unscramble the raw data stored inside.
The prices for data recovery can vary from $20 - $850 based on the severity of damage done to the drive, and the type of recovery required.
Some data recovery companies offer solutions for minor to moderate physical/internal damage costing under $200.;
, If you decide you are comfortable risking your files, you will need:

A soldering iron with solder and flux
An old USB cable
Wire cutters/strippers
A small flathead screwdriver
A magnifying glass or jeweler's loop
Note: These steps only apply if your flash drive has a broken connector.

,, If the PCB itself is damaged or the solder pads are lifted, you will probably need the help of a professional.

Note: Solder pads are the 4 bits of solder that connect the prongs of the USB connector to the copper lines in the circuit board. If the connector has broken away without causing damage to the PCB or solder pads, continue to the next step.

,, Cut the female end if it's not male-to-male., Or, if you do not have a spare USB cable to use, you may solder pieces of small gauge electrical wire to each of the prongs on the broken USB connector; this will create your own mini USB cable., The colors from left to right are black, green, white, red. They should attach to the solder pads in that order, from left to right, when you're holding the USB so that the two cutout rectangles are facing up and away from you.Do not mix these up or your flash drive (and files) are toast.
If you used your own individual wires instead of a cable, simply solder each wire straight across to the corresponding pad regardless of what color the wire is.

,

If it registers, great! Just save your files to your computer.
If it's still not being recognized, it's likely that there is a different underlying problem that can't be seen with the naked eye. Either consider sending it to a professional recovery company, or use it as a Christmas Tree ornament that reminds you to always back up your important files.

If the USB drive is full, you will not be able to save anything to it.

, Before taking the USB drive out of your computer, you'll want to eject it from your operating system.


Windows - Click the ""Safely Remove Hardware"" icon in your System Tray. Click ""Eject USB"" for the USB drive that you want to remove.
Mac - Drag the USB drive from your desktop to your Trash.

, After ejecting the drive, you can pull it out of your computer. You can then transfer you saved file to any other computer.

, USB drives tend to fill up quickly, especially older drives that don't have much storage. Try clearing out some files that you don't need if your drive is full.

, Most USB drives cannot store files larger than 4 GB. If you need to transfer files larger than this, you'll have to format the USB drive with a different file system. See the next step for details.

, Formatting the drive will make sure it is using the correct file system. Be aware that formatting will remove all of the data on the drive. You should only format the drive if it isn't being recognized or not working properly.


Right-click the USB drive and select ""Format."" If you're using OS X, open Disk Utility from your Utilities folder and then select your USB drive.
Choose FAT32 or exFAT as the file system. FAT32 is the most compatible format, and will work on virtually any device or operating system. exFAT is also a very compatible format that will allow you to store files over 4 GB. NTFS should be avoided unless you only work with Windows computers. It is not very compatible with other devices or computers.
Uncheck the ""Quick Format"" box if you suspect there is a problem with the drive. A standard format may be able to correct errors, but will take longer.

This is faster and more secure than the software alternative. Hardware encrypted drive have until recently been very expensive, but now several are available for not much more than a standard drive.


If you already have a drive and would like to encrypt it there is a very powerful free software solution called TrueCrypt. The software is slightly slower and less secure (because the encryption is done by the PCs processor so the encryption key and data are transferred to the PCs memory where it is available later on to hackers.






A problem with software flash drives is that they need admin rights on the host PC to work; thus, they cannot be used in public locations such as schools or internet cafes. We get around this problem by installing a “viewer” called TCExplorer. This does not need admin rights and lets you view as well as read and write files TrueCrypt encrypted files on public PCs:

Test the resolutions.",How to Get the Most out of a Low End Graphics Card," This will be what you consider to be an acceptable level. Generally, you should aim for 60FPS or higher, as it is a nice smooth frame rate but 30+ will work in a pinch.;
, Using Modern Warfare 2 as an example, use shadows, because you want all the help you can get spotting enemies. Enable sync every frame, as with a lower end graphics card, tearing can easily occur. However, specular mapping, for example, leave disabled. You're not going to waste the limited graphics power you do have to make your guns shinier.

, Basically, you use a frame rate benchmarking tool (e.g. Fraps) to show your performance in-game. You increase the resolution, until you find one too high, and it goes below what you consider an acceptable frame rate (established earlier). Once you reach that level, go one resolution lower. This will be the highest acceptable resolution. It is VERY important to make sure this is 1024x768 or higher. Low resolutions are often handled by the CPU rather than the GPU, and this can lower performance, unless your CPU is powerful enough to EASILY handle running the game and rendering it.

Start using your new card.",How to Change a Graphics Card," Graphics cards can easily become the most expensive component in your computer, but they don't have to be. Many of the budget and midrange cards can still provide great performance, depending on your needs. If you are a gaming enthusiast that has to play the newest games at the highest possible settings, you'll want to look for the more powerful and expensive cards. If you only game occasionally, aren't worried about the newest releases, or don't mind sacrificing a few graphics settings, you can get much more bang for your buck by looking at midrange cards. If you just want to watch HD video or play a few 2D games, most budget cards should do the trick.


Do your research before putting your money down. Sites like Tom's Hardware (tomshardware.com) and PCWorld (pcworld.com) regularly test and provide comparisons for many of the most popular new and upcoming graphics cards. These test results can help you quickly see how all of the available options stack up against each other.
Don't worry about the amount of memory (RAM) the graphics card has. Inflated amounts of memory are often used to make poor cards look more appealing. What is important, however, is the memory bandwidth. This is the speed that the memory can send and receive data from the computer. GDDR5 is the current leader in this category, and will significantly outperform four times the amount of the older GDDR3 memory.If you have a midrange CPU, you're likely not going to get the most out of a high-end graphics card. The graphics card is an important factor for performance, but games rely on all of the components in your computer in differing capacities, including the CPU, the system RAM, and even the hard drive read and write speed.
4K gaming is becoming more and more of a reality, but it will require a top-of-the-line graphics card (or two) in order to get satisfactory performance out of your games at that resolution. Keep this in mind if you're in the market for a 4K monitor as well.;
, Before purchasing your new graphics card, you'll want to check a few things inside your case or in your computer's documentation. Remove the side panel from your computer by loosening the thumbscrews or regular Phillips screws along the back. Typically, you'll be removing the panel opposite of the motherboard's Input/Output panel on the back of the computer.


Except in very rare circumstances, it is not possible to upgrade the graphics card on a laptop. Refer to your laptop's documentation to determine how to upgrade its graphics card if possible.
When opening your case and working inside your computer, make sure that you are properly grounded. This will help prevent electrostatic discharge that can damage your computer components. You can ground yourself by using an electrostatic wriststrap, or by touching a running water tap before working in the computer.

, Graphics cards are one of the biggest draws on your power supply, so you'll want to ensure that your power supply can handle the power requirements of the new card. Different cards draw different amounts of power, so check the specs on the card you want to buy, as well as the specs on your computer's power supply.


There are a variety of power supply calculators online that you can use to enter in all of your components and see the minimum recommended wattage. You'll want a little more than the minimum to future-proof your computer. Another general rule you can follow is that you typically will want a power supply that supplies double the wattage that your graphics card requires.
If you're installing multiple graphics cards into a single computer, you'll likely need a power supply that provides at least a kilowatt of power.
There is no way to determine a power supply's wattage without physically looking at it. There is no software that can report the wattage. Nearly all power supplies have a sticker that is clearly visible on the side which will tell your the power supply's specifications. You can usually just remove the side panel from your computer and visually inspect the sticker.
Many of the more powerful graphics cards require one or two 6-pin connectors (PCIe) from the power supply. Most newer power supplies should have these cables, but older power supplies will not. You can get adapters to connect to one of the other cables, but you may be better off replacing the power supply anyway if it's that old.

, Graphics cards have gotten quite large, and if you have a small case with tight spaces, it may be difficult or even impossible to insert the card you want. Use a tape measure to measure the space where your graphics card will be inserted. Check this space against the specifications of the graphics cards you are looking at. Make sure to pay attention to the width as well, as many of the more powerful cards can be quite wide.


A graphics card may take up the width of two PCIe bays, but it will only need to plug into one slot.

, Nearly all modern graphics cards run on the PCIe interface, which replaced the outdated AGP method. If your computer was purchased or built in the last ten years or so, chances are that it uses PCIe. If you're trying to upgrade the graphics card on a really old computer, you may be stuck with AGP unless you upgrade the motherboard as well.


PCIe and AGP slots are colored differently on the motherboard. AGP is typically a darker color such as brown, while PCIe is usually white, yellow, or blue. There is no standard, however, so refer to your motherboard's documentation or look for labels next to the slots.
PCIe slots are typically located closest to the CPU on the motherboard.

, Make sure that your computer is completely powered down before you work on the inside. Unplug it from the wall once it has been completely powered down.

, Your monitor is most likely connected to your old graphics card, so disconnect it from the back of your computer before removing the old card.

, Whenever you work inside of your computer, you should make sure that you're properly grounded. An electrostatic wriststrap attached to the bare metal of the case is the most convenient way to ground yourself when working in a computer. You can also ground yourself by touching a metal water tap with the water running.

, If you are upgrading, you'll need to remove your old graphics card before installing your new one. If you were using your motherboard's on-board graphics card, you may not have a card to remove.


Use a Phillips-head screwdriver to remove the screw that is securing the old card to the case.
Unplug any cables connected to the old graphics card.
Undo the latch underneath the back end of the old graphics card (PCIe). This latch helps secure the graphics card, so make sure to unlatch it before pulling the old card out.
Gently pull the old card directly out of the slot. Pull the old card straight out of the slot. You may have to be firm, but don't force it out. If you can't pull the card out, make sure that the latch has been released and the Phillips screw has been removed from the card's bracket.

, Many newer graphics cards require two bays on the back of your computer. You may need to remove the protective panel for the next bay if you haven't used it before. These panels usually pop off, though it varies depending on your computer case.

, Make sure that there aren't any cables obstructing the slot and that none will get stretched underneath the back of the card. Push the card firmly down straight into the PCIe slot until you hear it latch and it is evenly inserted. Secure the card to the case using Phillips-head screws (most cards will come with a couple). Make sure to secure each bracket if the card takes up multiple bays.

, Most new graphics cards require at least one 6- or 8-pin connector from your power supply, usually along the top of the graphics card. Make absolutely sure that you connect all of these, as your computer will likely not boot if your graphics card is not properly powered.


Due to the way that the pins are configured, the plug will only fit one way. Don't force the connection, but make sure that the connection is secure.

, With the graphics card firmly seated and connected to the power supply, you can close up your case and move on to the software side of the installation.

, When plugging your computer cables back into your computer, make sure that the monitor is now connected to one of the ports on your new card. If your monitor is very old and your graphics card is new, you may need an adapter to connect the monitor. Most graphics cards come with these adapters., Before you do anything with drivers, make sure your computer is booting properly. If the computer is not able to start, or runs into errors immediately after starting, the graphics card may not be seated properly or may not be getting enough power from the power supply.


Windows will likely boot into a low-resolution mode when starting with your new graphics card. Ignore the prompts to detect the new hardware for now.

, If your old card was an AMD/ATI and you're moving to NVIDIA, or vice-versa, you should uninstall your old drivers first in order to avoid conflicts. If you're staying with the same manufacturer, it is still recommended that you remove your old drivers so that you can get a clean start. You can uninstall your drivers from the Control Panel.Open the Control Panel and select ""Programs and Features"" or ""Uninstall a program"". If you are using Windows XP, select ""Add or Remove Programs"".
Find your graphics drivers in the list of installed programs. For NVIDIA, this will usually be ""NVIDIA Graphics Driver XXX.XX"". If you are removing AMD/ATI drivers, look for ""AMD Catalyst Install Manager"".
Follow the prompts to uninstall the drivers. For NVIDIA, highlight the driver, click Uninstall, and then follow the prompts. For AMD, highlight ""AMD Catalyst Install Manager"", click Change, select ""Express Uninstall ALL AMD Software"" and then follow the prompts.
Reboot your computer after removing the drivers. This will complete the uninstallation process.

, Now that your old drivers are gone, you can install the drivers for your new card. Ignore the drivers that are included on the disc that came with your card, as these are already out of date. Visit the AMD or NVIDIA website, depending on which card you have, and enter your new graphics card model into the Search tool. Download the latest drivers that work for your card model.


Driver files are fairly large (around 300 MB), and may take a little while to download depending on your connection.

, Follow the prompts to install the drivers on your computer. Most users can select the ""Express"" option. During the driver installation, your display will likely flash a few times, and may change to a more suitable resolution.


You will likely be asked to reboot your computer once the driver installation is complete.

, With the new drivers installed, you can start putting your graphics card to work. Load up your favorite game or graphic-intensive program and see what kind of performance you can get!

Select your method of imprinting the circuit schematic on the copper board.,
Draw the circuit schematic on either graph paper or a simulation programs such as MultiSim or Eagle CAD.,
If a simulation program is being used, test the circuit thoroughly in the simulated environment.,
Make sure the circuit functions on the breadboard, or in the simulation software.

,
Acquire a circuit board.,
Apply a printed design.,
Alternatively: Draw out your circuit on your board with the Sharpie.,Put on old clothes, gloves and safety goggles.,
Warm the ferric chloride, stored in a non-corrosive jar and sealed with a non-corrosive lid, in a bucket of warm water.,
Pour only enough ferric chloride to fill a plastic tray that has plastic risers in it to rest the circuit board on.,
Use plastic tongs to lay the circuit board face down on the risers in the tray.,
Wash all the etching equipment and the circuit board thoroughly with plenty of running water.

,
Drill 0.03 inch (0.8 mm) lead component holes into your circuit board with high-speed steel or carbide drill bits.,
Scrub the board clean with a scouring pad and running water.,
Gather the following tools:

Hand-held Drill or Drill Press
Various drill bits
Soldering iron
Solder

,
Before drilling, locate all the positions of the through-hole components.,
Drill through the board with a bit wide enough to accommodate whatever part must be placed at that location.,
Place the components on to the circuit board at their designated locations.,
Soldering is a skill that requires practice, although it is not inherently difficult.,
Test your circuit board before installing it into its permanent location.",How to Build a Circuit Board," You can do this either using a Sharpie for a simple circuit or a printed out version from a computer program. Only one of these is needed, so select according to your preference.
, The schematic should contain a detailed description of all parts, as well as easy to follow connections.

, If no simulation program is used, assemble and test one or more prototypes of the circuit on a breadboard. Breadboards are very easy to use, and allow one to view the results of a circuit in real time without the need for solder or permanent etches.

,, Circuit boards are about a dollar apiece, and are simply a layer of copper over an insulator. The typical size is usually 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) by 5 inches (12.7 cm). Drawing is simple; all that is required is an indelible marker, such as a Sharpie. A ruler is also helpful.

, (Skip this step if you aren’t using the computer program and are using the Sharpie method.) Print the design out from the software's print menu. Make sure the print is on a glossy paper (like those in magazines or separate glossy paper).

Turn on the electric iron (the same one used for clothes).
Carefully cut out the design and position it on the circuit board.
Put the hot iron directly on top of the circuit board for about 45 seconds.
Take the circuit board (careful it's hot). Wash the paper out such that the black ink is stuck to the copper circuit board.

, Note that it's really difficult to draw out a circuit design in real life, unless it's as simple as a led and a battery.

Keep in mind that copper cannot be between components, for example, if connecting an LED, there must be a gap in the copper between the positive and negative points of connectivity. Without a gap, the electricity would flow around the LED, as opposed to through it. Remember laws of electricity, all circuits must end at either a negative or ground, or no current will flow.






Use thin lines, but lay the ink on thick, it is important that the copper is dissolved before the ink, and that there are no thin patches in the ink exposing copper.







,, Do not heat it above 115 F (46 C) to prevent toxic fumes from being released., Be sure to do this in a well-ventilated space., Allow 5 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of your circuit board, for the exposed copper to drop off the board as it etches away. Use the plastic tongs to agitate the board and tray to allow for faster etching if necessary.,, Wear safety goggles and a protective mask to protect your eyes and lungs while you drill.

, Add your board's electrical components and solder them into place.

,, Copper dust is toxic, wear a dust mask.

, Remember not to make the hole to wide, or soldering will be very difficult.


There are two types of components: Through hole components (have long legs) and SMDs (surface mount devices). For SMDs you don't need to drill because they are surface mounted, but through holes need holes in order for them to be soldered on. Through hole components enter the board from the opposite side of the copper.

, Gently bend the legs of the component against the underside of the board, to hold the part in place. Make sure parts with polarity are lined up correctly with the corresponding positive and negative. Check and double-check the location of all parts before soldering.

, Please see Soldering Electronics for help.

, Use a multimeter, if possible, to diagnose connection problems. A De-soldering gun can be used to make minor switches and repairs.

Decide on what you want out of a new video card.,
Understand the different types of video card bus interfaces.,
Check your current PC setup.",How to Buy a Video Card For Your PC1," Multiple monitor displays and FHD or HTPC video do not require a high amount of power. High-end games, demanding emulators, high resolution video and virtual reality may require extra power for optimal performance. You will need to determine how powerful you want your video card’s components to be.;
, Your computer’s motherboard may feature one of three key slots that act as a video card bus interface. A key slot is a connector on a motherboard that features a specific pattern that allows you to plug in a card to expand your computer’s functionality. Inspect your motherboard and confirm with your motherboard’s documentation for which key slot is provided.PCI-Express is the most popular iteration in today's PCs. These can range between in Times one (x1) up to times sixteen (x16) which determines how fast the card is able to perform and the size of the key slot. Today almost all graphics card use PCI-Express x16 (PCIe).
PCI is an older and obsolete slot type. You may have a motherboard that features integrated graphics that does not include a PCI Express or AGP graphics card. PCI cards primarily support 5 volts for power and some cards may be compatible with 3.3 volt key slots. All PCI cards are 32-bit cards, but can be plugged into both 32-bit and 64-bit key slots.

, Ensure your computer can not only fit the card but will be able to sustain its power as well.Your video card may be limited by the power of the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, power and even the size of your desktop tower’s chassis.


The CPU speed must be fast enough to allow your video card to perform at it’s maximum capacity. A CPU with fewer cores or at low speeds may cause your video card to throttle its performance.
Measure the inner size of the PC chassis. A video card can vary in size. For high-end computers, a video card may require a long length and may take two PCIe slot width in order for it to fit properly. Your video card may also be obstructed by the internal wiring. Be sure to note how much space is available in the chassis of your computer.
Your power supply is very important, and will need to be able to not only sustain the power that your video card will require (low-end cards mostly draw power from PCIe slots only but high-end cards require more power and have additional 1 or 2 six or eight-pin power connectors).
Always check how many watts your power supply can deliver, the number of additional connectors provided, and how much power is required for the card (usually given in the manual or on the website of manufacturer).

Choose a Graphical Processing Unit Brand.,
Consider the GPU.,
Consider memory and clock speed.,
Think about how much space the card takes up.,
Consider your need for DirectX.,
Purchase a video card.",How to Buy a Video Card For Your PC2," There are two popular brands of GPUs that are popular in the video card market; Nvidia and AMD. Both GPU types can provide similar features using proprietary functionality as well as their share of exclusive features. There are substantial differences in the technologies in AMD's and Nvidia's graphics chipsets, and if you're really picky, you may have a very good reason for choosing one over the other. The truth, however, is that only serious, detail-obsessed gamers are going to be able to discern a difference in appearance between a game running on an AMD card and one running on a comparable product from Nvidia. Most people are going to pay more attention to how realistic a game looks and whether it stutters during play than the specific types of anti-aliasing, physics processing, and multi-monitor technologies that are employed. If you find a card at a price you can afford, and reviews say it does well, go with it. Most of the other stuff is just gravy—and often lumpy at that.

, A video card's graphics processing unit (GPU) is what determines its video capabilities, and many GPUs have names that are often fairly arcane and unintuitive if you don't follow the business closely. But a good rule of thumb is that the higher the number in the GPU's name, the more recent and more powerful it is.

, Ultimately, video cards aren't much different from CPUs—a lot of the same rules apply, including those about memory and clock speed. Video cards have their own collections of both, although the specific values of either will usually be less immediately important than when you're choosing a system processor.

The name and number of a video card type generally specifies their power and performance. This can be used in addition to determine how powerful a video card is. Both popular chipsets offer different naming conventions to identify their line of cards.A video card model number will determine its power, generation and performance level.
However, it's possible for two video cards of the same type to have different amounts of memory; Nvidia's GPU, for example, maybe available in both 1.5GB and 3GB of memory—and the one with more memory will tend to be faster and cost more. Likewise, some cards might use GDDR5 memory, which is faster and more expensive than the GDDR3 memory other cards use.
Lower-end video cards sometimes have faster clock speeds to compensate for the power they lack in other areas, but that's usually not going to translate to increased real-world performance.
You only need to pay close attention to these specs if you want to fine-tune your purchase; in most cases, the name of the GPU will tell you everything you need to know about the card's capabilities.

, Back when all computers were two-foot-tall towers, no one thought much about video cards hogging a lot of space. But because PCs now come in a range of sizes, you may not be able to use every card in every system you want to build.

The more powerful a card, the longer it's going to be, and the less likely it will fit into a microATX case, or even a smaller ATX case. Some higher-end AMD and Nvidia cards will be very long. If you're building a smaller computer, or you want to upgrade the video in a mini tower you already have, be aware that your card choices may be limited.

, Video cards will support different versions of Microsoft's DirectX collection of advanced programming interfaces (APIs), which offer different graphical and processing features. Again, the specific details are going to be important only to hard-core gamers, but the higher the version number of DirectX a card supports, the more realistic games that use it will look—and the more challenging they will be for your computer to run.


The highest-level version as of spring 2017 is DirectX 12 (DX12), and cards that can run it will also be able to run the full feature sets of games written with DX11 or DX10, but DX9 or DX10 hardware won't be able to see all the effects of DX11 or DX12 games (assuming they work at all).
The software package or the manufacturer's website will tell you what version of DirectX is supported—always check to make sure your hardware matches up. All the latest AMD and Nvidia cards support DX12, so if you buy new you won't have a problem.

, Purchase a video card from a retail store or from online. You may also read reviews to compare and contrast other user’s experiences with the video card.


Keep an eye out for seasonal and periodic sales as this will allow you to purchase a video card at a lower price.
A computer can be built with millions of combinations. Comparing your computer’s overall performance to others will not offer the best advice for the graphics card itself unless the hardware combines with your video card for specialized compatibility.

Connect the video card to your PC.,
Install and configure drivers.,
Configure software settings.",How to Buy a Video Card For Your PC3," Be sure to turn off the computer and remove all connected plugs. Open the chassis of your computer and locate the compatible key slot for your video card. Line up the video card to the compatible key slot on the motherboard and push down.


PCI Express cards may feature a holding clip used to secure video cards in place. Pull the clip back and hold onto the video card by its edges to line up with the keys on the motherboard then push the card gently into place until it is seated.If you are upgrading from an older video card, remove the previous card unless it is being used with a cross-connection method described for either Nvidia or AMD video cards.
Plug in power using either power connectors or SATA power cables. If the video card requires more than one power source, be sure to use a different cable track from your power supply. You may also use converter cables if you have a different connection type that leads to your power supply., Your video card will come with drivers and software designed to control your video card’s behavior. You can obtain the software from a disk that is bundled with the video card or from the manufacturer’s website. Follow the instructions provided by the video card manufacturer on how to install the software.

, Certain programs such as games may require additional setup to be configured for higher resolutions and enhanced features. Your video card may also need to be identified by the software or game in order to display video.

You can double-check that you have a sound card built-in by looking for speaker jacks on the back of the computer. Sound cards are really only necessary for audiophiles and recording studio computers, or for very old computers that don't have built-in sound.;
, This will allow you to move your computer to a place that allows you to easily access it. Place the computer on its side on a table, with the ports on the back closest to the table. The ports are connected to the motherboard, so having them closest to the table will ensure that you can get to the motherboard when the case is open.


Avoid laying the computer on carpet.

, Most newer cases have thumbscrews, but you may need a Phillips-head screwdriver. The screws run down the back of the computer. Remove the panel on the opposite side of the motherboard and set it aside.

, You should always ground yourself when working inside your computer. You can use an electrostatic wrist strap or touch a metal water tap to discharge any electrostatic buildup. If you don't ground yourself, you run the risk of damaging your components with electrostatic discharge.

, Since your computer is open, you should take this opportunity to clean out the dust that has built up inside the case. Too much dust can lead to overheating, which can lead to your components failing.


Use compressed air to remove as much dust and debris as possible. Make sure to get in all of the nooks and crannies.

, These are the slots that you can install expansion cards into. PCI slots are typically white, and you may have 1-5 of them. The slots line up with the removable panels on the back of the case.


If you're having difficulty identifying the PCI slots, check your motherboard's documentation. You can look this up online if you have the motherboard's model number.

, If you are replacing an old card, remove the old card first. Having two cards installed will lead to hardware conflicts. Remove the screw securing the card to your case and pull the card directly out of the slot.


You may need to disconnect the sound card from your CD/DVD drive.
Make sure that any speakers connected to the old sound card are disconnected before you remove the old card.

, Remove the corresponding dust guard panel from the back if you are installing the new card. Make sure that the notches in the slot line up with the card, and press the card straight down firmly. Don't force the card into the slot, and ensure that the ports on the back line up with the with the bay opening.

, Screw a single screw into the metal tab that secures the card to the computer chassis. Don't overtighten, but ensure the card is snugly fastened to the case.

, Some older sound cards may connect to the CD/DVD drive with a small cable. This is optional on virtually all newer computers, as this connection is now handled by the hardware.

, Return the side panel to the computer and secure it. Place the computer back at your desk and plug the cables back in.

, Set up your speakers around your computer. Ensure that the left and right channels are on the correct sides. Avoid placing the subwoofer in a corner or up against the wall.

, Examine the ports on the sound card. These ports are color-coded and should match the colors of your speaker cables.


Green – Front speakers or headphones
Black – Rear speakers
Silver – Side speakers
Orange – Center/Subwoofer
Pink – Microphone

, Wait for Windows to load. Your sound card should be detected by Windows automatically, and the drivers will be automatically installed.

, If Windows cannot install the correct drivers of your sound card, you will need to install the drivers manually. Use the disc that came with the drive, or download the drivers from the manufacturers., Make sure that your speakers are turned on and the volume is up. Click the Volume icon in your System Tray. When you use the slider to set the volume, a test sound will play out of your speakers.


If there is no Volume icon, your sound card may not be properly installed. Make sure that the drivers were installed correctly.

Electronic heads are normally covered with orange wire strips. Sponge heads are obviously sponge which can be touched. Open heads are a hole with nothing in them but ink.


For electronic heads, simply throw in trash. These heads are unreliable, especially if you don't print every day.

Get rid of your printer. Give it away. Deliver it to your local thrift store.
Buy a printer with sponge or open heads. These almost never dry out because the system keeps them sealed. Usually you will find these in printers with four or more cartridges; three separate colors and one black (aka CMYK).


If you have a sponge or open head cartridge, and you already did the other methods to no avail, your cartridge is dead. The ink has dried and hardened to a point it cannot be salvaged. Buy a new one. They can usually be found cheap on Ebay.

Dust the exterior of the printer at least once a week to keep particles from entering the interior of the chassis.
Open the printer and spray compressed air into the crevices inside. This prevents dust, hair and other debris from getting into the ink cartridges and gumming it up.;
,


Locate your printer's folder on your computer and find the option to run an alignment test. Aligning the heads prevents you from having to reprint copies with streaking and coloring mistakes.

,


Check if your printer has a self-cleaning option under the printer folder on your computer. If not, research how to clean the printer heads of your specific model of printer.
Perform a deep clean at least once a month.

,


Make use of paper that is the least absorbent. Do not use thicker paper than your printer manual suggests. Using the wrong kind of printer paper can cause jams and use up more ink than necessary.

,


Place unopened toner boxes in a room-temperature location. Make sure the area is dry and will be undisturbed by pests. Do not open the package until you plan to use it. An opened printer cartridge reduces the shelf life by more than half.

,


Change your printing resolution from the highest quality (which tends to be the default) to the lowest quality when quality does not matter. The lowest quality option is often called draft mode. Even in draft mode, though, the quality is acceptable if you have a good printer.

,


Use the printer often to keep the ink nozzles wet and in working order. Not using your printer often causes the interior of the nozzles to dry out and prevent ink from traveling through them.
Print a test page every couple of weeks if you have no need to use the printer regularly.

,


Shutting off the printer using its ""off"" button caps the cartridges to prevent them from drying out or being clogged by dirt and debris.

,


Remove the ""empty"" toner cartridge from the printer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Find the circuit board on the cartridge and look around for a small hole.
Stick the end of a paper clip inside the pinhole to reset the memory and continue using the ink cartridge. Often the printer reports the cartridge ""empty"" when it really has more life in it.

,


Remove the cartridge from the printer.
Locate the 2 windows that display the amount of ink left.

Look for the best deal.",How to Buy a PVR TV Tuner Card For Your PC," If all you want to do is watch TV on your PC monitor or LCD display, you probably do not need to purchase a card that includes the specialized hardware accelerator chip used for PVR. If you want to pause live TV or record shows on your hard drive for future viewing or burning to CD, you should spend the extra $50-$75 to purchase a card that includes an MPEG-2 hardware accelerator.;
, If you don't mind opening the case of your PC to install a new PCI-based card, you will save $30-$50 buying a PCI version of the product. If you have a laptop or you would rather not open your PC (which in some cases voids the warranty), you should purchase a USB device. There is no difference in performance. (Note: this is not true of USB 1.x devices that have a paltry 1.5mb/sec bandwidth. Far too slow for high quality full screen video. Buy a USB 2.0 device if your PC supports it.)

, Once you have decided whether to purchase a PVR card vs a TV tuner, the hardware is very similar from product to product. The biggest difference will be the software interface you use to access the product. The main applications available are SnapStream Media Beyond TV, CyberLink PowerDVD and smaller generic programs. Beyond TV is the PC Magazine Editor's Choice award winner and is a superior product. Cyberlink is an acceptable all-purpose PVR application. Most generic 3rd party applications have limited functionality are less visually appealing.

, PVR products can range in price as much as 50% for the same technology. A PCI TV Tuner with no hardware acceleration should cost $50 or less. A PCI card with hardware PVR will cost from $99 to $149. The USB equivalents of each of these products will cost $30-$40 more. Just because a product costs more than another one does not necessarily mean it offers greater functionality, so read the labels carefully.

Do not buy standard ink cartridges.,
Be wary on the warranty.,
Be wary of buying inkjet cartridges online.,
Consider the price.",How to Find the Right and Low Cost Inkjet Cartridges," Ink cartridges of this kind will only damage the ""nozzles"" of your printers. This is because standard ink cartridges may not fit the nozzles of your printer. Generally, ink cartridges have their own sizes that are specifically made to fit a particular printer. Hence, using the wrong size will definitely ruin your printer's nozzles.;
, Most of the printers come with a warranty. However, there are some cases that might void this warranty like using ink cartridges that are manufactured by a different producer. So if you want to continue using the warranty, it is best that you buy inkjet cartridges that are manufactured by the same maker of your printer.

, Today, online shopping can do great wonders, especially because it gives you the convenience of purchasing a product without having to go to the shop. However, if you want buy cheap ink cartridges online, there are some dangers that might go with it. For instance, frauds and scams are lurking in the Internet today. Hence, you might be buying an inkjet cartridge that is of low quality or of the wrong specifications, different from what they advertise online, of course. So it is extremely important to be sure of the inkjet cartridges that you are going to buy online and make sure that you can ask for a refund or an exchange for the item if in case you were satisfied with it.

, When buying inkjet cartridges, it is best to consider the price of the items. They may vary from one shop to another. Hence, it is important to shop around and compare so as to get the best buy. Just be sure that you get the same kind of inkjet cartridge with the same manufacturer. If you cannot afford to buy original inkjet cartridges, you can opt for refills. Just try to look for quality refilling stations that will give you the same quality ink as that of the original one. Indeed, buying cheap ink cartridges could be very tricky, and yet, it is not that complicated as well. The only important thing to remember is the model, size, and the manufacturer of your printer's inkjet cartridges. Given all that, you are ready to make the best inkjet cartridge purchases.

It is usually marked on the front of your printer and in this example, it will be, simply : C4280 and click the search. Because there seems to be a new version your printer manufactured every 24 hours, you may be asked for an identifying version which can be indicated by a letter. .

This should begin the installation process, and follow the process and take a moment to read each window that requires input instead of simply clicking ""yes"", ""okay"", ""sure"" , ""what ever you ask"" ... etc. The reason for this is to insure that you don't end up with, yet another toolbar that you do not need. At the end of this process, you should be able to open and print but there can always be a glitch. If there is a problem where your printer acts more like a popcorn maker instead of a printer, it will probably require these steps and try them, one at a time and in this order. First - turn off the printer, unplug all cables and detach it from the computer and restart the system. When the computer has rebooted, reattach and reconnect the printer. If this fails, you may need to uninstall the printer and then reinstall it again in order to get it back on line. You'll do this by going to control panel, system, hardware, device manager (Windows XP) and locate your printer. Right click and select uninstall. Reboot your system with the printer still connected.

Another means of torture invented by the manufacturer is the ever changing requirement to connect ... or not, to connect your printer to your computer first or to install the driver prior to connection. You will need to check your manufacturers specifications to be certain. Something very important to understand is that you are under no obligation to accept anything other than what you have requested and I recommend you refuse all offers, except the drivers you have asked for initially. This means, surveys, product customer service clubs, tool-bars (of any kind) or super duper warranties. The best you'll get are additional troubles out of your system. And finally:

Open the Start menu and right-click on ""Computer."" Select ""Properties"" to open the System window.
Open the Start menu, select ""Settings,"" then ""System,"" and then click ""About"" (Windows 10).;
, This will tell you how much memory is installed and recognized by Windows.


Note that the ""Usable"" amount of memory will be lower than the ""Installed"" amount. This is because memory manufacturers report size differently than Windows. For example, 8 GB of installed memory may be reported as 7.88 GB of usable memory.

, If you need more information about the RAM that you have installed, such as the speed or the capacity of each individual module, you can use the Command Prompt.


Open the Command Prompt from the Start menu. You can also press ⊞ Win+R and type cmd to start it.Type wmic MEMORYCHIP get BankLabel,DeviceLocator,Capacity,Speed and press ↵ Enter. This will display a few columns.
The BankLabel column will tell you which slots the RAM chips are installed in. The Capacity column will show how large each module is, expressed in bytes. The DeviceLocator column is another expression of the slot the RAM is installed in. The Speed column will tell you what speed each module is.

, You can use the Task Manager to check how much RAM your computer is currently using.


Press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+Esc to open the Task Manager.

Select the ""Memory"" option (Windows 8 and later). This will allow you to see your RAM usage.
Find how much RAM is used and available. In Windows 7, it is referred to as ""Physical Memory."" RAM is designed to be used, so there's no cause for alarm is the vast majority of it is currently in use.

, There may be several different reasons why Windows is not showing all of the RAM that you have installed on your computer:


If you are running a 32-bit version of Windows, you can only make use of up to 4 GB of RAM. Any RAM over this amount will not be recognized by 32-bit Windows. You can see which version you have at the top of the System window. Upgrading to a 64-bit version of Windows will allow you to access more RAM.
If your RAM modules are different speeds, they may not be functioning together properly. Use the Command Prompt command in the previous step to determine if all of your RAM is the same speed.
If one of your RAM modules is failing, it may not be registering in Windows. You can use the free MemTest program to scan your memory modules and check for errors. See How to Test PC RAM with MemTEst86 for detailed instructions.
If the RAM modules are not supported by your motherboard, they will not be recognized or used by Windows. Check your motherboard's documentation to ensure that any RAM you've added is supported.

"
"
Make sure you install the RAM in a clean environment.,
Handle the RAM module properly.,
Be careful when inserting the RAM modules into their slots.,
Minimize the risk of electrostatic discharge.",How to Avoid Damaging RAM During Installation," Whether you're installing RAM into a laptop or a desktop computer, chances are you're going to have to open the casing to reach the RAM slots inside. If there are stray liquids or dust or other pieces of debris in your environment, they may get inside and cause damage. Ensure that your RAM modules remain clean by working in an environment that is as clean as possible.;
, Always hold RAM modules by their edges. Never touch the golden electrical components on a stick of RAM because those are where the electrical connections are made. If you touch the gold parts, some of your finger oil will smudge onto them, which can destroy the module.

, Always make sure that your RAM is compatible with your motherboard before attempting to insert the module. If the RAM and the motherboard are incompatible, the RAM will not fit and something will end up breaking if you force it. If you're sure that your RAM is compatible, then make sure you line up the tabs and notches correctly before applying force.


Use firm but not excessive pressure. You will need to press on the RAM, but not so much that the stick bends or warps. Bending can cause the stick to crack or break, rendering it useless.

, Whenever 2 things touch, there is always an exchange of electrons at the atomic level. Most of the time, this exchange is so negligible that you don't notice it, but even tiny bolts of static electricity can fry your RAM modules. In fact, any electrical component in your computer has a chance to be damaged by static electricity.


Before handling any electrical components, including RAM, always ground yourself to nullify any static charges that may have built up on you.
Avoid installing RAM or any other computer component on carpet. Carpets generate tons of static electricity very quickly and you could fry your RAM module without even knowing. If possible, work on a flat, wooden table on hardwood flooring.
Keep your body's electrical potential at the same level as your computer's while your work. You can do this by always being in contact with the computer's casing if the casing is metal.
Avoid working with RAM and internal computer components when the humidity in the room is low because static charges build up more quickly in low humidity environments. When working with the electrical components of a computer, the ideal humidity falls somewhere between 35 and 50 percent.

,
Buy an inkjet printer if you need a printer for the following tasks.,
Know the benefits of laser printing.",How to Decide Whether to Buy an Inkjet Printer or a Laser Printer," This will give you a better idea of which type of printer you should buy. Ask yourself the following questions.


Will the printer be used at home or in an office?
Is color printing required or will printing only in black suffice?
What is the budget or maximum price limit?
What will be the monthly or yearly budget allowance for maintenance of the printer?
How many pages will be printed per day?

,,


Printing photos: Inkjet printing can blend colors more smoothly to print photos with enhanced tones and hues.
Using different types of paper for printing: Paper jams are usually less common in inkjet printers. You can print on regular office paper as well as textured paper or even print on iron-on transfer sheets using an inkjet printer.
Mobile printing: Inkjet printers are easier to move around because they are smaller in size and lighter in weight.
Low-cost printing: Inkjet printers generally cost less to purchase and maintain.

, Laser printers offer the following advantages in comparison to inkjet printers.


Better black text printing: Laser printers give better results when printing in only 1 color.
Speed: Laser printers usually have a higher page per minute (PPM) speed.
Bulk printing: Most laser printers allow you to feed many pages through a paper feeding tray so you can print documents with many pages. Most feeding trays can hold 150 or 250 sheets of paper.;

What is RAM?,
First up, find out how much RAM you currently have.,
Next, see how much extra memory you can potentially add.,
Look inside and locate your RAM.,
Find out what kind of RAM your computer requires.,
Purchase the correct type of RAM.,
Do not touch the gold-plated parts of your RAM.,
Beware of static!,
Now it’s time to install your RAM.,
Insert the replacement boards by doing this in reverse.,
Clean the dust from your computer.,
Close your computer.",How to Buy and Install Computer Ram Memory," RAM stands for Random Access Memory, and takes the form of small rectangular green circuit boards with memory chips and integrated circuits on them, each with a different value or capacity. These boards are commonly referred to as ‘sticks.’ RAM does not actually contain your data, so removing or replacing them one at a time or all at once will not make you lose your files. Think of them more as the workhorses that access and retrieve your data. The more ‘horses’ you have, the faster you’ll be able to move data around, and the faster your programs and computer in general will run.;
, To do this, go to START >> Control Panel >> System. This will bring up a window headed ‘View Basic Information About Your Computer.’ At the bottom it will show your computer’s vital specs, such as OS type, processor speed etc. Look where it says “Memory (RAM):” This will tell you how much RAM your computer currently has.

, Unplug your computer and open up the casing so you can look inside. Most computers only open up on one side. Look at the back first and look for the screws which hold the side casing on. The screws on one side may be bigger than on the other and can be unscrewed using just your fingers. If not, use a screwdriver. Once all the screws are off, test each side to see which comes off by laying your computer down on one side, and pressing inwards with the heel of your hand on the back of the panel on the other side, and pulling inwards and backwards hard. The side panel should slide off.

, You may need a flashlight for this. The RAM boards are a series of green boards inserted into sockets parallel to each other. Look for empty slots. Most computers have a limit to the amount of RAM you can install. Modern PCs in 2010 can take up to 16 GB, but models from even a year or two ago usually hold less than 4GB max.

, There is no such thing as ‘Off the peg’ RAM – each make and model of computer requires a different kind. To find out what kind you need, locate your computer’s model number (usually stamped on the front under the brand name, or printed on the back.) Write your brand and model number down and take it with you to the computer shop. Ask the assistant and they’ll look it up for you. You can also Google it online (Google: BRAND + MODEL NUMBER + RAM).

, Once you’re back home with your new RAM, unplug your computer and open it again. Make extra sure it’s completely unplugged, never open up your computer while it is plugged in as you’ll risk serious electric shock. Once its’ unplugged, lie it down on its side with the open side facing upwards. You are now ready to install your extra memory.

, Acid and other nasties on our skin can corrode the delicate gold plating and actually disable that ‘pin’. If you have a 1GB card and you run your fingers down half of the pins, you may lose 512MB in computing power.

, You will have to get rid of any static electricity which all humans conduct, so in order to do so simply grab hold of a metal object which is touching the ground to discharge any static electricity you may have conducted.


How to know if you’ve given your computer a static shock? As soon as you touch part of your computer without a grounding bracelet, you may feel that little ‘crack’ of electricity you get when doing laundry or walking on nylon carpet. Congratulations, you’ve just fried part of your computer. Don’t say we didn’t warn you!

, If you need to remove the old RAM, look at the ends of the RAM, where it joins with the slot. You’ll see tiny white ribbed clips. Press down on these one at a time and pull them backwards, away from the RAM. They should unfasten and pop outwards. Do this at each end, then get a firm grip on the RAM, holding it between your pinched thumb and forefinger at each end of the board (never pull it out by the middle or you could snap the board) and pull firmly upward to remove it.

, Make sure the white clips are wide open at both ends before inserting the memory. You might find you have to push the boards in quite hard. Don’t be afraid of pushing with moderate force, but before you start pushing, make absolutely sure the boards are the right way around and that they are correctly seated in the slot. Then, push the board in by putting firm and even pressure on both opposite ends of the board with the pads of your thumbs and pressing hard downwards. Use slow and steady pressure without jerking. You’ll know the boards are fully seated when you’ll see both white clips automatically lock onto the sides with an audible ‘click.’

, Get a can of compressed air and blow dust out of your PC. All computers suck in dust as they have a fan at the back which keeps the graphics card or processor cool. This problem gets worse if the tower is kept on the floor. Opening up your computer and turning it on its side will redistribute the dust and let even more in. This could be bad if dust gets into moving parts or settles in places which may get hot. Never use a vacuum cleaner as the suction will be too powerful and you may suck up wires and cause serious damage to your computer.

, Screw the side panel back on and reattach all power cords on cables. Turn your computer on. Navigate back to the Control Panel and check to see that the amount of RAM listed has gone up. Congratulations! You have successfully installed your RAM! You may now enjoy faster operation, better multi-tasking and less frequent freezes and crashes. Nice work!

Windows - Press ⊞ Win+Pause to open your System Properties window. Your installed RAM will be listed in the System section.
Mac - Click the Apple menu and select ""About This Mac"". Your installed RAM will be displayed in the Memory entry.;
, There are several factors that will dictate how much RAM your system can support, including your operating system and motherboard limits:If you are using Windows, a 32-bit version can support up to 4 GB, while a 64-bit version can support up to 128 GB. You can check what version of Windows you have by pressing ⊞ Win+Pause and looking for the ""System type"" entry.
Even if your computer supports up to 128 GB, there's a good chance that your motherboard doesn't support that much. You'll need to check the documentation for your motherboard or run an online system scanner (Crucial.com has a good one) to see how much memory your motherboard supports.
Mac users will need to check their documentation to see how much their computer support as it varies significantly from model to model. If you don't have the documentation anymore, you can look up the specs of your model on the Apple support site.
See this guide for more details on determining the maximum amount of RAM your computer supports.

, RAM, actually short for SDRAM, has gone through several revisions over the years. The standard these days is DDR3 RAM, but if you are upgrading an older computer, you may need DDR2 or even DDR. If this is the case, you will likely want to consider upgrading the entire computer, as older types of RAM are getting increasingly expensive.


You can determine what type your computer uses by referring to the documentation or running a tool like CPU-Z, a freeware utility that analyzes your system.
DDR3 is the standard as of this writing, but DDR4 will be available soon for high-end enthusiast PCs.

, RAM comes in a variety of different speeds. If there are multiple speeds installed, your entire system will clock down to the lowest speed present. This can actually hurt your performance, even if you are adding RAM.The clock speed of RAM is measured in megahertz (MHz). Motherboards typically support a range of clock speeds.
If you use CPU-Z to check your memory clock speed, you will need to multiply the displayed MHz value by two, since CPU-Z doesn't display the memory multiplier.
All installed RAM should be the same speed for the best performance.

, Nearly all RAM should be installed in pairs. The total value of each module should be within the limits of your motherboard. For example, if you are installing 8 GB of RAM, you'll need to install either two 4 GB modules or four 2 GB modules. If your motherboard has an 8 GB limit, it likely won't support a single 8 GB memory module.


RAM often comes packaged in pairs to make purchasing easier.

, Most desktop computers use DIMM RAM, while most laptops use SO-DIMM, which is smaller. The notable exception is many iMacs, which also use SO-DIMM. Other than form-factor, most of the other specifications discussed in this section apply to both desktop and laptop memory.

, Unplug the power cable. If you need to move the computer to access it easier, remove all the cables from the back. Place the desktop on its side somewhere that gives you easy access. Lay it down with the ports on the back closest to to the table.

, Some cases have thumbscrews for easy opening, while older cases typically require a Phillips head screwdriver. Slide the panel off or pull it open after removing the screws.


Make sure to remove the panel that allows access to the motherboard. You can determine which panel to remove by looking for the I/O ports on the back of the computer. These ports include monitor, Ethernet, speaker, USB, and more. They are connected to the motherboard, so remove the panel on the opposite side.

, Anytime you work inside a computer, you risk emitting an electrostatic discharge that could damage your components. You can reduce this risk by wearing an anti-static wriststrap, or by grounding yourself before working in the computer. Touching a metal water tap will ground you.

, If you are replacing RAM, pop out the old modules by pressing down on the latches on each end of the module. The RAM module should pop out of the slot, allowing you to lift it directly out.

, Many motherboards have four slots for RAM, but pairs are typically not installed directly next to each other. For example, the slots may be laid out as A1, B1, A2, B2 and you would install your first pair on A1 and B1. Refer to your motherboard documentation to ensure that you know which slots to use.


If you don't have your documentation handy, you can often tell which slots are pairs by looking at the coloring. They may be labeled on the edge, which each label etched onto the motherboard. These labels may be small, so you may have to look closely.

, Push each module directly into the slot, ensuring that the notches at the bottom line up. Apply even pressure directly to the top of the module until it is inserted and the latches snap into place on each side. Do not force the modules in or you may break them.


Nearly all RAM is installed in pairs. Most computers will have difficulty with a single RAM stick.







, With the RAM installed, close up your computer and screw the case panel back into place. Plug all of the cables back in.

, Turn on your computer and allow it to boot into your operating system. You may be prompted to continue due to your new RAM installation.


If your computer runs into a serious error at this point, the RAM may be improperly installed, or there may be an errors with one of your new modules. See this guide for instructions on testing your RAM modules.

, Open your computer's system information to verify that the RAM was properly installed and is being used. Double-check that the amount is being displayed correctly.


Windows - Open the System Properties window by pressing ⊞ Win+Pause. Verify your installed RAM in the System section.
Mac - Click the Apple menu and select ""About This Mac"". Verify your installed RAM in the Memory entry.

, To ensure that you don't cause any damage, remove the battery as well (if possible). Make sure to unplug the laptop from the power adapter.

, Most laptops allow you to swap out RAM through a panel on the bottom of the laptop. You will need a small Phillips screwdriver to access this panel. The panel is often marked by a small image of a RAM module.


You may have to remove multiple panels in order to access the RAM.







, Anytime you work inside a computer, you risk emitting an electrostatic discharge that could damage your components. You can reduce this risk by wearing an anti-static wriststrap, or by grounding yourself before working in the laptop. Touching a metal water tap will ground you.

, Most laptops only have one or two slots for memory modules. You may need to remove your existing RAM if you intend to upgrade. You can remove the ram by detaching the latches on each side, which will pop the RAM up at a 45 degree angle. This allows you to pull the module straight out.

, Insert at a 45 degree angle and then push down to secure. Make sure that the notches line up. If you try to install the RAM upside down, it will not fit. Do not try to force the ram into its slot.


Not all laptops need pairs of RAM modules. Check your laptop's documentation for details/







, Once you have installed your new RAM, close up and secure the RAM access panel.

, Turn on your computer and allow it to boot into your operating system. You may be prompted to continue due to your new RAM installation.


If your computer runs into a serious error at this point, the RAM may be improperly installed, or there may be an errors with one of your new modules. See this guide for instructions on testing your RAM modules.

Backup any data that you want to keep-resizing partitions can cause data losss/corruption.,
Open gparted and click on your swap partition (right click) press swap off .,
Now you need to shrink a partition next to it by the same size that you want to increase your swap partition by.,
You now have more swap.",How to Adjust Virtual Memory3," Boot from live cd-it needs to have gparted on it.it should detect that you have linux installed and will use the swap space.

, this dismounts swap so you can increase the size of it.

, So in my case i have 4gb ram and 4gb swap. I need 8gb swap. So i reduce the partition next to swap by 4gb. the unallocated (greyed out) space should be next to the partition. (This may be done by booting through CD ROM and un-mounting the partitions). Now click on the partition (the bar at the top of gparted) and select resize. Include your unallocated space. click swapon-restart.

,
Warnings!!!
always have backups-not just when you are changing the system
-dont delete the swap partition- it is harder (at least for me) to create a new one so that everything works.

Press the “Next” button to begin the burning process.

, Once it’s done, click on the “Finish” button and the DVD disc will automatically eject from the drive, completing the process.

Know the limitations imposed by Windows.,
Back up any important files on the thumb drive.,
Download Bootice.,
Extract the Bootice file.,
Run the Bootice program.,
Ensure your USB drive is selected.,
Click the ""Parts Manage"" button in Bootice.,
Click the ""Re-Partitioning"" button.,
Select ""USB-HDD Mode (Multi-Partitions)"" and click ""OK."" This will open the Partition Settings window.

,
Set the size of each of the partitions.,
Give the partitions labels.,
Set the partition table type.,
Click ""OK"" to begin the format.,
Start using your active partition.,
Set your active partition in Bootice.",How to Partition a Thumb Drive1," While you can use third-party tools to make a multi-partition thumb drive, Windows will only ever be able to read from the first partition. You can use the same tools to change which partition is visible, but only one will be visible at a time. There is no way around this in Windows.

There is no way to create multiple partitions on a USB drive using the Disk Management tool. You must use a third-party utility.
If you plug the USB drive into a Linux or Mac computer, all of the partitions will be visible.;
, When you partition the drive, you will lose all the data stored on it, so move any important files to your computer's hard drive before beginning.

, This utility will allow you to create multiple partitions on the USB drive, as well as switch the active partition in Windows.


You can download Bootice from majorgeeks.com/files/details/bootice.html


, You'll need a program that can open RAR files in order to extract Bootice.


7-Zip is a free archive program that can extract RAR files. You can download it from 7-zip.org. Once you've installed 7-Zip, right-click on the downloaded RAR file and select ""7-Zip"" → ""Extract Here.""
The free version of WinRAR rarlabs.com can open RAR files as well, but the program has a trial period.

, You'll find this in the folder that was created when you extracted the file. You'll likely be prompted by Windows to confirm that you want to run the program.

, Click the ""Destination Disk"" menu and select your USB drive. Make sure your computer's hard drive is not selected, or you could lose all of your data. Use the size and the drive letter to determine that you've selected the correct drive.

, This will open the Partition Manager section of the program.

, This will open the ""Removable disk repartitioning"" window.

,, By default, the available space will be split evenly between four partitions. You can appropriate this however you'd like. If you want less than four partitions, set the ones you don't want to ""0.""

, These labels will help you identify the different partitions. Remember, Windows will only show one partition at a time, so having unique labels can be helpful.

, At the bottom of the window, you can choose between MBR and GPT table types. MBR is fine if you're just planning on using the partitions for data, or to boot older systems. Select GPT if you want to boot computers with UEFI or want to use the more modern system.


If you plan on booting from the GPT USB drive, check the ""Create ESP partition"" box.

, You'll be warned that all data will be deleted on the drive. The format process should only take a few moments to complete.

, Once the format is complete, the first partition will appear in Windows as a removable drive. You can use this partition just like you would a USB drive.

, Since Windows will only ever show one partition on the USB drive, you can use Bootice to change which partition is displayed. This won't affect any of the data on the partitions, and you can switch whenever you'd like.Select the partition you want to make active in the Partition Manager section of Bootice.
Click the ""Set Accessible"" button. After a moment, the active partition will switch and Windows will show the new partition.

In Device Manager, go to the Drives section and select your USB flash drive.,
Select Policies and check Optimize for Performance.

,
Try not to just pull out the drive, especially for iPods; you need to left-click on the Safely Remove Hardware icon in your system tray, and select your flash drive.,
You may find that after clicking on the Safely Remove Hardware icon in your system and select the drive you wish to remove, your system may respond to the effect that The device cannot be removed at this time"".,Close all applications and try again,

,
Shut down your computer.,
Close all applications, and using Task Manager, end explorer.exe.,
First, select explorer.exe from the task list, and click to End Process.,
Do this again.

,
If you receive an End Program dialog in a moment, you can answer affirmatively and Explorer will restart.,
If not, then choose explorer.exe again, and choose End Task.

,
This time, answer yes.

,
You will probably have to restart Explorer by choosing New Task in Task Manager.

,
Fill in Explorer and your taskbar should reappear.

,
Now you should be able to choose ""Safely Remove Hardware"", and when selecting your device it should report that it can be 'safely removed'.

,
Note - After restarting Explorer, some of your system tray icons may not reappear.,
Restarting Explorer can cause data loss if open applications have not saved their data.

,
Also note, some data devices come with their own utility software.",How to Prevent a USB Flash Drive from Corrupting the Files and Folders Within It,";
,, Only after Windows tells you that you can remove the drive, should you do so.

, This indicates that either files are open, Windows has not completely written data to the device, or Windows will just not tolerate ejecting the device at this time. There are two fairly simple ways to resolve this:

,, Okay, this is not usually convenient, so:

, You can try this method to restart it:

After the download, click the “Burn” app icon (black and yellow circle) inside the folder to launch it.

, Type in any name you want for your DVD disc on the text field provided. You can use alphanumeric characters when naming your disc.

, This will allow you to choose what kind of CD you’ll be burning. From the drop-down list, select DVD-Video since you’re making a DVD disc.

,, Here, click the “Region” drop-down menu and select “NTSC” from the list.


Doing this sets the file format of the DVD disc you’re about to create so that DVD players will be able to read your disc. Press the red button at the upper left of the Options window to close it.

, Open it and select the video file. Once you’ve selected it, drag it over to the Burn window. Wait for a few moments while Burn loads the video file.


If an “Incompatible file” prompt appears as you move the video file to Burn’s window, simply click on “Convert” button on the prompt, and this will change the video file to a format the program recognizes.

, On the next window, select the right copying speed to burn the DVD. Click on the “Speed” drop-down list and select “4x.”


This will ensure you that the video will be copied to the DVD disc using the right speed without compromising quality. Click on “Burn” button again to begin the process.
Once the process is done, a DVD shortcut icon will be created on your desktop.

You can use your index finger to click the left button and the middle finger to click the right one.
On the bottom of the mouse is a censor that allows the mouse to know where to move.
A wireless mouse may have a compartment to insert a battery, and it may have an on and off button.;
, You may have issues with the mouse if it is not on a mousepad, such as it not scrolling smoothly.

, You don’t want to hang on to the mouse too tightly or click with a lot of force. Keep your fingers relaxed, and keep the mouse at elbow level. If your fingers become tired, take breaks from the computer.

, Your mouse will have a cable extending from it, or it will come with a small USB connector if it is wireless. USB ports are located in different areas for every computer, but in general, laptops will have USB ports on the left or right side of the keyboard; most desktops will have a USB on the front or back of the modem or either side of the monitor.


Look for a small square port about the size of your USB connector.

Determine what types of services do you need for your data storage needs?,
Dedicated Servers - A dedicated server is a leased server located within a secure data center environment that is dedicated only to your website and applications.,
Find and contact a data center.",How to Pick the Best Data Center For Your Purposes,"


The most common data center services are (including a short description):

Cloud - In simple terms, the cloud is the Internet. It is a network of servers that perform specialized tasks such as running applications or storing data. As an end user, you use the computing power and resources of the servers in the cloud rather than your own computer or device. There is no need to install or download software. As a business, you can place applications and data in the cloud as an alternative to colocation or dedicated servers. The cloud uses the pay-per-use model, also referred to utility pricing.
Colocation - is leased space within a secure off-site data center where customer owned servers and network equipment are hosted. The customer retains control over the operation and maintenance of their servers and hardware. The data center provides the infrastructure needed to keep servers running with minimal downtime. This includes space, power, bandwidth, cooling, security and redundant systems.
Content Delivery - Content Deliver Network (CDN) technology boosts the speed at which content is transferred to your end users. CDN works by replicating your content and placing it on potentially thousands of server Points of Presence (PoPs) locations around the world. By doing this, your content becomes more reliable and readily available to your end users because they can access it from the server location closest to them. In addition, if several users request the same content at the exact same time, it will be made available without delay or time-out issues - along with optimal bandwidth speeds.
CDNs are used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to deliver web pages, but this technology is also very useful to enterprises for the delivery of downloadable media, mobile media, software, documents, applications, and especially the real-time streaming of audio, video and television.
Data Storage - Enterprise data storage and backup are no longer a choice, but an absolute necessity and one of the foundations of a solid disaster recovery plan. Whether your business stores employee records, financial details, assets, customer records or everything about the company, it is imperative that you have something in place to guard against data loss. Every year, businesses are caught off guard and suffer productivity and financial loss due to data being lost or damaged.

;
, There are often many different server hardware configurations available from low cost value dedicated servers to enterprise class servers. A few of the important hardware considerations include: processor type and speed, RAM, storage, operating system (OS), firewall, bandwidth, managed service level. Learn about dedicated servers and how to determine server, power and bandwidth requirements.


Disaster Recovery - The old adage “better safe than sorry” applies to a lot of things in life – including the development of a company Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery plan (a.k.a. BC/DR plan). In the event of a natural or man-made disaster, having a solid formalized BC/DR plan focusing on replicating and restoring your business operation will alleviate a lot of stress and keep your business operations going should something disastrous happen.

A BC/DR plan essentially works to protect and save the business that you have spent so much time building and covers restoration and replication of your business’ power, technology, office space and connectivity. It is ultimately designed to protect you from the unknown, and because you never know what lies ahead, having a BC/DR plan is always in your business’ best interests.


Managed Hosting - With managed hosting, the majority of the server administration is handled by the provider. Managed hosting has been described as a glorified dedicated server with extended features and support. As with a dedicated server, you get your choice of operating system, routing equipment, network connectivity and administrative control. However, managed server hosting takes care of much more than what’s offered with dedicated hosting. Depending on the provider, managed hosting plans can include a wide range of services such as data storage and backup, security and firewalls, database administration, load balancing and around the clock support.

, There are thousands of data centers around the world, and contacting them all would be nearly impossible.


Several search engines are available that give you location and name, but do not tell you what type of services the center offers.
Using a search engine like data centers allows you to find the best data center for your needs, while giving you comprehensive information about the center and contact information.
As storage needs increase, more and more services become available, picking the best data center for your needs will become very important in the here and now, as well as the future.

Select the auto choosing function where the scanner decides whether to scan in black and white, grayscale or color.,
You have a book with a lot of images, try doing the scanning in the usual way.,
You are exasperated with the progress you are making, try this space efficient method: scan a good portion of the book, about one-third, in black and white.,
Go thru the 100 scans and delete all pages with images.,
Scan, again, but in grayscale the first 100 pages of the book.,
Go thru the second batch of scans and delete all the pages that have just text.

,
Combine the 1) black and white and 2) grayscale folders.,
Before scanning the next batch (pages 101 to 200), check the first batch for errors.,
Sometimes the long way of doing things is faster, maybe give this method a try if you are space conscious.

,
If space is not a problem, another option would be to scan the whole book in grayscale.",How to Scan a Book With Many Images," If your scanner can correctly choose what to save your scan as, this article is not for you.;
, The usual way is to change the setting, from black and white to grayscale, when you come upon a page with an image. However, you will notice that instead of being able to scan a book in one session, you are on going on several sessions. It will be very tiring to constantly change the settings back and forth from: 1) black and white to grayscale and 2) from one-sided to two-sided. Note: scanning, in this context is just the first step in the whole process, where the separated pages of the book are fed into the scanner. This does not include: separating the book into individual pages, creating file folders, checking scans for mistakes, re-scanning, converting the files to PDF, stacking and checking the final product.

, Scan every page. In this example your book has a total of 300 pages and you will scan the first 100 pages. Normally when scanning a book with 300 pages, scan the book in its entirety, however with this project there will be a greater propensity for error, so dividing the project into parts is recommended.

, Save this file in a separate folder.

, Scan every page. Note: for those of you new to scanning, to achieve the maximum in clarity, pages with images must be scanned in either grayscale or color.

,, Arrange the combined file by name. The two files combined will complement each other and fit together perfectly. To arrange a folder by their names: put the cursor in the file folder: right click the mouse - Arrange Icons By - Name. Arrange the files in ascending order.

, It is important to have the initial scans in Tiff format because it is easy to navigate through Tiff files.

,, This option would be the quickest, but be aware that a scanned book in grayscale would be almost eight times larger in size than one scanned in black and white. The text in each grayscale page will be pale, so with Windows Live Photo Gallery go to: Fix - Adjust Exposure and to Highlights. To darken the text on each page individually move the slider bar in Highlights. Repeat this process for every page.

",How to Save Your Computer Accessories," When you type, lightly tap the keys instead. Not only will this ensure that your keyboard lasts much longer, it is also better for your fingers and wrists.;
, Do not pick it up and drop it, especially if you have a digital mouse, as this can move the sensor out of place. Clean your ball mouse if you have one:


Turn your ball mouse upside-down and unscrew the cap;
Take out the ball;
Take a toothpick, cotton swab, or your finger, and clean off the three (3) small long rings inside of your ball mouse. Turn each ring slowly several times to make sure there is nothing left on the rings.
Replace parts and use the ball mouse again.

, When turning up volume, do it gently. Make sure the speakers are away from edges, so that they do not fall off the sides, which can badly damage them. Keep them away from heat sources as well.

, Make sure you have your screen saver turned on. If you use your computer often, consider setting the time to two-three (2-3) minutes before the screen saver comes on. Clean your screen at least once a week. Other ways to keep the monitor in good condition include:


Turn off your monitor at night or when not in use.
Take a window spray, such as Windex, and lightly spray it on your screen.
Immediately wipe screen vertically with a newspaper, or any other soft cloth that you may prefer. (Do not use paper towels, as they can scratch the screen, and small pieces can break off which, if not removed immediately, dry on your screen.)

, Use an appropriate cleaning product, such as a can of dust remover to spray to clean your computer parts. Parts should include: mouse, keyboard, speakers, modem, etc. To spray the mouse, simply remove the cap and spray in the hole for three-five (3-5) seconds. To spray the keyboard, simply turn your keyboard upside down and gently shake for several seconds. This will remove any large debris that may have gotten caught in your keyboard. Then simply tilt your keyboard at a 45 degree angle, and spray down each row of keys.

,


Shut down your computer completely.
Remove all cords from the back of the computer case.
Remove the outside casing from your computer. Look in your computer manual for further instructions on how to do this.
Spray all chips and parts in your computer. Warning: do not touch the chips with your hands, as this can badly damage them. If easily accessible, use dry cotton swabs to clean the fans and metal casings.
Replace all parts and cords, and start your computer.

, If you have small children in the house, you should always keep your computer up high and away from the edges, so that there are no dangers of any parts falling on them. If you cannot place your computer out of the way of small children, place a small child-safety fence in all doorways surrounding the computer, or a small fence around your computer/computer desk.

Ask yourself if there are any alternate ways to printing you could use to send information.",How to Decide Whether to Print Something Out," If you don't, your printout could stop halfway until you have more paper. If you have something more important to print out, consider doing that first.;
, This is for the same reasons as before.

, Unnecessary or even 'pointless' printing costs money you don't need to spend and harms the environment.

, Can you e-mail, text, or put the information on a flash drive or CD instead of printing it? For example, if you are sending a chart to someone, you can usually just attach it to an e-mail or put it on a flash drive and give it to them in person, instead of using paper.

Materials: Boards of 2”x4”x8’ Wood, Powered Screw Driver and Screws 2” long, 50 lb.,
Cut the 9 boards, measured at 2”x4”x8’, into the following parameters: 2 Boards at 8’ ( Not cuts required ), 2 Boards at 6’, 4 Boards at 5’6”, and 1 Board into two 2’8’’ pieces.

,
Take the 4 boards at 5’6” and cut 45 degree angles on each ends, so that the cuts are not parallel.

,
Find the midpoint of a 8’ board, mark it, and line up with a 6’ board’s 2x4 area so that it makes a flush ’T.’ Screw two screws going from the 8’ board into the 6’ board.,
Take two of the newly cut boards, with the 45 degree angles and place them so that the touch connect with the base and vertical boards simultaneously.,
Repeat steps 3 and 4 with the other half of the wood to have two identical support structures.

,
Using the one 2’8” boards, screw one perpendicular anterior to the base just below the 45 degree angle board, and with the other end of the 2’8” board attach it to the second structure created in step 5.,
Measure 5 feet up on both vertical boards.,
Drill a hole on both sides of the Fresnel Lens frame at the midpoint which should be at the 12” mark on a 24”x24” lens.,
Using the 1/2 threaded bolts feed them through the Fresnel Lens frame and into the vertical supports we made in steps 1 - 5.,

, Use Spacers to get the Fresnel Lens a taught feel, but not too taught that it’s fully immobilized.

, With the open end facing up fill it with sand until about 2” covers the bottom.

, To find the focal point have the face of the lens directly face the sun. (Note: Temperatures at the focal point can exceed 1600 degrees Celsius on a clear day).

, If melting is taking place then we have prime conditions and can move forward.

, Carefully move the box slowly to disperse the focal point into a design for the first layer.

, Layers of sand should be added at about 1/8” per level. By sprinkling the sand is small stages this will allow for more preciseness of the levels of melted silicon(sand) on top of itself.

, Center most of your first layers into a covered circle, and having following layers increased to rings that steadily have increasing diameters as the layers increase.

",How to Clear a Paper Jam on an HP Inkjet Printer," The paper tray is one of the most likely spots to get a paper jam. If you notice any loose paper in the paper tray, remove it. If any paper got stuck while feeding from the tray into the printer, gently pull it back out of the printer to remove it.


Press the Resume button on the printer if this is the only spot that paper jammed.;
, This will allow you to look into the printer to see where paper may be jammed. There should be a knob or a clasp that will release the door and allow you to take it off.


Pull out any paper that is stuck in the rollers in the back of the printer. Make sure all of the paper has been removed, including any scraps of paper or ripped pieces.
Replace the rear access door onto the printer. If there is no other paper stuck in the printer, press the Resume button.

, Remove any additional paper jams. Pull any paper out very slowly, to minimize the risk of damaging the printer.

, It must be able to move freely from one side of the printer to the other.


Unplug the power cord and gently move the carriage from side to side. Do not force it if it is stuck or hung up on something.
Rotate the rollers inside the printer for 3 full rotations with your fingers if the printer carriage is not moving freely. Roll them in the upwards direction and make sure everything inside the printer can move easily, without getting stuck.

Channel number: This is a unique path where two nodes communicate with each other.
WEP key (optional): This stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy. WEP encrypts data as it travels from one end point to another one via radio waves.;
, If you have more than one computer that will be using the wireless printer server, you will need to install this printer software on each one.

, The window should display two options:


Automatically obtain an IP address (DHCP): DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. This protocol dynamically allocates IP addresses from a server, which contains a pool of open IP addresses. The network device borrows one of the IP addresses for a certain amount of time. After the time has run out, then the server will lend out another available IP address for the network device. This option is usually the default. Keep this option if you don’t want to use a static IP address. This protocol allows you to add more network devices to the network without having to do any configurations.
Set IP configuration manually: If you are running multiple computers or servers, choose this option. The IP address will not automatically change and it also enables you to solve network problems when you have more than one PC operating from the same gateway PC or router.

Using force may permanently damage the print head.

, To remove paper, grasp it firmly and pull very slowly. If the paper tears, it can spread paper fibers that interfere with printing. Pulling too roughly can also cause injury, as even a powered-off printer may pinch or scrape your fingers.


Use tweezers to reach narrow areas. Pull even more slowly when using tweezers, and alternate tugging from the left and right ends of the paper.
Whenever possible, pull in the direction the paper would travel through the printer.
If there's no way to avoid tearing, grab the paper from both ends of the jam. Try to catch hold of all torn pieces.

, If the paper is still stuck, follow the instructions for your printer model to remove the print head or the ink cartridges. Gently tug out torn paper scraps, or grasp intact crumpled paper with both hands and pull gently downward.


If you don't have your printer manual, search online for ""manual"" and the name of your printer model.

, On inkjet printers, paper sometimes gets stuck in mechanisms near the output tray. Look into the slot feeding the output tray and gently remove any visible paper.


Some models have a knob that will enlarge this slot, making removal easier.

, If the printer still will not function, you can try taking it all apart to search for paper. Because there are many different models of printer, you should look for specific instructions in your user manual. Search online or contact the printer manufacturer if you do not have a manual.


Many printers have a basic way to remove the back panel and/or the input tray, which are good places to start. Check for movable access panels on the back, and a plastic tab deep inside the input tray.

, If you've removed the bulk of the paper but still have printing issues, run a print head cleaning process. This should get rid of paper microfibers clogging the nozzles.


Close all access panels and return all trays before you print again.

, During laser printing, the paper passes between two heated rollers, called the ""fuser.""If the paper has jammed in or near the fuser, wait at least thirty minutes for it to cool down. The fuser reaches dangerously high temperatures.


Some printer models recommend waiting at least thirty minutes.

, In a laser printer, one of the front or top covers will usually expose the print cartridge. If you have not yet found the paper, pull out the cartridge carefully. Most just pull out. A few may require disengaging a latch or a pair of latches.

, Hold the paper with both hands if possible. Pull very slowly, to avoid tearing the paper. Continue patiently until the paper is freed. If the paper does not move, move on to the next step. Do not use force.


If you can't reach the paper, use wide grip tweezers.

, Paper jams often occur as the paper passes between the two rollers. If the rollers turn easily when touched, rotate them slowly until the paper is free. If the jamming is complex, with multiple folds or tears, look for the mechanism attaching the roller to the rest of the printer. Carefully remove one roller and lift it out of the printer, freeing the paper.


It's best to follow user manual instructions. Do not try to force the mechanism.
Many models use rollers attached with a ""hole and pin"" latch. Push down on the pin to release the roller.

, If the paper still won't come out, refer to your printer manual for instructions on further disassembly. If you've removed all the paper but the printer still won't print, hire a printer repair service to inspect parts for replacement.

This may be worth trying again later in the process, if you have managed to remove some paper but still can't print.

, Turn off the printer and let it finish its shutdown process. Wait a few moments, then turn it back on again. Sometimes a printer will clear the jam itself during its start-up cycle. Resetting a printer can get it to recheck the paper path and stop detecting a jam that is no longer there.

, Many printers have a small screen that displays a line or two of text. When jammed, such printers may try to give you an idea of where the jam is and what to do next. Follow the on-screen instructions and the user manual to reduce the chance of damaging your printer.

, Make sure the trays are loaded, but not overloaded, with paper. Sometimes too much or too little paper will register as a jam. Try to print again after reducing paper stacks below the recommended maximum for your model.

, Remove all paper from trays. Fully open all trays and access panels until you find the jam. If a panel won't open with gentle pressure, look for a release latch or consult the manual.



Warning: Do not reach into the printer while it is still on. This can cause serious injury.
Some drawer-style trays can be fully removed. Look for a release catch.
It may help to use a mirror when checking trays and panels in the back.
If possible, have the printer moved away from the wall to allow for more access.

, Turn off the printer. Allow to cool for at least thirty minutes, or confirm with your user manual that the mechanism around the paper jam is a safe temperature.


For added safety, unplug the printer.

, When you find the paper, slowly pull it out with both hands. If you have a choice, tug from the end with the most paper sticking out. Do not use force, since tearing the paper could cause more problems.


If you cannot remove it, contact the people in charge of the office printer's repair.

, Dirty mechanisms are a less common cause than actual paper jams, but cleaning may be worth a try if you don't see any stuck paper. Refer to the owner's manual to avoid causing harm.

, Attach all trays and close all panels before you turn on the printer. After turning it on, give it time to finish its start up cycle.

If it's a laser printer, wait 10-30 minutes before reaching inside (or up to an hour for some models). Parts inside can get dangerously hot.

, Shine a flashlight into the inner workings, near the input tray. You should see a long cylindrical rubber object, or a rod with small rubber objects attached to it. These rubber parts are the rollers that feed the paper into the machine.

If you do not see the rollers, try turning the paper upside down, or opening a back or side panel. You may need to check the manual to figure out how to remove these panels.
If your roller is clearly broken, that's the source of your problem. Refer to your printer manual or contact the manufacturer to find out whether your roller is replaceable.

, If your printer displays a ""paper jam"" error message when there's no paper stuck inside, there's probably some other blockage. Inspect the length of this roller for objects that have fallen into the printer. Remove these with tweezers or by turning the printer upside down., Dust and stuck debris on the rollers can cause a paper jam error. Cleaning can help, but the type of cleaning supplies you need depends on your printer type:

Laser printers contain toner particles that can irritate lungs. Wear a mask that filters fine particles, and buy a special toner cloth that picks up most of these particles. Moisten it with 99% isopropyl alcohol.(Some rollers crack when exposed to alcohol. You may want to check your printer manual for advice, or use distilled water instead.)Inkjets printers are easier to clean. Use any lint-free cloth (such as microfiber) and moisten it slightly with isopropyl alcohol, or distilled water if you don't want to risk damage.
For extremely dirty feed rollers, use a special rubber rejuvenator product. Read all safety instructions first. These products can cause serious skin and eye damage, and corrode plastic parts of the printer., Swab the feed rollers with your slightly damp cloth. If your rollers don't rotate, snap out the clips holding them in and remove them so you can clean every side.Toner cloth tears easily. Move slowly to avoid leaving shreds behind that can clog your printer.

, Jams can also happen at other parts of the printer. Remove the printer tray and any other removable covers. All laser printers and some inkjets have a second pair of rollers near the output tray.A paper jam error could mean an object has fallen against these.


Warning: The ""output rollers"" on the laser printers get hot enough to cause burns. These are actually ""fusers"" which bake the ink onto the paper.

Warning: These rollers are close to delicate machinery, and on laser printers they require special treatment. It's best to refer to your printer manual for precise cleaning instructions.

Place the microphone behind the main speakers and in front of the monitors.,
Do not cup the microphone.,
Utilize a feedback eliminator.,
Use a graphic equalizer.,
Utilize the parametric equalizer on the channel strip.,
Treat the acoustics of the room.",How to Prevent Microphone Feedback," If the monitors are too far off to the side of the mic, there can be feedback due to the pickup pattern of live vocal mics. It's best to place the monitor directly behind the mic.;
, Many singers have the tendency to place their hand around the microphone when performing which can cause unpleasant, high-pitched feedback. Keep your hands at the back of the microphone. If you are walking around on stage, be careful not to go past the main speakers or point the microphone at the monitors at all.

, There are rack-mountable units that can be hooked up in the mains or monitor chain. Feedback eliminators have the ability to detect when feedback is about to increase and cut the exact frequency, thus eliminating the feedback.


This can be very helpful if your act involves switching vocalists and moving the microphone around on stage.

, A graphic equalizer allows a sound engineer to effectively prevent feedback from occurring during the performance -- a process known as ""ringing out"" the microphones. This is done before the show, during soundcheck.


During sound check, the vocalist sings through the microphone while the engineer increases the level slowly until feedback begins. Once it starts, the engineer will find the correct band on the graphic equalizer and try to lower the gain.
This process should be done with every microphone during soundcheck. On a high quality systems, there are usually 2 31-band graphic equalizers, 1 for the main mix and 1 for the monitor mix.

, Most high-end mixing boards have a mid-sweep parametric equalizer that can help if you need to pull out a specific frequency.


The bandwidth of a parametric equalizer is often much smaller than the bandwidth on a graphic equalizer, and allows for precise frequency control. Thus, it allows the engineer to pull out the frequency that's feeding back without compromising tone.

, This is only applicable if the venue belongs to you. Treating the acoustics can prevent excessive reverberation, which can potentially increase the chance of the mics feeding back.


Place foam above and on the back wall behind the stage to reduce stage volume. Consequently the monitors won't have to be as loud, thus decreasing the chance for feedback to occur.

, Other devices that use radio frequencies can interfere with your wireless mouse and keyboard. If possible, move appliances that have antennas, like televisions, AM/FM radios, baby monitors and cordless phones, to another area of your house. This can extend the range and signal strength of your wireless devices.

, Wireless devices transmit data to their receivers, which usually are docked in USB ports in the back of your PC's tower. If your mouse and keyboard aren't responding or are working intermittently, move the wireless receivers to ports in the front of the tower, if that provides a better line of sight between them.

, Even a slight adjustment of the tower position can have a positive effect on signal strength.

, You can attach a copper wire antenna directly to a receiver to extend its range. By running the antenna up a wall a few feet, you'll be able to use your wireless keyboard and mouse from more than 30 feet (9.1 m) away.

Measure in all 3 dimensions the maximum amount of space you're willing to allot for the printer. Do not exceed these measurements when you go out to purchase.;
, InkJet has been one of the most popular options for all-in-one printers for the past few years, particularly because they have a much lower upfront cost than laser printers. Inkjet printers also have a reputation for printing higher quality photographs than laser printers. However, inkjet printers are slower than laser printers and they perform poorly when printing something that has a low-quality or low-resolution source. Laser printers are better suited for printing quickly and printing in high volumes, but also tend to be larger in size.


If you are only going to print text documents, the laser printer is the better choice. They are fast, low-maintenance, and high quality. While inkjet printers can print at a similar quality, they print slower and require far more maintenance.
If you plan on printing in color often, the inkjet printer is the better choice. Unlike black and white printing, color printing on a laser printer requires 4 toners, which can bump up maintenance costs noticeably. On top of that, color laser printers are significantly more expensive upfront.
If you plan on printing photographs, the inkjet printer is the better choice. Laser printers are not good at printing on specialty papers, including photo stock, resulting in poor quality photographs. Inkjet printers, on the other hand, print very high quality photographs.

, If you are planning on doing photography work, then you'll want to buy a printer with a memory card reader slot for your camera's data card, which will allow you to print photos directly. Some printers are even equipped with an LCD screen for viewing and editing photos before printing. If photo printing is important to you, be sure to purchase a printer that has the ability to print on standard photo paper.

, If you ever plan on scanning an item into your computer, be sure you buy an all-in-one printer with a high quality scanner. Standard scanners often produce images with low quality. On the other hand, higher quality scanners tend to produce much cleaner and crisper pictures. Keep in mind that higher quality scanners will increase the price by a noticeable amount.

, Most all-in-one printers are equipped with the ability to fax. Some of the better models will allow you to store hundreds, even thousands, of fax numbers and use them for speed dialing. Some machines will have the capability to hold an outgoing fax until a scheduled time.

, Many high end all-in-one printer models come with built-in duplexer, which allow the printer to print on both sides of paper. Some models can print labels directly onto CDs and DVDs. More recently, all-in-one printers have been coming equipped with the ability to connect to the Internet in order to print content directly or to send printing jobs to remote printers.

, A lot of the lower end all-in-one printers typically support a single computer connected by a single USB cable. However, if you need an all-in-one printer for a larger network with multiple computers, then be sure to buy one that can be connected to a network. Higher end models often have Local Area Network, Bluetooth, and WiFi capabilities.


Keep in mind that some networked printers will only allow specific features (e.g., printing only) over a network. If you need to scan, fax, or copy over the network, make sure the printer you purchase is able to do so.

, Many of the specifications given by vendors, such as print speed and resolution, are tested using in-house methods. There is no standardization across companies and brands. Because of this, most of these specifications can be arbitrary and, therefore, useless for comparison.

Will the multifunction printer be used in the workplace or will the purchase primarily be for use at home? If you work at home, you will be using a multifunction printer more often than if the unit is just needed for occasional personal use.;
, If your job involves working with images and photos then a multifunction printer with a high resolution is a necessary feature.


Both laser and inkjet multifunction printers have the capability to print in color as well as black and white. Laser models tend to be more expensive but are able to print black and white text at a much faster rate per minute then the smaller, inkjet models. If your needs entail printing a large quantity of black and white documents and you need a fast turnaround, then consider getting the laser multifunction printer.
Understand that the larger multifunction printers that cost more usually have components that can handle the stress of ongoing, continuous use similar to commercial machines used in a traditional office with many employees. This is why the larger units generally have a higher capacity to handle more tasks, more efficiently, more quickly and more often.

Avoid ""all-in-one"" or multipurpose printers. These printers typically do not provide the same level of quality as a device dedicated to printing photo-quality images and graphics.;
, Resolution quality may be the most important factor in determining the quality of the final product. The resolution capability of an inkjet printer will range between 4800 and 9600 dots per inch (dpi). To achieve the highest quality image quality, purchase a printer capable of printing at 9600 dpi.

, Prices for a dedicated photo-printer can range from $100 to $6000 (USD). Depending on the intended application of the final product, the most expensive option may exceed your particular needs.

, Inkjet printers offer a variety of image size options. Smaller, compact photo printers can accommodate image sizes ranging from wallet-size to letter-size. Some desktop inkjet printers can print larger sizes, ranging between 17 inches (43 cm) and 24 inches (61 cm). Commercial printers can print even larger sizes.

, Sometimes the file that you're trying to copy is actually the one that's write-protected, not your USB drive. The error will be a little different, but looks pretty similar. You can change your file's attributes by doing the following:


Windows - Right-click the file and select ""Properties."" Uncheck the ""Read-only"" box and click ""Apply.""
Mac - Control-click the file and select ""Get Info."" Expand ""Sharing & Permissions"" and set the ""Privilege"" column to ""Read & Write"" for your user name.

, Whenever you plug a USB drive in, especially one that's been plugged into another computer, you should scan it for viruses. Many virus scanners can be configured to scan USB drives automatically when they're connected, or you can right-click on the drive and select ""Scan with Antivirus.""

, If every drive you insert in your computer becomes write protected, you may have a virus or malware infection.Run an antivirus scan on your entire computer using your antivirus program.
Download and run Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. You can download it for free from malwarebytes.org.
See Remove Malware for more detailed virus removal instructions.

, This is a free, open-source program designed to find problems with USB drives and Windows USB drivers. You can download UsbFix for free from fosshub.com/UsbFix.html.


Click ""Research"" after launching UsbFix.

, If your USB drive or SD card is stuck in Read Only mode, you may be able to fix its attributes using the Command Prompt.


Press Start.
Go to Accessories.
Right-click Command Prompt, then choose ""Run as Administrator"".

, This will launch the DiskPart utility in a separate Command Prompt window. You will likely be prompted by Windows to start it.

, This will display a list of the drives connected to your computer., All of the partitions connected to your computer will be displayed, including your internal hard drives. There are several columns of information you can use to identify the USB drive:


The Ltr column displays the associated drive letter for each partition. Not all partitions will have letters, such as recovery partitions.
If you've given the USB drive a name before, it will be listed in the Label column.
Look for Removable in the Type column.
The Size column can help you differentiate between two similar USB drives.

, Replace X with the number from the first column in the list for the USB drive or SD card you want to perform commands for. For example, if the USB drive is Disk 5, you'd type select disk 5.

, This will change your USB's properties so that it is no longer read-only.

, DiskPart will close, and you can try manipulating files on your USB drive again. You may have to eject and then reinsert the drive to get it working. If the Command Prompt didn't work, try the next method., If performing the DiskPart commands did not fix your USB drive, or every drive you connect becomes read-only, you may need to edit your Windows registry. The registry controls how Windows runs, so be very careful to only perform the actions described in this article.


To open the Registry Editor, press ⊞ Win+R and type regedit. If you're not an administrator, you'll be prompted for the administrator password.

, Expand and collapse the entries on the left to navigate to the following location:


HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\StorageDevicePolicies
If you don't have a StorageDevicePolicies folder in the Control folder, right-click in the folder and select ""New"" → ""Key."" Name it StorageDevicePolicies and then open it.

, This will open the Edit window.


If you don't have a WriteProtect entry because you just created StorageDevicePolicies, right-click in the folder and select ""New"" → ""DWORD (32-bit) value."" Name it WriteProtect and then save it. Double-click it to open the Edit window.

, This will disable write protection for all of your USB drives.

, The card or drive should now be writeable.

, If you've tried everything above and still can't remove the write protection, you may need to format the drive. This will delete all of the data on the drive, but may get it working again.

, You won't be able to properly format the write-protected drive unless you are in Safe Mode:Reboot your computer and hold F8. Select ""Safe Mode with Networking"" from the list of startup options.
See Start Windows in Safe Mode if you're having difficulties booting into Safe Mode.

, This windows displays all of the drives connected to your computer.


You can open this window from the Start menu, or by pressing ⊞ Win+E.

, This will open the Format window for the USB drive.

, This will make the drive compatible with the most computers and devices.


Select ""exFAT"" if the drive is larger than 32 GB.
Select ""NTFS"" if the drive is only going to be used in Windows.

, Windows will begin formatting the drive, which may take a while to complete.

, After formatting, see if you can read and write to the drive. If the problem is not fixed, the drive itself may be damaged., Your drive's permissions may have become corrupted. You can fix these using Disk Utility. You can find Disk Utility in the Utilities folder.

, The Disk Utility window should list your hard drive, CD drive, and any attached devices. Select the write-protected device.

, After confirming, OS X will begin scanning your drive and attempt to fix any problems. This may take a while to complete.


If you're using older versions of OS X, click the ""First Aid"" tab and then click the ""Repair Permissions"" button.

, If the drive is in NTFS format, you won't be able to write to it. Formatting it will allow you to use it, but will erase all of the data on the drive.

, Open the Disk Utility app from your Utilities folder. Your USB drive will be listed in the left frame.

, There are several options you can pick from, depending on what you'll be doing with the drive:


Select ""OS X Extended (Journaled)"" if you're only going to be using the drive on Mac computers.
Select ""FAT"" if you plan on using the drive on other operating systems and devices.
Select ""exFAT"" if the drive is larger than 32 GB and you want to use it in Windows as well.

, OS X will begin formatting the drive, which may take a while to complete. All of the data on the drive will be deleted.

, If you still can't write to the drive, it may be malfunctioning and will need to be replaced.

, Use a soft cloth and alcohol or Windex to clean the interior screen. Other cleaning agents may put you at risk for scratching the parts or smearing. A vinegar/water solution of equal parts is another acceptable cleaner to use. For safety reasons, do not apply the liquid directly into the machine. Put it on the cloth first. Also use the soft cloth to clean the rubber blades on the ink cartridges.

, Use the damp soft cloth to wipe off the outside of the printer as well.

, The printhead applies the ink to the paper. This is cleaned by selecting a program on your computer. Go to the Control Panel and then Printing Preferences. Once you have selected the printer, the computer will guide you through the process of cleaning the printhead. The printer will print out a test page to compare with the image on the screen. It may take several cleanings to completely clean the printhead if it is very dirty.

, Most of the time, this will sufficiently clean your printer. Consider an inkjet cleaning cartridge to clean clogged nozzles. Special cleaning sheets are available to use for cleaning print rollers.

Choose the type of printer based on its use.,
Need color or black and white?,
Do you need ink or Laser?,
Paper size requirements This is a commonly overlooked step!,
Consider other options Some printers are multi-function devices, such as a scanner, copier, and fax machine as well as a printer.,
Research!,
Evaluate the total cost of ownership After selecting a printer, determine the TKO or Total Cost of Ownership.,
Find the best deal and make the purchase Research all of your purchasing options and make the most economical decision.

",How to Choose a Type of Printer," Will it be for business or personal use? Business printers are usually more expensive because they are more reliable, generally have higher duty cycles (in other words they last longer), have better warranties, and parts are easier to replace. Personal printers are usually less expensive. Check that the printer works on your Operating System (Windows or Mac, for example).;
, Color printers are more flexible but can also cost more to purchase and operate.

, Laser printers are typically used more in business environment because they print faster, are generally more reliable, and sometimes cost more to purchase and operate than an Ink printer.

, Most printers will print envelopes, letter (8.5 x 11) and legal (8.5 x 14). Other sizes, such as tabloid and executive require special consideration. Also don't forget about paper weight - make sure the paper will take heavy paper such as cardstock, if that is a requirement.

, There are advantages to a multi-function device - they generally take up less space when compared to the individual components and they can be more economical to purchase compared to buying each device individually. There are disadvantages too - if one component breaks, the entire device needs to be replaced, the individual components are sometimes of lesser quality than if they were purchased separately.

, After following the above steps to narrow down the type of printer, take time to research the companies and printer models available. Consumer Reports is a good resource for researching printers. PC World, CNET, PC Magazine, and others can have valuable information as well.

, Purchasing the printer is just the first step and very inexpensive printers can end up costing a lot to operate over time. Other considerations include: What is the energy consumption and is the printer Energy Star certified? How much do replacement toner/ink cartridges cost and how many pages will they last? How long is the warranty? What is the cost for printer maintenance and how often is maintenance recommended?

Personal files are often stored in the “Documents” folder (sometimes called “My Documents” or “Joe’s Documents,” if your name is Joe).
If you are looking for photos or music you’ve saved to your computer, try looking in the “Pictures” and “Music” folders.;
, Desktop computers often have these ports on the front panel of the unit, though sometimes you’ll find them on the rear of the monitor. Laptops generally have USB ports on both sides of the device.

, You can copy files to any folder on the USB drive.


Your system likely popped up a dialog box a few moments after the device was connected. One of the options should be “Open folder to view files.” Click that link to arrive at the root (main folder) of your USB drive. Files can be copied right to this folder, or to any folders you see here.
If no window pops up, press ⊞ Win+E to open a new Explorer window, then double-click the name of your USB drive on the left side of the screen. It should be called something like “USB Drive” or “Removable Storage,” or perhaps the name of its manufacturer (e.g., “Sandisk”).

Good Job!",How to Build an External Hard Drive," The first step is to decide on one of the standard physical sizes for any HDD. If you already have a spare HDD laying around for this project, skip to step 2. There are basically 3 HDD sizes: 1.8"", 2.5"", and 3.5"". 1.8"" and 2.5"" are the standard sizes for laptop HDD's. Laptop HDD's can be powered by the USB cable, so there is no AC adapter needed. Laptop HDD's are however more expensive than internal PC HDD's, so if you are not worried about size or another power cord, a desktop PC HDD may be the way to go.;
, Take into consideration the physical size of your HDD, as well as its interface (ATA100, ATA133, Serial ATA150, Serial ATA II, etc.). Decide on a connection type that suits the needs of all computers that will be connected. USB2.0 is currently a good standard, and it will work on any computer or laptop with a free USB connection. FireWire (IEEE1394) is even faster, however it is not as common in all computers yet. Be sure to also compare fan noise levels (if it has a fan, and if the noise level is displayed). For a HDD that will be running whenever your computer is turned on, a fan will be most likely a good thing to have, while HDD's used primarily for backup usually won't need one. Also check to see if there is a power switch on 3.5"" enclosures. Without one, you will need to unplug the adapter to power down the drive. For backup this isn't a big deal, but some people using their drive for secondary storage might find it annoying to plug and unplug every time they start and shut down their computers.

,,, This jumper setting is located between the Molex power connector (4 large round pins) and the ATA/SATA connector. You will see 2 rows of four or five small pins, and a small clip (jumper) connected to 2 of them. Pull out the jumper with a tool such as tweezers or a pencil, and place it in the Master position if it is not already there. A diagram of the different jumper settings can usually be found right on the top label of the HDD.

, Although it would be very hard to accidentally plug these in upside-down, take a moment to make sure that the ribbon cable and power connector are properly aligned before inserting them.

, 4 or more screws were supplied with the enclosure. There will be 4 holes, 2 on each side of the HDD, and corresponding holes inside the enclosure.

, Make sure you did not forget to connect anything. Read your instructions (you HAVE been reading them too, haven't you? :) and make sure you covered all of the steps. It will be a pain to open it all over again because you forgot to change the jumper to Master or something.

,,, Connect the other ends of these cords to your computer and surge protector (you ARE using a surge protector, right? :).

, Go to My Computer (or Computer for Windows Vista or Windows 7). It is most likely on your desktop, but can also be found in the Start menu.

,,, To read and write from both Linux and Windows, use fat32. You can give it a Volume Label if you wish. Example: External, Secondary, Backup, etc. Be sure Quick Format is not selected. This will allow any bad sectors to be recognized and to be roped off from any data being stored later on.

, This may take longer for large drives.

The keyboard should have nothing other than the number pad keys on the number pad side, which is to be cut off. The project will be simpler if the keyboard has no special buttons, just the usual keys.;
, Turn off the computer and unplug the keyboard that you're going to modify. If you like, plug in a backup keyboard and restart the computer if you'll need it during the project.


Swapping a USB keyboard generally doesn't require a restart, but that will usually fix any problems. And using the not-yet-unplugged old keyboard is the best way to make sure you can shut the computer down cleanly.

, Find a place where it's OK to scatter plastic shavings and possibly scrape something with a saw. The workspace should also be well-lit so you can see what you're doing, tidy so that you don't lose things, and fairly clean so that you don't contaminate the keyboard's inner workings. There should be an electrical outlet nearby for a vacuum to clean up messes throughout the project.

, Clear your workspace. Plug in the vacuum and set it to to suck through a nozzle and preferably a clean soft bristle attachment which will be perfect for dislodging keyboard dirt and plastic shavings. Gather the blower and canned air for cleaning accumulated dirt from the key assemblies, saw(s), screwdriver(s) to fit the screws on the bottom of your keyboard, work gloves, and safety glasses.


Some electronics are sensitive to static, so a warm, humid day would be best. You could let a humidifier run in the area for a few hours first if the air is dry: heated winter air generally is. You could use a wrist strap and other antistatic deviceswhen handling the electronic parts, but they're unwieldy, and keyboards are tough and cheap as electronics go.

, You'll need to remove all the working parts from the space between the number pad and the other keys so that the case can be cut without damaging the insides with less-than-ideally placed or stress-focusing ragged cuts to mechanical parts, or with breaks in electronic circuits. To do that, you have to open up the keyboard.
Before you take apart something complicated or unintuitive, or once you notice that you have (seeing, for instance, an array of different-length screws), make a reminder of how to put it back together. Take notes or a digital picture.


Turn the keyboard upside down and remove the screws from the back.
Sometimes, a plastic case may be held together partly by one or more screws hidden under a sticker. If so, poke into and slice around the edges of a round depression or lump in it with a small knife, or just poke a screwdriver through. In an area that would show, gently lift up the edge of the sticker with a knife (a blunt one will often do) and peel it up, lifting more than rolling back so as not to crease it, impart a strong bend that won't go back down, or damage the surface. If you remove it entirely, set it sticky-side-up out of harm's way until time to replace it.
Sometimes a plastic case may be held together by an interlocking tab at an edge. If so, lift out the other edge first or bend one or both mating parts to free it.
Sometimes a case may be held together by screws extending from the top into the bottom, such as screws under the spacebar, which pops off, on a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000, or screws under stickers.
When you have the bottom free, set the keyboard on a table to complete disassembly so its parts don't dump out before you see how they all fit together.

, Set the keyboard on a table keys down: all the parts fit into openings and projections of the top part, with the bottom normally just pressing them into place, so gravity will keep them nestled in the top until you take them out. Once you can get something out of the outer case, there's no need to disassemble it further. It's best to take out all of the keys and big, loose items so they don't get broken and the plastic shavings you'll make by cutting the case can be vacuumed away, but anything small and firmly mounted entirely away from the number pad can stay. You'll notice the following parts, from the now up-facing bottom of the keyboard to the top:


Case screws. You already loosened these to free the bottom cover. Take them out and set them aside or carefully set the bottom aside with them still in the holes so they don't fall and get lost.
Bottom cover.
Multi-layer keyboard membrane set of thin, non-stretchy plastic with electrical circuit traces. Keep this together so that dirt doesn't get between the layers and put it aside. It's delicate and possibly susceptible to water damage, so don't clean it except to gently wipe off any excess dirt. Notice that it has holes which fit over pegs in the top cover to keep it from sliding around under the set of keys which is supposed to tap it in particular places to indicate what is being pressed. If it is held down somehow, remove whatever is holding it down. Unscrew screws and wiggle it past or cut off any bits of plastic holding it. Do not cut the membrane itself! Notice that the keyboard has an electrical connection to some electronics themselves connected to the USB cable. If those are permanently connected, remove them from the keyboard with the membrane. If it's removable, check that it can connect only one way or note how it connects. On the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, the membrane has a set of contacts at an edge that press between a rubber pad in a pocket and a set of contacts on the edge of a rigid printed circuit board that lays over it.One or more silicone sheets of dome switches to provide one dome per key. Notice that the domes face the keys, which would kink them to tap the membrane, and that, like the membrane, they fit over pegs to keep them from sliding around. They don't themselves contain any electronic parts, so wipe them or even wash them gently if you like, but make sure they are dry before reassembling the keyboard.
One or more key assemblies - banks of keys in plastic frames. On an old keyboard, these probably have lots of dirt that might even interfere with their smooth travel. Blow it out from between the keys with a small blower or canned air. Wash them if you like, even in a dishwasher (away from the heating element, which could melt them) but make sure they are dry before reassembling the keyboard. It's not easy to remove the keys from their plastic carriers and you might break something trying.
If the keys of the to-be-removed number pad are mounted in a common assembly with others, such as the navigation keys, remove the keys in the leftmost row of the number pad for room to work in cutting the assembly. It's best to put the risk of mistakes closest to the keys you don't want, and, depending on the keyboard's design, a plastic rib remaining on the number-pad side will help anchor the truncated key assembly securely in position with the truncated keyboard case. On the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, a key is best removed by squeezing catches on the back and pushing it through the frame.
In some keyboards, such as the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000, the key assemblies may be affixed to the top cover. It's OK to leave them there, but take extra care to get out the plastic shavings after cutting off the number pad so they don't interfere with the keyboard's operation.
Num Lock, Caps Lock, and Scroll Lock indicator lights. These may be attached to another electronic assembly or, as with the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, rest on contacts on the membrane. Check the orientation of the assembly and its contacts. Even if it appears symmetrical at first glance, it may have to go back in a particular orientation. Note which end faces a particular way on tape attached to the assembly before removing it if there is a risk of confusion.
Cord and main circuit board. On the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, the cord is woven through several small gaps in the top cover to diffuse and relieve strain from pulls on it before leading to the circuit board, which connects to the membrane with an edge connector that rests against the membrane, which in turn is pressed down by a rubber pad. Set this assembly, and the pad, aside.
Spacebar and its separate dome switch. Some keyboards may not have a separate dome switch or mounting for the space bar, but the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard does. Take out the dome switch so it doesn't collect plastic shavings (dirt tends to cling to the silicone), and remove the spacebar too.
Top cover. If you've removed everything electronic from it, you can wash it. You can wash the bottom cover, too.

, Screw them together. Use at least the screws close to the gap between the navigation keys and number pad. You'll cut through the top and bottom covers together so that the cut parts mate neatly.

, In addition to creating a straight, square profile, take care to preserve the stiffening flanges and ribs near the number pad.Wide masking tape is great for marking straight lines: place it on the side to be kept, with its far edge indicating the place to cut. It stays fairly straight when stretched taut (stretch any tape from the middle of its width, rather than along one edge, to reduce curving) to automatically continue a straight line and may reduce lifting of little bits of plastic, i.e., burring, at the cut edge.
On the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, there is a squarish stiffening flange extending inward at the edge of the top cover's hole for the number pad. Keep this for strength. Tear off several inches of tape, set the edge of the tape along the edge of this flange (next to, but not into, which you'll cut), and continue the tape forward and back.
If you'll use a long, stiff saw to cut the case, you'll just saw across the whole breadth at once and continue down through the bottom cover. If not, you may need to mark the bottom cover for cutting. You may not just be able to wrap the tape around, since a varying cross section from one end to the other might cause the tape not to continue straight around. Use a separate piece of tape lined up with the first at the front and back of the keyboard before the places its path curves. Or line up the bottom cover marking tape with measurements taken inward from the right edge of the case by a ruled carpenter's square hanging over that edge, matching measurements from given points at the margin of the top-cover tape to the edge of the case to corresponding points at the margin of the bottom-cover tape. (Because the bottom cover is smaller than the top cover, tucking into it, you can't just measure equal distances inward from the edge of each cover separately).


If the keyboard case has stick-on or otherwise removable feet where you will cut, or on the part you will cut off, peel them off and set them aside to leave the adhesive untouched, and stick them at uncushioned corners after you reassemble the keyboard.

, It's just thin plastic, so pretty much anything will cut it. But shears would twist and break it. A sharp, coarse-bladed hacksaw or a backsaw will be best: lay the blade flat on a flat part of the line to be cut, press and drag it somewhat firmly to start the kerf (take care to start a single distinct cut without marring the surrounding material), and keep the blade vertical as you saw through the top and bottom covers. No need to press hard once the saw is started in its kerf: push back and forth gently, and let it do the work until the keyboard case just comes apart.
If you have only a little saw, you can cut the frame from one end to the other (watch the number-pad left flange and cut next to it). If you have a hobby rotary tool such as a Dremel, you could follow the tape all the way around. Wear hand and eye protection, particularly if you are using a hacksaw (whose blade can break), a saw with big teeth, or a small power tool (a big one would be very dangerous).
Protect the work surface with something like scrap wood or an old telephone book.


Save the removed pieces. You might be able to use part of the removed bottom cover, especially if it was cut off perfectly straight, to close up the cut edge of the keyboard.
You can use sandpaper to smooth very-rough areas. But it will create many fine, messy plastic particles. Don't turn a fairly straight, rough edge into a smooth, wavy edge through uneven sanding if you plan to attach a flat, rigid cover to the cut edge. A sanding block to hold the paper flat would help avoid this and the gaps it would leave.
Unless you're going to glue a rigid plate over the entire cut end, you can gently round the cut corners by stroking a flat file around them a few times for appearance. Since the rounded profile will look good, but the cut edge won't, keep the file in a vertical plane. You could use sandpaper on a flat surface or in a sanding block instead of a file.
Once you've finished cutting and grinding, remove the tape and open the keyboard case again so you can clean out the shavings.

, On the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, the number pad is part of the same bank of keys as the navigation keys, which you'll need to keep. There is a rib at the left edge of the number pad. Keep this, and cut immediately to the right of it: it adds strength and rests against the top-cover flange that was at the left of the number pad to keep the key assembly from slipping left. Cut the key assembly as you did the keyboard case. Mark it, similarly, before cutting if you like.

, A clean soft bristle attachment would be best, and any small nozzle would be good, for breaking their static cling to surfaces and sweeping away burrs from cut edges.

, If the number pad keys are part of a larger assembly, the dome switches probably are part of a larger sheet. They're held in place under the keys by being squeezed at the edges, and their sheet is soft and probably translucently inconspicuous, so it's best to leave a fraction of an inch (cm) margin beyond what is needed than to leave too little. Be sure to only cut off the number key switches, not the navigation key switches, and trim close to the switches to be removed rather than close to the ones to keep. Use a single cut with a paper cutter or a full-size scissors to avoid jagged edges that can focus tension and tear.

, Do not crease it, which could bring the layers into contact in the wrong place or break the circuit traces, either. It has a network of circuits from which the number pad is not cleanly separable. You'd probably wreck the keyboard.

, You'll essentially reverse the disassembly process. This will be easiest if you support the front cover by edges or corners so the key assemblies can drop in fully rather than themselves resting on a table. Put in the electronic controller, lights, and keys; put in the dome switches; put in the membrane; and set up electrical connections (on a Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, don't forget the rubber pad that squeezes the membrane-controller connection together). Line up all of the the dome switches' and membrane's retention holes. Screw on the back cover. Put on any rubber feet you removed and, after the keyboard is working and this project is otherwise finished, replace any stickers you removed. The number pad part of the keyboard membrane will just hang out of the keyboard case for now. Touching the protruding membrane may cause errors such as unwanted number-pad keystrokes.

, Check that all of the remaining keys gently snap and rebound when tapped, as before. Plug in the keyboard and check that all of the keys work. You may need to restart the computer for it to recognize that the keyboard has been attached. If the keyboard doesn't work, check that it's plugged in to a working port, and, if that's not the problem, open the keyboard and inspect the assembly. If only some of the keys do not perform correctly, check the assembly near them in particular.

, You have a few options for this flap:


Wrap it underneath the bottom edge of the keyboard and hold its edge in place with cellophane tape. This is quick and easy. But it looks sloppy. It leaves the membrane vulnerable to contamination, especially from spills--though those aren't much of a risk in a dedicated keyboard drawer. It leaves the keyboard unsuitable for placement on surfaces that might press on the membrane and thereby register keystrokes, such as the user's lap. If the keyboard erroneously registers keystrokes from the flap, try shielding one of its layers from the other with plastic wrap. You could still tuck it under, rather than into, the keyboard. In that case, don't put plastic wrap over the spot the tape is to attach.
Prevent it from registering keystrokes by separating its two outer layers from one another and other surfaces with plastic wrap, then tuck it back into the keyboard. This looks much better, and protects the flap from the environment. But it risks damaging the membrane and thus killing the keyboard by bending and breaking it or flaking off its circuit traces, either immediately or over time. It also risks mechanical and electrical interference with the keys it's tucked under, usually the navigation keys.
To do this, cut a strip of plastic wrap a little longer than the length of the protruding membrane flap (which, with standard plastic-wrap width of 12""/30cm or so, will be much wider). Draw the plastic wrap around the bottom layer of the membrane flap, which needs to be separated not only from the top flap but from the bottom flap area nearby inside the keyboard case which it will be bent up against. Pair up the cut edges at the right edge and the top or bottom edge of the plastic wrap (whichever isn't wrapped) and press them together so they cling. Keep the plastic wrap only one layer thick and trim off any great excess extending past the membrane layer edge. A 1/2 inch (1 cm) margin is plenty.
You could try plastic tape instead of plastic wrap. It would stay in place readily. But attempting to remove it, as you might want to try if something doesn't work initially, could damage the circuit traces--possibly invisibly--and kill the keyboard.
Turn the keyboard over and loosen the screws holding the number-pad side of it together, and if necessary the others, so that the cut edge of the keyboard can loosen by a small fraction of an inch (a few mm). Bend over the membrane flap, all layers together, and tuck it in under the navigation keys' adjacent membrane. You may have to tuck the membrane flap in at a slight angle to best accommodate the screws and other obstructions extending through the keyboard. Leave at least the very edge of the fold out so that it doesn't get creased hard and possibly soon break on its own. You could roll up the flap, too, but it might be harder to store or cover if it is rolled up and under tension to expand than if it is simply bent over.

Folding the membrane into many layers (which will bulge around the folded edges, inside and outside the keyboard enclosure) to tuck into a small space will likely make it too thick and press on the adjacent navigation key switches from underneath. So, you may be left with most of it tucked in and a little sticking out at the keyboard edge. Ignoring that works great.
You could cover the cut edge of the keyboard with wide, strong tape such as mailing tape, a hard cover of another material, or even a flat piece of plastic made from the cut-off piece of the bottom cover, tipped upward. If you use tape, and have to remove the tape, carefully free it from the plastic wrap or you may pull that off and have to replace it. If you use part of the bottom cover, you may have to remove or trim down its rim and ribs, and mark its inside edge for cutting by reference to the contour of the edge of the top cover above the bottom cover. After cleaning the mating surfaces, you could attach the plate made from the bottom cover or other rigid material with glue, solvent cement, or strong double-sided tape suitable for the materials involved. If glued or cemented, they would probably have to be held firmly with a device such as a strap clamp until dry. Attaching an improvised cover with a strong adhesive or cement could frustrate opening the keyboard later.

Both of these jacks have corresponding ports on most computers.


If you're using an XLR microphone, a quarter-inch jack, or some other variety of mic, skip to the next section.;
, Almost all desktop computers will have visible microphone ports on either the front or the back of the tower. Usually, this port will be colored pink, and have a microphone image over it. If you have an eighth-inch jack, all you've got to do is plug it into this port and start testing sound.


If you have a USB jack on the end of your microphone, most computers will have two or more USB ports on the side, or the back of the computer. Simply plug the USB jack into one of these ports.
Laptops and some more contemporary computers don't have microphone ports, because they're generally outfitted with internal microphones. It's usually possible to plug into the headphone port on most computers, however, and adjust your sound settings later.

, The easiest and quickest way to test your levels and check your settings is to go to your input sound options and make sure that the device you just plugged in is visible, and that it is selected for use. Open a recording program and attempt to use the microphone and set the levels.

Solder the copper wire to the signal conductor of the co-ax.

",How to Design a Simple Antenna," This is needed because this determines the length of your antenna.;
, For the example we can use a copper wire and a piece of copper plating. Also you will need a co-axial cable (75 ohm is better than 50 ohm, for Wi-Fi 50 ohm is better than 75 ohm).

, This is done by using the frequency value from step 1 to find the wavelength of the signal. To do this you simply need to divide the speed of light (c = 299 792 458 m/s) by the frequency (f). In the case of 2.45GHz the wavelength is 12.236 centimeter (4.8 in). Usually monopole antennas are quarter-wavelength structures, so the length of the wire should be 12.236/4 = 3.0509cm

, This way you can pare it back based on performance.

, This is basically used to form a theoretical mirror image of the antenna. Simply use the copper plate that you picked up earlier. It should be at least half a wavelength square.

,,, The ground conductor is now above the ground-plane. Fold the ground conductor back and solder it to the copper ground plane.

Examine the jack on the end of the microphone.,
Get the appropriate converter.,
Test your new microphone with the recording software of your choice.",How to Connect a Microphone to a Computer2," Higher grade music microphones, condenser mics, and other professional gear will generally require an adapter or a converter cable before you plug them in. These range in price, and will vary depending on the type of microphone you're trying to input into the computer.


If you see a triangle of prongs on the end of the end of the microphone, that's an XLR mic, and you'll need to get either a cable which converts the XLR jack into the eighth-inch port, a converter box which will convert it into USB, or a mixer.
If the jack is a quarter-inch, the size of a guitar cable, you'll need to purchase an adapter cable that will convert into either USB or (more usually) eighth-inch size, and plug it into the mic port or the headphone port. These cables are usually quite cheap, no more than a few dollars.

, Both of these types of mics will need to be connected to some kind of adapter before you plug them into the computer. Because these microphones are typically higher quality, it's best to invest in good adaption equipment to keep the signal as strong as possible.


XLR mics can be adapted relatively cheaply with cables or a USB converter box, but some users find that this can be ""crackly,"" losing some of the presence of good microphones. For the best sound quality, invest in a mixing board with a USB output.
Quarter-inch to eighth-inch converter cables are widely available and pretty cheap to buy. You can find them at any electronics store or online electronics retailer.

On Windows, you can use the Sound Recorder, on a Mac, Quicktime or GarageBand should do fine.
If you're not getting a signal, skip to the next section for troubleshooting tips.

"
"
Check your sound input settings.,
Set the input level.,
Check your speaker and computer volume.,
Check the settings on the microphone.,
Check the setting in the specific program that you're using.,
Try restarting your computer.",How to Connect a Microphone to a Computer3," If you're not getting a signal, navigate to your computer's sound settings and make sure that the correct device is selected, and the levels are appropriate.



On a mac there are no drivers to get in the way, so the only other thing you need to do is to go into System Settings and click on ""Sound,"" then select ""Input."" Make sure that the microphone is checked, rather than the built-in microphone.

On a PC, go into the Control Panel and clicking on ""Hardware and Sound,"" then click on ""Sound"" and it should pop up another windows. At the top, click on recording, and you should see your microphone there. If it doesn't have a green check mark next to it, it isn't selected. Click on it and click properties. You can then change the settings at the bottom to ""Use this Device"" and it will automatically use it next time it is plugged into your computer.

, On most computers, you'll be able to control the level of the input volume. With lower quality mics, it'll usually need to be set somewhat high to get a half-way decent signal, but you don't want to blow out the levels, either. It's usually best to set it somewhere in the default range, about 50%.


On a Mac, you can do this in the System Settings, under ""Sound.""
On a PC, you can do this in ""Hardware and Sound,"" under ""Sound.""

, If you have external speakers, or have headphones plugged in, you need to double-check and make sure that the volume levels are adjusted properly, as well as the settings on your desktop, or you may not be hearing anything.

, Obviously, you need to make sure the microphone is switched on, the cable is plugged in flush, and that you've got any other settings adjusted correctly, depending on the microphone.


Some condenser mics, and speaking microphones will have a variety of toggle settings, some of which might be louder, or feature a wider range of sound than others. Switch between them to get a sense for what sounds best for your purposes.

, Different audio processing programs will have a variety of input settings as well, that you need to check. Some recording software may still be set to pick up internal mics, or audio from other sources, even if you changed it in your system settings.


For example if you are using Skype, go to: Tools>Options>Audio settings, and select your microphone. If your microphone isn't listed or still doesn't work then check whether it requires software or drivers to run.

, Sometimes, you'll need to close the program you're trying to use at least, or even restart to get some computers to recognize a new piece of hardware you've plugged in.


If the microphone still doesn't work then try using another microphone or try using the microphone on another computer. This should help you figure out whether it is the computer or the microphone which is at fault.

Know what kind of photos you will be scanning.,
Identify the resolution you will need.,
Decide how much color you need.,
Determine how fast you would like the photo scanner to work.,
Consider your budget.,
Test different scanners.",How to Choose a Photo Scanner," Though you may change the format occasionally, most people prefer a certain type of photo, such as 4 x 6 pictures, 8 x 10 pictures, or negatives.


Flatbed scanners are most popular and vary greatly in cost, depending on the specific features they offer. These serve the purposes of the general public.
Film scanners cost more, but they scan at a higher resolution. This is a great option for photographers or other photo professionals.;
, Resolution is simply the amount of detail a scanner pulls from a photo. Print images need to have a higher resolution so they print clearly and not get pixelated. Web images can have a lower resolution.


For general uses, many photos will scan perfectly fine at 300 dots-per-inch (dpi). The highest you will need will be 1200dpi.
For enlarging photos, you will need 3200dpi or higher.
For emailing or posting photos on the Internet, keep resolution low. This keeps the file size low, making it easy to email or publish to a website.

, Scanners scan images at different color depths (also known as bit depth). This determines how accurately the colors from photos translate over to the digitized image.


For general purposes, a bit depth of 24 bits works well. You may consider a 30-bit scanner if you want higher quality.
For scanning monochrome or black and white photos, a higher bit depth will give you a better image. Look for a high bit depth in both color and gray (i.e., 30-bit color 12-bit gray).

, If you will be scanning photos regularly, finding a scanner that works quickly will save you a lot of time. Read product reviews to discover how quickly different scanners work at different resolutions.

, Photo scanners vary greatly in price. Determine how much money you are willing to spend on your scanner and find something that suits your needs that is in your price range.

, Though reading the specs of scanners will tell you some information, the only way you can really tell if a scanner is right for you is by testing it. If it does not work like you want it to, return it and try another one.

Find an online streaming platform that suits your needs.,
Once you find the platform you want, create an account.,
Sign in to your account and use your platform's streaming service.,
Allow the platform access to your webcam.,
Start streaming!,
You can improve the quality of your stream by downloading your platform's broadcasting software.",How to Stream Your Webcam1," A streaming platform does all the heavy lifting for you. You don't have to worry about any coding or technical knowledge. There are plenty of free or paid streaming services that give you user-friendly tools to easily broadcast your webcam without the hassle of installing encoders or hosting it yourself. Go to a reputable search engine and search for ""live stream platform."" The results will give you more than enough options to choose from.


Decide what you need from a platform. Do you want a huge audience, HD streaming, mobile compatibility, and an ad-free platform? Look for a paid service. Do you just need a basic stream for a small audience, and you don't care about ads? Look for a free service.
If you decide you want a free platform, alter your search to ""live stream platform for free."" Just remember there are far fewer free platforms than paid platforms.
You can try out different free platforms before you commit. Many paid platforms also have free trials you can take advantage of.
Popular services include: Ustream (paid, free trial),DaCast (paid),Livestream (free option, free trial),and Bambuser (free option).;
, Every service requires an account of some kind. There will probably be a button in the upper right corner of their site to create an account.


Sign up for a premium account for a broader audience, better quality, and fewer ads. Premium accounts can be quite pricey, often over a hundred dollars a month.
Sign up for a free account if you don't need those perks or you can't afford it.

, There's usually a ""Go Live"" or ""Broadcast Now"" button. This will let you stream your webcam directly without downloading any software.

, You only have to do this once if you check ""remember"" when prompted. You may have to update your version of Adobe Flash to do this.


You should see your webcam's light turn on. If the platform can't access your webcam, your webcam may be broken (in which case you should buy a new one) or you may have to update your webcam drivers.
For better quality, you may want to upgrade your webcam's software or buy a new one.

, Now that everything is ready, broadcast your webcam to the world. Every site has different tools and instructions, but they should be straightforward. Click the broadcast button to toggle the stream on and off.


Once you start your stream, you will have your own channel or room that viewers can tune in to. You can share the link on your social media or blog. You can also name and customize your channel to suit your needs.
You can also embed the stream to your personal website. Your stream comes with embedding code that you can place in your site's code so your stream is always up. If you don't have access to your site's code, contact your web developer. Most sites and blogs have intuitive embedding features, but this link will help you embed your stream.

, Some sites offer it for free, while others don't. You can also utilize a third-party software like the free Open Broadcaster Software. This makes you less dependent on your platform and your wifi. Method 3 has more information on encoding software.

Download and install an encoder program.,
Decide which platform you want to link your encoder to.,
Determine your computer's connection speed.,
Go to your encoder's settings and optimize the performance.,
Connect the encoder to your streaming platform.,
Start broadcasting from your encoder first, and then broadcast from your streaming platform.",How to Stream Your Webcam3," Encoders convert your webcam's video feed into a customized live stream which usually has much better quality than the in-site encoders that online streaming platforms provide. Using your own encoder will give you more options and higher quality video and sound. If you want complete control over your broadcast, you should consider using an encoder. Here are some of the best encoder programs available:


Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) is a free, open-source encoder that is highly customizable and easy to use, though it is not as professional as some encoders. It easily streams to popular hosts like Twitch, YouTube, Hitbox etc... Open Broadcaster is one of the best options for a free encoder.Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) is also free and offers many of the same high-quality features as OBS. However, it tends to be a resource hog on your computer, so you will need a powerful machine to run it with a consistently high performance.Wirecast is a professional encoder that also functions as a video production switcher. That means it has far more features than both OBS and FMLE, which are both fairly bare-bones compared to Wirecast. Despite having more features, Wirecast is also highly efficient and streamlined. The downside is it costs $495 for the most basic version.Windows Media Encoder (WME) is specifically meant for PC which is its main positive and negative. The encoder is streamlined and optimized for PC but many people don't have access to a PC or want an encoder that works on both platforms. If you do own a PC, WME is solid choice, as it's free and can be used to encode more types of media, meaning you don't need a webcam to use it.
Whichever encoder you use will have detailed downloading and installation instructions.

, Encoders still require you to have a live streaming platform like those discussed in Method 1. Those platforms have their own encoders, but using your own can net you better results. Follow the same steps in Method 1 to set up your account and channel.

, Go to a reputable search engine and search for ""connection speed test."" This will give you a variety of options. Run the test and write down the upload speed for future reference.


The upload speed should be in Mbps (Megabits per second).

, The purpose of the encoder is to push your live stream to the limit.


Set the bitrate to 64 percent of your internet's upload speed. Tests have shown this rate to be the optimum balance between quality and compression.The bitrate determines the amount of information in each frame of video, so higher bitrates make for better quality. If your upload speed is 5Mbps, set your bitrate to 3.2Mbps. You can go up to 80 percent, but beware of visible compression artifacts that may show up if you push your bitrate.
Set the buffer rate the same as the bitrate.
Set the base resolution the same as your desktop. You can check this on your computer's properties or settings.
Set the output resolution based on your bitrate: 480p for 1-2 Mbps, 720p for 2-3Mbps, 1080p for 3-5Mbps, and 1080p HQ for anything over 5Mbps.Set your FPS (Frames Per Second) to 60 if possible. Check your streaming service to see if they allow 60FPS, because some only allow 30FPS.
Test your stream on various settings to get the quality and speed you want.

, Most encoders have most platforms listed as possible streaming services. If yours doesn't, select ""custom."" Your encoder should give you a stream key to copy and paste into your platform which will link the encoder to your live stream.


Every encoder and every platform does this differently. Generally speaking, you will usually be given a stream key or URL to copy and paste into your streaming service. If you have trouble finding this, go to the ""Help"" section of your encoder.

, Just streaming from the encoder won't make the stream live. You also have to start broadcasting on your streaming platform after you've linked your encoder to the platform.


Make sure the encoder stream is functioning properly before you start broadcasting on the platform.
You can change the source of the stream in your encoder's settings. If you want to broadcast your webcam, make sure ""Video Capture Device"" or some equivalent is selected.

Some thicker inks need to settle for 1 hour after installation before printing. If you have printed or performed a head cleaning with less than desirable results, let the cartridge settle in its new printer for 1 or 2 hours before attempting another print.

, This typically can be found on the printer's control panel listed under ""printing preferences"" or ""advanced printer settings."" Different grades, thicknesses and textures of paper require varying amounts of ink in order to produce clear, high quality documents or images.


Refer to the operating instructions included with the laser printer for detailed instructions on adjusting the paper settings.

, Failing to follow proper maintenance procedures can significantly degrade the quality of documents and images produced by a laser printer.


Reference the documentation included with the device at the time of purchase for specific instructions on performing proper maintenance, or contact your maintenance technician.

, The resolution, or dots per inch (dpi), of the original image or graphic file will have a dramatic effect on the final product printed from a laser printer.


Use images or graphics with a resolution of at least 2400 dpi to achieve the best results when printing from a laser printer.
Determine the resolution of an image or graphic by right-clicking the file and selecting ""Properties"" from the pull-down menu. The image resolution will be listed among the information in the Properties dialogue box.

, Certain commercial lease contracts require that a qualified service technician perform all maintenance tasks required for a laser printer. Printer maintenance contractors often will place a printed label with their contact information on the device.

List your needs.,
Understand your requirements.,
Be aware that there are two mainstream categories for printers: Laser and Ink Jet printers.,
Look at the descriptions.,
Remember that laser units are larger.,
Consider the availability of affordable ink for your printer, not just its initial price.,
Consider the resolution (more dots per inch).,
Check paper type and size abilities of the printer.,
Before buying a printer, check the manufacturer’s website (for example, Epson.com) to make sure they provide driver updates and currently offer a driver for your operating system.

,
Consider whether you also require other features.,
What will this printer be for?",How to Buy a Printer," Do you need one that only prints? Or do you like electronic copies of papers? Or do you still fax a lot of documents? Or do you want duplicates of everything?;
, If you want one to print documents with words only, get a black and white printer. If you print documents with color photos or webpages, you'll want a color printer. Then, if you want duplicates of everything, you'll need a color printer with a copy feature. Or, if you fax a lot, you'll need a color printer with copy and fax. Normally, if you buy the color copy and fax, you'll also get the scan function. If you want everything, get a color all-in-one.

, Here are some of the different qualities:


Laser printers cost less per page to print, especially if remanufactured toner cartridges are available.
Laser printers cost more per purchase of a cartridge by a typical 10x. So if you only print a few pages per month, you may be likely to replace the printer before you use up the toner. It could be wasted if you don't use it.
Laser printers also print faster and are preferable for heavy printing, such as in a large office. They print better text quality, but inferior photo quality compared to an inkjet printer.
Inkjet printers will use less power than laser printers. Ink, unlike toner powder, can run when fresh off the printer or if it gets wet. There is a low initial cost when purchasing the printer, however printing will cost you more in the long run with the purchase of ink.
Inkjet printers are good when used to print photos, and many times feature media card slots to print directly from a digital camera.

, If you just print webpages or color documents, then you'll need one with around 2 inkjet cartridges, or 2 laser cartridges. If you print just for fun photos, then you may want a 4-5 cartridge inkjet printer or a 4 cartridge laser. To print almost-perfect photos, you'll need a 7 cartridge inkjet. The laser's won't do as good as a job.

, Are you limited on space? Then you'll have only the inkjet option, as laser units are very big.

, It is here that the costs can really start to add up. Check online for the availability of the specific replacement cartridge. Contrary to what printer manufacturers may say, using remanufactured or compatible cartridges may not void your printer warranty, depending on your jurisdiction.


Estimate the cost per page for any given product. If the cartridge yield is 300 and the price of the cartridges are $30, then you will average 10¢ per page, and if you print about 200 pages a month you are looking at an average $20 per month cost.

, This is a simple way to compare image quality.


The standard resolution for laser printers is 600 dpi, and for ink jet is 720 dpi.
720 dpi on an ink jet is an equal, not better resolution, compared to the 600 dpi on laser printers.

, If you need to print on heavy stock paper, glossy paper, smaller or larger size paper or would like duplexing (the ability to print on both sides), be sure that the printer can accommodate all of the paper sizes and types you would like to use.

,, No matter what printer category you choose, you will also have the additional option of an All in one (AIO) or Multifunction (MFP) printer. These AIO/MFP offer additional functions such as printer, scanner, copier and fax.

, Would you like it to be used for the whole house? Consider getting a printer with network connectivity (you'll need a router/wireless internet for this). A network enabled printer can be connected to by any computer on its network so as long as you get the internet signal the printer is on, you can wirelessly print. Setup is also much easier, because there is usually no need for a USB connection to a host computer.

Pick the best SD card for the job.,
Insert the SD card into your digital camera.,
Format if prompted.",How to Use an SD Memory Card4," There are two basic factors to consider when purchasing an SD card for digital photography: capacity and speed. You will also need to be aware of the differences between the three main types of SD cards: SD (Secure Digital), SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity), and SDXC (Secure Digital Extended Capacity).


Standard SD cards can store up to 2 GB of data. SDHC cards can store up to 32 GB, but must be used in compatible devices. SDXC cards can store even more data, but like SDHC require a device that supports the format.
If you are serious about digital photography, you will want to pay close attention to the different speeds available for SD cards. DSLRs can capture a lot of data at once, and being able to write quickly to the SD card will help improve the shots you take. Amateur photographers can usually get away with using a Class 2 or 4 SD card, while professional photographers (especially sports photographers) will want a Class 6 or 10 card., Make sure that your device supports the type of SD card you are using. For example, if you are using an SDXC card, the camera will need to support that format.

, Usually you should be able to simply start using the SD card as soon as you insert it, but you may need to format it if you've been using it for other tasks. Formatting will erase all of the data on the SD card.


Note: If you insert an SDXC card into a camera that doesn't support it, you will be prompted to format. DO NOT do this, as the card will lose its expanded storage capability and will likely not work with any SDXC devices in the future.

Two motion-sensing controllers
A base station
A USB cable
A Quick Start Guide;
, Take the cable coming from the controller and plug it in to the dedicated port on the base station. There are two ports on the base station; the controller should be connected to the right-hand port.

, Take the USB cable and plug the smaller end into the left-hand port on the base station. Take the other end of the USB cable and connect it to any available USB port on your computer.

, Open a web browser on your computer and download the Razer Hydra driver installer here:



http://www.razersupport.com/gaming-controllers/razer-hydra/.

, Once the download has finished, double-click on the downloaded file to start installing the driver then wait for it to finish installing.


A pop-up message will appear on the bottom-right corner of your computer screen notifying you that the Razer Hydra has been detected by your PC.

, Double-click the Razer icon on the desktop to launch the Hydra driver.

, This will automatically set the functions of the controller and its buttons with the game you’re playing.

, Click the “OK” button to save the changes and resume playing the game.

, These buttons are located on the face of each of the two controllers. These buttons are given numerical values for compatibility purposes, and the functions will depend on the game you’re playing.


The numerical buttons on the left-hand controller are usually used as directional keys while the buttons on the right are used as action keys.

, This button can be found on both controllers and is placed in between the numerical buttons 1, 2, 3, and 4. The 5 button usually works as the “Select” or “Start” button, or a way to access the game menu.

, The analog sticks are located right at the middle and can be found on both controllers. The analog sticks are used as substitute to the 1 to 4 buttons, but its functions may still depend on the kind of game you’re playing.

, These buttons can be found on the front side of the controllers, and just like the keys mentioned above, its functions will depend the on the game you’re playing.

, At the lower part of the base station you’ll see a Razer logo. To properly use the motion-sense feature of the controller, the logo should be facing you. The logo must be in line right between the two controllers.


This serves as a basic rule of thumb to properly align the base station, accurately using the motion sensing controllers.

Turn NumLock off when you're finished with the numeric pad.",How to Use the NumLock Feature on Lenovo Thinkpads," Different laptop models have different numeric pad configurations.


If your U, I, and O keys have 4, 5, and 6 printed in the lower corner, you have an older laptop with an alternate numeric pad. See the next section for details on using it.
The ThinkPad line of laptops do not use an alternate numeric pad. You'll need to use the method in this section as a workaround. Some larger models have a dedicated numeric pad.;
, Click the ""Start"" button in the lower-right corner of the desktop. In many versions of Windows, this is just a Windows icon. The Start menu will appear above the button.


If you are using Windows 8 and don't see the Start button, press ⊞ Win on the keyboard. This will open the Start screen.

, You can start typing immediately when the Start menu or screen is open to begin searching. You'll see ""On-Screen Keyboard"" in the search results. If your Lenovo laptop does not have a NumLock key, you can use the Windows On-Screen Keyboard to access the numeric pad., The On-Screen Keyboard will open in a new window.

, You'll find this below the PrtScn button.

, When you click OK, the numeric keypad will appear on the right side of the On-Screen Keyboard.

, When you click one of the buttons, that number or symbol will be inserted wherever your typing cursor is.


You cannot use the On-Screen keyboard to type Alt codes, as it does not recognize more than on keypress at a time. If you need to enter special characters, open the Character Map by searching for ""character map"" in the Start menu.

, Depending on the Lenovo laptop you're using, your NumLock key may be found in different locations.If your laptop has numeric pad capabilities, the NumLock key will be found on the F7, F8, or Insert key. It may be labeled ""NmLk,"" and written in a different color below the normal key function.
On laptops with a dedicated numeric pad (15 inch+), the dedicated NumLock key can be found next to ← Backspace.
Some popular models, notably most of the ThinkPad line, do not have NumLock keys at all, because there is no built-in numeric pad. See the previous section for workarounds.

, You can find the Fn key in the lower-left corner of the keyboard. The NmLk key may be F7, F8, or Insert.


The NumLock indicator in the upper-right corner will turn on when the NumLock feature is active.

, When NumLock is activated, the keys on the right side of your keyboard turn into the numeric pad. You'll see the numbers and symbols that they turn into written on the keys below the regular characters.


If you have a 15""+ laptop, you'll likely have a dedicated numeric pad to the right of the keyboard. These turn into arrow keys when NumLock is off.

, You can turn NumLock off and return to your regular keyboard functions by pressing Fn and the NumLock key again.

Know the difference between hardware and software.,
Know about input devices.,
Know the main output devices.,
Learn Internal Bus Devices.,
Learn the External Bus Devices.,
Learn the internal and removable storage devices.,
Learn about motherboard hardware.",How to Understand Computer Hardware," Before you learn anything, you must first know what hardware is for itself, and how it is different from software. A key difference between hardware and software is that hardware can be touched physically. Right now, you're using your mouse or keyboard to scroll the page, and your monitor is showing you the information. These are hardware. However, software is what cannot be physically touched, the programs currently loaded into your memory, your operating system, for example.;
, Input devices are used to enter information into a computer. This information could be instructions to move the cursor of the mouse, or could be an image. Whatever the input device, it gives the computer some type of information. They are sorted into categories with basic hardware underneath:





Text Input Devices

Keyboard



Pointing Devices

Mouse
Trackball



Audio Input Devices

Microphone



Gaming Devices

Joystick
Game Controller



Image and Video Input Devices

Scanner
Web-cam





, Output is how the computer responds to what the user (you) does to it. For example, when you move the mouse, the cursor on the screen moves in response to that movement. When you press the space bar in notepad, the cursor moves according to how many times you pressed it. Output devices are also sorted into categories with the hardware underneath:





Video

Monitor



Image

Printer



Audio

Speakers (standard or headset)





, Don't worry too much about internal bus controllers just yet, but about what types of devices are controlled by them. In general, internal bus controllers control the specific output devices, internet access, and, on most older systems, specific input devices. Other types of internal bus devices might control disk drives, such as IDE or Serial ATA, Floppy, etc.

, You're probably familiar with the USB, or Universal Serial Bus. This is an external bus, as well as some others, including the eSATA, or external version of Serial ATA devices.

, Obviously you don't need to know all of them, but you need to know the basics. You need to know the difference between IDE and Serial ATA drives and floppy drives, you need to know which drives will go in each, what the cables look like, which types of drives should be master and slave, etc. You should know the difference between Compact Disk Drives and Digital Video Disk Drives, what is W and RW, what hard disks are, what kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and possibly terabytes are. If you're interested, learn the basics of how each disk stores information. Also, learn about USB devices. These aren't as important as learning internal storage and internal removable storage devices, since you can just plug them in and install them for use, but it's nice to have some knowledge.

, Learn about the Central Processing Unit (probably more about which ones are best and compatibility), the Random-Access Memory (learn about the types, like DRAM, DDR2, etc.) Learn about the Basic Input/Output System, and how to configure it. Finally, if you're interested, learn about the CMOS battery and the chipset. Knowing about input and output and buses is important with computer motherboards, as your knowledge will determine whether or not the computer parts you by will actually fit.

They make your GPX file findable with a single word and allow you to group the trace alongside other similar traces. For example, all the traces tagged 'Melbourne' are listed at www.openstreetmap.org/traces/tag/Melbourne.


Tags are case-sensitive, so Melbourne and melbourne may supply different results.
Each file can have many tags, and you can enter as many as you like with commas ("","") between them.
Usually the tags are the names of countries, cities and other places your trace concerns.
All the traces you upload will be accessible from your OpenStreetMap profile (unless you choose ""trackable"" or ""private"" visibility), so there's no need to use a tag to identify your traces from other people's.

, You can review a description of each visibility level here; generally in order of most public to least public, the options are identifiable, public, trackable, and private.

Have a good backup system on your hard drive or on an external drive.,
Try not change the layout of the pages, especially the margins.",How to Scan a Book1," You'll need to make a choice between a flatbed scanner and a sheet feed scanner, depending on what you can afford and what you're looking for:


A flatbed scanner generally costs less and offers precise scans. The benefits of this scanner is that the book does not require its pages separated or its binding to be destroyed. Furthermore, flatbeds can easily scan just about anything that can be placed on the glass, not just paper documents. It is simple and flexible, especially for books.
A sheet feed scanner is able to scan both sides of the page and is much faster than a flatbed. A sheet feed scanner requires the same amount of space as a flatbed, but scanning a bound book is impossible using this type of scanner (unless the book is destroyed by separating each of the pages.) There are some other disadvantages to sheet feed scanners:

The moving parts required to do the job of feeding are prone to jamming and malfunction, which typically renders the scanner useless.
Feed scanners are not designed for books, but for digitizing large amounts of single-page documents.
Feed scanners usually offer less crisp images; the pages have to move through the scanner in order to be read by the machine.

;
, A good sheet feed scanner, even at the low end in price, is an investment, so consider getting an extended warranty from a third party. If you'll be using your scanner a lot, get an extended warranty.


The well known third party warranty users like ""Square Trade"" cost more than other warranty issuers. But because such companies tend to be affiliated with well known companies, you can generally have more confidence in them.
The warranty price and length will be cheaper than getting an extended warranty bought locally. Weigh the expense by factoring in the costs of shipping (if necessary), insurance, confidence in the warranty issuer, and your estimate of the frequency of repair.

, This is an absolute necessity with a sheet feed scanner. With a flatbed scanner, it is a good idea to separate the pages to achieve an excellent scan and to avoid damaging your scanner because scanning a bound book requires pressing the cover on the book with some force.


If there is a print or copy shop nearby, you may be able to take the book to them and ask them to cut off the binding with large powerful paper shears. This costs very little and will save a great deal of time; it eliminates the next few steps and all your pages will be square and devoid of binding glue or stitching.

, Contrary to what you may think, there are easy ways to do this with both a hardcover book and a paperback:


Hardcover: Use a utility knife to cut the paper hinge between the covers and endpapers. Then hit the flue with a moist, not wet, sponge to remove any paper residue.
Paperback: Use a blow-drier on its warm, not hot, setting to slowly heat up the glue holding the paper to the spine. Then simply pull the pages from the spine until they all come off in one bunch.

, You can start from the font and work your way to the back. Or you can fold the book in half in the middle and break two equal portions in half, and then break each half in half, and so on.

, Industrial shears are not essential, but if you decide to purchase one, choose the old style cutter because it can cut thin strips easily.


When cutting with a rotary cutter, overlap the paper, on the cutting platform, or else the paper will sink into the groove and the ends will not cut thoroughly.
Additionally, to minimize uneven cutting, when using a rotary blade cutter, reduce the amount of sheets you cut. With a rotary cutter, your margins will be narrower on one side (cropping can adjust the margin width). A good scissors and a photo editing program like Windows Live is all that you need to get the pages looking professional in the end.

, If you used industrial shears or a rotary cutter to remove the binding glue, you won't have much to remove.


There might be an adhesive type of glue also — remove this too, as you want to avoid paper jams.
If you have streaks on your scanned images, you may have some glue on the glass lens. Wipe the sticky, rubber cement glue off of the glass lens with a soft cotton cloth moistened with rubbing alcohol or glass cleaner.

, At this stage, if they aren't in order, organize them so that they are.

, Paper Port connects the scanned pages together and it also converts your scans to various file types such as PDF, TIFF, JPEG, BNG, etc. PDF files are good because they cannot accidentally be altered later when reading your book on your computer. For basic scanning, PDF and TIFF files are enough.

, Use Windows Live to fix the irregular edges of the pages by cropping them. These irregular edges are caused when separating the book into individual pages and could be distracting to view. Use the ""straighten image"" and ""cropping"" features in Windows Live.


If you so desire, make your scanning projects technically correct. Windows Live works well because the final product will be uniform in size without configuring.

, The blank pages have a purpose — they stop the flow of thought. If you do not include blank pages, include a note of this. For example, if blank pages 95 and 96 were omitted, put a note on page 94 (write: ""page 95 and 96 were blank""), because in the future it might be temporarily confusing to find those two pages missing. Have the scan number correspond with the page number, or very close to it, so when using Adobe Reader later, it will be easy to navigate through the book.

, Paper jams from feeding more than a page will wear out the scanner roller area faster.


Pages that were joined (stacked) by Paper Port can be separated into individual pages by Paper Port, but if you have have a batch of pages, all on one page, and made by your scanner -this file cannot be altered. If you scan your pages separately, any mistake can be deleted and replaced with a rescan of that page.

, If your scanner assigns each scan a counter number, then do nothing. This is ideal for inserting a missing page or a page that had to be rescanned.


If your scanner automatically has the date and time for a scan number, configure your job to be on a counter. This is much easier to work with.
When working with scans that were assigned time or date scan numbers, one option, although tedious, is to change those numbers to sequential numbers. A better option, when working with time or date scan numbers, is to divide your scanned pages into small batches. The pages tend to stay in sequence when working with small batches.
When using Paper Port, divide your work in batches. Paper Port works much faster when working with a small amount of pages versus a large amount. Instead of stacking 350 pages in one step, do it in several steps, of 60 pages per batch, and it will be much faster and less of a burden on your computer's memory.

, Do a few color scans with different DPI settings and check the size of each page when scanning a book totally in color. Multiply the scanned page size with the number of pages to calculate the total size of whole file.


Choose the DPI, carefully considering the readability and size of the scan. Color scans use a lot of space. Check the time is takes to scan a page at a high DPI — it will be in the minutes, while a black and white scan, at the default DPI, will be in seconds.
Know also that each color scan must be edited, with a photo editing program such as Windows Live Photo Gallery, because the text in your scans will be faded. In Windows Live go to ""adjust exposure"" then to ""highlights"" and finally move the slider knob in highlights to darken the text.

, For each grayscale and color scan with picture (or photos) and text, edit the exposure so the text will be readable. Editing, here, is an absolute necessity as grayscale scans will be pale.


In Windows Live Photo Gallery, go to ""adjust exposure"" and adjust the ""highlights"" slider bar. Adjust the highlights to make the text darker and the text will be indistinguishable from a black and white scan. Adjusting the highlights will not affect your image or photo.

, Set the scanner on black and white, do not set it on auto. By setting the scanner on auto, the scanner will choose between color, grayscale and black and white, but the scanner does not make these choices as accurately as you can.

, Always save the scanned images as TIFF files because TIFF files are easy to navigate and edit. Although your ultimate file type will be PDF (Paper Port can only join PDF files), PDF files in separate pages are difficult to navigate through.


For example, if you are reviewing 100 pages of TIFF files, you could scroll through them, but with PDF files you have to open (and close) each file one at a time. Furthermore, PDF files cannot be edited, so if you have a PDF file of 100 pages all connected from the beginning, and there are several pages that are unsatisfactory, you cannot do anything about it. For this reason, save your scans initially in TIFF or some other format that can be edited, and change to PDF later.

, Next, using Paper Port, join (stack) the pages into one big file. Stacked files can be unstacked, in case you find an error later. A stacked PDF file will be easy to navigate through.

, This is a precaution against computer failure, mistakes and accidental deletion. If your backup system fails, restore your deleted items from the recycle bin. Scanning can get confusing and mistakes happen. Ideally, do your scanning when your mind is rested and clear, but as this might not always be the case, use a backup system, at the very least.

, A book that has small fonts is a good candidate for scanning, but do not crop your scans and reduce the margins (for example, because you want to make the book more readable) because margins serve a purpose. Margins are like a frame on a picture, and a page looks better with margins.


When reading that book, with the small fonts, later on your computer, you can easily make the fonts bigger by using the ""zoom"" feature. When working with books with very small print, you could crop each page a bit to make the final product a few percentage points larger and more readable.

Decide how you intend to use the keyboard.,
Know the types of keyboards that are available.,
Synthesizers: Synthesizers can electronically reproduce the sounds of many different instruments, as well as create electronic sounds musical instruments can't duplicate.,
Consider your present musical knowledge.,
Look at the number of keys on the keyboard.,
Choose a keyboard with keys that are easy to play.,
Evaluate the sound capability.,
Look for ease of use.",How to Buy a Keyboard," If you're just learning how to play, or if you don't have any serious musical aspirations, you can probably get by with buying a relatively inexpensive (under US $100 new) keyboard. If you're a serious musician or plan on performing publicly, you'll want to buy a more expensive keyboard with a greater number of professional features.;
, In addition to Moog, digital keyboards are made by a number of other manufacturers, such as Alesis, Casio, Korg, Roland, and Yamaha. While keyboards offer a number of features, they fall into 1 of several categories, as described below:


Digital pianos: A digital piano has the same 88-key keyboard as an acoustic upright piano, but it replaces the metal strings and felt hammers with digital recordings of those strings. When pressed, the keys strike electronic contacts that play the corresponding samples. An amplifier replaces the sounding board that causes the strings of an acoustic piano to resonate, making a digital piano more compact than an acoustic piano. Console models have built-in speakers, while digital pianos for the stage are designed to connect to external speakers.

, More sophisticated synthesizers offer you the ability to program your own sounds and connect to a computer through either Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) or Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports. (MIDI interfaces also let 2 keyboards connect to each other, enabling you to layer sounds.)


Workstations: Also called arranger keyboards, workstations are more sophisticated synthesizers that offer music sequencing and recording capabilities in addition to computer interfacing and sound synthesis. These keyboards are most suited for digital music studios.

, Some keyboards for home use come with built-in instruction systems, as well as instruction books or software. These built-in systems may include lessons on how to place your fingers on the keys while playing, as well as a number of pre-recorded tunes that can be played while highlighting the keys that correspond to the notes of the song.


If you hesitate to practice in front of someone, look for a keyboard with a headphone jack so that only you hear your music when you play.

, Digital keyboards can have as few as 25 keys or as many as 88. Digital pianos have the full 88 keys of a standard piano keyboard, and most workstations have at least 61 keys or more. Lower-end synthesizers may have as few as 25 keys, although most home-use keyboards come with 49, 61, or 76 keys.


The more keys, the greater the instrument's range. A 25-key keyboard has only a 2-octave range, while a 49-key keyboard has a range of 4 octaves, a 61-key keyboard has a range of 5, a 76-key keyboard covers 6 octaves, and an 88-key keyboard spans 7. (Each octave includes 7 white and 5 black keys, or 12 chromatic tones.) The larger the instrument, the more room there is for other features.
The larger the instrument, however, the less portable it is. You may have to sacrifice the 7-octave range of an 88-key keyboard for a smaller unit that you can take with you if you like to jam with friends.

, In addition to looking at the number of keys, also look at how easy it is to play the keys without giving yourself painful fingers or carpal tunnel syndrome after playing. Two features to look for when buying a keyboard are touch sensitivity and weighted keys.


Touch sensitivity means that the strength of the sound is dependent on how firmly you press the keys. On a touch-sensitive keyboard, if you press the keys lightly, the sound is soft; if you hammer the keys, the sound is loud. Touch sensitivity is usually not available on low-end keyboards.
Weighted keys require you to press them to move them downward, but they come back up on their own faster than unweighted keys. The key weights add weight to the keyboard, making the keyboard cost more and be less portable, but they're easier on your fingers if you plan to play for long stretches at a time.

, There are 2 main sound capabilities: polyphony and multitimbrality. Polyphony is a measure of how many notes the keyboard can play at 1 time, while multitimbrality is a measure of how many different kinds of sounds the instrument can play at once.


Lower-end keyboards can play as few as 16 tones at once, while higher-end synthesizers and workstations can play as many as 128.
Multitimbrality comes into play if you plan to produce music with the keyboard. It's a definite asset in layering multiple sounds for a recording.

, Presets should be easy to use, and sounds should be logically grouped so they're easy to find and remember. The unit's liquid crystal display (LCD) screen should be easy to read, as well. Good documentation is helpful, but you should not have to consult it every time you want to use the keyboard's most important features.

Look at the table of contents.,
Read introductions and ends of chapters.,
Read the beginnings and ends of paragraphs.,
Scan depending on the book.,
Stop when things get important.,
Try not to re-read sections.,
Practice, practice, practice.",How to Scan a Book2," The table of contents, in the beginning of the book, is one, big outline of the structure of the book. Take some time to internalize the structure of the book, as provided in the table of contents, before you move on to scanning the book.


What you're doing is giving your brain a mold to fit little bits of pieces of information into. If you don't internalize the structure of the book and just start scanning, your brain has to piece together the structure of the theme by itself before it can begin organizing information. This takes time and mental effort. Eliminate that effort by studying the table of contents for 30 seconds before you start reading.

, A lot of the time, introductions will map out where the writing is going to go, while the ends of chapters often summarize what the author talked about over the course of the chapter.

, The beginnings of paragraphs will often give the reader a glimpse into topic sentences, which announce what the theme of the paragraph(s) is going to be about. After the topic sentence usually comes some form of evidence or justification. If done properly, reading just the topic sentence will let you know the theme of the paragraph without needing to process the evidence that comes with it.


The ends of paragraphs will often be transitions to the topic sentences of the following paragraph. If you read the last sentence of the paragraph and then the first sentence of the next one, you're more likely to understand the topic sentence.

, Different kinds of books require different ways of scanning. A newspaper article is designed to be skimmed, while a math book is patently not. Before jumping into your speed-reading exercise, decide how much of the book you want to scan and whether you can save any time for more in-depth reading.


Works of fiction are notoriously difficult to scan. You don't know how the book is going to turn out, and there's not really a ""guide"" within a table of contents. If you're reading a book of fiction, take a minute or two to read (not scan) a portion of the book that you think is important. Getting a flavor for detail will help your comprehension of the plot immensely.

, What use is scanning if you don't remember or understand the most important parts of the book? Give yourself leeway to stop when things get interesting. Really try to ingest these important parts of the book. They'll be the waypoints along your journey that you stop at.


Sometimes, text books will announce that an important concept is about to be introduced. A special bolded section or a portion of design will make it clear that you should slow down and interact more with the material here.
If you're reading a novel, for example, read a short summary of a chapter before you scan. This way, you'll be able to identify the most important parts. When you come to those parts while scanning, you'll know that you're supposed to slow down.

, Sometimes, people re-read sentences without ever knowing that they do it; to cut down on re-reading, read slower. If you're reading quickly but need two times to understand the information, you're probably not going to be able to scan as fast as someone who reads slower but only reads once.


Cover a line in your book with a dark piece of paper once you finish scanning it. That way, you won't be tempted to re-read the line once you're done going over it. After each line, move the paper down.

, Practice scanning your book at least once a week for 30 minutes. During this time, see how many pages you can blaze through while still retaining information. The next week, try to beat your previous mark without sacrificing any information retention.

The ""Visibility"" section allows you to enable a trail for the pointer, as well as hide the pointer when you're typing. You can also make the pointer emit circles to help you locate it when you press Ctrl.

, The settings in the Wheel tab affect how fast you can scroll through documents and web pages.


The ""Vertical Scrolling"" speed is dictated by lines-per-click. You can also set it to scroll a whole screen at a time.
The ""Horizontal Scrolling"" speed is dictated by characters at a time. Not all mice support horizontal scrolling.

, The Hardware tab displays the mice that are currently installed, as well as their status. You can see more details as well as update or rollback the driver by selecting a mouse and clicking the Properties... button.

, If you have a mouse with a fourth or fifth button, you can use configuration programs to set specific functions for those buttons. Your mouse manufacturer may have software available on their support site, or you can download a program like X-Mouse Button Control or Mouse Manager.

Choose a box that can fit a webcam and be at a good working height for you.,
Make hole at base of box wide enough for the camera cable, (and projector cables if using one).

,
Secure camera facing up in box base, along with projector and front surface mirror if the throw distance is too long.,
Thread camera and projector cables to computer.

,
Secure a piece of acrylic to open side of box.,
Activate touch screen software.,
Test settings, camera focus, lighting.

",How to Build a Cheap Multi Touch Surface," A wooden box is preferable, but any box will do. If using for a permanent installation, a projector may be useful below the 'screen'.;
,, If it is too long, then mount the projector up near the screen, with the mirror next to the webcam on the base of the box.

,, Then place a piece of paper the size of the acrylic over it. This provides a hard surface to work on, and can also improve tracking performance, whilst providing a projection screen.

, Community Core Vision is a good one, as is Touchlib. There are others, but these two are the two main ones.

Remove your memory stick from your computer.",How to Add Files to a Memory Stick2," USB ports are rectangular with a solid piece of plastic on the upper half of the slot and an empty space on the bottom. The slot should have a graphic of three branching arrows pointing upward next to it.


If you're using a desktop, your Mac's USB ports are probably integrated into the display casing, while Mac laptops have USB ports on the left or right side of the keyboard casing.

, Make sure the solid piece on the inside of the memory stick's port is on the bottom when you plug it in.

, This may take a few minutes if this is your first time installing this memory stick on your Mac.


If your memory stick's icon doesn't show up, open your Finder and look for the memory stick's name in the left-hand side of the window. It should be under the ""Devices"" tab.

, This will open the memory stick's interface, to which you can add files the same way you would add files to another folder.

, If your files are all in the same place, simply click and drag your cursor across your files until you've highlighted all of them.


To find a file manually, open the Finder and type the file's name into the search bar in the right-hand corner of the window. You can open the Finder by clicking the word ""Finder"" in the upper left-hand corner of your screen, or you can click the blue face icon in your dock.

Think about all of your options before you buy.",How to Adjust to a New Computer Keyboard," Compare it to the keyboard you were recently using. Did the other one have raised letters, and this one flat? Vice versa? There are many ways in which your new keyboard and your old one are different, so you may want to spend some time comparing them. When you have realized the differences, it will make it much easier to type when you are using it.;
, There are many stores that can show you all new types of keyboards. Here are some options:

Best Buy






Apple






Dell






Verizon







, There are types that light up in the dark, have hand warming systems, etc. Think long and hard, as this step is critical. List things you have had trouble with in past keyboards. Too low? Too high? Hard to type? List these, and then search for the kind that suits your needs.

, Or another online writing document, and just type. You do not need to type in any words, because this is just something to help you get to feel the way the keyboard works. Spend some time looking at the keyboard while you type, note the way your hands feel as you type, you may even want to do one letter at a time, to see the way it looks under the print.

, Open up a book or textbook you have, and type a page or two from the book until you can type without worrying where your hands are going to go. This will only work if you follow step 2, so if you skipped the second step, go back and do it.

, These buttons include the Alt, Ctrl, Shift, and Enter keys on your keyboard. Spend some time getting used to those after you are familiar with the actual lettering. It may take some time, but once you know where the letters, numbers, and outside buttons are, you will have completely mastered the keyboard skills!

, Some people like using miniature tabs that are on the back of your keyboard, while some prefer not adding the extra height. Look and see if there are tabs on the back of your keyboard (They usually flip right over with a simple pull), and see whether or not you like adding the extra height.

, If you can, IM one of your friends (AIM, Yahoo, GMAIL,AOL, etc...), and see if you can beat your friend in ""Writing Contests"". Set out a sentence or two and then type it! If you can beat your friend, you have then officially mastered your keyboard! Give yourself a pat on the back, you've come a long way!

, Would you like a keyboard separate? Or one built-in, like on a laptop? Choose carefully, because until you ""spill orange juice"" on your keyboard again, you're going to have to stick with it!

Look for specialty features!",How to Choose a Site to Webcam Model For," This can be a big deciding factor when choosing the appropriate site that you wish to work for. Some cam sites pay their models once a month, others once a week. What works best for you?;
, What this means is basically, what percentage of what you make is actually put into your pocket? Some companies pay 30%-35% and others pay all the way to 70%! This is something that can sometimes be easily overlooked and can make a BIG difference in your paycheck.

, Every website accepts females, but not always males, couples, etc. So if you aren't just a solo female, make sure you are even allowed to apply for the position before you go through the trouble of submitting all of your paperwork.

, This is really good to know. Generally any large, well known site has millions of visits each month which greatly impacts the money you will be making. Smaller sites, with lower traffic numbers can be a harder place for new webcam models to start.

, Make sure before signing up that the website you choose allows for geographical location restrictions. Basically, make sure that you can block states, countries and areas as you wish. This ensures that you will be completely invisible to places that you don't wish to broadcast to.

, Does this site allow you to place up wish lists to get goodies? Can you promote your highly important model twitter page? Can you be tipped? Can you do group shows. All of these small, but very important questions, can make or break you in the webcam industry!

Consider your needs.,
Evaluate your video viewing needs.",How to Buy a Webcam," Webcams vary in price, ranging from $25 to $150. Weigh the pros and cons carefully.


Higher-end, feature-rich models usually have much better quality for audio and picture than low-end models.;
, Before buying a webcam, take into consideration the various features.


Look at the megapixels. The average resolution for standard video should be at least 640 pixels by 480 pixels. For high definition (HD) video, you should buy a webcam with 1,600 pixels by 1,200 pixels. Having more megapixels means that the webcam is more likely to deliver optimal picture quality.
Consider the frames per second (fps) when buying a webcam. A lower fps rate may create a choppy video and out-of-sync audio. Typically, you want your webcam to perform at 30 or more fps.
Think about the webcam design when you buy a webcam. If you like to take videos, you'll need pan, tilt and zoom capabilities. If you want to be able to hear audio, make sure your webcam comes with a headset or a built-in microphone.

, Some webcams offer exceptional low-light sensitivity, while others do not. Look for a webcam that can handle low light. Consider whether you need software for surveillance, video editing or conferencing, email or stop motion.


Determine whether you want the warranty. If you're buying a webcam for travel, you may need the warranty to cover damage that occurs during transit. Most new models come with a 1- to 3-year warranty.

, You'll need a webcam that supports your computer and lifestyle.


If you're mobile, you'll need a portable laptop webcam that's compact.
If you're a Mac user, you'll need a Mac-compatible webcam that supports Mac operating systems and applications.

, If you don't have an HD monitor, you will not see the video in HD, even if you buy a webcam with HD features.


Most webcams on the market are HD capable, but you can adjust the settings to record in a lower resolution or switch from widescreen to standard.

Go out.",How to Get by Without the Internet," Supporters of the Internet love telling people how much easier life is with a world of information just a click away. But they forget that people had access to all the same information long before the arrival of the Internet: they're called encyclopedias. And they're probably a lot more accurate than some information you'd find online anyway! Online information can be tampered with too easily or be full of inconsistencies. Don't even get this article started on Wikipedia. You often have to sift through a lot of garbage to filter out the useful information you get online. With an encyclopedia, any topic you need to look up is readily available right at your fingertips, without all the sifting and filtering you do online. They're good, reliable sources of information.;
, Like the encyclopedia, one doesn't need Internet access to look up the standard spelling or definition of a word.

, If you're one of those that relies on the Internet for news, you can easily get your fix delivered right to your door every morning. Most towns publish their own newspaper, and the best part is that all the news is compiled and presented for you without any clicking or searching to be done.

, This may lead one to ask ""But if I'm cutting the Internet to save money, what good would it do to go out and subscribe to magazines?"" Simple: you pay a one-time price for months worth of issues, as opposed to paying your Internet bill every month. A typical magazine subscription offers weekly or monthly issues ranging from six months to a year all for under $30, and there are literally hundreds of magazines catered to every interest you may have. If you love looking up celebrity gossip online, there's 'People.' If you want to stay up-to-date on current events, there's 'Time.' Like browsing movie sites online? Subscribe to 'Entertainment Weekly.' Everything you love to search and look up on the Internet is available in a magazine somewhere, and you can usually subscribe to a whole years worth of issues for a pretty decent price. The best part about magazines is, like with the encyclopedia, all the useless information is already filtered out for you. You get dozens of pages of good, solid material you can hold in your hand and take everywhere with you (which you can't do with the Internet unless you bring your laptop everywhere and have wi-fi).

, This should be pretty self-explanatory, but the Internet is not the only way to look up numbers and information in your local area. Phone books have been around for decades and people did just fine with them.

, If you're big on online shopping, it might do you some good to get out and browse an actual store for once. Sure, the selection might not be as big as what you get online, but most stores are willing to order an item for you if they don't carry it. Many movie and music shops will order a movie, CD, or game you want if you only ask them to. And this also cuts out the cost of shipping. Many clothing stores and other establishments also have catalogs where you can browse their merchandise and either order in the store or submit an order through mail.

, No, this doesn't mean you actually have to write checks, but a record of your spending will eliminate the need to do online banking or check your account online. You can also call the number on the back of your debit card to get your balance.

, One of more convenient aspects of the Internet is the ability to pay all your bills online, but this can just as easily be done through alternative means. If the business is in town, drive there and pay it in person. If it's not, send a check or money order through the mail. Most companies allow you to pay your bill in any number of ways, and many people still buy money orders or send checks. You can also have your monthly charge for something taken directly out of your account.

, Sometimes, whether for work or school, using the Internet becomes a necessity. Thankfully, many businesses offer free wireless connection. Many book stores, coffee shops, and even fast food places offer free wireless Internet. If you have a laptop, take it with you, get connected and start doing your tasks.

, If your work or school requires you to complete a task, write a paper, or read something online, the local public library offers computers to use for free, to anyone. Most public libraries have a time limit in which to use the computer, but most college libraries allow their users to stay on for unlimited amounts of time. Have you ever gone to your university or college library and taken a look at all the students using the computers there?

, The Internet is an easy way to stay connected with family and friends with minimal effort, but much of that communication is also meaningless and void of real connection. If you're one that relies on the Internet to stay in touch with people, or use Myspace and Facebook, you'll find an actual visit or phone call with these people would not only be just as easy, but more fulfilling and ultimately satisfying than online-only communication. Even your grandma knows how to use a telephone.

, When most people eliminate the time they spend online, they suddenly find it frees up a significant amount of time. Rather than spending your life glued to a computer screen, get out and meet people. Join a club. Go to a bar or club. Just get out of the house. You'll feel better making a connection to people and things that isn't solely virtual for once.

,
Use toilet paper and flush it down the toilet.",How to Not Get Caught Looking at Porn," You can switch to a different window that is open on your computer with a few simple keystrokes, on MACs its (COMMAND + T) and you press these two keys at the same time. Make sure that you are ready to know exactly what you will change the new window to.


It is recommended to use a word file with a bunch of text pasted in to make it look full . If someone catches you and wants to know why you seem so uncomfortable and jumpy about getting caught at the computer, you'll be able to tell the little white lie that they scared you!
It also might not hurt to close the Internet window. However, a hasty click with the mouse is usually an indication of someone looking at porn, so having the other window and a good excuse will work much better. An alternative is to press ctrl + w, which closes the current tab that's open. This looks much more natural than clicking.
If you're going to plan on closing the window if you get caught, make sure to disable confirmation when closing multiple tabs. Unless you’ve already disabled this setting, some browsers (ex. Firefox) prompt for confirmation if you want to close multiple tabs, spoiling the quick exit.;
, Of course, your best option is to look at porn only when you know you're going to be alone. Whether it's everybody being out of the house or you just locking the door, making sure that there's no one in the room to catch you is your best bet.

, If you're going to keep porn, either saved on the computer, in printed magazines or otherwise, you'll want to be smart about where you keep it. If you think your parents, siblings or partner aren't going to check under the mattress, you are naive.


For storing digital files, you can create a password protected file with a nice inconspicuous name, like paystub_scans. These can be made using basic, built-in capabilities in Windows or MAC.

, Laptops are the best because you can move your laptop so only you can see it and you can close the lid so nobody else can see it. Make sure there isn’t a reflective surface (such as a mirror or window) behind you.


For even more privacy, you can find and store porn on your mobile phone, tablet or other portable device with an Internet browser incorporated into it. If you have an iPhone, make sure to use the ""Privacy"" mode on safari. This mode does not remember anything you search and there will be no history saved.

, Position yourself so that you can see approaching people before they can see your computer, giving you a chance to act.

, Do not use speakers when viewing porn, for obvious reasons. Do not use noise-cancelling headphones, or in-ear headphones with rubber seals. These headphones will block out external sounds, so you won't hear others coming. For best results, use iPod-style earbuds. Also, take out one earbud so you can listen to the film with one ear and listen to your surroundings with the other. Hearing is more important than you may think.

, This mainly applies to mobile or portable devices, which can be kept in places that would raise suspicion. Put the device in a sensible place such as on a table or next to a charger when you have finished using it., The more porn you look at, and the more often you look at it, the more likely you are to get caught. It's basic math. Reduce the time you spend looking at porn if you really want to reduce the likelihood of getting caught. Your imagination is your greatest tool.

, This is a bit of an obvious point, but don't leave the window minimised when you're away in case someone else wants to use the computer., Make sure that you frequently clear your browsing history. The best method is to clear it right after you finish your session and to only clear the items for that day or the time period you spent looking at porn. Having the entire history randomly cleared will be an indicator for smart users that someone is looking at porn. You can also use a private browsing mode like google chrome's incognito mode.

, These cookies aren't a tasty treat; cookies let your browser track where you've been on the Internet and information you enter. Clear your cookies regularly for safety reasons or keep them from being stored at all, and at least use the same wiping protocol as discussed above.

, You don't want someone accidentally coming across all of your searches for porn; that would be extremely embarrassing. Keep this from happening by clearing your Google search history as discussed above or at least every now and again.

, Google has removed the option to turn off autocomplete, the feature which uses your past searches to suggest new ones (which can tip off other users to how often you search for porn and what you search for). Instead of using Google, try an alternative search engine.


There are other ways around this, however. You can still use Google to look for porn, assuming you disable cookies and make sure that you are not logged in while searching.

, PornHub has a feature that opens up a webcam website as a new tab floating in the middle of the screen so make sure that is closed as well as the steps we talked about above.

,, You don't want your trashcan to smell suspicious, do you?

The first one you send to all the people that you want to invite to your party, the second is meant only for you and let's you edit your event poll.

, Just watch how your friend vote on the different date / times. You'll instantly see which date works best for them (the one with the grey box around it). Perhaps you should write your friend a second mail once all of them voted on their preferences, just to make sure everyone knows the right date & time.

, Let the party begin!

Uninstall the Trovi program using an Uninstall Program.,
Set your computer to a different date using System Reset.,
Remove the Toolbar from Internet Explorer.,
Reset your homepage settings away from the Trovi homepage.,
Choose the skip or no option when a software offers Trovi for installation.,
Learn to recognize the signs of a backdoor /unknown Trovi installation.,
Make sure your antivirus software is functioning correctly and is up to date.",How to Remove Trovi from Internet Explorer," If you're using Windows, go to the Control Panel and go to Add/Remove Programs and find Trovi and click Remove. Sometimes this doesn't completely work and it reappears.

In that case, use a Registry Cleaner like CCleaner or RegSeeker which removes the files and any folders. RegSeeker also has a search engine you can use to find remaining files and folders and delete them off the registry.;
, This is located in the Control Panel of Windows. Choose a time the computer worked well by clicking on a time or date before the Trovi virus was install., Open Internet Explorer and click on Toolbars. Locate the Trovi toolbar and click remove/delete., Find your browser's homepage settings. Replace the Trovi web address with the homepage you desire.

Find the Internet Explorer icon on your computer and right click on it. Go to properties and look for the house icon with the Trovi webpage address. Replace that address with the address you want for your homepage.
Open the web browser and find the house icon. Click on it and repeat the step above.

, Many users accidentally install this legitimate-looking software when installing many freeware programs. If you are offered it, do not press the install options and make sure the boxes are unchecked for installation of Trovi. Also look for the skip or decline button.

Use caution when downloading files from sites such as CNET. This virus is often included on many freeware files on this and similar sites.

, When you go to some sites, this happens from time to time, especially on mp3 or YouTube converters. The first obvious sign is your homepage changes to Trovi and no matter what you do with the homepage settings Trovi manages to keep your homepage on it. Another sign is the Trovi Toolbar that appears near your original toolbar. When you use the internet you are more at risk for errors and pages not to work or display properly.

, Some antivirus programs don't recognize Trovi as an virus program. Good antivirus programs can keep this annoying thing off your computer for good."

Realize how much time you are online.,
Consider whether you find the time you spend online reasonable or not.,
Set yourself internet time.,
Choose a set time.,
Find workarounds being online.,
Block yourself.,
Go out and do something.,
Go to bed earlier.,
Volunteer.,
Run a book club.,
Spend more time with your kids and pets.",How to Resist Spending Time on Internet," Given how easy it is to be online all the time, you've probably stopped counting the hours and noting when you're doing internet things rather than offline things. Start making a note of all the time spent online. This includes work time when the internet is used for research, updating, social media purposes––it's still online time and needs to be accounted for in the overall scheme.


Keep a diary of times for at least a week. At the end of the week, tally up the time spent.;
, If you think it's a lot of time but still think it's reasonable, what are the good reasons by which you are justifying this? Reasons that are not helpful for supporting your case include loneliness, boredom, frustration, anxiety, everyone-else-is-there and can't-be-bothered-doing-anything-else. Good reasons might include doing work, researching for studies and connecting with a long distance relationship.

, This involves a lot of self discipline but you're already thinking about making a change just by reading this, so you're bound to have this discipline in there somewhere. Decide which part of the day is going to be internet.


Obviously, work decreed internet time is already chosen for you. But maybe you can do even less time here by being more efficient with research, etc.
Choose a daily time, and if needed, vary it to account for sports practice, hobbies, after school or work activities, catching up with friends, etc.

, This is really important––only allow yourself a certain amount of online time, especially when it's goofing off or updating your profile or posts.

, In some cases, a lot of time is spent uploading posts, update statuses, images, tweets, etc. Try to automate these things if you're a blogger, tweeter or Facebook user. In this way, you can reduce the amount of time just fiddling with posting and shift your saved time to more interesting uses of the internet.


If you're searching for information, instead of using the internet try to go to a library. Even if you use the internet there, you'll more efficient as you will have less reason to waste time.

, If you can't find the self discipline to stay off, use software blockers to keep you offline. There are several apps and programs through which you can block certain websites for a certain amount of time try those. Or, get your very organized or kindly bossy spouse/sibling/parent to time you and pull the plug on the WiFi.

, Get out of the room, out of the house and out into the wider world. Leave the smartphone behind or turn off its internet connection. Spending too much time on the internet is often due to the simple reason that you have nothing else to do, so fill your time with fun activities that need your time.


Play a sport, go for a run or walk, go cycling, try a local hike or do a discovery walk of your local neighborhood.

, Take back those lost sleep hours and regain the energy to do more active things. Turn the internet off early, grab a good book and sleep earlier.

, Take up a volunteering opportunity which requires your help at least a few hours a week. That way, you can spend time helping others and doing something not related to being on the internet all of the time.

, Start a book club in your area of interest or for your local friends and neighbors. You will have to read the book in time for each meeting and then you'll have a great time getting together to talk about it.

, Take the kids to the zoo, to the movies, to a hobby event, to the beach or on a hike in the local woods. Take the dog for a walk. Wash and groom the cats. Grow a garden of rabbit food. Get re-involved in the people and creatures you care about.

Limit the number of messages that you're allowed to send a day.",How to Reduce Email," Mark messages as spam to have them automatically filtered out of your inbox in the future. When you receive spam, select the message and mark it as spam. This will mark the sender as a spammer, and all subsequent messages will be diverted to your spam folder.


Most web mail clients (like Google Mail, Yahoo! Mail, Outlook, and more) already have built-in spam filters that automatically move spam to your account’s spam folder. Spam filters are able to recognize spam by their text characteristics and large numbers of recipients.
Spam messages are e-mails randomly sent to a large number of recipients, often for marketing or scamming purposes.
Since spam messages can contain viruses, it's a good idea to avoid opening the message in order to mark it as spam. It is better to simply delete the message, rather than get a virus while trying to mark it as spam.;
, Different email clients will have more powerful spam filters and other features. If you aren't impressed with your email service, try using a different one.


Gmail is generally considered one of the more effective at filtering spam and has a large number of tools available for you to further control your email.
If your email address requires that you use a particular client but you want to try another one, have your existing client forward your emails to a new address with a different client.

, You should only give your email to websites you trust and that have a good reputation. You don’t want to give out your e-mail address unless it's really important. An e-mail address is one of your personal points of contact, just like your cell phone or your home telephone number. Being responsible about signing up for websites will often help reduce your emails.


Although a website you give your email to might not email you themselves, they might sell your email address to another company which will spam you.
Businesses that you give your email address to in real life may also do this. Be wary of particularly disreputable industries like travel agencies and bridal shows. Since they know exactly what you're looking to spend money on, they can easily sell your email address to related companies or services.

, Sometimes you might be inclined to post your email address on a website. This might be your own personal website or it might be the comments section of another website (like news websites or blogs). Another common mistake is posting your email address in forums. There are people who troll the web for email addresses and then sell those addresses to companies that want to send you spam. By taking some precautions, you can make sure this doesn't happen.One common solution is to write the email out instead of just listing it. So, for example, ""jackjohn@email.com"" might become ""jack john at email dot com"".
If the website where you want to post your email is your own, you can create a link which automatically generates an email to you instead of posting your address. This is known as a ""mailto:"" link.

, Aside from spam, newsletters are one of the major factors that contribute to a large influx of email. When you create accounts on different sites (like Amazon, eBay, etc.) where you are required to put in an e-mail address, these sites automatically lists you as a subscriber to their newsletters.


To stop receiving newsletters, all you need to do is to open it and scroll down to the very bottom of the message. Newsletters, by US law, have “Unsubscribe” buttons or links on them that you can use to stop receiving them. Just click the “Unsubscribe” button/link to remove your address from the mailing list, and you won’t receive newsletters from that website anymore.
Your spam filter won’t filter these messages, because these messages come from legitimate websites.

, Social media accounts, like Facebook and Twitter, are often set up to send you emails every time you get a message, mention, like, fav, or comment. If you're tired wasting time looking at your phone as it buzzes for each like, try changing your social media settings to only notify you about important interactions or change it to not notify you at all.


Instead of getting these constant notifications, set aside a few minutes at the end of each day to check your account for activity manually. This is better than having to wade through a sea of emails.

, Another option, if you frequently use sites that ask you to sign up or you still want to receive the standard bulk messages, is to get a new email account and use it just for receiving spam. Give this email address to websites and businesses and save your personal or work email for personal and work use.


You can also reverse this and set up a new personal or work email address, if it's time to upgrade from ""wolfmoon92@unprofessional.com"".

, Most web e-mail clients have a filter option that you can use to sieve out messages. Message filters work the same way as spam filters, the only difference is that messages filters are manually set by users. You can create a filter for specific e-mail addresses in such a way that every time you receive a message from that account, it automatically gets directed to the trash bin.


To create filters, simply access your account’s e-mail settings and select the “Filter” option. From there you can configure the e-mail address you want filtered out and to what location in your account should the message be diverted to (like the trash bin or a custom folder in your account).

, If you’re continuously receiving unwanted e-mails from personal e-mail accounts (like those annoying daily jokes you get from your cheerful office or schoolmate), then you may consider filtering them out of your inbox. In this instance, you will probably want to filter messages by the sender's email address. Have your client filter by the email of your choosing, routing all of those messages into a separate folder or even into your junk mail.

, If spam tends to make it through your email service's natural filters, then you might want to consider setting up your own filter which catches the most common phrases used in the spam you get. In this case, you will want to filter by the content of the subject line of the email.


Example phrases might include ""Cialis"", ""Viagra"", or ""penis"".
Be careful not to include phrases that are sometimes good and sometimes bad. For example, you might be tired of emails about sales, but setting the word ""sale"" as a trigger to send a message to spam is a bad idea. Sometimes you might want to know about a particular sale.

, Another option is if you don't want to receive any emails with particular content. You can set your filters to browse the content section of an email for key words or phrases, and then reroute those messages elsewhere. This is handy if you're tired of being emailed about a certain hot topic issue, or if you know you'll have a lot of emails coming in about something going on.


For example, let's say that you run a clothing company and you just released a new shirt for the hit show ""Rainbow Unicorn Fighting Squad"". You might want to create a filter that sends all emails about the shirt to a different folder, so that you can deal with those messages without losing sight of important emails in your main inbox.

, It's easy to sink a ton of time during your day into checking your email. This is a common problem especially in office settings. Because of this, it's a good idea to try to change your habits to reduce the amount of time you spend dealing with your email. Set limits, giving yourself only two or three short periods during the day, when you are ""allowed"" to check your email.For example, check your email at 9 am, 1:30 pm, and 5:00 pm, and spend no more than 10 minutes going through your messages at those times.
If you are a business owner or manager, you can set these rules for your staff in order to help productivity, too.

, One bad habit that many people have is replying to an email just to be polite. They treat it like a conversation but what it really does is create more email for everyone. Don't feel compelled to reply to an email using responses like ""have a good day"" or ""thanks"".


Generally, you should only reply to acknowledge that you got a message if it's important that the other person knows you got it. For example, if someone sends you some paperwork, it's better to respond by returning the filled paperwork or with a message saying when they can expect the papers back.

, Emails are designed for quick, one off messages. The sort of thing where you need to exchange no more than two or three messages to complete your conversation. If you need to send many messages, or have more of a conversation, then meeting in person or talking over the phone will save both of you time and significantly reduce the number of emails you need to check., If you want to help reduce how much time you spend with your email and also reduce the amount of email that other people have to read, try setting a limit for the number of messages you can send in a day. This will make you think a bit more about how important the message is and if it really needs to be sent.


For example, if you know that you need to send a message to your boss later, you might be less inclined to email everyone about your daughter's canned food drive.
If you want to send mass messages out to everyone, there are better channels. Try putting a post-it on everyone's lunch in the fridge, for example.

Free up space.,
Set network security.",How to Make Your Internet Go Faster1," Sometimes, when your Internet connection seems unusually slow, it's just because something else is using part of your connection in the background. Find your browser's download manager and ensure no files are downloading, then check to see what other programs are running, and check each one of them to be sure it isn't hogging your connection. If someone left a torrent running and neglected to tell you, that could very well be the source of your slowdown.


Check to see if system update or scan programs are running, too. Often, these programs slow your whole computer down, but the effect is only temporary. Once they finish maintaining your computer, things will go back to normal.
To check which programs are running in Windows, type Control-Shift-Escape. A list of all active programs will appear. On a Mac, go to the Applications folder, and then the Utilities folder inside that. Open the utility called Activity Monitor for detailed reports on programs, memory usage, and more.;
, One of the simplest ways to speed up modern computers is to disable some or all of the many fancy visual effects they apply to various actions. By turning these off, you give the computer more power to put towards opening web pages, and less for making files appear to spin or unfold when you open them.


In Windows, these options can normally be found in the System control panel, under Advanced System Settings. To find the right panel quickly, use the Start Menu to search for “System properties,” open the icon that appears, and click the Advanced tab. In the box titled Performance, click the Settings button to select or deselect visual options.
Macintosh computers utilize a whole host of visual effects. Some of these can be controlled easily; others require specialized software to disable. There is a lot of good information online about the specifics of these programs and what they do, but for starters, you can turn off Dock effects by going to the Apple menu and selecting System Preferences. From there, select Dock, and select “scale effect,” then deselect “Animate opening applications.”

, Over time, Internet browsers get replaced with newer iterations and become obsolete. If you continue to use an old version of a browser, you'll eventually begin to notice that your Internet seems slower, since the old browser isn't equipped to handle new content. Solve the problem by updating to a current browser. The four most popular are Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome. Install the latest version of one of them and prepare to be amazed at the jump in performance you see.


To download the latest version of Internet Explorer, go here.
To download the latest version of Mozilla Firefox, go here.
To download the latest version of Google Chrome, go here.
To download the latest version of Safari, go here and follow the instructions.

, Adware and spyware are programs that are free to install, but almost impossible to uninstall once you've made the mistake of doing so. They can range from mildly irritating to seriously invasive of your privacy, and they almost invariably hog your bandwidth, slowing down your Internet connection. To get rid of them, install a program designed specifically for the task.


The best way to avoid most adware in the future is to never agree to download anything other than what you're trying to download, even if it seems like the file you want won't download without the adware attached. No reputable site will force you to install a “toolbar” or any other extra program as part of a legal file download.

, Windows users generally rely on a free program called Spybot Search & Destroy; Mac users can use MacScan, but will have to pay a small licensing fee of $39.99 if they want to use it for more than a month. Whichever you choose, download the program, install it, and run it to find, catalog, and delete the offending programs from your computer. Once you have the programs, their steps are very straightforward.

, Viruses, worms, and other more directly harmful computer problems are best handled by a powerful antivirus program. Viruses and their ilk don't often contribute directly to a slower Internet connection, but they should always be prevented whenever possible and purged as soon as they sneak onto your computer. To check for and contain viruses, download an antivirus program and install it, then run it immediately.


You don't always have to pay for quality. Some of the world's best antivirus programs are actually free for home use. Windows users can download Avast! Antivirus or AVG for free; Mac users can download Sophos, a Mac-native antivirus program. All of these programs are clean, legitimate, and widely used.
Allow your antivirus program to run continuously in the background. It will catch threats you didn't see coming – sometimes more often than you might suspect.

, Sometimes, an older or smaller computer will begin to slow down due to the sheer amount of temporary Internet data or extra programs and files it's accrued over the years. This generally isn't a problem for any computer made in the last several years, but it never hurts to do a little spring cleaning. Start by deleting your temporary Internet data. This is usually pretty simple; guides for whatever browser you use can be found with a quick Google search. Afterward, go through your programs and remove those you no longer use or want.


Mac users can simply scan through the Applications folder and drag unwanted programs to the Trash. (Be sure to empty the Trash when you're finished). Windows users should go to the Control Panel and find the Programs panel (also called Add/Remove Programs, or Programs and Features, depending on your edition of Windows), and remove programs from there by highlighting unwanted items and clicking “Uninstall.”

, If you access the Internet via a wireless network, slowdown can occur as a result of other people using your connection to surf the Internet. Stop them from doing so by setting a network password. The means of doing this vary from router to router, but are generally available by means of accessing a specific address in your web browser, usually a sequence of numbers like 192.168.1.1. You can learn more about the specific steps of this process by reading .


If you're having trouble getting your network security to take, call the manufacturer of the router and ask them for assistance. If your router is still under warranty, they should be happy to help. Otherwise, you may need to check online for answers, or call a tech-savvy friend. There are many reasons why a password might not work properly, and most of them aren't obvious at a glance.

Clean your computer.,
Upgrade your Internet service.,
Purchase a new modem (and router).,
Repair your computer.,
Replace your computer.",How to Make Your Internet Go Faster2," The physical components of your computer can get dusty and clogged over time, leading to overheated parts that underperform and can eventually cause serious problems. Unplug and remove any batteries from your computer, then carefully open the case and clean it out with cotton swabs and compressed air. Sometimes, the bulk of the problem is just a huge dust bunny on the other side of the fan vent keeping your CPU cool.

, ISPs (Internet service providers) continue to offer faster and faster service every few years, to keep up with the increasingly image- and sound-rich world of the Internet. Even a connection that was blazing fast 10 years ago may seem agonizingly slow today. If you haven't upgraded the speed of your Internet service in several years, it's likely that the Internet, rather than your equipment, could be the culprit. Fix this problem by purchasing newer, faster service.


You can compare prices and service plans online or by calling ISPs and speaking with their salespeople. Always read the fine print: is there a contract required? How much extra will you have to pay in government fees or rental costs? Shop around until you find the best deal.
You don't necessarily need the very fastest Internet service available in your area. Speak with a representative about what you generally use the Internet for, and ask what he or she thinks would be an appropriate speed for your connection.

, Over a period of years, old communications equipment can begin to underperform simply because the company that provides your Internet service assumes you have newer equipment. The problem can also be exacerbated by mismatched equipment, such as a newer modem hooked up to a very old wireless router. Fix it by purchasing a new replacement for each piece.


To help speed the process along, bring your old equipment with you to the store, and write down the name of your ISP just in case.

Double check your monthly bill to make sure you aren't renting your modem from the ISP. If you are, you can probably request a newer one from them instead.


There's no need to buy top-of-the-line equipment for a simple household Internet setup, but don't always opt for the cheapest items, either. Aim for a price that's economical, but a bit above the discount level.

, In some cases, your Internet may be slow because of a physical problem with your computer's hardware. It may be worth bringing your machine to a repair shop and having them take a look at it. Settle on a diagnostic fee beforehand, and be sure the repair shop is reputable.


Often, the cost of fixing a significant hardware problem is more than the cost of just buying a new mid-range computer, so don't agree to pay for repairs until you know what's wrong with it.
If the technician says that your problem is a lack of hard drive space or RAM, your computer is probably very old and overdue for a replacement. You can clear more space and add more RAM, but it's not likely to make any long-term difference to your connection speed, in most cases (though it may improve performance elsewhere on your computer).

, When all else fails, chances are that your computer is too old or too worn-out to provide an adequate connection speed. As mentioned previously, content on the Internet becomes more demanding and data-intensive every year. Eventually, your CPU and system bus just won't be fast enough to keep up. Set a budget and head out in search of deals.


Don't be pressured into buying add-ons or extra insurance for your computer. You rarely need them; your computer manufacturer's warranty should cover any flaws in manufacturing perfectly well.
You don't need to buy the fastest, most expensive computer on the market to get a perfectly useful and fast machine that will last you another several years. Instead, read computer magazines or online articles comparing newer models of computer, and pick one with a high rating that has the features you need.
Be sure to install your favorite antivirus and spyware program as soon as possible, along with the latest version of your favorite browser. With a little bit of work, your computer will be all set for blazing fast Internet speeds for a good long while to come.
Internet speeds may vary depending on the distance between your internet provider (Internet Exchange) and your home. In some places, fiber optic cable may need ran from the nearest telephone pole to your home since the signal strength for cable modems and wireless routers can diminish if the distance is too great from the sending source.

Figure out what subgenre of vaporwave you want to do.,
Browse the internet for some 70's, 80's, 90's music.,

Make it slow.,
Select your favorite part of the track and cut it.

,
Experiment.,
Save the file in any format you want.,
Add artwork.,
Spread your Work.",How to Make Vaporwave," There isn't a real vaporwave, it's more a couple of sub-genre one derives from another. You can find out more about each one by researching Vaporwave subreddit wiki., This is the most common music sampled in vaporwave. One thing to note is vaporwave is highly, if not fully, sampled. New wave music based heavily with synthesizer noises and smooth saxophone leads seem to be the favorite for sampling from.

, DAW stands for Digital Audio Workstation (I.E. FL Studio, Ableton Live, Logic, Cubase, Pro Tools, Sonar, Reason, etc.) and is the common tool today for making music. Once you have imported the song into your DAW, you want to do your best to match the BPM of your project and sync them together so it's easier to slice apart into samples/loops.

, The most common rate of slowing down music to make it vaporwave is anywhere from 20-60 BPM slower than the original, and if it has vocals, make sure that it's slow enough to where the vocals sound eerie and almost nightmarish, and let that be your reference to how much to slow your track down.

,, Try to repeat some parts, add effects, delete the parts than you hate, until it sounds good for you.

, Flac is the best, but it's a really heavy format. Commonly, the most used is mp3 or mp4 if you want to upload it on YouTube.

, Vaporwave was one of the first genres of the internet music movement (even though not the first to be popularized) and has the most unique style of graphic design and aesthetic culture. Many designs in vaporwave sport roman statues, 90's computers and technology, distorted low-res photos of nature and ethereal backdrops of a world that is only seen in dreams or imagination. Look up some popular designs of vaporwave and spend some time in a famous art program (namely GIMP or Photoshop) trying to understand what is commonly seen and how it's structured in vaporwave designs.

, Soundcloud and Bandcamp are the two most popular websites for spreading of vaporwave and other internet genres. If you do not already, register for an account on one or both, and follow their instructions to get started on uploading your music to the vaporwave community!

Check the audio quality.,
Provide your music with all the right information.,
Get good artwork.,
Deal with logistics.,
Find music retailers.,
Get a digital music distribution deal with a retailer.,
Read your music vending contract.,
Create your own website and brand yourself.,
Publicize the music.,
Milk your connections and expand your reach.",How to Sell Music Online," If you haven't distributed music before, you'll want to make sure that your debut is as good as your music. Pay attention to the following things before you think about putting your music up:


Audio quality. You want your music to sound good, right? If you've had it professionally recorded in the studio, the chances are good that it already sounds amazing. However, even if you have and definitely if you haven't, it's a good idea to play it and see how it sounds. Try it in places you would expect your new fans to play your music, such as a computer, .mp3 player, car stereo, etc.
Audio source. An .mp3 file goes on your .mp3 player, but it isn't good for distribution because it's a compressed format. Make sure you upload your music as a high quality, lossless audio file like a WAV or FLAC file. You can also get it mastered if you want to improve the quality.;
, Your songs need something called meta data, the titles, album, and artist info attached to the files. Without it, people won't be able to recognize your music.

, Album art is an important part of you and your work's branding, and will help your listeners easily remember who you are by making your work easily identifiable. Currently, store standards (such as ADED.US Music Distribution, iTunes, and Apple Music) require your artwork to be 3000 x 3000 pixels in size exactly with a resolution of 300 dpi/ppi


Plus, it's an opportunity to make your work look good.

, Make sure you copyright your own work, check the copyrights on covers, and set up a release date.


Special processes exist for copyrighting and licensing music. Take care to consider all of these before putting your music out to the public, since some music that gets popular can be ripped off. A violated copyright can be a hard thing to fix.
If you're trying to make money off song covers, you can't do so without obtaining the license from the intellectual property owner in writing. Make sure you've done so before you upload covers, or face potential legal hazards.
Think of when you want to release your work, and once you've chosen a date, you can begin hyping it and marketing it in various places such as your social media pages, blog, local and online culture zines, etc.

, A number of accessible venues offer parking for pay-per-tune song vending. The biggest and most recognized is iTunes, but with research, beginning musicians may be able to find smaller online music vendors such as ADED.US Music Distribution, SongCast, Getonic, Tunecore, CD Baby and more.


Many of these vendors offer different terms, perks, benefits, etc. Make sure you shop around before deciding on which venue to use for your music.
Make sure you are eligible for the service. You may not be able to sign up in India for a service that only works in the United States, for example.

, Many major digital retailers such as iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, and Google Play do not usually do direct deals with independent artists.


So, in order to sell you music on iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, Google Play, etc., you will need to establish a digital music distribution deal with a digital music company that specializes in distributing music for indie musicians. These music distribution companies are referred to as aggregators. Essentially, these are music distribution companies that have direct contracts with the various digital retail stores for music.

, Most of the online sites offer equitable deals, but be sure to read all details of an agreement to make sure you like the terms.


Keep an eye on things like royalty collection, which will detail how much money the company will pay you for selling your music. For example, a site like CD Baby takes $4 for each CD or record, and 9% of all digital music sales.
There are sometimes premium and free versions of a service, and they could offer different rates. ADED.US Music Distribution offers 12 distribution credits whereas most music distributors distribute one project for one fee. CD Baby has a premium service, described above, as well as a free service, which keeps 15% of your download revenues. If you're not making a lot of money, it might be best to stick with a free account like this one.

, If you're selling via a dealer like CD Baby or iTunes, you won't need this to publicize your music, but your brand. If your music is good and people like it, they'll want to find the artist behind it, and nothing is a bigger buzzkill than looking for an artist and finding nothing but a blank Google search and a single distributor landing page.


You can start with a simple blog-type page, such as offered by Wordpress or Blogger. However, if you want to monetize your site, creating a personal, self-hosted site with installable themes and plugins is the way to go.
Web design is a big business as well as an art form, and there is a lot to learn about how to create a successful site: search engine optimization (SEO), site layout, HTML and CSS, etc. It will take some time to make a serious, monetized website if you do it yourself, and even longer if you don't have any background knowledge.
Some things you can do to make a good site: commission (or make) a beautiful, catchy logo; upload crisp pictures of your music or your shows; don't add a bunch of frivolous details.

, Most of us have heard it said that ""no publicity is bad publicity."" That slogan usually holds true in the music world, where news often generates sales. Think about the best ways to promote your music business to sell more music over the Internet.


Get onto the web with viral video. Simply having your music available online will not usually get people to buy. Putting out great, compelling clips on YouTube or some other venue (like Myspace) is more likely to help.
Monetize with social media, like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Pinterest. Lots of music is shared over social media, and most of its features are free to use for everyone, though some advanced options (like ""boosting posts"" on Facebook) cost more money.
Use local events. When online publicity is not enough, playing or participating in local events can get you more recognition. Some musicians who have had success in marketing their music swear by the solid combination of online vending and live venues to get visibility. The idea is that people will see your band at events and be able to follow up with easy online purchases.

, Everyone knows that connections make the world go round. Utilize your existing network of friends, relatives, and acquaintances to help you promote or publicize your music and brand.


Try to get publicity in local media. Most medium and large cities have various culture publications dedicated to cataloguing all the music, art, food, etc. their locale has to offer. Call them up or email them offering to do an interview with one of their reporters, and Try to push them to publish it both in print and online (it probably won't take much convincing).
Reach out to web publications. These often have far greater reach than your local neighborhood newspaper, and can introduce people all over the world to your new music. Depending on your level of expertise or relative fame, you can be featured in large or small publications.
Make contacts with local businesses. Bars and clubs are traditional venues for performances, but have you considered bookstores? Restaurants? There are many ways to build presence in a community, and expanding your range of areas for gigs is one. Think of the sort of place you live, the community you live with, and what they like, and then go out and meet people.
Spread the word with your friends and family. Give away free CDs, give out invitations to shows or gigs, offer to play at your friend's birthday party, or any number of other things to get more fans.

Go to the Start Menu, and click on Control Panel.,
There is an option in the Control Panel that should say something to the effect of “Date, Time, Language, and Regional Options.” (If you have Windows XP, then this is the exact wording.),
You should be in this folder, unless you have locked it in the past.,
Only after you start the installation and it has already asked for the required CD-ROM, put in the CD.",How to Make Other Language Fonts Show on Your Computer," (It should be called the same thing in every version.);
, It should sound similar in every version of Windows. Click once on this option.

, (In this case, simply go back and unlock it.) What is here depends on the version of Windows you hold, and each is at least slightly different. As an example, XP has five different options while Vista has only two. What you should look for should have the word “Language” in it.

In Windows 95, 2000, and etc., it is very similar to Windows XP, though certain things many be entitled different things.
In XP, simply go to “Add Other Languages” once you arrive at “Pick a Task.” This should be the third option with a green arrow to the left. Click on this. A box should appear that titles itself “Regional and Language Option,” as you could guess. You should be on the tab that says “Languages.” There are two different boxes (that are more than likely unchecked); the first one says “Install files for complex script and right-to-left languages (including Thai),” and the second one says “Install files for East Asian languages.” For the best results, check both boxes. Read what the boxes that pop up have to say.






Unfortunately, in Windows Vista, it is more difficult to access this than any other version of Windows. However, if you fish around after these, it becomes easier to understand. Click on “Regional and Language Options.” A box should pop up, and in this box, click on what should be the third tab, “Keyboards and Languages.” At the very bottom of this, click on the “link” (blue, underlined text) that asks, “How can I install additional languages?” Two boxes should pop up. Depending on how much time and/or space you have, read this first one and click either “Yes” or “No.” Go to the box that has appeared on the very right of your screen. It should be titled “Help and Support.” After you read this information, go back to the second paragraph and click the “link” at the very end that says, “How do I get additional language files?” Read this, and once you understand, you should be able to get the languages you desire.







, Then, sit back and let it load. This should take 5-10 minutes (Sometimes 15-20 minutes if your computer's memory is low) to do this. After this, simply restart your computer, and you will now be able to see (and maybe read) other languages!

Include keywords in each headline that are relevant to the article's content.,
Word headlines in a manner that is similar to the way most users type keyword phrases into search engines.,
Write headlines that clearly reflect the article topic.,
Write headlines that contain less than 65 characters.,
Capitalize all the main keywords in your headlines.,
Include numerical characters in headlines instead of numbers that are spelled out.,
Use keywords in headlines to indicate that the information you are publishing is recent.",How to Write Headlines for Search Engines," Search engines locate and display relevant content for users based on the words and phrases they enter into the search engine.;
, This can improve the ranking of your website in search engine results. For example, the headline of an article about the method for baking bread should be ""How To Bake Bread,"" instead of ""The Art of Baking Bread,"" the former of which may be more commonly entered into search engines.

, This will inform Internet users of the content they will see when they click on your headline.

, Most search engines, such as Google, have restrictions on the character length of headlines, and will not display your article in search results if the headline is more than 65 characters.

, This practice will make your headlines more readable and attractive to both human users and search engines. For example, write a headline as ""Tips for Writing Headlines in Search Engines"" instead of ""Tips For Writing Headlines In Search Engines.""


Refrain from capitalizing common words used frequently in grammar such as ""the,"" ""or,"" and ""to,"" unless these words happen to be the first word in your headline.

, Numerical characters are often more effective in grabbing the attention of readers. For example, write a headline as ""10 Tips for Writing Effective Headlines"" instead of ""Ten Tips for Writing Effective Headlines.""

, This practice can influence readers to click on headlines in order to read breaking news or updates about a particular topic. For example, the headline for an article about money-saving tips in the new year should read as ""New Ways to Save Money"" instead of ""Good Ways to Save Money.""

Write web copy that is easy to read and understand.,
Employ search engine optimization (SEO) techniques.,
Explain what makes your site or web page unique.,
Focus on reader benefits.,
Proof your web writing to make sure it is error-free.",How to Write Copy for the Web," You may be trying to sell a product or service, recruit followers for your blog, promote your business or convince readers of a cause's worthiness. Only once you identify what it is you want your web copy to accomplish will you be able to write effectively.;
, Your goals will determine your targeted visitors, and your web writing should speak directly to them. Determine your target's age, gender, socioeconomic status, interests and concerns, and customize your content accordingly.

, Write as if you are speaking to your site visitors and use the word ""you"" often. Remember that writing copy for the web is about developing relationships, and that your site's content is your chance to have a virtual conversation with visitors.

,


The heading is the first thing site visitors look at. It should grab the reader's attention and clearly state the subject of the page's content. Keep the heading short (less than 8 words) and concise, and try to stay away from prepositions (and, of, the, a) and adjectives.
Write a summary to follow the main heading. The summary should cover the who, where, why and what of the web copy, and should be less than 50 words.
When writing copy for the body of a web page, keep in mind that most people scan over a page in order to determine if it is a worthwhile read before they commit to reading it completely. Use bulleted or numbered lists, along with bold heading and subheadings, to create a visual outline of the page's content.

,


Begin each paragraph with an opening sentence that will get and keep the reader's attention, and limit paragraphs to between 4 and 5 sentences and 40 to 70 words long.
Avoid using large or obscure words that readers may not be familiar with.
Sentences should be between 15 to 20 words long.

,


Choose keywords that you feel best represent the subject of your web writing, and that people searching the web are likely to use. Plant these keywords in your page headings, subheadings and body in a way that is undetectable to the reader.
Use title tags that are keyword-rich and content specific. Title tags are HTML code that search engines use to assess the quality of the content on a website, and are 1 of the most important factors in achieving higher search engine rankings. Your headings should include relevant keyword phrases, and should be bracketed by title tag HTML code.
Include links in the content that lead to relevant outside sources, and make sure those outside sources also link back to your page.

, When writing copy for a home page, it is important that you stand out from the competition. Illustrate 2 or 3 reasons readers should stay on your page and further engage in receiving the message you are trying to communicate to them.

, Rather than outline the features of whatever it is you are trying to promote to readers, write about the benefits. For example, rather than tell readers your blog is informative, explain to readers how they will be better informed for reading your blog.

, Mistakes in web copy make you look unprofessional, and when readers assume you are not a professional, you lose your credibility and your site visitors.

, You can keep a calendar with all of your appointments, birthdays, and anniversaries using tools like Google Calendar. You can even share your calendar with friends and family, so that they know where to find you and what's going on in your life.

, You can play games online (or even gamble!). Websites like Games.com offer lots of free, classic games that you can play. Another option are games like fantasy football: a number of league are available online that you can enjoy for free.

Choose the most efficient and successful promoting methods.,
Use strategic keywords and phrases to attract search websites and keep site visitors scanning your content.,
Use of bold to highlight keywords or important benefits (use sparingly to ensure emphasis without over-use)


Subheadings to create a logical flow and to break large blocks of content
Titles and subheadings in ‘sentence case’ since capitalizing most words tends to break attention span and create confusion
Graphics or pictures that are clearly relevant to the product and that showcase benefits and value
Highlighting unique information, benefits and value by using ‘call out boxes’, ‘pull quotes’ and other design elements

Assess the purpose of your Internet research.,
Look at the URL for clues about the reliability of the information for Internet research.,
Learn who the publisher of the web content is.,
Investigate the identity of the author of the web content you want to use.,
Check when the web content was created or last updated.,
Verify information in the source material.,
Cite sources in your own work.",How to Use Web Content as Research Material,"


Do you need objective facts or are you looking for subjective opinions or descriptions? If you're looking for subjective material, then a personal home page may be appropriate for research material. If it's facts you're looking for, then it's not.
Question what entity would provide the most credible information for your purposes. Would it be a government site or perhaps a university? Maybe it's a newspaper?
Primary source material is often found on .edu or .gov sites.;
,


The domain or last three letters of the address tell you whether it is a commercial site (.com), educational (.edu), organization (.org), government (.gov), network (net), or military (.mil) web site.
Depending on your research material needs, you probably want to avoid .com sites.
Even an .edu web site doesn't guarantee the integrity of the information. Sometimes the work of students is posted on educational sites.
A personal name within the URL suggests that you should probably evaluate the web content a little closer to see if it presents reliable information for your research.

, If it's not immediately apparent, look for a link that says ""About Us.""


For example, a web site about insect habitats that is published by an insecticide company may be biased.

,


What is the author's name and position?
Does the author represent an organization?
Does the author have any expertise in the subject matter or is he or she just providing opinion or quoting other sources?
If a web page is quoting from another web site or source, go to the original source to verify the information. There is nothing to keep someone from changing original source material for his or her purposes.

,


Many pages have a ""last updated"" date on them.
If you're looking for current information, the date of the source material is significant.

, You'll often see cited information in published academic work.


If material is based upon another source, follow the links.
Look for sources in notes within text, footnotes, endnotes or bibliographies.

, This is often required for academic papers, plus it is considered appropriate to give credit to authors of source material.


Plagiarism isn't just copying another's work verbatim. It is presenting the ideas of someone else as your own.
Check with the end users of your research for the preferred citation style. The most common are APA (American Psychological Association), MLA (Modern Language Association of America) or Chicago Manual of Style.

Install a podcatcher.,
Customize your settings.,
Search for a podcast.,
Download your podcasts.,
Access your podcasts.",How to Use Podcasting1," To download podcasts onto a mobile device, you will need a relevant app known as a ""podcatcher"". Since there are numerous podcatchers available for both iOS and Android, you have options; as a general rule, though, you should look for podcast apps with wide, expansive libraries, clean interfaces, and easy controls.


iOS: Apple's newer models actually come with the free Podcasts app pre-installed. If you don't have a recent iPhone or iPad, don't fret--you can download Podcasts from the app store free of charge. Overcast is also a great alternative to the default software. Android: Apps like Pocket Cast and DoggCatcher range from $3 to $4 and come highly recommended; however, if you're hard on cash, Stitcher Radio along with Podcast and Radio Addict are both great free options for Android. You can download them from Google Play. ;
, Once you've downloaded a podcatcher of your choosing, make sure your accessibility settings allow you to download items through the app. You can generally do this by accessing the app's restrictions through your phone's settings and editing them accordingly.


Many podcasting apps will also give you the option to download every new episode of a subscription automatically. Though this can eat up hard drive or cloud space quite quickly, it's a great option for users interested in some autonomy.
Similarly, many podcatchers allow you to customize specific subscriptions. Most come with features such as layout options, whether or not to download new podcasts automatically, and sorting.

, In your podcatcher, access the search function and browse. Ideally you'll have an idea of what you want to look for; if not, most podcatchers have ""trending"" or ""top"" tab within their interface. This is always a good place to start if you're out of ideas. Once you've found a podcast you like, find a ""subscribe"" button in your podcatcher interface. Often, this button will be intuitively designed--a plus sign in the corner, for example--but it will differ from app to app. Subscribe to the podcast if it looks like something in which you'll be interested.

, Usually, each individual episode displayed on your podcatcher will have a download sign--a downward-pointing arrow, for example--next to its name. If you've made sure that your podcatcher is allowed access to your hard drive or cloud already, then press the download button.

, Depending on the model of your device, you will have a different default app for playing podcasts: iOS favors iTunes, while Android devices default to Music Player. Many podcatchers also give you the option of playing your podcasts within the app.

Even if you don't have an iPhone or iPad, iTunes is a great music, video, and podcast manager, especially since it stays consistent with updates and it's free.

, Once you've downloaded your program of choice, check out your options to customize aspects like file type, download destination, and player preferences. Some managers, such as iTunes, will allow you to play your podcasts within the interface.

, Unlike mobile podcast platforms, your computer gives you freedom to browse any and all podcasts in public record, rather than simply the ones in app databases. Use this to your advantage! Once you settle on a podcast, click on it to view specific episodes.


You may have to create an account with a podcast site in order to view specific podcasts, so be ready to enter a valid email and password if needed.

, If you are using a manager like iTunes or Zune, you can simply click ""save"" or ""get"" next to the episode's name to save it to your computer. Otherwise, you will have to copy the podcast's URL and paste it into your manager. Every manual client differs slightly in its method of downloading, but most use the provided URL to access the podcast's feed. You'll want to click the ""subscriptions"" tab or its equivalent in your manager of choice; from this step, you can usually download specific episodes.
You can click a ""refresh"" button to check for new episodes.

Think about what you are looking for.,
Explore your options.,
Do some old-fashioned research to spot the differences between the three main search engines.,
Run a basic search.",How to Use Image Search1," It helps to ask yourself a few important questions before searching. This will bring to mind the correct terms to use in your search.


What are you looking for?
How specific are your needs? Do you want to pick something cute from many pictures of cats? Are you looking for a picture of a cat doing something in particular?
What do you want to do with this image? Do you want to use it in a social media post? Do you want to print it for publication? Maybe you just saw a status update that reminded you of a meme you saw awhile back. Perhaps you need a photo to use in one of your blog posts. There are different copyright considerations for each of these options which may require a more advanced search.;
, The biggest names in image search are Google, Bing and Yahoo. They all do basically the same thing in their own way, each with slight differences.


Google offers a very comprehensive image search engine. It provides a user-friendly interface with a wide variety of filters and advanced search options.
Bing Images is also good. It is comparable to Google Images in terms of interface and filters, but not quite as comprehensive.
Yahoo Images works in a pinch. It has only the most common search filters, with about the same results as Bing most of the time.

, Open up each image search engine in a different browser tab. Pick a basic search term like kittens or Nicolas Cage, and enter it into each search engine. Compare and contrast the results. You will notice that all three engines come up with some duplicate entries. However, Google usually finds the widest variety of items that are not picked up by the other two.


Mess with the filters. All three engines have some version of time, size, color, license and safe search filters. Google and Bing both have file type filters, but Yahoo does not. Bing has a couple of filters Google doesn’t have, such as layout and people. This makes Bing look like a more specific search engine at first glance. However, if you click on the gear shaped button in the top right hand corner of your Google Image search results page, you can access the Google Advanced Image Search. This feature is what sets Google apart from other engines. It allows you to narrow down your search using text and other very specific options.
Choose which engine or engines you will employ based on your needs and the options each has to offer.

, Enter a word or words into the search field at the top of the page, then press “enter” or click the “search” button with your mouse.


If you want to narrow down your search results, try putting your search terms in quotation marks. For instance, “Nicolas Cage crying” will bring up slightly different and more specific results than plain old Nicolas Cage crying.
Pay attention to the autocomplete options when you enter your search terms. Sometimes this feature will generate a list of popular associated searches as you are typing. This can be a good way to get the most out of your web searches.
Keep in mind you will sometimes have to do multiple searches before you find exactly what you are looking for. After an initial search in Bing or Google, you will notice a section at the top of the page above your results with suggestions for related searches. Feel free to browse through those if you are having trouble thinking of the correct terms for your search.
At the end of the day, searching the internet is all about word association. Adding the right verb or adjective to the object of your searching desires can make all the difference in what results turn up.

Download the mobile app.",How to Use Duolingo," When you visit Duolingo's main page, you'll be asked to sign up in one of two ways.


If you choose to sign up via email, you can link your Facebook account to Duolingo later.
If you choose to sign up via Facebook, it'll be easier for you to invite friends later. You can also automatically share updates and progress on your Facebook timeline.;
, When you're creating a new account, you'll be asked to select the language you want to learn. This choice isn't set in stone, though — you can always change your mind or add new languages later. The current options for English-speakers are:


Spanish
French
Italian
Portuguese
German
Dutch
Danish
Irish
Swedish
Turkish
Esperanto
Ukrainian
Norwegian (Bokmål)

Coming Soon: Hungarian, Russian, Polish, Romanian, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Klingon, Yiddish, Greek.

, When you're first signing up, you'll only need to enter a username and password. If you'd like to add more to your profile, though, you can do so by clicking the gear icon in the upper-right corner and selecting Settings. You can add your:


Full name
Location
Short bio
Facebook account (as well as whether you'd like to automatically share progress on Facebook)
Twitter account
Profile picture

, Duolingo works best when you practice every day, though it can be easy to forget. Set up daily nudges to drill your vocabulary to stay on track.


Go to notification settings: https://www.duolingo.com/settings/notifications

Check the box next to ""Email me when..."" and select a time. Try to choose an hour when you won't be busy driving home, or sitting in class. The end of the day, about an hour before you go to bed, might be a good time to use at first.

, The skill tree is where you'll do the majority of your learning. It's split into different units, and each unit contains multiple lessons. As you progress through the language, more units will be available to you.

, If you already have a basic grasp of the language, you can test out of parts of the skill tree. Click the golden keyhole at the end of each section to take the test. You'll have three attempts.

, It will probably be something like ""Basics 1.""

, Within each skill unit, there are multiple lessons. Click the first one to get started. You'll start out with four hearts (which will later turn to three, as you progress through the language). Every time you get a question wrong, you lose a heart. The goal is to get through the lesson with your hearts intact. Here are the different types of questions within a lesson:


Vocabulary: You'll see a picture of the item, and be asked to name it.
Translation: You'll be asked to translate a word or sentence out of English and into the other language, or vice versa.
Listening: You'll hear an audio clip of a word or sentence, and be asked to type it in. (Note that you won't be translating for these questions — for instance, if you hear the sentence in Spanish, type it in Spanish, not English.) To play the clip more slowly, click the smaller turtle icon beneath the main speaker button.
Speaking (optional): You'll be asked to repeat or translate sentences using the microphone on your computer or mobile device.

If you don't want to do the speaking questions, click the gear in the upper right corner, choose Settings, and switch the microphone option to off.



, If you're not sure about a word, hover over it with your cursor. Duolingo will either provide the translation or give you a few options.


Note that as you get further along in your studies and your sentences become more complicated, this tool won't be as useful. Beware!
Duolingo will note that you peeked. However, you won't lose any points for this.

, Navigating through Duolingo lessons using the keyboard is a lot faster and easier than clicking. (It will also come in handy when you're doing timed quizzes.) Here's what to do:


Enter: Submits an answer
1, 2 or 3: Selects a multiple choice answer
Up and down arrows: Scrolls through choices in a drop menu
Ctrl + Space: Replay audio clip
Ctrl + Shift + Space: Replay audio clip more slowly.
Click the gear in the upper-right corner and select Help to see a visual table of keyboard commands.

, The key to retaining your new language is drilling what you've learned. Every few lessons, stop and do a few practice rounds. Or, if you only have 5 minutes to work on your language today, spend it on quizzing yourself. Duolingo offers a few different ways to test your skills:


Practice overall: Navigate to your skill tree, and click the blue ""Practice all skills"" button on the right. You'll be randomly quizzed on everything you've learned up to this point.
Practice individual skills: To refresh a skill unit, click the blue ""Practice skill"" bar on the right side of the page, below the lessons. This will run you through what you learned in that particular unit.
Practice weakest words: Click Vocabulary, on the navigation bar at the top. Then click the blue ""Practice weakest words"" bar at the right. Duolingo will run you through the words you've learned recently or seen less often.

, When you pass a skill set with flying colors, the module will turn gold. If you slack on practicing, however, your progress will decrease and the modules will slowly turn different colors.

, The Immersion section allows you to translate sentences from actual webpages, as well as reviewing other Duolingo users' translations.

, You can choose whatever is at the top of the popular list, or narrow your search by selecting a category on the sidebar at the left.

, Try clicking a sentence. The translation submitted by another user will pop up. From there, you can decide if the sentence is right or wrong. If it's wrong, you can click Edit and submit a better translation.

, Click a sentence that's greyed out. A text box will pop up, where you can enter your translation and collect more points.


If you're not sure about a word, hover over it with your cursor. Duolingo will provide a few suggestions.

, The forums can be a good resource for answering questions, finding supplemental material, or simply connecting with other users.


Click Discussion on the top bar to enter the main forum. From there, you can select your language on the right sidebar.
Discuss skill units. Each Skill unit will have a discussion board, below the lessons. You might find answers to common questions there.
Discuss individual sentences. You can ask other people for help in the middle of a lesson. After you've answered a question (whether it was right or wrong), you'll see a Discuss Sentence button at the bottom of the answer section.

, If you'd like to follow someone else's progress, navigate to their profile. Click the blue ""Add friend"" button at the top of the page. From then on, you'll be following that person's progress. You can see how may points they've accumulated on the leader-board, at the right of your skill tree.

, On the home page (at your skill tree), click the Stream tab near the top of the page. From here, you can post an update on your progress that your friends and followers can see.

, Duolingo is available for free on both iOS and Android. You can still do lessons, practice vocabulary, and translate pages from the app.

Check out Advanced Image Search on Google.,
Use shortcuts.",How to Use Image Search2," None of the other engines have this option, and it is very helpful for specific searches. Access the menu by clicking the gear shaped icon in the top right corner of the Google image search screen.


The options from here are pretty self-explanatory. Each field has a different variable you can modify to filter the search. You can tell Google to bring up results only with or without certain specific words. You can enter all kinds of specifications, such as image size and aspect ratio, color search information, image type, file type, you get the picture.
Usage rights is a very important search option now offered by all major search engines. This is the result of a widespread effort to differentiate between public domain, copyrighted images, and everything in between. You will find more filter options for this in the advanced search section of Google than anywhere else. How you use this feature will depend on what you plan on doing with the images you find.

, If your searches are coded accordingly, you can get precise results no matter what search engine you use.


Placing the word OR in caps between search terms can give you a variety of results you might not get from searching just one term. For instance, searching a thing like Nicolas Cage OR Nic Cage OR Nicolas Kim Coppola OR Edward Malus OR Charlie Kaufman OR Castor Troy OR Terence McDonagh OR Peter Loew is very likely to bring up every known photograph of Nicolas Cage on the entire internet.
Use the minus sign to exclude search results associated with a particular term. For instance, searching for Nicolas Cage –Johnny Blaze will exclude photos of his character in Ghost Rider from your search results.
Did you know there is a quick little code you can use to search for results within a specific website? For instance, if you type site:thesun.co.uk ""Nicolas Cage"" into any image search engine, your results will be limited to photographs of Nicolas Cage from The Sun tabloid.
Use Safe Search to exclude adult content. For instance, if you enter safesearch:Nicolas Cage, you can be sure all results are safe to view at work.

Get familiar with reverse image search.,
Consider the common uses for reverse image search.,
Try using Google Images.,
Check out tineye.com as well.",How to Use Image Search3," A couple of search engines now allow you to upload an image and search for all the different instances of it throughout the web. Mainly, Google Images and Tineye.com.

, This feature is very useful if you want to find the original author of an image. You may need to do so if you are hoping to gain permission for commercial use of the content.


It can also be used to control the distribution of images you created. This can range from copyrighted material to incriminating images you are trying to keep under wraps.
You can use it for research. Say you have to write a paper about a painting for Art History. Do a reverse image search with a JPG of the painting and you will suddenly have access to all the different contexts in which the image appears online.
If you are looking for a higher resolution version of an existing image, reverse searching it can help.
You have the legal right to defend yourself against slanderous use of images you created, and images depicting your face or person. Reverse image search is a great way to find out who is using your images and for what purpose.
Reverse image search can also be used to satisfy other curiosities, such as how popular or widespread an image is.

, Go to the Google Images home page and click the tiny little camera shaped icon inside the search field. This will prompt you to designate an image for your search. You can choose between dragging the image from your desktop or browser into the search area, uploading the image from your computer, or entering a direct URL to the image. In an instant, you will be presented with your search results.

, It is a search engine just for reverse image searches. The mechanics of searching tineye are the same as Google. You can drag and drop, upload, or enter the image URL from the tineye home page to begin your search.


Tineye is dedicated to connecting content authors with the content they created. They offer networking opportunities and other options you won’t find on Google.

Click your desired country.,
Use Hola to get access to sites you otherwise couldn’t.",How to Use a VPN," If you are at home, your computer should connect automatically. If you are working someplace other than home, such as an airport or coffee shop, you may need to manually connect to the Internet if you have not connected from that location before.


Since you don’t have a VPN yet, be careful of which public Wi-Fi you connect to. It’s best to close any sensitive applications like email until you are secure.;
, VPNs are offered in both paid and free versions, and both have merits. You may not need a full scale VPN if you simply want to access Netflix or BBC iPlayer from different countries, or you want to make sure that your social login information is safe while at a coffee shop; you can get typically what you need from a free service. However, if you are looking for more comprehensive encryptions that hide all your activity from government surveillance or disallow data trackers from advertising companies, you may need a paid service.Be aware of free services as some will add unwanted toolbars, third-party applications, and place third-party ads on websites you visit.
There are plenty of trustworthy free VPN services like VPN Gate, TunnelBear, and Starter VPN. Note that most free options offer a data limit for free before charging you for more data.Most VPNs also work across Windows, Mac, tablets, and smartphones.
VPNs can also be used within a company to connect everyone privately and protect sensitive company data.

, Navigate to the website for your desired VPN. You should see a download button on the homepage, or a link in the page’s navigation bar for downloading. Click the download button and follow the prompts to download the version for your operating system.


If you need a VPN for work, contact your company's IT department to get the VPN software. You will need to install the client software onto your computer to access your company's servers. Your IT department will determine if your computer is compatible with the VPN software, help you make your computer compatible if it is not, and help you install the software and configure your access to the VPN.
Many VPN softwares offer options for downloading to iOS and Android. If you are on the company’s website on your computer, click the link for your phone’s operating system. You will be directed to your phone’s app store.
If you are not on your personal computer and want to download a VPN directly to your smartphone, go into your phone’s app store and search for the VPN, downloading directly on your phone.

, Once you have downloaded your VPN software to your computer, locate the downloaded file. Open it and follow the prompts to install and start. Some VPNs like CyberGhost are ready to use right away without creating an account. Other VPNs require you to sign up with an email address.


On a Mac, you will typically launch the .dmg file and be asked to drag the application into your Applications folder. If you’re computer is password protected, you will be asked to input your password upon first launching.
On Windows, you will typically run the .exe file and follow the installation prompts. Once you have installed your VPN, launch the application from your Start menu.
On your smartphone, launch the app from your home screen. You will be asked to login with your account or create one if you don’t have an account already.

, If you’re using a VPN for personal use, make sure you read the terms of use. Some VPNs, especially free ones, might install third-party applications, or give you a data limit. Make sure you are educated on what your VPN is providing you, what it is requiring of you, and what kind of information it collects.Search online forums to see what others have said about a particular software.

, Once you have downloaded and installed your VPN, it’s time to start it up. Locate your application from your Applications folder, Taskbar, or desktop/home screen.


On Windows, you may have an icon on your desktop or you may need to click on the Windows icon in the lower left corner of the screen and select the program from the Taskbar or the Programs menu.
On a Mac, you can find your VPN application in your ‘’’Applications’’’ folder.

, Most VPN applications will give you easy to follow prompts that get you started if this is your first time using the software. Some services like CyberGhost don’t require you to do anything but click the big yellow button in the center of the application. Other’s like TunnelBear ask you to set up an account. You can also edit your preferences to tailor your experience.Most applications give you the option to automatically connect upon startup of your computer.
You may also have the option for TCP overrides. This override means that if your internet service provider throttles your connection, you can choose to force your VPN to use a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) which is more stable, though sometimes a bit slower., If you don’t have an account you may have to sign up. If you are using a company's VPN, or most personal software, this will grant you secure access to your network. At this point, operations vary depending on how your company has configured its VPN access.


The VPN software may open a new window that looks like your desktop at work, also known as a virtual desktop, where you can access your company resources. Or, you may need to launch your web browser and enter a secure web address where you can access your company's resources. If your VPN session does not launch a virtual desktop, your IT department should provide you with instructions for accessing your resources.

, Now that you are signed up and logged in, you can begin running your VPN to protect your identity, access protected files on a network, or access websites and content not available in your country. You can also change your settings to allow your VPN to launch automatically and connect to a random network, or you can choose when and how you connect.


If you are using a free VPN, most likely you’ll only get a certain amount of data to use per month. Or you may be restricted to a time limit. For these reasons, it’s best to only activate your VPN when you need to secure your IP address. For example, you may want to use your VPN when on a public Wi-Fi like at a coffee shop, but not use it home.
You can use your VPN to watch Netflix in a different country, allowing you access to movies and shows that you may not get normally. VPNs that let you choose where you’re browsing from, by changing your IP address, allow you to pick a country that you want to view from. If you’re in the UK, you can change your location to somewhere in the U.S. to view the American Netflix., Hola is a collaborative (P2P) network that comes as a browser extension. You can install Hola to your browser easily for quick and free VPN access. Hola works on Macs and PC's as well as iOS and Android. You can download it to your computer or through the App store. Or, you can install the extension to Chrome, Firefox, and Opera for quick use.
Hola reroutes some of your activity through a peer to peer network and helps to mask your true IP address. It doesn't completely reroute it as other VPN applications do but is effective for its ease of use.
Once on the homepage, click the blue button that says ""Get Hola, it's Free!"" Follow the prompts for your browser or device to install.

, Once you have Hola installed, you will see a button on your browser's toolbar. It is identified by a little flame with a smiley face. Click it to activate the Hola service.


If Hola is off, the flame will be grayed out and you will see that it says ""Off"".
Click the icon and then wait for a popup box to load. Click the button on the center of the dialogue box to activate Hola.

, Upon activating Hola, you will have the option to browse from various countries. This is how the Hola's VPN service masks your IP address.


Click the ""More"" option to open a list of all the countries that are available.
Once you click a country your page will reload and will act as if you are browsing from your desired location.
This is useful for not only protecting your identity, but also to access websites that may not be available in your region.

, In addition to routing your IP address and hiding it, you can also use Hola as a quick way to watch Netflix as if you’re in another country. You can also access other sites restricted to your region.


Not everyone gets access to the same content on Netflix due to licensing restrictions. The U.S. has the largest library of content online but doesn’t have some of the content that other countries get.
For example, you can go to Netflix and activate Hola to then watch as if you’re in another country. If you’re outside the U.S., click the browse from U.S. option. If you want to watch something on the British Netflix that you don’t get in the U.S., click the browse from United Kingdom option.

Use Tinypic for quick tasks.",How to Upload Images to the Internet1," Imgur.com, the largest website of its kind, is an image hosting site that allows users to upload image files and share them with others quickly, easily, and anonymously.Because of its ubiquity and ease of use, Imgur is a good ""first stop"" for casual image hosting needs.



Pros: Easy to use, no sign-up required, massive user base.

Cons: User base tends towards ""meme-y"" content, potential loss of quality on large image files.

Use for: Sharing pictures via links in email/forum posts, uploading memes, posting Reddit/Digg content.
Note that Imgur pictures are deleted if they receive no views after six months. In addition, Imgur will automatically compress large images to save bandwidth.;
, Uploading an image to Imgur is easy. Once you've reached the home page at Imgur.com, use the following instructions to upload your file:


Click ""Upload Images"" at the top of the page.

Pick your upload option. You can browse your computer for images that you have saved, drag and drop images into the Imgur window, or even paste copied images from the clipboard.
Note that you can upload more than one image at once — to do this, just repeat the upload process for each new photo and it will be added to your queue.
Once you are satisfied with your selections, click ""Start Upload."" The images will be uploaded onto the Imgur server (you can watch each image's progress via the bar next to its thumbnail picture.)

, Once your image is uploaded, you will be taken to its page on Imgur. On the right side of the page, you will see a list of links. Each link is labeled with a method for sharing it — to show people your image, just copy and paste the appropriate link into your online conversation. Your options for sharing are:



Image link: Gives the viewer a hyperlink to the image page. Used for emails/social site conversations.

Direct link: Gives the viewer a link to the image itself — not its Imgur page. This option and ""Image link"" are the easiest for general-purpose use.


Markdown link: As indicated, used for including the image in Reddit comments.

HTML: Used for including the image on a website.

BBCode/Linked BBCode: Used for certain forums and message boards.

, If you want to share your image with your friends and family on social media and don't want to deal with the hassle of copying and pasting links, just click one of the icons on the right side of the page to link the image to the indicated social network site. A pop-up window will appear asking you to comment on your image and submit it. The social networks Imgur supports are:


Facebook
Twitter
Pinterest
Google+
Tumblr
Reddit
Stumbleupon

, If you find yourself using Imgur frequently, you may want to register an account by clicking the ""Sign Up"" button in the top right of the site. There are added benefits to creating an Imgur account, and, best of all, regular accounts are free.


Free account features include:



Options for commenting and rating images
Privacy controls
Photo album creation
Captions and titles
High-quality image upload options




Pro account ($23.95/yr) features include:



No ads
Analytics options
Extra image/thumbnail features





, While Flickr doesn't have the membership of Imgur or large social media sites, it has its own strengths. Flickr gives you a large amount of storage to upload your images to, and Images are not compressed or resized. Flickr also allows you to easily link to your images from your blog (though some advanced users report problems with the way Flickr handles professional photography.)Pros: No resizing or compression, ample sharing options, welcoming community of professional/amateur photographers, storage of high-quality videos of up to three minutes allowed, basic photo-editing tools included.Cons: Some minor features that are unappealing to professional photographers.Use for: Hosting photography work, high-quality images, some videos.

, Flickr offers 1 terabyte of free storage — more than anyone could realistically expect to use. This makes Flickr a good place to store all backups of your photos, even if you don't intend to share them. To upload an image, use the following steps:



Create an account. Flickr requires members to register before uploading images. Flickr uses your Yahoo account — if you don't already have one, click the ""Sign up"" button in the top left to get started.

Click the ""Upload"" button at the top of the screen. Drag and drop images into the window or click the ""Choose photos and videos"" button to browse your hard drive.

Select more photos as desired. You can also add a description and tags for each photo using the options on the left. When finished click the ""Upload"" button in the top right to start the upload.

, Like many social media sites, Flickr uses a system of tags to organize your images. These tags are key words describing your image that allow you to easily organize them and other users to easily find them.


To add tags, click the uploaded photo and scroll down to the options underneath it. Click ""Add tags,"" type in a word that describes your image, and hit enter. Repeat as needed.

, To share your image with your friends on a social network site, click the button that looks like an arrow pointing to the right in the corner of the image's page. In the pop-up menu, select the network you want to share on, then follow the on-screen prompts to finish. You may need to supply your login credentials for the site you choose. The networks supported by Flickr are:


Facebook
Twitter
Pinterest
Tumblr

, In addition to its online services, Flickr also offers an image-sharing app that is very similar to Instagram, but allows you to store your pictures at their original size and shape. This free app is available for both Apple and Android devices. Search for ""Flickr"" on iTunes or the Google Play Store to download and install the app.

, Like the sites above, Photobucket allows you to share and link to your stored images. However, Photobucket has several features that set it apart from the pack, including the ability to make albums, scrapbooks, slideshows, and more, making this site a good choice for those interested in creating unique photo experiences for their viewers.



Pros: Easy to use, lots of creative presentation features.

Cons: Free accounts have limited storage.

Use for: Slideshows, collages, albums, etc.

, Getting started on Photobucket is easy: you can either login using your Facebook account, or create a dedicated Photobucket account. A basic Photobucket account is free — just click the ""Sign Up"" button in the top right to begin the registration process and follow the on-screen prompts.

, You can upload images from your computer, import images from your Facebook page, and even upload images using the Photobucket app on your smartphone. You also have the option of emailing images to your Photobucket account using the email address you receive when you sign up — the images you send will be uploaded automatically.


See our guide to using Photobucket for more details on uploading images to Photobucket.

, One of the great features of Photobucket is that you can organize your images into albums for easier sorting. This lets you organize your images by theme and share specific groups of images easier. Use the steps below to create an album:



Click the ""Library"" option at the top of the screen. Select ""Create Album.""

Provide any pertinent details. In the pop-up window, you can give your album a name and add descriptors that work like tags in social media. Click ""Create"" when you're done.

Click ""Upload Images."" On the next screen, you'll see your album, currently empty. Click the upload button and add images as you normally would.

, As with the other image-hosting sites above, you can quickly share your images to various social networks on Photobucket. On the image's page, click the appropriate buttons along the top and, if necessary, provide your login credentials when prompted. The social networks supported by Photobucket are:


Facebook
Twitter
Google+
Tumblr
Pinterest

, If you use Photobucket frequently, you may want to take the time to download the free desktop program. This easy-to-use application allows you to easily back up large numbers of images at once without dealing with the online Photobucket site.The desktop client is available for both Windows and Mac operating systems.

, Shutterfly.com is somewhat unique among image-hosting sites in that it's designed to allow users to assemble and order custom scrapbooks, greeting cards, stationary, and so on. While the site isn't practical for general image-sharing needs, it's a high-quality service if you're looking to use your photos for gifts, crafts, and so on.Pros: Allows users to order professional photo products using their images.

Cons: Not a conventional image-hosting site — designed more as a commercial service.

Use for: Holiday cards, scrap books, etc.

, Like its name suggests, tinypic.com is all about minimalism. Its extremely stripped-down interface offers the basics and little else, but if you just want to get you images or videos online, it's harder to find a quicker, more direct route.



Pros: No-frills, no-nonsense design. Allows uploading of videos in addition to image files.

Cons: Little in the way of extra features/sharing options

Use for: Quick fixes.

Use Facebook for its social experience.",How to Upload Images to the Internet2," Instagram is one part Imgur, one part Facebook. The site, which allows users to upload photos from their mobile device's camera, is built around its community and is designed for sharing photos with other users. One of Instagram's most famous features is its easy-to-use filter system — users can simply take a picture and scroll through a list of pre-made visual filters to give their photo a unique, dramatic look.



Pros: Large, active community, simple, easy-to-use interface, designed with mobile users in mind.

Cons: Non-mobile options very lacking. Not good for sharing outside of social networking sites.

Use for: Sharing photos with your friends and family directly from your mobile device.

, Instagram is designed to be used through the Instagram app on your phone. This means that, before you use it, you will need to download the app, which is available for free on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. Once the app is installed, simply sign in with your Facebook account.


Note that you can also create an account via your browser, though this is less common.

, To upload pictures with Instagram, you have two options: you can use Instagram's camera function to take a picture directly in the app, or upload a picture from your phone's storage. See below:



To take a picture, tap the button in the center of the bottom of the screen to turn on the camera. Point and shoot like you normally would.

To use a saved picture, tap into the camera as above, but then tap the button in the bottom left that looks like a 3x3 grid of dots. Pick the photo you want to upload from the list.

, After you choose your picture, you can add filters and captions to give it a distinct style. Simply scroll through the list of filters to pick the one that you want, then tap the check mark. On the next page, add a description or hashtags (see below) as you see fit.


Note also that Instagram pictures sometimes need to be cropped so that they're a perfect square.

, Hashtags allow other Instagram users to find your images by searching for the tags associated with your image. Using high-traffic, interesting hashtags will help get your image viewed by more people. To give your image a hashtag, simply write the tag preceded by a hash sign in the description of the image. For example, on a picture of a pool party, you might include the hashtags #summer and #fun.


See our hashtagging article for more information.

, Once you're satisfied with your image, you can submit it to your Instagram account by clicking the the check mark in the top right. Alternatively, you can also share it with your friends on other social media sites. Simply click any of the ""Share"" buttons at the bottom of the screen to cross-post your Instagram submission to the indicated site. You may need to provide your log-in credentials to complete this process.


Note that the social sites listed at the bottom of your photo submission screen will vary depending on which sites you have associated with your phone.
See our Instagram guide for more detailed information on using Instagram.

, Tumblr is a hybrid photo-sharing/blogging platform with a moderate-sized but growing community. Tumblr allows users to post pictures, gifs, and even videos. However, many users use Tumblr as a place to blog about their lives or their passions, opting to use visuals only to support their written content (or not at all.) Thus, Tumblr is a great choice for people looking to tell their life's story with their images (and/or words.)



Pros: Offers combined blogging/photo-sharing platform. Customizable profile pages.

Cons: Not useful for traditional photo storing needs. User base can be somewhat confrontational.

Use for: Blogging/scrapbooking.

, Pinterest is unique among social networks in that its format is much more like a catalog than the typical ""feed"" structure used by Instagram, Facebook, etc. This unique format has certain advantages: Images uploaded to Pinterest can be ""repinned"" by other users, causing them to be shared with these users' page visitors, where they can be repinned again, and so on.



Pros: Easy to share and re-share content, higher-than-normal potential for viral spread of content.Cons: Non-conversational community, not a substitute for traditional image-hosting services.

Use for: Sharing photos of your interests, viral content, etc.

, Facebook is the most popular social network in the world by far, but there's a reason it appears last in this section. While there's no beating the breadth of Facebook's user base, its image-hosting tools are surprisingly lackluster compared to other options in this article. Facebook does allow you to upload photos, tag your contacts, and share them with your friends and family, but its options for managing albums and organizing photos are somewhat counter-intuitive and its interface pales in comparison to quick, easy solutions like Instagram. Thus, Facebook is good choice for people who are most interested in the social aspect of uploading images — not features or ease-of-use.



Pros: Largest community in the world, good social options.

Cons: Lacking in features compared to newer options.

Use for: Keeping your friends and family up-to-speed on your life.

Send your email to yourself.",How to Upload Images to the Internet3," Dropbox is a cloud service that's more geared towards accessible, long-term online storage than traditional photo-hosting needs, but you can still easily share your stored images with others. Dropbox allows you to easily store your images online and access them anywhere, but is not suitable for some common features of other services, like embedding images in blogs and websites.



Pros: Convenient, accessible file backup capabilities. Easy-to-use desktop client.

Cons: Requires desktop client download. Free Dropbox accounts come with 2 GB of storage, which may not be enough for some users.

Use for: Long-term backups.
Note that Dropbox requires you to register an account. This is easy — just visit dropbox.com and click the prominent ""Sign Up"" button to get started.See our guide to getting started with Dropbox for more details on creating a Dropbox account.

, There are three options for uploading files to Dropbox: you can upload images through the Dropbox web interface, through the Dropbox app on your smartphone, or through the Dropbox desktop program.



Adding Files Online: This is the quickest, easiest option. Simply sign into your account and click the upload button at the top of the page (it looks like a white page with a plus sign on it) to get started. Follow the prompts and browse your computer's hard drive to find the file you want to add — it will upload automatically.
See our Dropbox guide for more details on the other methods for uploading files.

, The process of sharing images on Dropbox is a little different than the way you would do it on a standard photo site. With dropbox, you will need to specifically indicate the people that you want to share with. The upside of this is that only people you approve will have access to your files. See below:Select ""Photos"" from the sidebar.

Select the photos you want to share. You can also select albums to share.
Click the ""Share files"" button.

Enter the email addresses of the people you want to share with. Alternatively, you may click the ""Get Link"" button to receive a link that you can give to others.
Note that your images' viewers do not need a Dropbox account

, Like Dropbox, Google Drive is geared more towards personal storage and document collaboration than it is on image hosting, but you can still use it to share images that you've uploaded with others. Free Google Drive accounts come with 15 GB of storage, with more available for purchase. Like Dropbox, you can share your images on Google Drive, but the service is not suitable for embedding images in blogs and websites.



Pros: More storage than Dropbox; also allows online word/spreadsheet/slideshow editing.

Cons: Lacks features of image-hosting sites.

Use for: Long-term storage, file backup.
You'll need a Google account to use Google Drive. See our guide to signing up for a Google account for more information.

, There are multiple ways to upload images to Google Drive. You can use the Google Drive main web interface, the mobile app, or the Google Drive desktop program.


Of these options, the web interface is generally the most convenient. Log into your account at drive.google.com and click the orange button with the upward-pointing arrow next to the ""Create"" button. Browse through your computer's hard drive and select the image you want to upload.
See our Google Driveguide for more details on the other methods uploading files to Google Drive.

, Sharing images with Google Drive is similar to sharing with Dropbox. You can either share directly with specific Drive users, or you can share the link to your file with whomever you'd like. See below:


Right-click on the image you want to share.
Select ""Share...""

Ensure that ""Anyone who has the link can view"" is present.


Copy the link in the field and distribute it to anyone. You can also use the included sharing tools to quickly share to Google+, Facebook, Gmail, and Twitter.
Alternatively, you can enter email addresses into the bottom field and invitations to view the file will be sent out.

, If you have an email account, you have a free (but somewhat old-fashioned) method of storing images online. Simply attaching your images to an email and sending it to yourself is one way to ""upload"" them to the internet in a sense — once they're in your inbox, they're easy to access from almost anywhere. However, since email interfaces aren't technically made for this purpose, doing this can feel a little more ""clunky"" than with the options above. In addition, this option lacks the features of both the social media and traditional image hosting options mentioned above.



Pros: Convenient. Online email accounts are near-ubiquitous.

Cons: Interface of most email programs not designed specifically for this task. Storage available varies from service to service.

Use for: Situations when you need to quickly store images online and don't have access to another option.

, To get started, simply create a blank email. Depending on the email program you're using, this is usually done by clicking a button that says ""Compose New Message"" or something similar.


You don't have to put anything in the body of this email unless you want to send yourself a memo for later.

, Next, attach your image files to the blank email. Usually, the button for this will have a paperclip on it, though this can vary from service to service. Browse your hard drive and select the file you want to attach.


The maximum attachment size per email can also vary from service to service. For instance, with Gmail, the max attachment size is 25 Megabytes, while Outlook has a max size of 10 MB with the option to send larger files via Microsoft's cloud service., Next, just put your own email address into the ""To:"" field and click ""Send."" Within a few minutes, your email should be in your inbox with your files attached — now, you can access them from anywhere you can log into your account.


If you don't see your email, check your spam filter. There is a chance that it was incorrectly categorized as junk mail.

Start by entering any term into Google image search, then clicking SafeSearch → uncheck Filter Explicit Results. This will not fully remove SafeSearch, but it will make finding explicit results possible with the step below.


Check out the next step if you can't find the option or if the option is greyed out.;
, If you can't change your SafeSearch settings, they are probably locked by the owner of the Google account. Bypass this using any one of the following methods, then turn SafeSearch to the lowest setting as described above:



Turn on your browser's private mode. This might not turn off SafeSearch in all browsers, but it usually works. This will allow you to bypass SafeSearch if it has been locked by someone's Google account, but will not work if SafeSearch is enabled on the router.Open a new browser, or download a new, trustworthy, free browser such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

Create a new google account, or sign out and log into your own existing account.

, Explicit results will show up only if you make your search extremely clear. For example, if you are trying to find nude images, add the word ""nude,"" ""sex,"" or ""porn"" to the end of your search. The results you see should change dramatically.

, If you enter a search term that you think is clearly explicit, but you only get ""safe"" results, you can report the experience to Google. If they receive enough similar feedback on that search term, it may be changed to an ""explicit"" one that will automatically return explicit results without the need for additional terms.


You can use the same form to report the reverse: non-explicit searches that returned explicit results.

, Google SafeSearch isn’t tied to any web browser as it’s linked to your Google account.

, Visit Google’s search page and make a search. On the results page, if you see a picture of colored balloons on the top right corner, SafeSearch is enabled.

, You will be brought to the Search Settings page.

, Look for the “SafeSearch filters” section. The option for “Filter explicit results” should be checked and grayed out, meaning not editable. Click the “Unlock SafeSearch” link beside it, and you will be asked to sign into your Google account. If you’re already in, you will be asked to re-enter your password. This is for added security for SafeSearch so anyone can’t just turn it off.

, You will be brought to another page to confirm unlocking SafeSearch. Click the “Unlock SafeSearch” button, and Google will release the SafeSearch lock across all Google domains for your account.

, Go to Google’s search page, and the picture of colored balloons should be gone. You can now use Google Search and all its other domains freely.

To search for explicit terms on IxQuick, click Settings in the top right, then scroll down and click the circle next to ""Do not filter my results.""

There are several that work directly from the browser and only require a Java applet to run; they don’t need to be installed. These sites will convert the video to the format of your choice.;
, In order to play the video on iOS, you will need to download the video in the .mp4 format. The other formats available will not work. For Android OS, most of the available video types will work, though some may require a video player app to be installed.

, Since you will be viewing on a small screen, you most likely do not need to download the highest quality files. Quality is denoted by a number with a “p” next to it (240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, etc.). The higher the number, the better the quality. Strike a balance between quality and size, especially if space is an issue on the phone.

Determine the nature of your podcast.,
Choose the products you'll use to Podcast.,
Pick your software.",How to Start Your Own Podcast1," What will the content be? Write it down so you don't forget. Come up with an outline or some sort of organizer to keep track of what you will discuss and/or promote.


There are countless examples among the podcasts already in existence. Podcast.com lists podcasts by categories, which include comedy, news, health, sports, music and politics. Some examples include Mugglecast, which covers ""Harry Potter"" novels and films; The Word Nerds, who discuss the etymologies of words and other linguistic matters; Fantasy Football Minute, a podcast to help all fantasy football coaches and general managers; and NPR Science Friday, a podcast version of the weekly show broadcast on local public radio affiliates, just to get your mind rolling.Listen to some of the more popular podcasts to get a feel for style and content. Draft up an outline to keep the awkward pauses at a minimum. If you're going to be doing interviews with your pets, this will be something you probably want scripted.;
, Most podcasts include a microphone (USB or analog), mixer (for analog mic) or even a new computer. There are different podcast starter packages out there you can buy for around $100.


Don't rely on the standard (and iffy at best) microphone your PC came with if you want to sound as professional as possible. You'll want a full headset with a noise-canceling mic to be positive your listeners aren't getting distracted by the sound of your air conditioner in the corner.For affordable voice recording, a unidirectional, dynamic-type microphone is good. Radioshack sells inexpensive ones and you’ll also find a good selection of higher quality mikes at most music stores.Is your podcast going to be portable or will you record at home? Maybe you want to podcast using your smartphone or tablet (Android, iOS). But the basics you'll need are a microphone and voice recording podcast software. You'll only need a mixer if you have multiple inputs. Smaller units with around four inputs will suit all but the most ambitious podcasts.

, If you have a Mac, you can record using Garageband (it comes free with every Mac as part of the iLife suite). There are free software packages (like Audacity) and expensive software (Adobe Audition). There are also tiered versions of software, like Sony Acid (music studio is only $50 whereas Acid Pro is $200). Some mixers and microphones come with free software to use.


Industrial Audio Software's aptly named iPodcast Producer is super podcast friendly. It takes care of the whole process from recording to uploading the finished product via a built-in FTP client. However, it's just about the opposite of free.Audacity (is free!) has an easy learning curve and there are Windows, Mac, and Linux versions available. It has a number of useful features and plug-ins.If this is more than you bargained for, Sound Recorder (on Windows) does everything you need it to do, but only saves files in .wav format; you will still have to convert your final recording into an .mp3 file. MusicMatch Jukebox can also do this for you.


If you go with Adobe Audition, you can get a monthly subscription through the Adobe Cloud that offers the entire Adobe site (with lower costs for students). Additionally, Lynda.com has an excellent video tutorial (about 5 hours or so worth) on everything Adobe (and lots of other technologies, too) that you can access with a month to month subscription that you can terminate at anytime.

Prepare your content.,
Record the audio for your podcast.,
Save the audio file to your computer desktop.,
Tag it, give it ID information (artist, album, etc.),
Create your RSS podcast feed.",How to Start Your Own Podcast2," You may want to put together scripts for what you will say at the beginning of a show and when you transition from one story to another. Put your content in order so you can read down the list.


Whatever it is, make sure you enjoy it. You probably won't become rich from this endeavor. Spend your time discussing or promoting something you really care about; the reward will be in feeding your knowledge/humor/music to others.

, This is probably the biggest step for without your voice, your podcast doesn't exist. Talk in a consistent pace and show passion in your subjects. Read the scripts and don't forget to thank people for being part of the show.


You can have the perfect podcast delivered, but sometimes technical glitches run the show, ruining all your hard work. Before you begin the actual recording session, take a few samples to test the software, mess with the volume controls, and just plain make sure everything is functioning., Make sure it's in MP3 format; a bit rate of 128 kbps is probably sufficient for a talk-show podcast, but podcasts featuring music will want bit rates of 192 kbps or better.Do not use special characters (such as # or % or ?) in the file name. Open it up into your sound editor and edit out extra background noise or long periods of silence. Put in intro/outro music if you'd like.
Of course, you can always save it as a WAV file first, to give you a master backup to work from if something were to go wrong.

, and give it album art. Either make it yourself, find some free, non-copyrighted images online, or have a friend make one for you.


Be careful to name the audio file so that the name of the podcast and the date of the episode are clear. You may also want to edit the ID3 tags of the MP3 file to help people find and catalogue your podcasts.

, The feed must meet all industry standards for a valid 2.0 feed with enclosures. Try using a complete solution and service such as Libsyn, Cast mate or Podomatic (see the external links below). For longer podcasts, you'll be paying a small fee.


The easiest way to do it is to use a blog. So hop on over to Blogger.com, Wordpress.com, or another blogging service, and start a blog with the title of your podcast. Don't make any posts just yet.

If your host has limits on the amount of bandwidth you can use, you could incur overage charges if your podcast becomes very popular (fingers crossed!).


A feed acts like a ""container"" for the MP3 file that tells feed aggregator programs where to get new episodes. It can be done manually with some XML coding. It's similar to HTML. You can copy another RSS file and use the template to make your necessary modifications.

Give it a second.",How to Start Your Own Podcast3," Go to Feedburner and type in the URL of your blog and click ""I am a podcaster!"" In the next screen, configure the elements for your podcast. These are the elements that directly relate to the podcast. Your feedburner feed is your podcast.


Go to one of the hosts you can find online and sign-up there (this may take a while). Then go to your files, and upload your MP3 file.
Make a post on your blog/website -- the title of the post should be the title of that episode of the podcast, and the content will end up as the ""Show notes"" or the ""Description."" Put in a little about what you talk about in your episode. At the end of the post, put a link directly to your media file.

, In a few minutes, Feedburner should add this to your feed, and now you have an episode! You can submit it to iTunes or a number of other podcast directories to get it known. You may want to wait, however, until you have some experience, so that your podcast will be compared as a fifth episode to another's first.


Submitting a podcast to iTunes is fairly simple. The podcast page in the iTunes store has a large button that asks for the RSS link and some additional information about the podcast. A podcast can also be submitted via the Web through the link in the iTunes FAQ.Ping the appropriate podcast directories when a new show is updated.
Put the appropriate subscription buttons on your website so people can subscribe to the RSS podcast feed.

Sell the podcast.,
Sell advertising.,
Get into web advertising.",How to Start Your Own Podcast4," You can set up a Web store to charge subscribers for each episode. However, a pay-per-listen podcast is competing with thousands of free podcasts. The content would have to be very compelling to convince very many people to shell out cash, so very few podcasts profit with this method.In case you were thinking it, podcasts cannot be sold in the iTunes store.

, If you insert a commercial into your podcast, listeners can easily skip over the ad when playing back the show on their computers or MP3 players. One option is to get sponsorship for the podcast, or even separate segments of the podcast. You may need to change the title of your podcast to allow the sponsor their due.


Be sure you're not bombarding the listener with commercial after commercial. If your podcast is relatively short, a listener isn't going to want to hear three commercials in that small time frame. Especially at the beginning.

, This requires extra effort, because once someone subscribes to a podcast, it is downloaded directly into their RSS reader. They might never see the website again. The key is to tie the podcast into a blog or website and mention it frequently during the show. This will drive click traffic to the site and hopefully create some advertising revenue.Think about banner and sidebar ads. The latter has a bit more impact because it's longer and you can't scroll away from it. As a result, it has a higher click-through rate."

Visits: Simply when someone comes to your site. Each page they go to will register as a visit.

Unique Visitors: A unique IP address that visits the sites. For example, if you go to the same site 10 times in one day, you will get 10 visits but only 1 unique visit.

Time on Site per Page: The amount of time visitors spend on a site or a particular page, regardless of whether or not they do anything. You want this to be high.

Bounce Rate: The percentage of visitors who leave after only reading one page. The lower you can get this, the better.

Exit Rate: The percentage of visits who leave when they are ""done."" This is only for sites that lead you through a bunch of pages on one theme, like a multiple page article. If they leave after the 3rd page of a 3 page article, they count in your exit rate.;
, This will tell you the Alexa traffic rank, traffic rank in the US, and the number of sites linking in. Write down all of these numbers and check back weekly to see how the numbers have changed. Press the ""Get Details"" button for more detailed information.


Alexa helps you determine which parts of the site get the most views and figure out where your traffic is coming from.
Similar to Alexa, there is a program called SearchStatus that can easily track a website's whereabouts. Just install the program and it should begin to process immediately. QuarkBase also works well, but Alexa is the industry standard.

, This will give you a very detailed dashboard of who is coming to your site, where they are coming from, how much time they are spending on the site, etc.

, There are many available for free download if you search ""website hit counter."" This will show on your site how many time a particular page has been viewed. You may have to copy and paste the code into your site's HTML code, but this is usually given in step-by-step instructions.


Many website design sites, like Weebly, SquareSpace, and WordPress have built in ""apps"" in the page customization screen that let you install hit counters.

, Tag managers track which articles get the most traction, but only if you tag them. Most blogging and website design sites allow you to add tags, which are relevant words connected to your post. This article, for example, might have the tags, how-to, web traffic, analytics, wiki, etc. A tag manager lets you see what topics get the most traffic.

It attaches right to browser as an add-on (found on Firefox or Chrome with a simple internet search) and sends you updates without having to go to each site individually., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Google + and more are great ways to get content delivered to you when and how you want it. Think of your social media accounts as a newspaper, but you get to chose which reporters, or websites, want to send you content.

, Sites like Alexa can give you basic information, like time on site or bounce rate, for any site in the world just by typing in the URL. Use these sites to get detailed information on sites you love or consider working with.

, Google, Yahoo, and other sites prioritize sights that have credible content and reliable viewers. So, to see how websites you like are doing, search for similar topics in search engines and see where the sites appear.

For instance, you might use the information to help figure out when to send a newsletter: the time of day, day of week, or day of month.
You might use the information to better time your social media posts for maximum impact. For instance, do you want to post to Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest in the morning, during the day, or in the evening? The reason it's important to understand the situation for your own website better is that there is no robust global heuristic. For instance, a blog post by CoSchedule considers sixteen different sources of advice on the best times of post, each suggesting different strategies and some of them even contradicting each other.You might use the information to buy advertisements, as well as boost existing social media posts, to show at the appropriate times: the time of day, day of week, or day of month.;
,

For instance, if your site sees a lot more traffic during the academic year than the summer, that is an indication that it is primarily used by students in connection with their coursework or academic life. This might be interesting information to you. It might be a relationship that you did not expect but that makes more retrospective sense. For instance, content on how to improve memory might be something you'd expect year-round traffic to, but you might discover that its main target audience is students during the academic year.
Similarly, if your site sees a lot more traffic near the end of the calendar quarters, that shows some relation to businesses or sales teams reaching quarterly goals. This might be interesting information that you did not expect but that makes retrospective sense. For instance, a website on how to motivate yourself to reach your goals might see this sort of spike.

,

Creating and maintaining a website that attracts enough users to see clear patterns is an impressive accomplishment. You can use the trends you see to confirm that you have had an impact and are meeting real human needs.
Looking at these patterns can also help you satisfy your curiosity about your visitors, many of whom you may never meet.

,

You will generally study traffic by making graphs of metrics (such as sessions, pageviews, and users). The time range defines the starting and ending point in time for the period for which you are plotting the graph. This may also be called a date range. In GA, the Date Range can be selected on the top right.
You can also control the granularity of the display. Granularity is the length of the time interval covered by each individual data point. A daily granularity means that you will see one data point for each day, representing the overall value for the day. A weekly granularity means that you will see one data point per week, representing the overall value for the week. Smaller granularities are called finer and larger granularities are called coarser. In GA, you can choose granularity within the chart area itself, with options ""Hourly"", ""Day"", ""Week"", and ""Month"". The ""Hourly"" option may not be available in all parts of GA.

,

A longer time range allows you to see trends and cycles over a longer period of time, whereas a shorter time range allows you to zoom in on a specific time period more clearly (and gives you more screen space for finer granularity).
A finer granularity allows you to see trends and cycles at smaller scales. For instance, if you want to understand how traffic varies within a day, you have to plot at a granularity finer than a day.
A coarser granularity allows you to see trends and cycles at a larger scale while reducing the effect of noise as well as smaller cycles. For instance, plotting at a weekly granularity helps you get rid of weekly cycles and focus on how traffic is changing between weeks.
A general rule for plotting to be able to capture cycles: plot at a granularity that gets rid of smaller cycles than the one you are trying to discover. Also, plot over a time range that covers at least three periods for which you are trying to determine a cycle. For instance, if you want to understand the annual cycle, plot at a weekly granularity (to get rid of the weekly cycle) and plot over at least three years. Similarly, to understand weekly cycles, plot at a daily granularity (to get rid of the daily cycle) over at least three weeks.

,

Random fluctuation as a proportion of total traffic goes down as total traffic goes up.
Therefore, the more traffic you have, the finer the granularity at which you can do analysis. An approximate rule-of-thumb: you should not go to a finer granularity than one where you have 100 pageviews (or about 50 visits). This leads to the following approximate thresholds of minimum traffic you need for various granularities. Note that these are just approximate guidelines; your website might have much more stable traffic, allowing you to use finer granularities even at lower traffic levels.

Hourly granularity: At 1,000 or more daily pageviews (or about 30,000 monthly pageviews), this becomes reasonably robust during peak traffic hours. At 4,000 or more daily pageviews (or about 120,000 monthly pageviews), this becomes reasonably robust at all hours. Note that since weekday and weekend traffic can differ, hourly granularity may be fine on some days of the week but noisy on others.
Daily granularity: At 100 or more daily pageviews (or about 3,000 monthly pageviews), this is reasonably robust.
Weekly granularity: At 15 or more daily pageviews (or about 450 monthly pageviews), this is reasonably robust.
Monthly granularity: At over 100 monthly pageviews, this is reasonably robust.


If traffic to your website is heavily influenced by viral news events (in the world) or the virality of specific posts you make to it, then analysis at short timescales may be hard. In other words, the rule of thumb above might break down. A site driven by viral news events or viral social media posts can have fairly unstable day-to-day and hour-to-hour traffic patterns despite having a fairly high level of traffic.

, This becomes particularly relevant if your traffic spans multiple timezones.

The main problem is as follows. Analytics providers are reporting traffic from across a bunch of timezones. In principle, there are two ways of doing this: use a single fixed timezone, or use local time. Most analytics tools, including GA, use the single fixed timezone approach.

The single fixed timezone approach: When reporting traffic for the calendar day June 1, report total worldwide traffic during that calendar day in the specific timezone. Therefore, this counts traffic over a contiguous 24-hour period only.
The local time approach: When reporting traffic for the calendar day June 1, sum up, across timezones, the total traffic during the calendar day June 1 using local time in that timezone. Therefore, this counts traffic over what is potentially a 48-hour period, though in any given region it counts traffic only over a 24-hour period.


GA displays all results in a single fixed timezone. The timezone is part of the settings for your Google Analytics property. This can be changed one-time but cannot simply be changed as part of the display setting. You can find and change the timezone used in your View Settings. Time zone changes are applied only going forward and not retroactively.The timezone Quantcast uses for QM is Central Time (as observed in Mexico City). This timezone is chosen to best approximate the local times of the majority of end users of websites that use QM.
Google Trends also uses a single fixed timezone, albeit one that varies with the observer. It always displays data in the local time of the person using the service. For instance, if you are in California but you filter Google Trends to show data for New York, it will still show results using California's local time (Pacific Time). Therefore, you will need to explicitly adjust for the timezone difference when interpreting Google Trends data.
Traffic statistics for Wikipedia pages are all reported in a single fixed timezone, namely the UTC timezone.
Reddit reports traffic statistics using a single fixed timezone, namely the UTC timezone.
The single fixed timezone approach makes some types of analysis easier. In particular, understanding the traffic effects of specific news events or social media posts is easier with this approach. On the other hand, understanding the daily cycle and people's consumption habits becomes trickier. A few key points:

The single fixed timezone is most challenging when trying to understand the daily cycle. It can also complicate the analysis of the weekly cycle. It is generally not an issue for understanding annual cycles.
One way of getting around the problem is to filter to specific geographic locations. However, traffic level in individual regions might be too low for meaningful analysis. This is particularly the case for traffic at hourly granularity, which is where filtering by region is needed most.



, Some examples of ambiguous traffic changes are below.

It can be hard to know how much of an increase in traffic from December to January is a result of a long-run growth trend and how much is recovery from a Christmas dip.
Similarly, for a site that's growing a lot every day, it is hard to know how much of an increase from Sunday to Monday is a result of a weekday-weekend differential and how much is due to the overall growth trend.

,

Filtering by loyalty (e.g., new versus returning visitors, or people who have viewed at least a certain number of pages) can help you determine if traffic patterns are driven by your regular users or by ""drive-by traffic"". In general, drive-by traffic tends to account for a larger share of variation.
If your hypothesis about the reasons for variation in traffic center around traffic of a particular type, then filter for that kind of traffic. Note that the traffic segments responsible for most of the variation may be different from the traffic segments responsible for most of the traffic. For instance, a website that gets a lot of traffic from both students and professionals might see an annual traffic cycle primarily due to the academic year of students, although the majority of its users are professionals. An example (discussed later) is programming Q&A website Stack Overflow.In cases where you cannot directly filter for the attributes you care about, use proxies. For instance, to verify that the variation in your traffic is driven by the academic year, filter to large university towns as your locations. You can filter for different kinds of university towns to better understand the underlying sources of variation.

,
Unique pageviews: This measures the number of times a visitor first visits a page. In particular, refreshes or revisits of the same page are not counted.
Sessions (also known as visits): This measures the number of times people visit a site. Every visitor must have at least one visit. The way an analytics tool separates sessions/visits for a single visitor from each other can vary based on the analytics tool. GA resets a session after 30 minutes of inactivity.Users (also known as visitors): This measures the number of distinct people who visited your website, as best as can be judged by the analytics service. Note that there is some ambiguity regarding the granularity at which users are deduplicated. For instance, if a user visits twice with a year of separation between the visits, is that user counted as a single user? Therefore, when reporting users, a granularity within which users are deduplicated is specified. For instance, if users are reported in terms of daily uniques (DU), then a user who visits multiple times in the same day is counted as a single user, but visits across days get added up. Similarly, weekly uniques (WU) and monthly uniques (MU) are also used. It's important to remember that weekly uniques would be less than the sum of daily uniques through the week.
Since calculating uniques across an arbitrary period is a computationally intensive process, the general practice with reporting uniques is to do so only for fixed time periods (such as daily, weekly, and monthly). For instance, QM reports uniques only for 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day periods.An analytics service may be unable to identify the same user across browsers or devices, or if the user clears cookies. For this reason, unique user counts as estimated by analytics services are generally overestimates.,

Pageviews/user (also known as pages per visitor) and pageviews/session (also known as pages per visit) are the two common metrics. These numbers can range from 1 to about 20, with most websites seeing pageviews/session numbers between 1 and 4 and pageviews/user numbers between 1 and 8. As a general rule, higher values of pageviews/user or pageviews/session are considered ""better"" but there are many exceptions. For instance, for a transaction-based site, getting things done more quickly might mean a better user experience, so smaller values of pageviews/session might be better. Similarly, for a site that a user should ideally use once and then not need again, smaller values of sessions/user or pageviews/user may be better.
New versus returning users is also used. Note that it is not completely obvious whether a higher percentage of users who are new is a good or a bad thing. Rather, looking at the absolute numbers and trends for both is more helpful than simply looking at the percentage.

,

Pageviews, sessions, and users should generally go up and down in tandem. In other words, days when there are more pageviews will also have more sessions and users.
However, the metrics will not necessarily change proportionally. In other words, the pageviews/session and sessions/user metrics could fluctuate over time. In many cases, days with higher traffic see lower values of pageviews/session and sessions/user, because the extra traffic is more shallow and less loyal. In particular, for sites that have lower traffic on weekends than weekdays, pageviews/session is usually higher on weekends than weekdays. However, there are exceptions: in case of a viral and rapidly developing news event, pageviews/user can go up (as people keep poking around the site to find new coverage of the developing event). Also, on big holidays (as opposed to simply weekends), pageviews/session might go down along with overall pageviews if very little new content is being released.

,

If you are selling stuff directly on your site, then sales you make through the site (purchases and subscriptions) are your conversion events. This is typically the case for Business-to-Consumer (B2C) websites which include e-commerce as well as online subscription services. It may also apply to low-end Business-to-Business (B2B) product websites.
For more high-end product websites, including expensive B2B products as well as in-person services (like counseling services), the final sale does not usually occur on the website, but the website is used as a starting point for showcasing and explaining the product. In this case, ""conversion"" on the website is usually defined in terms of initiating contact through a contact form or call now button.
Keep in mind that trends for conversion can differ from trends for pageviews. In cases where there is a weekly or annual cycle, sessions and pageviews start rising before conversions start rising.

, The timezone aggregation problem was discussed in Part 2, Step 4.


Before proceeding, please make sure to check the timezone GA uses for your website, so that you can correctly interpret all the remaining steps!GA uses a single fixed timezone, rather than the local time of regions. This can cause effects to appear to spread out over more days. The problem is bigger the more worldwide your traffic is.
For instance, let us say your website's traffic dips in each region during the weekend in that region, and that GA uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Then, in your GA, you will start seeing a dip on Friday afternoon UTC (because that's already the weekend in far-east timezones like Australia and New Zealand). Moreover, the dip will appear to continue till the middle of Monday UTC, because it's still the weekend in far-west timezones (such as California's timezone, Pacific Time).
Filtering your traffic based on region (and then making the timezone adjustment between GA's timezone and the region's local time) can be one way to get around the timezone aggregation problem. Plotting at an hourly granularity may also help with understanding the subtleties of the day boundaries more clearly.

,
The general heuristic is that daily weekend traffic is somewhere between 50% and 80% of daily weekday traffic.
The heuristic is strong for work-based sites that get much of their traffic from direct and search interest. For websites related to home maintenance (such as cooking and gardening) the pattern is usually reversed. For websites that cater to community hobbies (such as forums, link aggregation sites, subreddits) or websites that get traffic primarily from social media, the difference between weekdays and weekends is generally smaller in magnitude, and there may even be no clear pattern. More details based on the type of website are discussed Step 6 onward.
A survey conducted of people while they were reading the English Wikipedia and some other language Wikipedias sheds light on how people's motivation changes through the week. During weekdays, people are more likely to use Wikipedia for work and school. On weekends they are more likely to use Wikipedia to learn more about topics they encountered in the media. On Fridays and Saturdays, they are more likely to go to Wikipedia to look up information pertinent to an in-person conversation.Desktop traffic generally goes down on weekends whereas mobile traffic (both mobile web and apps) goes up.An example illustrating all these phenomena is the traffic to the English Wikipedia, shown in the image above.Data is at a daily granularity, time is recorded in UTC, and total traffic, desktop web traffic, mobile web traffic, and mobile app traffic are all shown. You can see that total traffic is lowest on Saturday and Sunday UTC. You can also see that desktop traffic declines a lot during the weekend, whereas mobile web traffic actually increases, and in fact becomes equal to or even slightly more than desktop traffic for part of the weekend. You can also read an analysis of the weekly cycle and other trends in use for different language Wikipedias from published research on the subject.,

Most of our data is based on sites that get a significant share of traffic from the United States. Moreover, many of our conclusions are based on US traffic, for which clearest information is available. We therefore rely on known facts about the definitions of weekday and weekend by country in different countries.Many countries follow a similar weekday-weekend pattern as the United States: Monday to Friday are workdays and Saturday and Sunday are holidays. In particular, Anglophone countries and European countries, as well as China, most East Asian countries and most African countries, follow the same weekday-weekend pattern. India as well as some South American countries have some places open Monday to Friday and some places open Monday to Saturday, though the trend is toward a 5-day week.
In Israel as well as many countries where Muslims form a significant share of the population, the week is from Sunday to Thursday and the weekend is Friday and Saturday. Moreover, in Israel, Saturday (the Sabbath day) is likely to see much lower web usage, whereas in high Muslim population countries, Friday, the day of prayer, is likely to see lower traffic except for websites that directly cater to related needs.
The main source of easily available public data you can use is language Wikipedia traffic by day. For instance, to verify the hypothesis for Israel, you can load up Wikimedia analytics data on the Hebrew Wikipedia. You will see that instead of the English Wikipedia, that gets its lowest traffic on Saturday and rebounds a bit on Sunday, the Hebrew Wikipedia gets its lowest traffic on Friday and rebounds a bit on Saturday, consistent with the weekend being earlier. Also keep in mind the timezone difference: Israel is ahead of UTC, so that what is classified as Saturday in UTC actually includes early hours of Sunday as well. In particular, it includes a significant time period after the end of the Sabbath, explaining the rebound.,


Go to the Google Trends main page, enter a search term in the domain you are interested in, and then select a time range of 30 days. This will display data at a daily granularity and cover a little over 4 weeks. This should be enough to get a sense of the weekly pattern.
To get a finer sense of the weekday/weekend differences, you may wish to just plot for the past 7 days. If you do that, data will be displayed at an hourly granularity.
You may wish to filter by location to get around the timezone aggregation problem.
Keep in mind: Google Trends displays times using your local timezone, even if you filter to a different location. You will need to adjust the time yourself. For more discussion, see Part 2, Step 4.

,,


More explicitly, the traffic pattern is as follows: reasonably steady traffic from Monday to Thursday (with traffic possibly a little lower on Monday due to the effect of timezone aggregation), then a slight drop on Friday, and a significantly lower level (between 40% and 70% of weekday traffic) on Saturday and Sunday. The data you see in GA may show the weekend spread out more, covering Friday and Monday, due to the timezone aggregation problem discussed in Step 1.
One of the clearest examples is Trello, a website that helps people organize lists graphically. Although not restricted to work, it is used much more heavily at work.Examples of heavily work-driven websites are listed. Keep in mind: you don't need to understand the subject matter of these sites to get the illustrative benefit of these examples! Examples are: programming question-and-answer website Stack Overflow, Security Stack Exchange,ServerFault,Engineering Stack Exchange,SuperUser,Ask Ubuntu,Game Developer Stack Exchange,Network Engineering Stack Exchange,Programmers Stack Exchange,Database Administrators Stack Exchange,the Graphic Design Stack Exchange,the Webmasters Stack Exchange,and the Personal Finance & Money Stack Exchange.You can also see the weekly cycle (lower traffic on Saturday and Sunday) by checking out Google Trends for specific keywords that are related to work queries. Keep in mind: you don't need to understand the meanings of the terms to see how they illustrate the weekly cycle! Examples are ""jquery"" (related to Javascript, used in web programming, part of software engineering),""constructor"" (a concept used in object-oriented programming, also part of software engineering),and ""dhcp"" (a term related to network engineering, in the context of Internet connection protocols).The use of specific keywords can help you better understand traffic patterns in your particular work domain.






You can also verify these cycles using Wikipedia pageviews. In particular, the reasonably consistent trends among weekdays and the much lower levels on weekends are easy to see. Since the UTC timezone is used, Monday traffic is pulled down a bit due to the timezone aggregation problem. In general, Wikipedia views are more robust than Google Trends, particularly for the long tail, because no confusing normalizations are performed. Examples from the English Wikipedia: JQuery,""Constructor (object-oriented programming)""and ""Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"".Some websites release more fine-grained activity data that you can process to verify weekly patterns. For instance, question-and-answer website Stack Overflow's data dump has been used to identify weekly patterns in the number of questions asked on the website.The weekly cycle in number of questions asked closely mirrors the weekly traffic cycle.To understand the effect of the work-relatedness of a website on its weekly cycle (controlling for topic), it is illustrative to compare traffic for Stack Exchange sites on a topic against Reddit desktop traffic statistics on the corresponding subreddit. (Note: Subreddit traffic statistics are always available to moderators, and for some time Reddit allowed moderators to make these statistics available for the public to see. The examples used below were captured while these stats were public. From May 15, 2017 onward, Reddit disabled public access to traffic pages). Subreddits display a similar qualitative pattern: traffic goes down a bit on Friday, and is lower on weekends, and Monday traffic is a bit lower due to timezone aggregation. Howveer, weekend daily traffic to subreddits is between 80% and 90% of daily weekday traffic, compared to the 40% to 70% we see for Stack Exchange sites. For instance, compare the Unix Stack Exchangeagainst the linux subredditor the unixporn subreddit.Similarly, compare the Vi and Vim Stack Exchangeagainst the Neovim subreddit.,


More explicitly: traffic is fairly consistent from Monday to Thursday, lower on Friday, lowest on Saturday, and then higher on Sunday. Sunday and Friday traffic levels are usually comparable. This is explained by the fact that many students celebrate the weekend starting Friday afternoon/evening, but resume academic work on Sunday in order to meet homework deadlines. In particular, the rebound of traffic starting Sunday is a key indicator that the site is used more by students than by people at work. Note that the data you see in GA may see the weekend effect spread out more, due to timezone aggregation, as discussed in Step 1.
The English Wikipedia's traffic pattern broadly matches the academic website pattern, although the gap between weekdays and weekends is on the lower side.A website where the pattern shows up in fairly extreme fashion is Quizlet, a website that provides study and test prep tools (flashcards, games, etc.).The reason this is an extreme example is that Quizlet is used almost exclusively in the context of academic needs, whereas many of the other example websites cater to a mix of academic needs and hobby and work needs.






Some examples of academic websites with this pattern are the Math Stack Exchange,Physics Stack Exchange,Chemistry Stack Exchange,Biology Stack Exchange,Economics Stack Exchange,GoodReads,algebra.com,purplemath.com, the Calculus Subwiki,Market Subwiki,and EasyBib.Websites aimed at a more advanced audience (such as graduate students and people with doctoral degrees of equivalent) generally see a less sharp Sunday rebound, because these audiences do not experience the homework deadline effect on Sundays. Examples include MathOverflow (a math Q&A site for students at the graduate student level and professional mathematicians)and the TeX/LaTeX Stack Exchange.Here are some websites that deal with academic content but do not themselves cover academic subject matter. An example of a site where there is a Sunday rebound, but Sunday traffic is still clearly less than Friday traffic, is Student Doctor.College Confidential, a website with advice and discussion on getting into college and doing well in college, also exhibits a Sunday rebound almost at par with academic information websites.You can also verify the phenomenon of the weekly cycle using Google Trends. You need to use search terms that get sufficient traffic volume. Examples of such search terms are ""derivative"" (a key concept in differential calculus, part of high school and college mathematics),""ethanol"" (used in chemistry and biology),and DNA (used in biological sciences).Keep in mind that the trends are clearer and sharper during the academic year, because traffic volume is greater, and some of the phenomena (like Sunday rebound) are specific to the academic year.






You can also use Wikipedia pageviews to verify the weekly cycles in data. Wikipedia pageviews are likely to be more robust than Google Trends, particularly for the long tail, because of the absence of confusing normalizations. They are reported in UTC. The Saturday dip is clear across a wide range of examples. Examples from the English Wikipedia: ""Derivative"" (used in calculus, a part of mathematics),""Ethanol"" (used in chemistry and biology),""Hydrochloric acid"" (used in chemistry; more noisy),""Normal subgroup"" (used in advanced college mathematics),and ""Law of demand"" (used in early college economics, but also in high school economics classes for students who take them).Subreddits related to academic topics can have a somewhat different weekly cycle: a general weekend dip but no greater dip on Saturday. For instance, the science subreddit has its highest traffic on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and its lowest traffic on Sunday.This is in contrast with academic websites that see their lowest traffic on Saturday. While this is partly an effect of timezone aggregation (Reddit uses UTC whereas Quantcast uses Central Time of Mexico City), it is also related to the fact that the subreddit is geared more toward the generally science-curious than to the specific academic needs of students.

,


Explicitly, the pattern is as follows: traffic reaches its lowest level on Friday, starts going up on Saturday, peaks on Sunday, and then steadily declines till Friday. In some cases, the peak is on Monday rather than Sunday.
Examples are the Cooking Stack Exchange,home improvement site Apartment Therapy,cooking site The Kitchn (actual name, not a misspelling),vegan recipe site Oh She Glows,the Home Improvement (DIY) Stack Exchange,and the Gardening Stack Exchange.You can also use Google Trends to verify the weekly pattern in topics related to cooking and home improvement. Example search terms include ""eggplant"",""tomato"",and ""stew"".Unfortunately, Wikipedia pageview trends do not display the same weekly cycles. Rather, they are all over the place. This is probably because most people who are looking for cooking recipes and advice don't go to Wikipedia for it, and variation in Wikipedia pageviews for these pages is governed by other factors.
Cooking-related subreddits display a similar weekly cycle, albeit the traffic peak appears to be on Monday rather than Sunday. However, this is partly a result of timezone aggregation (Reddit reports daily traffic using UTC). Explicitly, traffic peaks around Monday, falls through the week, reaching its lowest point around Friday or Saturday. It then increases through Sunday to its peak. Examples include the subreddits for recipes,and cooking.

,


Relative search interest related to eating out (as shown in Google Trends) goes up during the weekend, peaking on Saturday, somewhat lower on Sunday, and lowest from Monday to Thursday.However, websites related to eating out see their lowest traffic on Sunday. The highest traffic is generally during the week, between Tuesday and Friday. Traffic dips partly on Saturday and goes down more on Sunday. Examples include eater.com,yelp.com, and eat24.com.The higher traffic on Saturday than Sunday is likely because people are more likely to go out to meet friends on Saturday and more likely to stay at home on Sunday. This also explains the opposite pattern for home maintenance and cooking websites discussed in the preceding step.
The difference between the observations for search trends and website traffic could be due to a combination of two factors:

Search interest is relative to overall search interest, and people search less on the whole on weekends.
People are more likely to use the mobile app on weekends.



,


This pattern can be seen in the Parenting Stack Exchange.The pattern can also be discerned in raisingkids, a subreddit related to parenting., However, some travel sites have peaks a little later in the week, or even multiple peaks.


The standard pattern can be seen in the Travel Stack Exchange,and travelsort.com.The standard pattern with a little variation can be seen in travelcodex.com (the peak here sometimes occurs on Tuesday, and sometimes there is another peak later in the week).Some travel-related websites have a much more erratic pattern and no discernible weekly cycle. An example is travelskills.com.The English Wikivoyage (a sister project to Wikipedia) does show a weekend dip but does not show a consistent pattern of differences between weekdays.,

This pattern is seen in the Health Stack Exchange,Patient,and eHealthMe.A similar pattern is seen in Google Trends for health-related terms, albeit, depending on your timezone where you view the data, you might see the lowest day as a Sunday rather than a Saturday.You can get a clearer understanding of the weekly fluctuation by viewing the last 7 days (which would show them at an hourly granularity).,


The way the timezone is selected, as well as more specifics about the type of website can affect whether the peak occurs on Friday or Saturday.
One driving factor here is that new releases in music are usually on Fridays.Another driving factor is that people relax and party more on Friday and Saturday.
This pattern is the precise opposite of the pattern for academic websites (see Step 7), and is likely explained by substitution: students are disproportionately likely to be relaxing or partying on Friday and Saturday, which explains the increase in music consumption and decrease in academic website consumption. However, the magnitude of the weekday-weekend variation for music-related content is generally much smaller than that for academic websites.
The pattern can be seen in the view counts for YouTube videos such as Closer (Chainsmokers),Work from Home (Fifth Harmony),and Sorry (Justin Bieber).Many things music-related will not show this pattern. For instance, the Music Stack Exchange shows an opposite pattern, as its use is closer to that of an academic website than a place for music consumption., Keep in mind how the timezone aggregation problem will affect the interpretation of numbers you see in GA, as discussed in Step 1.

Gaming websites see slightly more traffic during the weekends, and substantially more engagement. In other words, there are more sessions, and pageviews/session and total time on site go up. This is because more people have time to play games (and catch up on gaming news) over the weekend, and they have larger blocks of free time. Examples include Twitch.tvand MMORPG.For news and commentary sites, regular variation within the week can often be swamped by other fluctuations, such as changes in traffic in response to trending stories. In general, the social media component of traffic sees less of a weekend dip than the search-driven component of traffic. The release cycle for new content as well as the timing of newsletters and social media posts can also affect the weekly cycle. Moreover, since the sites get a lot of their traffic from casual mobile browsing, this also reduces any weekend dip penalty. For some sites, like Refinery29, The Chive, Betty Confidential, or Uproxx, the weekend dip is statistically clear, with the lowest value on Saturday and the highest value on Tuesday or Wednesday.For Vox, the lowest value is on Sunday, but there are a lot of exceptions due to trending news events.For others, such as Upworthy and The Zoe Report, any weekend dip is swamped by other sources of traffic variation.Note that financial news sites do not fall in this category, as they are mainly used by people when markets are trading, so they exhibit traffic patterns similar to work-related sites., This is particularly important since people often report traffic on a monthly basis.
The day of week during which a particular holiday (like Christmas or New Year) falls can affect the traffic patterns for the month. For instance, in the United States, if January 1 falls near the end of the week, people are likely to get to work only the next week. On the other hand, if January 1 falls near the beginning of the week, people are likely to start work right after it.

, We also discuss the relationship between conversion and traffic, where data is available.For B2B websites, there is much more traffic on weekdays than weekends. However, conversions are even more heavily skewed toward weekdays. In general, people make B2B decisions during working hours. This may be because such decisions generally involve mutual consultation and approval by multiple people, who are more likely to be simultaneously available during working hours on a weekday (the more decision-makers involved, the more the advantage of weekday working hours than non-working hours).
For B2C websites, traffic is generally higher (in terms of unique users) during weekdays. Conversions are higher during weekdays for simple purchase decisions, including most retail e-commerce. However, pageviews/session and conversions are higher during weekends for cases where the purchase decision involves more complex research that needs to be done on personal time. An example of the latter is the purchase of medical products based on one's personal condition. The details can vary based on the nature of the website.For nonprofits, total donations are highest from Monday to Thursday, lower on Friday, and lowest on Saturday and Sunday. For instance, Network for Good's 2015 Digital Giving Index shows that 12%, 7%, and 8% of total donation amount was donated on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday respectively.Average donation amounts are also lower on weekends than on weekdays, though the margin is pretty small.,

For instance, is your site primarily targeted at students, people in specific jobs, holiday activities, home improvement activities, or something else?
For the region and type of activity that your site is targeted at, what is the pattern of use through the year? For instance, if your site targets people at work in specific jobs, what are the peak seasons and the lean seasons for that job?

,


Use Google Trends for seasonal fluctuation in keyword interest. The default display in Google Trends displays data at a monthly granularity since 2004. However, it only displays relative search interest, rather than absolute search volume. Therefore, it is not very good for identifying long-term trends. But it can help with understanding seasonal variation. Note that the default display might offer too little granularity, and a 5-year display might be better to see the finer pattern in the annual cycle.
Use QM data for the Stack Exchange in the subject closest to yours, where applicable, or any other site with publicly available QM data. Note: only use sites that have verified Quantcast metrics, as indicated by the checkmark next to the site's name; data for other sites is too unreliable. When using QM data, it is generally preferable to look at data over 3 or more years, and pick websites that were not undergoing rapid growth. This is so that the pattern you see is, for the most part, the periodic trend rather than the long-term growth trend. If you do have to use a site experiencing rapid growth as a benchmark, you will need to control for this growth. Controlling for growth is a little challenging, so do it only if needed.
You can also use Alexa or SimilarWeb data for websites similar to yours, to look for annual fluctuation in their traffic rank. It's important to remember, however, that this measurement is reliable only for websites that have fairly high traffic, or those that have certified metrics.
You can use global Wikipedia pageviews for language Wikipedias to get a sense of overall annual traffic cycles in pageviews.Additionally, monthly data by country and language Wikipedia is available, though not in an easily graphable form right now: you'll have to go through the archives one by one and piece the data together.Use Wikipedia views (through Wikipedia Views, wikipediaviews.org) to get a sense of traffic fluctuation over time. Wikipedia Views plots Wikipedia pageviews at a monthly granularity, and can therefore be used to approximately detect annual cycles. Examples of various types are discussed later.

,

Drill down by location to verify seasonal trends and annual trends that are location-specific, including academic and work years as well as holidays. You can drill down data by region for your own site in GA. You can also drill down by region in Google Trends.
Drill down by referral type (e.g., the default channel grouping in GA) to further verify hypotheses. As a general rule, annual cycles are stronger in search and direct traffic and weaker in social media traffic. This is because people's use of social media fluctuates less throughout the year.
Drill down by device type. Holiday dips are likely to be experienced more on desktop than on mobile and tablet.

,


If the website primarily serves a United States college audience, the pattern is a combination of two kinds of annual academic year structures:

The semester structure, that includes a Fall Semester that runs about 16 weeks. It starts somewhere between the second week of August and the first week of September, and ends somewhere between the middle of December and the middle of January. The other semester is the Spring Semester, that runs from the second week of January to the end of May.There is also a summer term that starts shortly after the conclusion of the Spring Semester and ends shortly before the Fall Semester.
The quarter structure, that includes three quarters each of which runs 11 weeks (10 weeks of classes and 1 week for finals), plus a summer quarter. The fall or autumn quarter starts around the last week of September and ends around the second week of December. The winter quarter begins in the first week of January and goes on till the first or second week of March. The spring quarter begins after a one-week break after the winter quarter, and goes on till early June.Non-US traffic will depend on the structure of the academic years in the respective countries. Most Northern Hemisphere countries have an academic year beginning some time in August or September and ending some time in May or June. Therefore the traffic pattern is reasonably similar across countries. If the website attracts significant traffic from school students (secondary education or lower) you will also need to look at the academic year pattern for school students.
A good general heuristic about traffic is that it rises for the first few weeks of an academic term, then stays roughly constant during the term. However, after finals are over and people go on vacation, it drops a lot. Note that the pattern within the term can depend on subtle aspects of the website. Some websites can see steady growth within the term because they become more useful to people as they accumulate more material to learn and master. Other websites are more useful during the early stages.
By combining the above heuristic and the mix of semester and quarter patterns, the following traffic picture emerges.


Summer dip: As summer vacations start in the Northern Hemisphere, traffic takes a dip. The dip begins with the beginning of summer vacation under the semester system (in May) and there is a further dip once those on the quarter system also go on vacation (in June). The dip lasts till the middle of August, when people on the semester system start coming back to work.

Autumn traffic: Traffic starts picking up in the second half of August, as people on the semester system get back to classes. It sees another boost in the end of September, as people on the quarter system get back to classes. It then stays steady, growing slightly. There is a brief Thanksgiving dip in te United States, after which traffic returns to old levels.

Christmas dip: Traffic drops precipitously around the middle of December, as the academic term (both the quarter and the semester) ends and people go on the Christmas break.

Winter/spring traffic: Traffic resumes its growth around the middle of January, as people on both the quarter and semester systems get back to work. It grows till the end of the month. After that, with the exception of a brief dip for spring break, traffic stays mostly steady till the summer dip hits.


An example website where these trends are sharp and clear is Quizlet.The reason this is an extreme example is that Quizlet is used almost exclusively in the context of academic needs, whereas many of the other example websites cater to a mix of academic needs and hobby and work needs.






You can use Stack Exchange websites for academic subjects as benchmarks for the annual traffic cycle. Plot over three or more years so that you can clearly discern the long-term trend of growth (particularly applicable to newer sites) and the annual cycle. For instance, on the Math Stack Exchange, you can select a custom range from August 24, 2010 to August 22, 2016 to see both the annual cycle and the long-term trend. To get rid of weekly fluctuation, select Week under ""Show By"".For the Biology Stack Exchange, you can go back four years. Since the year-over-year growth rate of this has been higher, the summer dips were obfuscated by this rapid growth for 2014 and 2015. However, the summer dip is clearer in 2016.Other examples include the Physics Stack Exchangeand Chemistry Stack Exchange.The Economics Stack Exchange is a little more noisy due to less overall traffic, but exhibits the same general pattern.Filtering location to a university town might be a good way of understanding your annual cycle better. For instance, filter to Stanford or Ann Arbor for a United States university with a quarterly system. Filter to Berkeley for a United States university with a semester system. However, traffic to any individual location might be too little. To make out variation clearly, plot at a granularity where you see at least 100 sessions per point plotted. Individual cities might attract too little traffic for this to work, so you may need to look at several of them to get a good picture. Another source of variation, when you are down to the level of the individual university town, is that specific features of the courses taught in that year at that university can affect traffic patterns. This becomes more of an issue the more specialized and less diverse your content is.
Another valuable heuristic for discerning the annual cycle for your website, and for specific content on your website, is Google Trends. Google Trends at the level of individual search queries can be even more granular, but also more noisy. It is more granular because it can capture information about the annual trends in specific search queries. Search queries related to concepts generally covered more in the fall quarter or semester will see a bigger peak in the fall months than in the winter/spring months. In contrast, search queries more customarily covered in the winter/spring quarter or the spring semester will see more traffic in those months. For instance, ""derivative"" is the key topic of differential calculus and is generally covered in the fall quarter or semester. It sees its search traffic peak in October, and a much smaller peak in February.In contrast, ""Taylor series"", a topic generally covered in more advanced winter and spring courses, sees a slightly bigger peak in April.Also, terms related to the American Civil War peak in April and May every year.The peak is likely related to end-of-year examinations in the United States, such as the Advanced Placement History examination.You might be able to use Google Trends to better understand what the expected annual cycle should be for the mix of content that you offer. Keep in mind, though, that search volumes for highly specialized or obscure terms may be too low for the patterns to be statistically robust. The image below shows the behavior for terms related to the American Civil War.






You can use Wikipedia pageviews, charted through Wikipedia Views, to get a sense of annual fluctuations in traffic. For instance, consider the same two examples as above (""Derivative"" and ""Taylor series""). From the Wikipedia views, you can see that derivative has its main peak in the Northern Hemisphere autumn, and a much smaller rebound in the Northern Hemisphere winter/spring. In contrast, Taylor series has comparable peaks in both seasons. The first picture below plots daily average of desktop pageviews at monthly granularity, with the blue line as the total, green line as Taylor series, and red line as derivative.Similarly, you can verify that Wikipedia pages related to the American Civil War peak every year in April and May, consistent with Google Trends. The second picture below gives the daily averages as monthly granularity for pageviews of a number of pages related to the American Civil War, along with the total.,


The typical traffic pattern is as follows:


Worldwide Christmas dip: There is a sharp but brief dip during the week between Christmas and the New Year.

Regional dips for regional holidays: For instance, United States traffic sees a dip during the United States Thanksgiving, but there is no similar dip in non-US traffic.

Slight summer dip (Northern Hemisphere): Work-related sites see a slight dip in traffic during the summer, but not as pronounced as for academic websites. There could be two reasons for the dip. First, some of these sites are also used by students, although less than by people at work. For instance, Stack Overflow is primarily used by people who code for a living, but is also used somewhat by students taking programming courses. The latter could account for the summer dip. A second reason for the summer dip is that professionals are more likely to take time off during the summer months (July and August). However, they do not all take time off at the same time, so the effect of this dip is mild but spread over a longer time period.


You can use data from the following sites to get a sense of the annual traffic cycles for professional websites: Trello,Stack Overflow,ServerFault,and Security Stack Exchange.You can see similar patterns using Google Trends. Since the Christmas dip is brief and may be hard to see, plot with a time range of 5 years so that you get weekly granularity. Also keep in mind that because Google Trends is relative, only very strong trends can be discerned. For instance, for ""jquery"" you see the sharp Christmas dip and a very slight (but hard to discern) drop every summer. The analysis is complicated by the fact that traffic is also going down steadily.On the other hand, ""dhcp"" sees a Christmas dip but no summer dip., Some of the details of these traffic patterns are specific to the United States, so do not blindly apply to different geographical locations.The annual traffic cycle is as follows:

January traffic can be slow to start, and depends on whether January 1 was early in its week (in which case it would start earlier and go longer) or late in the week (in which case people would start work next week, shortening the effective month).
February is shorter by two or three days.
March and April traffic can be erratic due to spring break and Easter.
May and June see consistent traffic.
July and August see lower inbound traffic due to vacations.
September and October see the highest traffic.
November traffic is decent till the week of Thanksgiving. It starts dipping on Monday and falls even further Wednesday through Sunday.
December traffic is low and falls through the month, with the second half having lower traffic. The day of the week that Christmas lands can affect traffic levels.


Unfortunately, very few B2B websites use Quantcast (since Quantcast is primarily used by websites who monetize by showing advertisements, and B2B websites are selling their own product). Therefore, we don't have examples of publicly revealed traffic data.

, Here are some heuristics for sites other than the academic, professional, and B2B categories already discussed above.

Websites related to outdoor activities and home improvement generally see lower traffic in the winter and higher traffic in the summer. The pattern can vary depending on the extent to which winter impairs activity. For instance, the Gardening Stack Exchange peaks in May and June, then steadily falls till December and January, and then again steadily rises till May and June.Websites related to travel see steady year-round behavior. Luxury travel goes up during vacation times but business travel goes down, with roughly cancelling effects. The Travel Stack Exchange has a remarkably steady year-round behavior, but does see a slight summer increase. It also sees less of a Christmas dip than professional, academic, and B2B websites.Websites related to cooking are quite stable year-round. The main anomalies are around specific holidays. Interestingly, in the United States, cooking websites see an increase in traffic around Thanksgiving and also sometimes the week before Christmas, but a decrease around Christmas. Some example websites to look at are the Cooking Stack Exchange,Oh She Glows,and The Kitchn (note: this is the website's brand name, with the 'e' of Kitchen missing).Note that the Thanksgiving increase is stronger for Oh She Glows and The Kitchn than for the Cooking Stack Exchange. This is probably a result of the first two sites (that are publisher-driven) putting extra effort to promote their content in the run-up to Thanksgiving, whereas the Cooking Stack Exchange (that is community-driven) does not see this sort of concerted effort. The images below are for the Cooking Stack Exchange and The Kitchn respectively.











Entertainment and gossip websites generally do not see a holiday dip. Some of them may even see a traffic increase during holidays, particularly if they cover feel-good stories and help people pass their vacation time. In general, their traffic pattern does not see discernible annual cycles.
News sites generally do not have discernible annual patterns, but rather, their patterns are driven by the nature of events in that year. They may, in fact, even see patterns across time periods longer than a year. For instance, politics news sites see more traffic closer in time to elections, which may occur once every few years.
Websites related to tax information for the United States see high traffic near the calendar year transition (December and January) as well as during tax filing season (beginning in the middle of February and proceeding till around the middle of April in the United States). Websites with similar tax information in other countries will see traffic patterns governed by the tax year and filing deadlines of those countries.

, We consider the cases of charitable giving and e-commerce.


Charitable giving in the United States is highest in the month of December, and second highest in January.Tax optimization as well as festival season generosity are contributing factors, but these are amplified by nonprofits engaging in marketing and fundraising drives at this time of year. Websites of charities as well as those related to charity evaluation see more traffic in December (and after that, in November and January) than in the rest of the year. Examples include charity evaluator GiveWell (based on their Google Analytics and Clicky web traffic data, as well as donation metrics as well as Alexa data),Charity Navigator (as recorded in Alexa data),and the Effective Altruism Forum.The Effective Altruism subreddit displays a similar annual cycle, though the peak is a little later (in January).In most countries, retail spending is highest at the turn of the year for that country. In the United States and in most countries that follow the Gregorian Calendar, the retail peak is experienced in December. In the United States specifically, sales are greatest between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Particularly heavy days for sales are Black Friday and Cyber Monday.In China, the biggest day for e-commerce is November 11, known as Singles Day,whereas in India, sales are highest during Diwali.With that said, if your website does not explicitly offer special deals for these occasions, traffic and conversions on your website are not likely to go up much.

,,

Keep in mind the heuristic discussed in Part 2, Step 3: you should aim to study traffic at hourly granularity only if your website gets on the order of 4,000 or more pageviews a day. Below that, random variation may make it hard to see trends. You can still try at lower traffic levels; if you do see a clear pattern that can be illuminating.
GA allows you to look at historical data at an hourly granularity, as well as get real-time analytics with totals for the most recent 30 minutes.
The analytics tool available with WordPress' Jetpack allows you to get a graph of the most recent 48 hours of data, as well as the total views so far in the current UTC day.
Other tools might allow you to see traffic at an even finer granularity.

,

It often makes the most sense to consider traffic separately for regions that are in different timezones, and to filter your view to only consider a specific timezone. This is particularly relevant for organic search and direct traffic that is governed by local time.
Keep in mind: GA uses a single fixed timezone when displaying data (see Part 2, Step 4 for an explanation). You can check the timezone in use by going to ""View Settings"" in GA's Admin Panel.Therefore, when looking at traffic in different regions, you will need to do a timezone adjustment to figure out what the local time in those regions is.
If you are sending newsletters or posting to social media at particular times of day, then you should view your daily traffic patterns in relation to that time of day.

,

Go to the Google Trends main page, enter a search term in the domain you are interested in, and then select a time range of 7 days. This is usually enough to capture hourly trends on all days of the week. The nature of hourly trends may be different for weekdays and weekends, so a 7-day period is recommended. You can also filter by region.
One key caveat: Google Trends displays search interest in a particular topic relative to overall search interest at that time (and in that region, if you are filtering by region). The data is then normalized so that the largest data point is scaled to 100. This is not that big a deal when viewing data at the daily granularity, since total Internet use does not vary that much between days. However, it is a big issue within the day, since search traffic can differ significantly through the day. In particular, search keywords that appear to show peaks at night do not necessarily get the most traffic volume at night; they just see the largest share of traffic volume at night.
A second caveat: Google Trends uses a single fixed timezone, namely, your local timezone (see Part 2, Step 4 for more information). Therefore, you will need to make timezone adjustments when you filter to different regions.
A third caveat around using Google Trends data at this fine a granularity is that for many search terms, there is insufficient volume to get a clear pattern. Moreover, because of timezone issues, it is necessary to drill down to specific locations, which makes the data volume even lower and more noisy. You may therefore have to settle for using more broad-based search queries than the ones you are actually interested in.

,

There is a daily cycle in how people use the Internet.

People use the Internet less at night, because they are likely to be asleep.
Internet use starts in the morning but is generally lower at that time.
Work-related Internet use is high during work hours.
Overall Internet traffic in a timezone is maximum in the evening hours for that timezone, i.e., between 7 PM and 11 PM. In analogy with the rush hour for transportation, this is known as Internet Rush Hour.Much of the rush hour Internet traffic relates to entertainment, including streaming music, movies, and porn, browsing social media, and reading celebrity gossip.
In particular, during Internet rush hour, social media-driven sites also see more traffic at this time since visiting social media is a common evening leisure activity.Organic effects of greater traffic during rush hour are often amplified by publishers who time their social media posts to Internet rush hour.Search-driven traffic does not see this additional boost, and therefore sees less of a rush hour peak.


The daily cycle has different shapes in different parts of the world. There are a few sources of variation.

The day-night gap in traffic varies heavily by region. In some regions, the ratio of the daytime peak to the nightly low can be as low as 3, whereas in other regions it can be higher than 5.
You can get a crude estimate of the shape of traffic in different continents using Akamai's real-time web metrics tool. This shows HTTP hits per second over the most recent 24 hours (ending now) with times displayed in UTC. Unfortunately, the free tool only offers granularity at the level of continent, and a single continent can span many timezones, so it is not a very good indicator of day-night variation in a single timezone.You might also get interesting information about the way the daily cycle varies by region by looking at published research on hourly traffic trends for the different language Wikipedias.Surveys conducted of people while using the English Wikipedia (and some other language Wikipedias) have found that people using it during the day time are more likely to have school or work as motivation, and those using it at night are more likely to be motivated to learn more about something they saw in the media.Note that if your traffic is global, then it can appear to be fairly even throughout the 24-hour period because of different timezones. You should therefore filter by region to see the daily cycle more clearly.

Some professions have a larger share of ""night owls"" than others. For these professions, even though night-time traffic is lower, it does not fall too low. In fact, Google Trends data for related searches may even show late-night peaks. Absolute traffic is lower but the share of traffic could rise. Programming-related professions have a high share of night owls. For instance, for the keyword ""jquery"" in California, Google Trends shows peaks (after adjusting timezones) at 11 AM, 2 PM, and 2 AM, with the 2 AM peak the highest.Websites that cater to needs specific to particular times of the day see traffic peaks at those times of the day. For instance, websites that provide news and information for day traders see a peak around the time of the opening of the market, and another peak around the time of the close of the market, since trade volume is largest at these times. In the United States, the main stock markets are located in New York, and open around 9 AM Eastern Time. Therefore, even in California, interest peaks at 9 AM Eastern Time, or 6 AM Pacific Time (the local time in California).Websites that people may visit for planning their day see a peak early in the morning, or in the evening, or at both times. This includes websites related to transportation and retail (e.g., the stores people plan to visit).For some other examples of analysis of traffic fluctuation within the day, and how these within-day trends differ between weekdays and weekends, see Pornhub's 2015 in reviewand the New York Times article on minute-by-minute Google Trends.,

Some websites have released activity data that allow people to measure how activity varies by time of day. An example is the activity data on questions as well as the activity data on answers on Q&A website Stack Overflow. Both questions and answers show a peak around 15:00 UTC, a time with maximal overlap between working hours of different timezones.Another source of benchmarks might be data on downstream conversion actions. For instance, the Digital Giving Index for 2015 includes data on the distribution of giving by time of day.,

Push factors generally result in sharp and sudden increases, followed by gradual decrease.
Examples of such factors include the release of news or related content (videos, movies, music, books) related to the topic. An example occurred when Adele's single Hello was released in October 2015. The song revived people's interest in Adele, and as a result, her older songs such as Someone Like You saw a sharp jump in YouTube traffic, that then gradually faded.To see the statistics, click on ""More"" below the video and select ""Statistics"" there.






For more on the history of push factors and their traffic impact, you can read up on the Slashdot Effect.,

The overall shape of traffic as a result of a successful Facebook post looks similar to the pattern described in Step 1, namely, a sharp increase, followed by a gradual decrease. More specifics are described below.
For an initial period after the post (that could last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour) Facebook circulates the post within a select subset of the potential audience, gradually ramping up the rate of circulation. The extent to which it receives a positive reaction from that initial subset determines how much further Facebook ramps up the post.
After the post is ramped up, Facebook exponentially decays the circulation of the post. In particular, if the post does not receive a lot of organic re-shares, traffic to the post from Facebook decays exponentially. The traffic graph shape is concave up (i.e., it goes down faster in the beginning, and then the rate of decline slows down). This sort of traffic shape is seen when the driving factor in the post's circulation is the huge reach. Without any special boosting, this is determined by the number of people who have liked the page. With special boosting, it depends on how heavily the post was boosted. The example below shows traffic to a Facebook-driven web site. When the post is published, Facebook experimentally circulates it for a few minutes (starting 16:17), resulting in a slight increase in website traffic. Then after determining the response rate, circulates it to a large audience (around 16:32), causing a huge increase in website traffic. Over time, traffic falls (probably because of exponential decay in circulation by Facebook). The fall is fastest in the beginning, and traffic eventually returns to a similar level as it was before the Facebook post.






If, on the other hand, the post receives a lot of organic re-shares, the decay pattern will not be exponential. Traffic shape will be concave down. In other words, it will decay less initially because of the extra boost provided by organic reshares. Later, the rate of decay will pick up. This sort of traffic shape is seen when genuine engagement rather than raw volume is that driving factor for the post's circulation.
In general, keep in mind the following heuristics for the ballparks of ratios. The number of people who see your post will usually not be more than 20% of the eligible population, but it can be much lower, particularly if you have a large number of people who have followed and liked the page. A typical range is 0.5% to 10%. The click-through rates for people who do see the post can vary from 0.5% to 10%, and usually from 1% to 5%. The ratio of likes + reactions to clicks generally varies from 1% to 5% (though some posts get a lot of likes without clicks, and others get a lot of clicks without likes). Overall, a page with a few million likes should expect to get in the tens of thousands in pageviews from an average Facebook post.

comScore is a global media measurement and Internet analytics company. Based on its many measurement tools, comScore provides regular estimates of the extent to which people are using the web on various devices (personal computer and smartphone) as well as their use of apps. Its focus is on United States traffic. comScore data has been cited for estimates of the relative use of mobile and desktop,the relative use of apps and the webs,and stagnation in desktop use.Survey research organizations and nonprofits occasionally conduct surveys on people's Internet and website usage. The Pew Research Center's Internet, Science and Tech section (pewinternet.org) contains a number of such surveys, focused on United States audiences.Another source is Public Knowledge (at publicknowledge.org).Another information source is the Wikimedia Foundation's Global Reach survey,with results so far for India,Nigeria,and Brazil.The survey, conducted through phone interviews, covers questions on Internet use as well as Wikipedia use in these countries. It has been used for the Wikimedia Foundation's New Readers project to better understand how people are using the Internet in countries with rapidly growing access, and how they currently relate to Wikipedia.You can get statistics on Internet penetration in various countries on the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) website.You can get more references for current Internet penetration and trends worldwide and in specific countries by looking at the references from the associated Wikipedia pages.,

People's consumption of the Internet has been shifting from desktop to mobile and from web to apps. According to comScore data, mobile Internet use accounts for about double of desktop and laptop Internet useand app use accounts for a little over half of Internet use (so, a little more than web use).Moreover, comScore data also suggests that desktop use peaked in 2015.comScore data on the use of Wikipedia, the world's foremost information site, shows a decline in unique visitors starting in late 2013, with the decline sharpest on desktop (with mobile numbers staying roughly constant or going up) and biggest in North America.User surveys of people's changes in Internet use, as well as changes they are considering, show that a minority (but a non-negligible one) of users have either stopped or are considering stopping their home broadband subscriptions because smartphone plans meet their Internet use needs. Users who are seriously considering this tend to have lower incomes and education levels. They cite both the cost of home broadband and the fact that they can accomplish the most important things through a smartphone as factors that influence the decision.Most users, however, see value in both desktop and mobile Internet. Mobile Internet is primarily used for communication, quick information consumption, and social media whereas desktop Internet is used more for video consumption and buying things.Advertising spend is another proxy for the growth in Internet use. In the United States, desktop advertising spend has been mostly stable since 2012, whereas mobile advertising spend has approximately doubled year-over-year from 2010 to 2015 (however, its growth rate is now falling).,

Websites that deal with work-related topics catering to a tech-savvy audience are likely to have seen their growth and peak earlier. In particular, organic growth rates for established websites in this category since about 2014 would be relatively small, under 10% per year in the United States and under 20% per year worldwide. Examples are websites in the Stack Exchange Network such as Stack Overflow,ServerFault,AskUbuntu,and Math Stack Exchange.Women's magazines have, since 2014, seen a slight decline in desktop web use and an increase in mobile web use, for a slight net increase.Websites with social media-driven traffic driven by ""clickbait"" have generally seen an increase in traffic till somewhere between 2012 and 2014, but a decline in traffic since about 2014. In particular, a serious decline begins around the middle of 2016, as Facebook rolls out new ways to combat clickbait in the news feed.However, this rule has a lot of exceptions, as different kinds of websites and different kinds of social media strategies are affected in different ways by changes to Facebook's news feed algorithms and users' changing social media habits. An example of a social media website that has seen steady decline in traffic is Upworthy.New genre websites in topics with less of a tech-savvy bias have much more room for rapid growth in recent years, but this growth is not guaranteed. Examples of such domains include sports, cooking, and fashion.

For search updates, use announcements on algorithm changes to Google Search. A good place to get an up-to-date timeline of all search algorithm changes is the Moz page on Google algorithm change history.Another source is Wikipedia's timeline of Google Search, but this is less likely to be kept continuously up-to-date.You can compare these changes against the search traffic to your website. If you have enabled Search Console, you should also be able to see data on total impressions and clicks on Google search queries that led to your website. If you see sharp changes in the search traffic occurring at a time when Google made an algorithm update, the change is likely driven by that algorithm update. You might be able to use the direction of such changes to better understand how further planned algorithm updates will affect your website traffic. There is a lot of online discussion on Google search algorithm changes, as well as paid tools that can help you understand and optimize against those.
For a history of Facebook news feed algorithm changes, see the events related to Product (news feed) in the Wikipedia timeline of Facebook page, and follow the references to get more details on the updates.If you see sharp changes in the reach and engagement of your posts, or the traffic to your website from Facebook, at the time Facebook makes algorithm changes, then you are likely affected by those changes.

Use AdBlock Plus and remove those annoying ads.,
Use OpenDNS and preemptively block whole categories of time-leeching sites.,
Selectively block your dearest time-leeching sites.,
Discipline yourself!",How to Tame the Internet," Ads are a major source of distraction on the Internet, especially on some sites that clearly have given up on user experience in favour for ad revenue. You can get rid of them though! AdBlock Plusis a plugin for the Firefox and Google Chrome browsers that intelligently blocks ads, most of the time retaining the original layout of the page, only without ads. It still allows some “non-intrusive ads” to show by default. If you truly want to go ad-free, you can tell the plugin to block these ads, too.;
, OpenDNSis a free DNS server for home users. Non-technically, it allows you to preemptively block large categories of time-leeching sites (Social networking, Auctions, etc.), in a way similar to how companies block some sites on their network. You choose what gets blocked, and you even get to watch statistics on what you visit and what is getting blocked!


As an added bonus, OpenDNS will protect you from phishing sites – and you can also choose to block sites classified as sources of malware, spam, etc. Since this solution operates at the network level, it is not browser specific – so even if you use some less common browser like Opera, this solution still works fully.

, Complementary or in alternative to OpenDNS, you can use with Firefox the LeechBlockplugin. Continuing the garden metaphor, while OpenDNS is the lawn-mower, blocking whole categories of sites with one blade, LeechBlock is akin to the garden scissors used for tuning your garden. Using this small tool, you can hand-select specific sites that bother you the most, and block them out completely, at certain times of day or even after a predetermined amount of time. That way, you can organize your Internet schedule and turn off distractions when they will do the most damage.

, As with any tool, these three suggestions are only means towards an end which is disciplined Internet usage! After all, part of taming the Internet is also taming yourself. Use them and enjoy your tidy garden – more secure, and with less chaff, but still ripe with opportunities for distraction – and learn to ignore that which matters and that which does not!

, Depending on where you live, your cable provider may be Time Warner, Comcast, Cox or another provider. Your neighbors should be able to tell you who provides the cable locally, or you can consult your local print or online directory, if you don't already know the cable provider.

, Satellite cable companies such as DirecTV, Dish Network and Verizon Fios offer Internet connections with their packages. These connections are available almost everywhere.

, You can find out the price for cable and Internet packages on any cable company's website. Many cable and satellite companies also engage in heavy marketing and advertising. Check for flyers or other sales and promotions that offer special pricing.


Take advantage of special deals and promotions, whether you are a new customer or an existing customer who wants to upgrade. Negotiate discounts and additional services, and mention more competitive prices you may have seen elsewhere.

, After you research the plans and pricing available with all of your options, decide which cable Internet plan you would prefer.

, Every cable company will have a toll-free customer service telephone number. Call the number listed in your local telephone directory, on the marketing materials you have, or on their website. The information you will need includes your name, address and anything that confirms your identity, such as a driver's license number or social security number.

, Most companies will allow you to sign up for cable Internet service online. Go to their website and look for a tab that says ""order now"" or ""sign up now.""


Use a website that searches for the best cable Internet plan for you, if you are unsure of which company to use. Sites such as Go 2 Broadband will search your local area for available plans, and allow you to sign up for the one you want. The site will ask you where you live and what you want.

Make your home and computer easy to access for any equipment that the technician will need to hook up. If you opt for wireless service, the equipment will be minimal. Digital cable will require receivers and a modem that plugs into your wall and runs wires through your television and computer.
Ask about whether you are required to purchase the equipment, or if you lease it as part of your contract. If the equipment is leased, you will see that charge as part of your monthly bill.

, Before you finish signing up for cable Internet, you will need to provide a billing address and method of payment. Some companies will require you to prepay for the first month, and others will send you a bill. You will have the option to pay online, or set up recurring payments to come out of your bank account directly.

Search a webpage.,
Search the definitions.,
Search for the exact range: There is a Google search operator called AROUND(n), (n stands for number) that is rather strange and probably very few people know when using Google.,
Search synonyms.",How to Search on Google More Effectively," Currently most of the websites are integrated with Search Engines to help the users find conveniently the desired content. However, a number of these websites’ Search Engines are not giving notification effectively with such things as “There is no result for…” or irrelevant results. Thus, instead of using Search Engines within the site and getting frustrated, you can ask for Google’s help by typing your keywords into Google search box followed by ‘at + name of the website”. Syntax: Keyword + at + Website’s name.;
, The search for definitions of a specialized word is also what users often apply to Google. Previously, to do this, you had to type in Google search box “What is + Keyword” so that Google could offer the full definitions exactly. But nowadays Google has become more powerful and multipurpose. You just need to type in the search box your specialized words, Google will be able to understand what you need and provide you with germane results.

, When applying this search operator, Google will return to the users the results that are limited with two primary keywords and ‘n’ the numbers of limited words . For example, when you type in the Google search box “Thailand AROUND(5) Cambodia”, the system will display all websites containing the two keywords at both sides with proximity of 5 words. Syntax: Keyword 1 + AROUND(n) + Keyword 2 (Where n = number of words. Note: when using this operator, you need to put in uppercase the word “AROUND”.

, This is also considered as a useful searching tip with Google to help you save your time when you don’t have to use multiple keywords. Google will automatically search the results with similar keywords, so you will find more results yet only need to type the keyword once by adding the “~” operator in front of the keyword. For instance, if you want to search for a cheap laptop, you might type in the Google search box “~cheap laptop”, Google will return to you the keywords that are synonyms with “cheap” such as affordable, discount or low-cost. Syntax: ~Keyword.

Examine the community.,
Look at your forum name.,
Consider your online persona.",How to Make an Avatar1," A great way to get an idea for your avatar is to examine the community that you are posting in. Many people use an avatar that relates to the community in some way, and helps identify their interests.


For example, if you post in gaming forums, consider using an image of your favorite video game character. If you post on car forums, choose an image of your favorite make and model.;
, Nearly all forums require you to create a unique username, and many people base their avatar off of their username. This helps create a visual connection with your username, as people will quickly be able to tell who's posting.


For example, if you chose the name of your favorite comic book hero, you can use an image of that character as your avatar. If your username is ""HorseRider"", then you might want to choose an image of a horse.

, Everyone acts differently online than they do in real life. Take your online persona into account when designing your avatar. Your avatar should be a reflection of who you are in that community.


For example, if you've taken the time to cultivate a zany personality, your avatar should probably be off-the-wall and random.

Find an image.,
Make sure the subject will scale well.,
Open the picture with your image editing software.,
Crop the subject.,
Check the dimensions allowed by the forum.,
Choose to scale or crop your image.,
Save the resized image.,
Add text to your avatar.,
Add effects to your avatar.",How to Make an Avatar2," If you don't want to draw your own image, you'll need to find one that you can use. Use tools like Google Image Search or Bing to find the perfect picture, or use an image you've taken yourself.

, Forum avatars are almost always quite small, so the subject of your avatar should be easily distinguishable when shrunk. Landscapes and other full-frame photos are ill-suited for avatars. Faces, figures, objects, drawings, and other easily-seen subjects make for much better avatars.

, You don't need anything fancy to create your avatar, unless you're planning on adding effects or text. Any image editing software will work, from Paint to Photoshop.

, Since you don't have much space to work with for avatars, crop out everything around the subject. There are several ways to do this depending on the program you are using, but there is one way that is universal across all programs:


Click the rectangular selection tool and select just the subject.
Copy it to the clipboard and then open a new file in your image editor.
Paste the copied piece so that only the subject is on your canvas.

, Different forums have different rules about the size of the avatar image. The range is typically between 50 X 50 px to 100 X 100 px. Most forums will inform you of the limits when you use the avatar upload function in your user profile.


Some forums may allow rectangular avatars instead of just squares.
Some forums may allow very large avatars.

, Now that your subject is isolated and you know your avatar dimension limits, you can choose whether you want to scale your image down or crop out a piece that fits the dimensions. Different programs will have different ways to go about this, but generally there is a ""Resize Image"" option. In Paint there is a Resize button on the Home tab, and in Photoshop you can click Image → Image Size to change the scale.


Whether you choose to scale or crop depends entirely on the subject and size of the image. If the subject takes up the entire image, such as a picture of a car, then scaling will ensure that it is all included in the avatar. If just a part of the subject will work for your avatar, such as a face, then you could crop out just that part.
You can do a combination of the two as well. For example, if you have a picture of a superhero that's way too big, you could scale it down a bit and then crop out just the head so that it fits the dimensions.
When scaling an entire image, be aware that changing the proportions will result in a stretched or squished image. For example, if your original image is rectangular and you scale it down into a square, the image will be appear squished together. Crop your image first to meet the proportions the avatar dimensions to avoid this.

, Once the image has been scaled and cropped, you're ready to save it. Double-check that it meets the dimension requirements, and then save your image as a PNG file. This will result in the best quality at the lowest size. This is important, as many forums have file size restrictions as well as dimension restrictions.


At this point, you may be finished. You can upload your avatar using the upload function in your user profile. If you want to add effects or text to your avatar, read on.

, If you have the space, you can add some text to your avatar. Keep in mind that, depending on the dimension restrictions your forum imposes, you might not have a lot of space. It can be hard to add much readable text to a 50 x 50 image.


If you're going to add text, it's recommended that you use an image editing program like Photoshop or GIMP, as they provide a lot more options for fonts and scaling than programs like Paint. See this guide for details on adding text using Photoshop.

, If you want to spice up your avatar, you can use advanced editors like Photoshop or GIMP to add special effects to your image. Good use of effects can really make your avatar stand out, and can add a professional feel to it.



Add a drop shadow to make your avatar appear more three-dimensional.

Adjust the lighting to make a picture appear sunlit.

Add a glitter effect to make your avatar sparkle.

Technically block the website, so you are not able to visit that website.",How to Leave an Addictive Website," Is it the fact that you can't stop talking to your friends? Or that your favorite games keep pulling you in? Figure out what's holding you.;
, You may reply, ""Because it's fun"" or ""Because if I stop, I might lose everything!"" Then figure out how you can control this desire. For example, find other fun things to do (like reading or biking, or hanging with friends.) In the latter case, ask yourself if ""losing everything"" on an online game is really so bad. Life goes on!

, For example, if you are addicted to Facebook, try to go visit some of your friends for real. Or if you love role-playing sites, search Google for similar sites that can help you get off your main addictive site.

, Never stop immediately- go slowly, cutting anywhere from fifteen minutes to two hours each day. Slowly, reduce your extreme visiting hours to a regular amount of time. If you wish, stop going there altogether.

, Go outside and breathe in the fresh air, or help your sister with her homework. Visiting other sites is all right, as long as you don't get addicted to them, too!

, Just add one line in your hosts file, ""127.0.0.1 domain.of.the.site www.domain.of.the.site""(without double quotation marks). If the site is facebook, that line would be ""127.0.0.1 facebook.com www.facebook.com"". See how to Block a Website on Mac.

Subscribe to a broadband service first.,
Check your broadband package.,

Take the Internet cable from the broadband package and plug it into one of the Internet ports behind the router/modem.,
Take the other end of the Internet cable and plug it to the Internet port at the back of your computer (located near the speaker ports) or laptop (along the sides or at the back).,
Connect the power cable to the router or modem and plug it to a power outlet.",How to Install Broadband," Broadband uses the networks of telecommunication companies, so you have to subscribe to a service first before you can start surfing. Contact your local Internet service provider or telecommunications company to know what kind of broadband services you can avail.;
, Once you have subscribed, you’ll be given a broadband package that contains the following:


An Internet modem or router with power adapter
1 piece Internet cable
1 piece telephone cable
Phone filters
1 piece ADSL splitter
These are the items you need to install a broadband Internet, which will be explained as you proceed.

, Start by unplugging your telephone from the wall socket and connecting the ADSL splitter.


Broadband runs on digital signal while telephones run on analog. Splitters split the digital and analog signal coming from the telephone lines between your computer and your telephone so they don’t get mixed up.

, If you have other telephone units in your house, take a phone filter and connect it in between your phone and the wall socket, just like how you connected the ADSL filter.


The phone filter works just like the ADSL splitter, but instead of splitting the signals between analog and digital, it filters out the digital signal so it won’t mess up your phone when you use it.

,, There’s only one port on the router/modem that the telephone cable can fit into (the smaller one), so connecting it to the right port should be easy.

, Most routers have four Internet ports; you can plug the cable to any of these four ports.

, There’s only one port on your PC that the Internet cable can fit to, so it won’t be hard locating the port.

, Press the modem/router’s Power button and the lights on the router or modem should blink; meaning it is booting up.


Once the lights have steadied out, turn on your computer, open a web browser, and start surfing the network.

, Keep a log including the institutions' names, telephone numbers and contact people. Leave plenty of space for any notes that you take while talking to medical assisting program representatives.

, Be prepared with the questions you want to ask. It is advisable to seek out the following information:


Is the institution accredited? Institutions must be accredited in order to qualify you to sit for the American Association of Medical Assistants (AAMA) national certification examination. Do not waste your time on an online training program that does not prepare you for a Certified Medical Assistant (CMA) designation.
How much time will it take to complete the program? Medical assisting programs can vary in duration, depending on the coursework and they type of schedule you choose.
What courses are included in medical assisting training? Choose a program with a broad range of medical courses to supplement the basic medical assisting courses. An online training program that includes coursework in phlebotomy, ultrasound technology, medical coding and more will better prepare you to specialize (and make more money) down the line.
What kind of financial assistance is offered? In addition to government financial aid, many schools offer discounts or special rates for a variety of circumstances. It pays to ask.
Does the medical assisting program include hands-on experience in the form of work-study, internships or externships?
Will the school help with certification and job placement upon successful completion of the program?

, Any reputable educational institution should have a list of course graduates who have volunteered to speak for the program.

Run Disk Cleanup and restart your browser.",How to Increase Internet Speed," There are a lot of free tools available online that will test your internet speed for you. Search for “speed test” on your favorite search engine and run tests through several different services. You may need to install plugins in order to get the tests to run.


Different tests will give you different results, even if you take the same test twice. This is because test servers are located in different areas and the number of people online can affect your speed. It is best to take a good sample of tests to see what your average is.;
, Check your service plan to see what speed you are paying for. Many service providers will claim speeds “up to” a certain number. This means that they can’t guarantee that it will always be that high.


If you are consistently receiving lower speeds than you are paying for, contact customer service and demand either a lower fee or speeds that match what you pay.
If you haven’t upgraded your internet in a long time, you may be able to find faster internet for lower prices. Check all of the providers in your area.
Don't fall for the megabit/megabyte trap. ISPs advertise in megabits, not megabytes. There are 8 megabits (Mb) in a megabyte (MB), so if you are paying for 25 megabits per second (Mbps), then that's just over 3 megabytes per second (MBps) of actual transfer speed.

, Sometimes a simple reset can significantly increase your Internet speed. You can also turn your router on and off to see if that's helpful. Just make sure that you know your login information in case your computer requires you to enter it after the reset.

, If many people in your building are using the same channel, then you could notice a major slowdown in your Internet speed. Use a program such as inSSIDer for PC and KisMAC or WiFi Scanner for Mac to scan for channels that aren’t as populated. Switching to one of these channels will reduce interference and possibly increase your speed.


If you see a more open channel, then switch channels to increase Internet speed. You'll need to consult your router’s documentation or look up the support site for your individual router to find out how to do access the router and change the wireless channel.

, If you are connected to the internet via a Wi-Fi router, poor signal can lead to lower speeds and dropped connections. If you can, move your router closer to your computer to boost your signal, or move the computer closer to the router.If the router is old, it may be time to upgrade. Newer routers can offer much improved connections and speed over older wireless routers.Dirty, dusty, or loose cables leading from your cable or DSL modem to your wireless router, or computer can cause significant reductions in your internet speed. Pick up a can of compressed air from your local computer store, and use it to blow out the dirt and dust in the connectors.
Maintain proper ventilation around all electrical components to avoid overheating.

, If you can, try to hardwire as many of your connected devices as possible. This will lead to higher speeds for those devices, as well as less interference for your remaining wireless devices, such as tablets and phones.

, If your wireless network doesn’t have a password, not only are you leaving yourself vulnerable to others spying on you, but you are also leaving your network open for anyone to use. This means that other people can be stealing your bandwidth. Make sure that your wireless network is properly secured, especially in crowded apartments.

, When you activated DSL, you hooked the line from your phone jack into one side of a rectangular box filter. On the other side, you have 2 lines coming out, 1 for your phone and 1 for your modem. If you are using a DSL connection over your landline, make sure that you have high-quality filters in place to get optimum signal speed., Turn off smartphones, tablets, Smart TVs, set-top boxes or other devices that you aren't currently using. If multiple devices are attempting to retrieve information from the internet, especially streaming video or gaming, you will see a loss of speed.

, Many internet service providers impose a data cap on their customers that may not be immediately visible. Log in to your account page, or contact the customer service department to see if you have gone over your allowance. Oftentimes the penalty for exceeding the allowance is decreased speed for the rest of the billing period.

, Viruses, adware, and other malware can significantly slow down your internet speed, as well as your computer’s speed. Run regular scans to ensure that your computer is virus and malware free.


If you don’t have an antivirus installed, install one immediately and make sure that it stays updated.
Antivirus programs don’t always catch everything, so you should occasionally run scans with programs such as Spybot or Malwarebytes to find and remove stubborn malware.

, As you surf the web, your browser stores information about the sites you visit to make the loading process quicker when you next visit. Over time, however, this can actually reduce the speed of your browser as more and more information is stored. Occasionally clearing your cache can help boost the performance of a slow browser.


Follow this guide to clear the cache of virtually any browser or device.

, If you’ve ended up with a lot of toolbars after years of using the same browser, it may be time to remove some (or all) of them. Toolbars will decrease your browser’s performance, and often take up your bandwidth by requesting ads and information.


Follow this guide to remove toolbars from any of the major browsers.

, Browsers are under constant development, and newer versions often offer performance increases over previous versions. Check to make sure you are running the latest version of your browser, and update it if you aren’t.


Update Internet Explorer
Update Google Chrome
Update Firefox

, If you’ve installed a bunch of toolbars and plugins for your web browser, it may be easier to just switch to a new browser instead of trying to remove all of them. Some browsers are natively faster than others as well, so you may see a performance increase regardless., If your computer is running slowly, it can negatively impact your browsing experience, making it seem like your connection is slower than it is. Follow the steps in this guide to clean out the old gunk from your hard drive.

, To prevent future infections or slowdowns, take the time to shut down your computer every day. Turn on automatic security updates for all of your programs., There may be programs installed that are using your bandwidth that you may not be aware of. Browse your installed programs and remove any that you know longer use or don’t remember installing. Be cautious when deleting programs you aren’t familiar with; always check online to see if it is a critical program.

Understand how a shortened URL works.,
Use shortened URLs when you gain a benefit from them.,
Select a URL shortener service that is reputable and that keeps a record of your shortened URLs either permanently or for a long period of time.

",How to Know When to Use a Shortened URL," URL shortening is a means by which the traditionally long URL to a website is truncated into a more manageable and shorter URL. It is typically used with pages that create longer URLs by dint of them being news stories, articles, explanatory pages, etc. that do not carry the simple front page domain name.;
, A shortened URL is made by using a service that shortens URLs (examples are provided below). The new URL basically redirects you to the actual URL.

, It is important to understand when you will benefit from using a shortened URL. Some of the uses for which the shortened URL is beneficial include:


Hiding a URL from spammers
Affiliated marketing links
Use on Twitter and other short messaging social networking sites
Need for less characters, a neater appearance on a webpage
For ease of remembering if you're exchanging information, making car stickers, etc.
Ease of use within emails, etc.

Create quality content.,
Create original content.,
Incorporate appropriate images.,
Use keywords.",How to Get On the First Page of Google1," The best thing that you can do to increase your rankings with Google is to run a quality website. Hire a professional designer to create your page if you can (and if you can't, be sure to at least avoid having it look like it was made in 1995). You'll also want to focus on the quality of the text. Google likes to see lots of text with correct grammar and spelling. It will also need to be exactly what people are looking for when they read the preview of your site: if you bait and switch them or they otherwise immediately leave and look for something else, your rankings will be docked.;
, You'll be docked for duplicating your content over different pages of your site and you'll also be docked for stealing someone else's content. It's not a matter of getting caught by a person, Google's bots do all the heavy lifting. Just focus on creating quality content that's all your own.

, Google also looks for images and pictures (image quality will also play a role!). Find and create images that match your text and add to the experience. Don't steal the images though! This can hurt your rankings. Use Creative Commons images or take your own!


Use your company’s original photos to show the work culture. Get high quality stock photos for your website.

, Use Google Analytics to find the best keywords for your business (this process is described in the ""Using Google"" section below). Then, use those keywords in your text. Don't overload the text with the keyword; Google will notice and dock you. But you should use it at least several times.

"
"
Choose a good domain name.,
Use descriptions.,
Use headers.",How to Get On the First Page of Google2," If you can make it work, fit your main keyword into your domain name as the first word in the domain. To boost rankings, you can also use a country TLD (top level domain, like .com) if you have a local business. You'll be rewarded for searches in your area, but doing this will hurt your searches outside of your country. Of course this doesn't matter if your business is local. At the very least, avoid replacing words with numbers (and other 90s tricks) and avoid using a subdomain.


This applies to subpages as well. Use descriptive and valid URLS for each page of the website. Give the pages names that tell search engines and users what they are instead of using generic names like ""page1"". Instead, do something like weddings, for your wedding rentals and catering page.
Keywords in subdomains also work in your favor. So for example, if you have a section of your site that is for wholesale, use an address like ""weddings and wholesale"".

, Your website code allows you to add invisible descriptions for pictures and pages. Use these, and try to fit at least one keyword into the text. Having one at all will help your rankings. If you don't know how to work your html code to do this, get your website designer to help you.

, Headers are another part of the website code where you can add text. Use these, and try to fit at least one keyword into the text. Having one at all will help your rankings. If you don't know how to work your html code to do this, get your website designer to help you.

Work to create quality backlinks.,
Get on the social media train.,
Be active in the online community.",How to Get On the First Page of Google3," Backlinks are when another website, preferably one that gets more hits than yours, links to your page. Find websites that are in the same vein as yours and see if they'd be willing to do some cross promotion. You can also contact relevant blogs and ask about guest posting, giving you another chance to link to your site.


Remember, you want these backlinks to be quality. Google can tell the difference. Do not spam comment sections trying to build backlinks for yourself. You will be docked for this behavior.

, Social media like and shares are rewarded more than ever these days with Google, especially with subjects that are currently relevant. This means that you should create social media accounts and try to build a base of followers who will like your pages and share them with friends. Remember: the trick is to not be spammy!


Keep interacting with your customers online so that they can feel valued. Try to respond to the reviews as this would be appreciated by the customers. Retweet and repost your good reviews.

, Update your website regularly. Google rewards sites which see regular maintenance and updates. This means if you've been ignoring your website since 2005, you're in trouble. Find small ways to update it: new pricing, news posts every couple of months, photos from events, etc.


Do some tweaking to your website in order to stay up-to-date with the latest trends. Use free online tools to keep updating your website on a regular basis.

For example, for your winery, search the term winery (applying any filters you think matter). Click on the Keyword ideas tab and it will tell you how often people are searching your term, what the competition is like, and suggest some alternatives that are also frequently searched. Look for the most popular keywords that are relevant to you and use them!

, Google Trends tells you specifically how interest changes in a topic over time. Search your term and look at the charts for months when you can expect a peak. Smart website owners will be able to guess why there's an increase and find a way to meet that need and set themselves apart.

, Businesses listed in Google Maps are displayed first when a user enters a regional search phrase. It's easy to add a listing; simply login to the Google account and fill out the online forms."
"Understand File Transfer Protocol (FTP).,
Open FTP.,
Connect to the Mozilla servers.,
Enter in log-in credentials.,
Connect to the correct directory.,
View the contents of the directory.,
Select the local target folder.,
Download the installer.,
Open the installer.",How to Get Online Without Using a Browser1," File Transfer Protocol is not used much by average users today, but it was very common in the age before the Web. You can connect to a server, look around in its filesystem, and download any files you might want. The Mozilla FTP server may not be accessible, Most operating systems come with a command line FTP tool, but you can also just type an ftp:// address into your file manager's address bar.Make sure that Internet Explorer is your primary browser. This is the only way that you can use FTP to download a browser.;
, Open FTP by hitting ⊞ Win, then typing FTP and pressing ↵ Enter. This should open up a command line window with a blinking cursor after ftp> . It is important that you do these steps relatively quickly, or else you may be automatically disconnected.


In order to reach the Mozilla FTP server from Windows Explorer: type ftp://ftp.mozilla.org into the address bar of Windows Explorer, then press Enter. Next, copy the Firefox Setup .exe file to your computer. Simply drag and drop the file, right-click and ""Copy To Folder,"", or copy and paste it to your desktop., Type open ftp.mozilla.org and press ↵ Enter. If successful, a few lines of text will be generated and the blinking cursor will now be after User (ftp.mozilla.org:(none)): .

, You do not need to actually create or register any account to connect and download the Firefox installer over FTP.Username: anonymous. Enter in anonymous and press ↵ Enter. You will then be prompted to enter in a password.

Password: anonymous. Enter in anonymous and press ↵ Enter. You will not actually see the letters appear as you type them. Don't worry, this is normal and to be expected.
After entering in the log-in credentials, multiple lines of text will be generated explaining a bit about the directory you have connected to. If successful, the last line of text generated will say Login successful.


, Type cd pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/latest/win32/en-US and press ↵ Enter. This will connect you to the directory containing the Firefox installer.


When you use FTP, everything is contained within folders or directories. Just like you access documents on your own computer by opening folders within folders, you can connect to and access information on remote servers and websites in a similar fashion with FTP commands.
The cd command stands for change directories. It is the command which tells the host that you would like to change the directory you are connected to.

, Type ls and press ↵ Enter. After pressing ↵ Enter you should see two files: Firefox Setup 39.0.exe and Firefox Setup Stub 39.0.exe. At the time of writing this article, this is the current version of Firefox. However, you may see a different version. It should still say Firefox Setup, though.

, Choose which folder on your system you want the Firefox installer to be downloaded. For convenience, it is probably best to just use your C drive by typing lcd C:\ and pressing ↵ Enter. If you want to use a different drive, just enter in its name instead of C.

, Type get ""Firefox Setup 39.0.exe"" and press ↵ Enter. Again, the version of the setup may different. In which case, replace the 39.0 with whatever version of the setup was listed after you used the ls command earlier.


You may be prompted by a pop-up dialog box to give permission to the server host to send a file directly to your computer. Give permission.
After waiting a little while, a line of text should appear saying Transfer Complete.

, Look for the file within your C drive, or wherever you told the server to send the installer. Double-click the installer to start the process of installing Firefox.

Install a mailbox program.,
Open your mailbox program.,
Set up your mail account in the mailbox program.,
Have someone send you a browser file.",How to Get Online Without Using a Browser2," If you have a stable Internet connection and a working email account, you can use a third-party mailbox program to access your email without using a browser. Any email account should do: Microsoft, Google, Yahoo! – anything that would access through a browser. Ask a friend, a relative, or a coworker to email you a browser install file; you can load this onto your computer and download a browser!


If you use Windows, try activating Microsoft Outlook. This program comes automatically installed on Windows.
Try Mozilla Thunderbird. It's a free mail program that works on all known operating systems. Plus, it's open source – so it will be safer than many proprietary ""backdoored"" programs.

, You don't need a browser to do this – it just needs to be installed on your computer. Make sure that you have a working email account, a stable Internet connection, and a previously-set-up mailbox program

, Most programs will prompt you to set up your account upon your first launch. The exact steps will vary from client to client, but they should be fairly straightforward. When you've set up the account, click the ""Get Mail"" button to access your inbox.


If you have any trouble, find the ""Help"" section of the mailbox program, or run a web search for ""how to set up a mail account in .""

, Ask anyone who's reasonably tech-savvy: a friend, a coworker, a family member. The install files for most standard browsers are available on the developer websites: your friend can download Chrome directly from the Google site, for instance, Safari directly from Apple, or Firefox directly from Mozilla. If you have trouble finding the file, run a web search for ""download "" to find the specific download page. Have your friend attach the file to an email, and then follow these steps:


Open the email using your non-browser mailbox program. Look for the attached browser file, then click it to download.
Open the file, and click ""Install"". Follow the steps to install the browser of your choice onto your computer.
Browse the Internet using your new browser. Keep the install file saved on your computer, just in case.

Use an instant-messaging service.,

Explore Newsgroups on Usenet (NNTP).,
Use non-browser tools to download files and access limited sites.,
Use a package manager or an app store.",How to Get Online Without Using a Browser3," Like text messages but they don't cost money. It's also possible to send files over instant messaging, though you still need to know who to contact. If you use Linux, then you might have an IM client like Pidgin or Thunderbird already installed. On Windows, you're probably out of luck.

, BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file-sharing program. Instead of way to communicating with a central server, BitTorrent reaches out to your peers (people just like you!). It's a great way to download files quickly. Although it has earned its reputation as a piracy tool, there are many files that can be legally torrented, including some browsers. You'll need to find it first, though – which might be hard without a browser.

, Despite its name, telnet has nothing to do with telephone lines. It's just a simple, two-way text communications protocol, mostly used for command-line applications. While it's technically possible to download stuff over telnet, it's not common to actually do this., The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is an application protocol that moves Usenet news articles—net news—between news servers. People also use it to read and post articles by end user client applications. Web forums effectively replaced Usenet. You can explore all the Newsgroups without needed to ""know the right people,"" like you would with all the above protocols, and you can probably find a browser if you look hard enough. However, it may be difficult to get access to a server at first. Many servers charge money to access Usenet.

, There are many non-browser tools that use the Web. Some file explorers will download files if given a Web address. Curl and wget are command-line tools that can access files from FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS.They will download a file from the Web, but they can't render pages. On a system with the curl or wget installed, one of these commands will download Firefox for Linux:


wget: 'https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-40.0-SSL&os=linux64&lang=en-US'

curl: 'https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-40.0-SSL&os=linux64&lang=en-US'


, If you use Linux, these applications are very powerful: package managers will allow you to download applications, libraries, manuals, window manager themes, device drivers, browser addons/extensions, OS kernals, command-line programs, and practically anything your computer might need to function. If you use Windows 8+ or a Mac, however, you can only get applications this way. Just search for ""Firefox,"" then install it, and soon you'll be online!


This doesn't apply to people who use an operating system earlier than Windows 8. Pre-8 Windows users are out of luck. In fairness, 8+ users are too – the Windows store doesn't have much content.

Since tapping into your neighbor's WiFi without their consent is illegal, you should ask them if you can use it.Some neighbors will let you use their Internet service for free; otherwise, a common arrangement is that you two split the bill -- which isn't exactly free, but it is cheaper than paying alone!
You can also barter with your neighbors for access to their Internet: for instance, you cut their grass, clean their car, etc.;
, Oftentimes, if you live in an apartment building, the building will offer free wireless Internet access for its residents in select areas. This, of course, is only helpful if you live in an apartment building.

, If you live in the city, chances are a building in your proximity offers free wireless Internet access for its residents or guests, and sometimes this network will require no username or password to access.


As you may not be the intended user for a neighboring building's wireless Internet, if you are caught there may be legal ramifications., Most locations nationwide are eligible to receive ""free"" dial-up Internet service through providers like NetZero and Juno. You can find out if you're in such a location by searching All-Free-ISP.com. The only catch is that these services put ads on your browser while you access the Internet., If you are already paying for Internet on your phone and are looking to access it through your computer, many services offer a tethering feature for free, which would allow you to use your phone's Internet service on your computer by connecting them through Bluetooth or WiFi.

Ditch your car. AmTrak, Megabus and Bolt have wi-fi on several of their lines. Hey, that's greener, too!
Truck stops, EZ Lube, and many auto parts shops have free wi-fi to help their customers kill time., Walking into a hotel lobby and flaunting your VIP card may just be the trick you need to score their w-fi password without booking a room. And if you sign up for various loyalty programs, you're good to go. Just install a spam blocker to keep the ads at bay.


Sites like RetailMeNot offer coupon codes that, amongst other things, have deals on various hotels that have paired up with various hotspot companies, if you're not looking to pledge your allegiance to a certain chain.

Not being able to connect with the second device doesn't necessarily mean that the router is the problem.

, Some websites will display the author next to the copyright information at the bottom of the page. This may be the controlling company as opposed to the actual author.

, If the specific page you are looking at does not have an author and is on a reputable website, it was probably authored under the authorization of the company or agency that runs the site. This can serve as the author if no specific author is listed.

, If you can find contact information for the website, you can try sending an email and asking for the author of a specific page or article. You aren't guaranteed to get a response, but it may be worth a shot.

, If you're reading a website that isn't being ethical, it may be displaying information copied from another source. Copy and paste a paragraph of text into a Google search to see if you can find who the original author is.

, WHOIS is a database of website registrations, and you can use it to try to track down a website owner. This will not always work, as the owner is often not the author, and many owners and companies use privacy services to hide information.Visit whois.icann.org and enter the website address into the search field.
Look for the ""Registrant Contact"" information to find who registered the domain. You can still try to contact the owner through their proxy email if the registration information is blocked.

, You'll need the title of the article or page you are on as part of your citation. Even if it's a blog post, you'll still need the title.

, Besides the title of the article, you'll need the name of the website. For example, this article's title is ""How to Find the Author of a Website"" and the website name is ""wikiHow.""

, This is the company, organization, or person that produces or sponsors the website. This may not be different than the website title, but be sure to check. For example, a health organization may run a separate website devoted to heart health.

, This isn't always possible, but you should always try to find the publication date if you can.

, If the article or publication has a volume or version number, make sure to note this for MLA citations.

, Depending on which method of citation you're using, and your instructor's guidelines, you may need the URL of the page or article.


MLA7 no longer requires including the URL for websites. The page title and site title are sufficient. Check with your instructor if you use MLA for your citation format., If you are citing an online scholarly journal, include the DOI instead of the URL. This ensures that the reader will be able to find the article even if the URL changes:For most publications, you can find the DOI at the top of the article. You may need to click an ""Article"" button or a button with the publisher's name. This will open the full article with the DOI at the top.
You can look up a DOI by using the CrossRef search (crossref.org). Enter in the article title or the author to find the DOI.

, Now that you've gathered everything you can, even if you don't have an author, you're ready to create your citation. Use the following formats, skipping the Author entry if you can't find one:MLA: Author <Last, First M>. ""Article Title."" Website Title. Version Number. Website Publisher, Date Published. Web. Date Accessed.Use ""n.p."" if there is no publisher and ""n.d."" if there is no publishing date.

Type the website's name into a search engine and review the results.,
Look at the website's connection type.,

Evaluate the website's URL.,
Look for bad English on the site.,
Watch out for invasive advertising.,
Use the website's ""Contact"" page.",How to Find if a Website Is Legitimate1," If the site in question is a hazard (or simply an overwhelmingly illegitimate site), a cursory Google check will be enough to inform you accordingly.


Google tends to compile user reviews of high-traffic sites near the top of the search results, so be sure to check these if there are any.
Make sure you're looking at reviews and feedback from sources unaffiliated with the website.;
, A website that has an ""https"" tag is usually more secure--and therefore more trustworthy--than a site using the more common ""http"" designation. This is because ""https"" sites' security certification is a process most illegitimate sites don't bother with.A site that uses an ""https"" connection can still be unreliable, so it's best to verify the website using other means as well.Make sure the site's payment page in particular is an ""https"" page.

, For most browsers, a ""safe"" website will display a green padlock icon to the left of the website's URL.


You can click on the padlock icon to verify the details of the website (e.g., the type of encryption used).

, A website's URL consists of the connection type (""http"" or ""https""), the domain name itself (e.g., ""wikihow""), and the extension ("".com"", "".net"", etc.). Even if you've verified that the connection is secure, be on the lookout for the following red flags:


Multiple dashes or symbols in the domain name.
Domain names that imitate actual businesses (e.g., ""Amaz0n"" or ""NikeOutlet"").
One-off sites that use a credible site's templates (e.g., ""visihow"").
Domain extensions like "".biz"" and "".info"". These sites tend not to be credible.Keep in mind as well that "".com"" and "".net"" sites, while not inherently unreliable, are the easiest domain extensions to obtain. As such, they don't carry the same credibility as a "".edu"" (educational institute) or "".gov"" (government) site., If you notice a large number of poorly-spelled (or missing) words, generally bad grammar, or awkward phrasing, you should question the site's reliability.


Even if the site in question is technically legitimate insofar as it isn't a scam, any inaccuracies in language will also cast doubt on the accuracy of its information, thereby making it a poor source.

, If your selected site has a stunningly large number of ads crowding the page or ads that automatically play audio, it's probably not a credible site. Additionally, consider looking elsewhere if you encounter any of the following types of ads:


Ads that take up the whole page
Ads that require you to take a survey (or complete some other action) before continuing
Ads that redirect you to another page
Explicit or suggestive ads

, Most sites provide a Contact page so that users can send questions, comments, and concerns to the owner of the site. If you can, call or email the provided number or email address to verify the legitimacy of the website.


Make sure you scroll all the way to the bottom of the site to search for the Contact page.
If the site in question doesn't have a Contact page listed anywhere, it should be an immediate red flag.

Compare the metrics for the page with metrics for pages of competing entities, to put it in better context.,
Adjust for fake likes and shallow likes.,
Outside of, and in addition to, official pages, use the appropriate metrics that make sense.",How to Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online1,"


Entities that correspond to living persons or active brands, companies or other kinds of organizations are likely to have official pages. For an official page, you'll see a blue check mark (specifically, white check mark with a blue background) at the end of the name.Currently active large companies are highly likely to have official pages. Among individuals, currently living celebrities in movies and music are highly likely to have official pages. Examples among musicians include Taylor Swiftand Rihanna.Examples of companies include Googleand Coca-Cola.Some famous people do not have official pages, but they do have verified personal profiles. This is just their usual Facebook account, that is capable of getting friends and followers but not likes (note that not everybody allows people to follow them).Examples include journalists such as Nicholas Kristofand Evelyn Ruslior technology sector leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and Marissa Mayer.Many topics are likely to have other forms of presence on Facebook: unofficial pages (usually created by fans), community pages (created automatically by Facebook based on the Wikipedia page), and discussion groups.;
, The current value, as well as the changes in the past two weeks, can be accessed by appending a ""/likes"" to the page URL, or equivalently, selecting the ""Likes"" option among the various options in the top panel to the right of the page photo. The ""Likes"" option may be hidden under ""More"" if the page has additional panel options.Number of people ""talking about this"". This can be accessed on the same page as the number of page likes. Number of likes for (and other reactions to) recent posts on the page.
Nature of comments and quality of the comments.
Number of page likes from your friends.
Some samples of users who like the page. You can look both at samples among your friends (about whom you might know more, and therefore get a richer sense of who is interested in the page) as well as in the general audience, including people who like specific posts.

, For instance, to evaluate Katy Perry, it makes sense to compare with contemporaries such as Taylor Swift or Shakira, but a direct comparison with Barack Obama doesn't make sense. You can even get Facebook to show you pages similar to a given page, by typing ""Pages similar to Katy Perry"" in the search bar.

,


The problem of fake likes arises when a lot of bots like a given page. This can happen either due to the page buying likes (either intentionally buying bot likes, or doing so unintentionally while under the impression of buying legitimate likes). It can also arise because bots, in order to appear like genuine users, may like pages of various celebrities or important topics or brands. Therefore, this problem needs to be controlled for most if you think the page may have tried to buy likes, or if the topic is a major celebrity or brand.The problem of ""shallow likes"" is related to the problem of fake likes. Shallow likes refer to cases where the users are real, legitimate humans using the site properly, but they are not genuinely interested in the topic. They may have liked the topic as a result of being shown a sponsored post, or in error. Whether shallow likes is a problem for your estimate of popularity depends on how you plan to use the estimate.
In many cases, fake likes and shallow likes may be hard to separate out. However, if the goal is to determine legitimate, engaged likes, then it's not necessary to separate fake and shallow likes.
Some strategies to detect and address shallow likes include: looking at the ratio of ""people talking about this"" to page likes, looking at the fraction of likes that are from your friends, looking at the quality of some sample likers, and examining engagement on individual posts (all of these were mentioned in Step 2). A further way of detecting fake likes is to look at the most popular week, city, and age group, and see if they make sense given the topic in question. In particular, if the most popular city is not one where the topic is known to be popular, and in particular if it is a low-income country such as Pakistan or Bangladesh that is unlikely to be the most popular, then the likes are likely to be fake.,


For verified personal profiles, use the number of followers rather than the number of likes (this may not always be possible since some people do not turn on the option on Facebook to allow people to follow them).In addition, use likes, comments, and shares on recent posts the same way as you would for a page.
In some cases, the number of non-official pages (including fan pages) about the topic on Facebook can also give an idea of the topic's popularity. Also, pages about subsidiary topics can also give an idea. For instance, in the case of a singer, the existence and popularity of Facebook pages about the singer's songs can be a valuable indicator of the singer's popularity.
When metrics of this kind are available in addition to official page metrics, they can offer a useful comparison point to identify if fake or shallow likes are likely to have caused a problem.

Identify the canonical Wikipedia page for the topic in the language(s) of interest.,
Get information on the number of pageviews of the canonical page.,
Use other proxies for importance, including:


The number of pages that link to the page (click the ""What links here"" under Tools on the left sidebar of the Wikipedia page).,
Compare with Wikipedia pages on topics in the same reference class.,
Correct for bots.",How to Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online2," For most topics that are reasonably popular, there will be an English Wikipedia page.

, This could be done in many ways:


For pageviews from December 2007 to December 2015, use the stats.grok.se tool to get the page view counts for the page by month and by day within each month. This tool only includes desktop pageviews and does not exclude bots.For pageviews from July 2015 onward, you can use the Wikipedia pageviews API (either directly, or by graphing it on Wikipedia, or through Wikipedia Views as discussed below). You can get pageview counts for desktop, mobile-app, and mobile-web. You can also filter the user to user, bot, or spider.To get combined data over all time, you can use Wikipedia Views (that uses stats.grok.se data till June 2015 and API data from July 2015 onward)or Wikipedia Trends (that switched to using the API starting August 2015).,
The length of the Wikipedia page.
The number of edits made to the page: Click the ""View History"" button on the top right to see the edit history.
The heat of debate in the corresponding Talk page.
The number of languages it's in (on the page in any language, you can see links in the left sidebar to versions in other languages).

, Do this for the steps above. For instance, Katy Perry might be compared to Shakira or Taylor Swift.

,


In particular, when looking at data using stats.grok.se (prior to data being available through the Wikipedia pageviews API) keep in mind that a lot of traffic could be coming from bots and spiders. For data before July 2015, the official estimate is that about 15% of traffic is from bots and spiders, and the proportion is greater for less trafficked pages. Unlike the case of social media, the goal of these bots is not to boost the status of pages being visited but simply to scrape information.
One way of determining the prevalence of bots is to look at pageviews API data and measure the number of pageviews by bots and spiders since this data became available, then extrapolate this to earlier times.

Use Google Trends to compare the search volume for the topic with the search volume for other topics.Because of its design, Google Trends only gives relative numbers and cannot give absolute search volume, so it is best used to compare different pages in the same reference class.,
Use keyword research tools to get more in-depth data on search volume and comparison with similar terms.",How to Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online3,"


By default, Google shows data worldwide, from 2004 to the present, at a monthly granularity. However, you can restrict to more recent time intervals. The granularity is determined based on the time interval. If looking at data for the past year, you will get a weekly granularity. For the past 90 or 30 days, you will get daily granularity. For the last 7 days, you will get hourly granularity. If looking at the past 24 hours or less, you will get even finer granularity, with the finest granularity of 1 minute obtained if looking just at the past hour.
Google scales the plot so that the largest data point plotted has the value 100. If plotting multiple keywords, it will look at the largest of the data points across all search terms included. This can create problems with looking at your data if there is an outlier. You might need to select your time range and collection of search terms to eliminate such outliers.
You can also drill down by region. Keep in mind that the times displayed are times in your local timezone and not the region you select.

, There are a number of keyword research tools, some of them available for free and others requiring a paid subscription. Paid services will generally do better on the long tail of items, whereas free services will usually be good enough for very popular queries."

Search for the canonical (preferably official) Twitter page associated with the topic.,
In case of a canonical Twitter page, look at the number of followers, as well as the number of retweets and favorites of posts.,
For more broad topics (those not about a living individual or brand) use hashtags and search filters.",How to Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online4," As is the case with Facebook, canonical pages may not exist. Also, some celebrities maintain a personal as well as a media or company Twitter account, and it can be difficult deciding which one to use. Look for the account with the blue check mark (specifically, white check mark with a blue background) and with the larger number of followers.

, Compare with competing topics. You can see the page's total number of followers at the top, and you can examine the number of retweets and favorites under any given tweet they've posted.


Make corrections for the large number of fake followers on Twitter. Twitter has a fairly large problem of fake accounts, more so than Facebook, partly because Twitter, by design, does not focus on real identity and does not require a user to have only one account.There are a few different online tools you can use to estimate the extent to which a Twitter account's followers are fake. The numbers are based on heuristics used by these websites and may not be accurate. One such tool, that allows you to enter any Twitter account, is Twitter Audit.,


You can type the words into Twitter's search bar and select to see either top tweets or all tweets. Scrolling through the list of tweets can give an idea of the frequency with which people reference the topic.

Be aware that this method applies only for topics where video is a primary form of consumption.,
Navigate to the videos tab inside the channel and sort videos by ""Most Popular"" to get a sense of how widely viewed the channel's videos are.,
Use SocialBlade and click Monthly Statistics.",How to Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online5," Musicians are good candidates for this method. Look for the official channel of the musician by searching for it within YouTube. If you can't find it easily, first look for the top result for one of the musician's more famous videos, then see the channel the video is under. A blue checkmark identifies the official channel (though not all YouTube channels have these checkmarks).

, You can also see the number of subscribers to the channel above the videos, in the subscribe button on the right.

Identify whether the topic has a canonical website, and whether it makes sense to use website traffic as a proxy for the topic's popularity or importance.,
Use tools such as Alexa Internet, Quantcast, SimilarWeb, and HypeStat to get an estimate of total traffic and global traffic rank.",How to Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online6," Tracking popularity of the website can be useful in cases where there is a canonical website that people go to in order to consume or engage with the topic. This is not the case for many topics.


For instance, Shakira's website gets negligible traffic compared to her online fame, because people consume her products on video websites or by purchasing her music. In contrast, for an information website such as WikiHow, the primary mode of consumption is via accessing the website.

,


You can see the statistics that Alexa has for a given website by typing the website's name in the bar at Alexa Internet, or appending the site URL with a URL structure of the form alexa.com/siteinfo/sitename (you can omit the leading www.).
Alexa estimates every website's global and country-wise traffic, as well as traffic rank. It does so using a panel of users for which it tracks the websites they visit.Since the user sample is small relative to the total set of Internet users, Alexa can be unreliable for small sites, but it is more reliable for more highly trafficked sites.What Alexa does a good job of is giving a crude estimate of the global rank as well as the rank in a few top countries.
It is also possible for websites to sign up to have their metrics certified by Alexa Internet (here, the website allows Alexa to track users on the site and in exchange Alexa can present a more reliable estimate of the website's traffic and traffic rank). Certification costs the website some money, and information on whether the website is certified is presented along with its statistics.
Slightly less censored versions of Alexa data, as well as some other related estimates, are presented by HypeStat. To see information on a website in HypeStat, use the URL structure hypestat.com/domainname (you can leave out the www.).
If the website is quantified (i.e., its sends data to Quantcast), Quantcast maintains rich information on the site's total traffic volume as well as the demographics and other attributes of the traffic. For many websites, this data is available to the public, although some sites restrict access to the data. Whatever data is publicly available can be accessed using quantcast.com/domainname (the leading www. can be omitted). Quantified sites will have a checkmark (black with white background). Note that Quantcast tries to estimate the traffic volume even to websites that do not send data to Quantcast, but this data tends to be unreliable since it relies on a rather small panel of people who have Quantcast installed (this is similar to how Alexa works). Websites' main motivation for being quantified is that Quantcast data on demographics and traffic can be used to approach potential advertisers.Another that can be used is SimilarWeb (URL structure: similarweb.com/website/ followed by your domain name). There are detailed online comparisons of Alexa and SimilarWeb.Full lists of such tools, and their strengths and weaknesses, are covered in many online discussions."

Search for the official Instagram page associated with the topic.,
Look at the following metrics associated with the page.,
Adjust for fake Instagram followers.",How to Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online7," As is the case with Facebook and Twitter, Instagram pages may not exist. Also, similar to Facebook and Twitter, official Instagram pages have a white check mark with a blue background.

Total number of followers of the page.
Number of likes and comments on recent photos posted on the page.

Use this method in the right cases.,
Look for fan websites on Wikia.,
Look for Q&A websites.,
Look for how-to pages.,
Look for subreddits.,
Look at follower counts on Quora.

,
Look for online rankings.",How to Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online8," It is most useful for fiction book series and TV series. Examples include the Harry Potter series, A Song of Ice and Fire (and the associated TV series, Game of Thrones), Breaking Bad, Gilmore Girls, and Star Trek. To begin with, identify the most prominent existing fan websites, including wikis, forums, and personally maintained websites by fans.

, For instance, there is a Harry Potter Wiki, a Gilmore Girls Wiki, and a Game of Thrones Wiki. You might also be able to find wikis unaffiliated with Wikia but using the same MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia, Wikia, WikiHow, and many other sites, so you should be able to locate corresponding metrics on those sites (an example is A Wiki of Ice and Fire, a wiki related to the book series that inspired the Game of Thrones TV series).


Some relevant numbers that you should generally be able to get for wikis are:

Number of pages on the wiki.
Number of active contributors to the wiki.
Number of edits to the wiki.
Number of pageviews of the wiki.


For standard MediaWiki installations, you can get these numbers by going to the page titled Special:Statistics. You should be able to get to this page by typing Special:Statistics in the within-site search bar, or putting Special:Statistics in the part of the URL structure that is for the pagename. This by default contains all the information described above, but some high-load wikis disable calculation of the number of pageviews. The number of pageviews as measured here is also unreliable as it includes all page loads, including those by bots. There is also a similar page called Special:PopularPages that includes the most popular pages with their lifetime pageviews.
For Wikias, Special:Statistics is available and includes the information above with the exception of pageviews. There is also a separate Special:Insights page with more in-depth insight information. In particular, Special:Insights/popularpages provides information on popular pages. Example links for the Harry Potter Wiki: Special:Statistics, Special:Insights, and Special:Insights/popularpages.

, For broad topics, there are usually associated Stack Exchange websites.

, If the topic involves specific actions, then how-to guides might be an interesting way to gauge their popularity. For instance, if you want to gauge the popularity of a sport or athletic technique, looking at the number of edits and pageviews of how-to guides on the subject can be useful.


Each WikiHow page, when viewed on a desktop (with a wide enough screen) shows the number of views, number of contributors, and average rating of a page.
How-to guides at other places like LifeHacker generally display total pageview counts, and you can use Facebook's API to get information on the number of likes, comments, and shares of the articles.

,


The number of people who follow or subscribe to a subreddit is listed in the right column on the subreddit's page. The noun used to describe such people varies by subreddit. For instance, the Taylor Swift subreddit calls the followers ""Swifties"" whereas the Katy Perry subreddit uses ""Readers"" for their followers.

,, Websites such as Ranker include ranked lists of various kinds of items (ranging from characters in specific pieces of fiction to actors to books).


You have a number of filtering and sorting options.
You can also, for any given item, look for all the ranked lists where that item appears.
